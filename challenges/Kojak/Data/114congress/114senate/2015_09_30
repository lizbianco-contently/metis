He will be \nmissed in the Capitol when he retires. It is clear that his leadership \nwill be missed in Kentucky too. Our troops at Fort Campbell will miss \nit. The workers at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant will miss it. \nKentucky's countless coal families--hard-working Kentuckians he never \nfailed to stand up for--will certainly miss it as well.\n  Ed was rightly considered a western Kentucky trailblazer. He became \nthe first Republican elected to represent that district in 1994. Our \nparty, the Republican Party, never held that district going back to the \nCivil War. It was an enormous breakthrough. Ed has worked hard and \ndelivered for the Commonwealth in the two decades since. He will leave \nbehind a record of service and accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7011-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOVERNMENT FUNDING\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate will complete its work on \nthe continuing resolution today.\n  We remember watching our Democratic colleagues swerve from crisis to \ncrisis when they ran the Senate. Perhaps that is just all Democrats \nhave known, but it is not right for them to again force America into \nanother short-term funding situation such as this.\n  We are working to change the culture around here. Our determination \nremains to get the Senate back to normal, with a functional \nappropriations process. That is why for the first time in 6 years the \nSenate actually passed a budget. That is why for the first time in 6 \nyears the Senate actually passed through committee the dozen \nappropriations bills necessary to properly fund the government.\n  Now that the CR appears to be on track, we can turn back to the last \nstep in the Senate's normal appropriations process; that is, getting \nthe funding bills passed on the floor. Democrats have blocked them all \nthis year as part of some arbitrary strategy to force our Nation to the \nbrink. They certainly succeeded in doing that, but I think the American \npeople are ready for our colleagues to finally get serious and get back \nto work. Americans are ready to see Democrats start supporting, not \nblocking, the very bipartisan funding legislation Democrats previously \nvoted for and bragged about in press releases. Our colleagues will have \nthat opportunity this week when we turn back to the regular \nappropriations process.\n  It is true that moving forward will require Democrats to definitively \nturn the page on years of bad habits and dysfunction, but it is the \nright thing to do for our country. We will see if they are ready to do \nso later this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7011-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader is reciting \nfacts that are not real. Everyone knows what has happened in this body \nand in the House of Representatives the last few years--gridlock. \nRepublicans in the House cannot agree with Republicans in the Senate, \nand it appears Republicans in the Senate cannot agree among themselves. \nSo for my friend to talk about how great things are going is not \nreality.\n  We need to start working together, not apart. And, working with \nRepublicans, we find it is very difficult to develop any kind of \npartnerships, as we always did in the past until Republican leaders \ntook over the Congress.\n  I would hope my friends the Republicans would understand we have to \nstart doing things to help the country. We are in the situation we are \nin. It is September 30. The country will be out of money in just a few \nhours. Why do we wait until the last minute and then only provide \nenough money to get us to the first part of December?\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\n  We have received word that the House Speaker is going to resign. Why? \nHe is resigning because everyone knows he cannot deal with the people \nhe has to deal with in the House. He has tried very hard, and it hasn't \nworked.\n  I would hope my friend the Republican leader would start talking \nreality, not come in and boast about how great the country is doing \nunder Republican leadership. We have gotten nothing done under the \nRepublican leadership.\n  I am reminded of what Albert Einstein said when he defined insanity \nas doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. \nThat is what we have been doing here. We have votes on everything, \neveryone knowing what the results are going to be. The latest episode \nwas--what a waste of our time--we had a vote here to defund Planned \nParenthood. It didn't even get a majority of the Republicans--well, it \ngot a majority of the Republicans; it certainly didn't get a majority \nof the Senate. It didn't get a majority of the Senate and certainly \ndidn't get 60 votes, which they were trying to do--revoting on things, \nalways knowing the results are going to be the same. It appears that \nAlbert Einstein had a few organizations in mind when he gave this \ndefinition of ``insanity,'' and one of them, as he looked forward, \nwould be this Republican Senate we have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7012-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES BILLINGTON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the original Hall of Representatives, \nwhich is now called National Statuary Hall, there is a beautiful clock \nthat stands over the Chamber's doorway. The clock and its adjoining \nsculpture depict Clio, the Greek muse of history, watching over the \nHouse of Representatives. The meaning of the clock and statue are \nclear: History will bear witness to all we do in Congress.\n  For the last 28 years--almost three decades--James Billington has \nserved as the Librarian of Congress. He has been our Clio, ensuring \nthat the annals of American history are complete and available to \neveryone.\n  Dr. Billington came to the Library of Congress in 1987. What a \nremarkable resume--valedictorian at Princeton University, a Rhodes \nScholar, and he earned his doctorate from Oxford College. Following his \ngraduation from Oxford, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. After his service \nin the Army, he taught history--first at Harvard and then at \nPrinceton--for 16 years. During that time Dr. Billington became one of \nthe foremost scholars of Russia.\n  I had the good fortune of being able to travel with Dr. Billington to \nthe Soviet Union. It was like having an encyclopedia with you. It was \nwonderful to travel to this country with which we had been involved in \na Cold War for so many years and to have a scholar with us to give us \ninsight everyplace we went and on everybody we talked to. He has \nwritten a number of important scholarly works on Russian history, \nculture, and politics.\n  In 1973 James Billington came to Washington, DC, to lead the Woodrow \nWilson International Center for Scholars, a prestigious organization. \nAs director, he founded the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian \nStudies. He served as their director for 14 years before coming over \nhere to become the director of the Library of Congress.\n  Dr. Billington has done extraordinary work during his tenure at the \nLibrary of Congress. He has brought the Library into the 21st century. \nDr. Billington doubled the size of the Library's analog collections \nfrom 85 million to 160 million. He oversaw the creation of the Library \nof Congress's online portal, making hundreds of millions of documents, \nbooks, and material available to the American public.\n  Using his relationship with Russian scholars, Dr. Billington founded \nthe Open World Leadership Forum. This important forum creates dialogue \nand cultural exchanges between U.S. and Russian leaders. James \nBillington has accompanied 10 congressional delegations to Russia. I \nwas fortunate to be on one of them, as I just said. In June 1988, he \naccompanied the President and Mrs. Reagan to the Soviet summit in \nMoscow, and I am confident President Reagan and his staff depended on \nJames Billington's outstanding mind.\n  Dr. Billington helped establish the congressionally mandated Veterans \nHistory Project, which collects and preserves first-person accounts \nfrom U.S. veterans dating back to World War I. Dr. Billington helped \ncreate the National Book Festival, which brings thousands of authors \nand readers to the National Mall every year.\n  In every way imaginable, Dr. James Billington has made the Library of \nCongress and, by extension, the United States better--a better library, \na better country. As he embarks on a well-deserved retirement after 28 \nyears of exemplary service, I wish him the very best. I have no doubt \nDr. Billington will enjoy time with his wife Marjorie--a lovely woman I \nhave come to know and admire greatly--and their 4 children and 12 \ngrandchildren.\n  James Billington, thank you for a job well done. We will all miss \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7012-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7012-S7013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOVERNMENT FUNDING\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have never been a sentimental person--I \nhave never tried to be one--but today I can't help but think back to a \ntime when keeping the government open and funded wasn't a last-minute \nexercise. Looking at the clock now, we are almost 14 hours away from \nwhat could have been another Republican shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment. This kind of brinkmanship is totally unnecessary. Although \nwe will likely avert a shutdown tonight, Republicans brought us \ndangerously close to a shutdown.\n  This continuing resolution only funds our government through December \n11, as I said earlier. That means that within the coming weeks, we need \nto negotiate with Republicans to keep our government open.\n  Yesterday Senator McConnell finally took Democrats up on our call to \nbegin budget negotiations. I welcome that, and I welcome Senator \nMcConnell to the table. We should have started this process months ago, \nbut better late than never, so I am pleased he has come around.\n  Lifting the sequester has been one of my top priorities for years, \nand I am hopeful that we can finally achieve this key Democratic goal. \nJust take what it has done in the past--just take one entity. The \nNational Institutes of Health lost almost $2 billion and they have \nnever gotten it back. It has been devastating to the most prestigious, \nimportant medical research facility in the world. That is what \nsequestration did.\n  This time around, we have to do better than just keeping the Federal \nGovernment operating by a continuing resolution. We have to stop \ndevastating sequester cuts from hitting our military and our middle \nclass. Even the Republican leader agrees, it appears, because a week or \n10 days ago he said: ``We are inevitably going to end up in \nnegotiations that will crack the Budget Control Act once again.'' And I \nsay hallelujah.\n  Here we are, ready to negotiate months before the December 11 \ndeadline. After all, that was the original intent of sequestration--to \nforce Democrats and Republicans to the negotiating table. That should \nbe easy to do. We hate sequestration, and I know there are a \nsignificant number of Republicans who don't like it. I have heard \nSenator Graham, and I have heard Senator McCain give speeches in \ncommittees and publicly about how terrible it is. So let's get rid of \nit for the good of the country. This is a so-called no-brainer.\n\n  Let's work together--not in December--to repeal the sequester caps, \nbut let's work now to repeal the caps and build a long-term, bipartisan \nfunding bill. Then we can turn our attention to the other matters that \ndeserve our immediate attention, such as the debt ceiling.\n  We can't put off the debt ceiling much longer. I don't know the exact \ndate when we are going to run out of money, but I am sure it is going \nto be sometime before Thanksgiving. We all know that in a matter of \nweeks, unless we act, the United States will lose its ability to pay \nits bills. And if you think shutting the government down is bad, which \nI do, that pales in comparison to the government of the United States \ndefaulting on all of our debts. The consequences would be dire and the \nfallout would be felt around the world.\n\n[[Page S7013]]\n\n  We also need to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. It is closed. \nRepublicans made a terrible mistake by allowing the Bank's charter to \nexpire, jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Congress \nmust also craft a long-term highway bill to ensure the highway trust \nfund will be solvent for years to come.\n  We have a lot to do in the coming weeks and months, and we certainly \ndon't have time for any more manufactured crises. So I sincerely hope \nthe Republican leadership will instead choose to do what is right to \nmeet our country's obligations.\n  Would the Chair tell us what we are going to do the rest of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7013-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. will be equally divided between the two managers or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the vote we are \nabout to cast this morning at 10 o'clock. This is a vote to basically \nextend the authority and budget of the Federal Government until \nDecember 11. This September 30 is the end of our fiscal year, and at \nleast legally, the authority to continue the government depends on \nbudget and appropriations bills being passed by the House and Senate. \nThat has not happened. So what we are doing is a continuing resolution. \nIt basically extends last year's budget until December 11.\n  Now, that will keep the lights on at Federal agencies, and it will \navoid the catastrophic outcome of a government shutdown, but it is not \ngood policy. We have done it on our side--on the Democratic side--and \nnow the Republicans, in control of the Congress, are doing it on their \nside. It buys time to reach some sort of agreement that is longer \nlasting and more thoughtful.\n  We know the notion of a government shutdown is a disaster, but it is \nnot a unanimous opinion in the Senate or in the House of \nRepresentatives. There are actually Members of the Senate and the House \nwho are applauding the possibility of a government shutdown. Some of \nthem were the same people who inspired the shutdown several years ago--\na shutdown which cost us 800,000 jobs in America because of the \nuncertainty created by it and which created real hardship for people \naround our country. A shutdown, if it happened again in this context, \nwould be even more serious in terms of its impact on the American \neconomy.\n  So we have a chance. And I would just say to those who follow this \ndebate--and there is no reason why people would follow the minutia--\nthat in June of this year we asked on the Democratic side for the \nRepublican leader to sit down and avoid this actual confrontation we \nare having today. We asked Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner to \nnegotiate with the President a new budget--a budget that is realistic \nand will not harm innocent people.\n  I am troubled by the notion that Republicans have that we should find \nwar funds to continue funding the Department of Defense and ignore the \nnondefense parts of the budget. Senator Reid made reference to one. \nNational Institutes of Health medical research, which is critical to \nAmerica and its future, is now facing the uncertainty of no budget, and \nthat is unfair.\n  Last night we had a meeting with some of the major medical \nresearchers in the United States, and they said it is hard to convince \nthe next generation of researchers that we as a nation are seriously \ncommitted, and it is because of this uncertainty in budgeting. It is a \npolitical problem, and one that should be solved by politicians, \nnamely, Members of the House and Senate working with the President.\n  So we will likely vote--and I certainly will vote in the next few \nminutes--to extend the operations of the government until December 11. \nBut if it is only for more speechifying and breast-beating by those who \nwant to shut down the government to prove some political point, I have \nto say they are seriously mistaken. It is the wrong thing for America \nto shut down the government. It is the wrong thing for job creation to \nshut down the government. It is the wrong thing for our future, when it \ncomes to medical research, education, and critical programs, to shut \ndown the government. Those who are preaching that gospel should be \nreminded that 3 out of 4 Americans think they are not very thoughtful--\nI will clean up my words a little bit--not very thoughtful in using \nthis approach.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \ncontinuing resolution but really to light a fire under the leadership \nin the Democratic and Republican precincts and to come together in the \nHouse and Senate in the next few weeks of this continuing resolution. \nLet's make sure we have a budget and one that is befitting a great \nnation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today we are voting on a clean, short-\nterm continuous funding resolution, CR. Passing this legislation means \nno government shutdown. There may be some drama, but we intend to keep \nthe government open and avoid shutdown, slamdown politics.\n  Shutdowns are bad for everyone. Shutdowns create uncertainty which \nslows economic growth, hurts the health and well-being of the entire \nNation, and causes the loss of private sector jobs. Shutdowns make it \nimpossible for Federal agencies to meet missions that serve the \nAmerican people.\n  Let's show the American people we can work across the aisle and \nacross the dome to get the job done.\n  Avoiding a shutdown is just the first step. Next, we need a budget \ndeal to cancel sequester. Right now, our budget caps spending, but \ndoesn't cap tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that send jobs \noverseas.\n  Americans are angry. They feel like the rules are rigged against them \nand that those who write the rules don't care.\n  Let's show them this Congress cares. The people deserve a government \non their side.\n  That is why I am fighting to make sure they have a government that \nworks as hard as they do. After we pass the bill to fund the \ngovernment, we can move on to a new budget deal that cancels sequester, \nraising the caps equally for defense and nondefense domestic spending.\n  The budget deal will give us a framework for an omnibus funding bill \nthat invests in America, protecting national security, rebuilding our \nphysical infrastructure, creating jobs for today and jobs for tomorrow, \nand meeting our compelling human needs. The Appropriations Committee \nneeds 30 days to get the job done after a new budget deal is passed.\n  I challenge leadership to work with Speaker Boehner to enact a new \ntopline budget deal by the end of October. We can't let October \nbrinksmanship become a Christmas crisis.\n  It is clear we need to cancel sequester. And it is clear that the \n2013 shutdown was a disaster for everyone--not to be repeated.\n  This bill provides the resources to keep our government open so \nagencies can continue to serve the American people, keeping us safe, \nhealthy, educated, moving, and thriving.\n  The bottom line is we need a new topline. With a new budget deal we \nget a new topline to invest in America's safety and future.\n  But we need to pass this short-term CR to get to a deal and not to \nanother shutdown.\n\n[[Page S7014]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this morning I said the American people \nare ready to see Democrats start supporting, not blocking, the very \nbipartisan funding legislation they previously voted for and actually \nbragged about. I also said we would give our colleagues a chance to do \nso this week. So I have just set up a vote that will give them that \nopportunity.\n  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill is one of the 12 \npieces of appropriations legislation we must pass to properly fund our \ngovernment. It is a bipartisan bill that does a lot of important things \nfor our country, but here is the headline: It supports our veterans.\n  This bipartisan bill passed committee with support from both \nDemocrats and Republicans. Democrats have said nice things about it in \npress releases that were sent out to their various States. Now it is \ntime to cooperate across the aisle to finally pass it and support our \nveterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                             PTC Extension\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise on a subject of urgency and \nimportance to our Nation's economy. The looming deadline for \nimplementing a new railroad safety technology known as positive train \ncontrol, or PTC, could soon wreak havoc on our Nation's transportation \nsystem. This havoc would not just affect the millions of Americans who \nboard commuter trains every day but also Americans who depend on \ncritical freight rail deliveries. These services could be interrupted \nbecause--despite years of warning--implementation of PTC has not kept \npace with an overly ambitious schedule set by Congress.\n  Let me explain how we got here. Seven years ago, following a deadly \nMetrolink passenger train collision in California caused by an engineer \nwho was texting and failed to react to track signals, this body passed \nlegislation mandating the installation of PTC, an innovative safety \ntechnology on over 60,000 miles of rail lines. Though a meaningful and \nimportant safety upgrade, PTC is not a panacea. It will not make a \ndifference when rail tracks are damaged or in situations when people \ntrespass on tracks or at highway rail crossings where the most \naccidents occur, but PTC can and will have an impact in preventing \nthree specific accident scenarios; first, the technology will prevent \ntrain-on-train collisions when both trains and the track they are \ntraveling on have fully functioning PTC systems installed; second, the \nsystem will prevent accidents or derailments caused by excessive train \nspeeds like the deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia earlier this \nyear; and, third, the technology will help protect individuals working \non railroad tracks from being hit by a train accidently routed onto the \nwrong track.\n  PTC systems operate by relying on ground-based computer systems, \nequipment installed on train locomotives, satellites and wireless radio \nspectrum-based communications coming from a network of thousands of \ntowers being built along rail tracks. A PTC system can help certain \ntrains automatically communicate with one another and sense if operator \ninstructions--namely speed--are appropriate for where the train is \noperating. Because it isn't effective unless all trains are linked \ntogether on a network, PTC will be required on all passenger and \nfreight trains that travel on rail tracks that carry passengers or \ncertain hazardous materials regardless of what an individual train \nmight be hauling.\n  Our colleague, the senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nchampioned the legislative provision that put this requirement in place \nback in 2008. The legislative mandate was forward-looking and set an \naggressive schedule for fully implementing the technology.\n\n[[Page S7015]]\n\n  Seven years later, both freight and commuter railroads have made \nsubstantial progress in implementing positive train control, but there \nhave been some unexpected delays in implementing the technology.\n  The Federal Communications Commission halted the construction of \nnecessary communications towers for over a year in 2013 over concerns \nabout historic preservation and potential impacts on tribal lands. \nThere have also been delays in regulatory approvals, problems in \nobtaining necessary communications spectrum, and many difficulties that \ncome with building a new technology.\n  The complexity of a positive train control system falls somewhere in \nbetween a new version of computer operating software and driverless \ncars. Any of us who have had a just-released version of software \ninstalled on our computer know about bugs that have to be worked out, \nand like driverless cars, when lives are at stake, you have to get the \ntechnology right before relying on a system as advanced as PTC.\n  Over $5.5 billion in private funding has already been spent on \nimplementing PTC. The debate on the need, costs, and benefits is long \nover. When this body voted in 2008 to mandate full and certified \nimplementation of PTC by December 31, 2015, there were concerns that \nthe timeline was too aggressive. Those concerns have steadily grown. \nBoth the independent Government Accountability Office and the Federal \nRailroad Administration, which regulates railroad safety, have warned \nfor years that the deadline set by Congress was unrealistic.\n  Some saw great value in keeping this overly aggressive deadline in \nplace. It was a way of maintaining pressure on freight and commuter \nrailroads to move aggressively. At the end of the day, the thinking \nwent that if railroads did not meet the deadline, they would be subject \nto financial fines, and these penalties would motivate to quickly \nfinish work on PTC. If the pressure didn't work, these individuals \nassumed things could go on much as if the law hadn't been put in place \nat all, and freight railroads could just continue to haul critical \nshipments of products like chlorine and fertilizer, which would pose \ngreater public hazard if hauled on highways.\n  There was even a naive belief that commuter railroads run by State \nand local governments could get exempted from fines mandated under the \nlaw. Some believed commuter railroads could continue to move passengers \ninstead of adding to the congestion and safety risks on our Nation's \nroads, but over the past month, these myths have been put to rest as \nthe real consequences of failing to meet the legal deadline for \npositive train control implementation have come into focus.\n  Both freight and commuter railroads have informed Congress, \nregulators, and even stockholders that an inability to comply with the \nPTC mandate could halt some freight and passenger services by January \n1, 2016. In fact, the effects would be felt weeks earlier when it comes \nto the shipment of hazardous materials such as anhydrous ammonia, a \ncritical fertilizer for our Nation's crops, because it takes time to \nmove tank car traffic off the rail network.\n  The Obama administration--in testimony before the commerce committee \nthis month--noted that the law leaves no possibility of exempting \npublicly owned commuter railroads that do not meet the PTC deadline \nfrom fines, but the threat of Federal fines is only one worry for \nrailroads among other much larger consequences of missing the PTC \ndeadline. Remember, the vast majority of passenger rail service relies \non track owned by freight railroads. To run commuter rail service on \nfreight lines in compliance with the PTC mandate, not only must \ncommuter rail trains and tracks be fully equipped but all freight \ntracks and freight trains that run on them must also be properly \nequipped.\n  There are approximately 40 railroads, mostly commuter railroads in \nthe United States, that will be affected by the December 31, 2015, \ndeadline for certified implementation of positive train control. I \nasked them to tell us about their situations in dealing with the \nupcoming mandate.\n  I will tell you what we heard. Not one railroad said they have met \nthe legal obligation for implementing PTC. I will repeat that. Not one \nrailroad, commuter or freight, told us that after 7 years of work, and \nwith 3 months to go before the legal deadline for full implementation \nof positive train control, that they have been certified by the Federal \nRailroad Administration as compliant with the requirement.\n  We had one railroad, Metrolink in California, that would go so far as \nto express that they were ``cautiously optimistic'' that they could \nmeet the end-of-the year deadline for implementing PTC, but neither \nMetrolink nor any other railroad advised us against the legal deadline \nfor positive train control. Some commuter railroads bluntly told us \nthey saw no option for continuing passenger service after December 31 \nwithout action by Congress to extend the deadline.\n  Last week, the board of directors of Metra in Chicago, with over 70 \nmillion riders annually, voted in favor of a resolution to shut down on \nJanuary 1, 2016, if the deadline is not extended.\n  Our Nation does not have the transit bus capacity to move these \ndisplaced riders. This will dramatically increase the number of people \nwho are stuck in traffic each day and decrease the safety of our \ntransportation system.\n  Sarah Feinberg, the Acting Administrator for the Federal Railroad \nAdministration, testified last week that she had not recently spoken to \na railroad that planned to continue operating on January 1, 2016.\n  Why are railroads so concerned about running over the legal deadline \nfor PTC? Railroads point out that, regardless of fines, their insurance \nwould not cover an incident if the railroad had knowingly violated a \nsafety law regulation like operating in noncompliance with the PTC \nmandate. They also point out that Federal law provides individual \nworkers with the right to refuse instructions that are counter to \nFederal safety laws or regulations. In effect, railroad workers across \nthe country would have an individual right, and protection from \nconsequence, to refuse to participate in the operation of trains in \nnoncompliance with the PTC mandate.\n  Different railroads have different concerns. Freight railroads have \nexpressed some varying ideas about how they interpret the law. But, \nremember, railroads are interconnected. Let me explain a common view we \nhave heard and how it will affect the Nation's interconnected rail \nsystem and economy more broadly.\n  The PTC mandate applies only to routes where there is passenger \ntravel or shipment of certain hazardous materials, such as chlorine \nused for water reservoir purification. Under normal circumstances, \nfreight railroads are bound by something called the common carrier \nrequirement. This means that freight railroads can't refuse to haul a \nspecific cargo such as chlorine simply because it is unprofitable or \ninconvenient, but railroads argue that this common carrier requirement \ncannot be reasonably interpreted as requiring them to haul cargo on \ntracks if doing so would violate Federal law.\n  Dan Elliott, the Chairman of the Federal Surface Transportation \nBoard, which regulates railroad business practices, added weight to \nthese concerns. In a letter to me this month about the situation, Mr. \nElliott stated to me that the ``common carrier obligation is not \nabsolute.'' He informed us that he ``cannot predict'' how regulators \nwould rule on specific railroad decisions to exclude cargo or passenger \ntraffic in order to comply with the PTC mandate.\n  So how do we avert this safety and economic disaster? The independent \nexperts at the Government Accountability Office who studied this issue \nand released a report told us that the railroads would need an \nadditional 1 to 5 years to meet the requirements of the implementation. \nThey documented the immensely complex technological challenges \nassociated with new PTC components. This report and the letters I \nreceived from both railroads and regulators about the positive train \ncontrol deadline are posted on the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee Web site: commerce.senate.gov/ptc.\n  The Senate acted in July by passing a provision on the multiyear \nhighway reauthorization bill that would extend the deadline on a case-\nby-case basis. The Senate's bill, which passed by a vote of 60 to 34, \ntook the best parts of legislation to extend the deadline that\n\n[[Page S7016]]\n\nhad been put forward by the Obama administration, by Senator Feinstein, \nwho championed the PTC requirement, and by Senators Roy Blunt and \nClaire McCaskill of Missouri, who saw this problem coming some time ago \nand have worked with me to prevent it.\n  Under the bipartisan Senate plan, the Secretary of Transportation \ngets the legal authority to approve or disapprove requests for \nextensions submitted in plans where railroads show how and when they \nwill meet the full requirements of PTC implementation. If approved, \nthis essentially becomes a contract, and railroads will face \nconsequences if they do not adhere to it, including fines. Under no \ncircumstance could the Secretary approve a date for full PTC \ninstallation that is later than 2018. The Secretary also has the \nauthority to identify and require changes to deficient schedules that \ndo not show safe and successful implementation as soon as practicable.\n  The proposal is specifically designed to maintain pressure on \nrailroads to install and implement PTC systems without undue delay. It \nalso recognizes that review by regulators after installation, which is \nnecessary to achieve legal certification of full PTC implementation, \nmay take additional time. Of serious concern to the many commuters and \nshippers who rely on railroad transportation, the deadline for \ncongressional action on the PTC mandate is actually well before \nDecember 31 of 2015. Without a legal extension, railroads will have to \nbegin preparations weeks in advance to operate under the assumption \nthat no change would be made. This will mean railroads will be \ncontacting customers such as water treatment facilities by Thanksgiving \nto cancel critical shipments. It will mean contacting passenger and \ncommuter rail customers to have tickets refunded because passenger \nrailcars will have to be cleared off the rail system before January 1.\n  To avoid this calamity, not to mention the other backups that such \nchanges could have on a vast rail network, we need to pass an extension \ninto law before these cancellations begin. Working on a bipartisan \nbasis, we can help our constituents avert a transportation calamity \nthat would have a much more serious impact on our economy than last \nyear's west coast ports slowdown.\n  This is about helping millions of Americans who are dependent on \nrailroads for their livelihood and essential deliveries. We have a \nresponsibility to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters that \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation have received \nfrom railroads and officials that I have with me here today, which I \nthink explain very clearly what the consequences are if this body fails \nto act before these deadlines are upon us.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                        Metra,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 10, 2015.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune, Thank you for your letter requesting \n     information about Metra's positive train control (PTC) \n     installation and the impact on our system if Congress does \n     not extend the December 31, 2015 implementation deadline. As \n     the commuter rail service provider for the northeastern \n     Illinois region, our primary goal is the safe operation of \n     more than 750 trains that run daily throughout our system, \n     providing about 300,000 passenger trips each day and 83.4 \n     million passenger trips per year. We remain committed to the \n     implementation of PTC in a safe and prudent manner. However, \n     many significant challenges prohibit our ability to meet the \n     federally-mandated deadline.\n\n\n                             Metra Overview\n\n       Metra is one of the largest and most complex commuter rail \n     systems in North America, serving Cook, DuPage, Will, Lake, \n     Kane and McHenry counties in Northeastern Illinois. The \n     agency provides service to and from downtown Chicago with 241 \n     stations over 11 routes totaling nearly 500 route miles and \n     approximately 1,200 miles of track.\n       Metra owns and operates four of its 11 lines, has trackage-\n     rights or lease agreements to operate Metra trains over \n     freight railroads on three lines, and has purchase of service \n     agreements with two freight railroads which operate commuter \n     service on four other Metra lines.\n       Metra's core business is to serve people traveling to \n     downtown Chicago to work. Approximately half of all work \n     trips made from suburban Chicago to downtown are made on \n     Metra. Our customers come from all parts of our region's \n     3,700 square miles.\n\n\n                    Metra PTC Implementation Update\n\n       Metra faces unique challenges implementing PTC as a result \n     of Chicago's complex railroad infrastructure and role as the \n     nation's busiest transportation hub. In fact, Chicago handles \n     one-fourth of the nation's freight rail traffic each day, \n     handling 37,500 rail cars.\n       More than 1,300 trains operate in the Chicago area each \n     weekday, including 750 Metra trains, 500 freight trains and \n     the remainder Amtrak trains. Metra must interact and \n     coordinate its railroad operations on a daily basis with all \n     railroads operating in Chicago--including six of the seven \n     Class 1 railroads. PTC implementation must be closely and \n     carefully coordinated with each of them. As a result, Metra \n     has directed much of its initial resources toward our \n     contract carriers, Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and BNSF \n     Railway (BNSF).\n       Despite these challenges, we have made steady and \n     consistent progress in implementing PTC. We currently expect \n     to have on-board equipment completely installed on BNSF by \n     the end of this year and on UP by the second quarter of 2016. \n     After those systems are tested and become operational, more \n     than 40 percent of Metra's train fleet will be PTC-compliant.\n       Metra has also made significant progress toward \n     implementing PTC on the lines we own. To date, that includes:\n       Allocating $153 million in capital funding from federal \n     formula funds and state sources toward PTC.\n       Installing PTC equipment on half of our 530 locomotives and \n     cab cars.\n       Continuing signal upgrades at 12 interlocking locations--\n     half the all signal locations on our system.\n       Installing 118 wayside interface units.\n       Hiring a system integration team to design Metra's PTC \n     system.\n       Awarding contracts to engineering firms to design necessary \n     upgrades to our signal system and to draft specifications for \n     other tasks.\n       Filling key leadership positions on the PTC project, as \n     well as hiring more than 50 full-time employees to install \n     PTC in the field and on our trains.\n\n\n                       Continuing PTC Challenges\n\n       However, despite our progress, many significant challenges \n     remain, including cost and funding. PTC implementation is an \n     unfunded mandate and expected to cost Metra more than $350 \n     million. Our agency receives approximately $150 million each \n     year in federal formula funding for all of our capital needs, \n     such as bridges, track and signals. Thus, to fully fund PTC, \n     Metra would need to spend 100 percent of its federal funding \n     for two and one-half years. Nationwide, the American Public \n     Transportation Association (APTA) estimates that it will cost \n     more than $3.48 billion to fully implement PTC on all \n     commuter railroads.\n       In addition, Metra, like all other railroads, has been \n     constrained by the limited number of firms that can provide \n     signal design services and the limited expertise available to \n     accelerate design and deployment. Those firms and expertise \n     are needed by most railroads to help redesign and renew \n     existing signals and install trackside components--a tough \n     job made even more so by the sheer volume and complexity of \n     the task. We have also been limited by the availability of \n     the needed equipment.\n       Another challenge has been the deployment of a national \n     220MHz communications network for PTC among U.S. railroads. \n     The network is critical. The onboard, trackside and back \n     office components of every railroad's PTC system have to be \n     able to communicate via a radio network. In Chicago, it is \n     undetermined if we have enough spectrum available for the PTC \n     needs of the region's railroads until a spectrum study is \n     completed by Transportation Technology Center, Inc.\n       Another challenge is that the initial technology continues \n     to be revised. A major prerequisite for the PTC system is the \n     creation of a detailed database of every route on the \n     system--a time-consuming and extremely labor-intensive \n     process. A process will be needed to document and update GPS \n     coordinates every time a critical PTC asset is moved more \n     than one foot. These processes are dependent upon the final \n     onboard software. A final production release date is not \n     known at this time.\n       Other challenges include expected issues with components \n     and software as full system testing continues this year. So \n     far, only partial testing of individual segments of the \n     system has taken place. And, the fear of component failure is \n     driving designs with more redundancy, which is further \n     lengthening the design process. In addition, the Federal \n     Railroad Administration (FRA) must review and certify every \n     railroad's plans.\n       Metra's current timeline for full PTC implementation is \n     2019, although we expect several lines to be completed before \n     then.\n\n\n           Consequences of Failure to Extend the PTC Deadline\n\n       Metra has been tirelessly advocating for an extension of \n     the PTC deadline due to numerous technical, regulatory and \n     operational challenges. The railroad industry and the FRA \n     have also known that the 2015 deadline is unattainable. In \n     our view, the time has come to adjust the implementation \n     schedule to reflect reality.\n\n[[Page S7017]]\n\n       Working with the American Public Transportation Association \n     and the American Association of Railroads, we have asked \n     Congress to allow the FRA to give waivers to agencies that \n     have made a good faith effort to meet the 2015 deadline. We \n     remain hopeful that we can work with Congress and the FRA on \n     a solution that will allow us to safely implement PTC on our \n     system and continue to provide 300,000 daily passenger trips.\n       Time is now running out. It is with great concern and \n     trepidation that we must begin to prepare contingency plans \n     in the event that the December 31, 2015 PTC implementation \n     deadline passes. In addition, our plan is to fully brief our \n     Board of Directors at its September 21st meeting to discuss \n     the path forward.\n       In addition, we are currently working with the FRA to \n     obtain further clarification on the legality of our ability \n     to operate past the December 31, 2015 deadline. Metra along \n     with other APTA members will be meeting with the FRA to \n     discuss these concerns at the end of the month.\n       In the absence of an extension, there is a strong \n     possibility that Metra will not be able to operate our trains \n     beginning January 1, 2016. Additionally, the two railroads \n     with which we have purchase of service agreements--UP and \n     BNSF--have stated that they do not plan to operate passenger \n     rail until PTC is fully implemented and operational. Both \n     have stated that they will not have PTC fully operational by \n     the December 31, 2015 deadline. These lines are our busiest \n     and carry more than 50 percent of our customers.\n       While it will be a limited option, we have already reached \n     out to our transit partners at CTA and Pace to learn if any \n     operational changes can be made to accommodate an increase in \n     passengers on their systems. However, we recognize that there \n     is no way our transit partners can accommodate any but a \n     small fraction of our 300,000 riders. We are also developing \n     communication plans to alert our customers of a decision \n     before October 31 so that they can begin to consider and \n     prepare for alternate transportation.\n       As background, under federal regulations all qualified \n     maintenance personnel must ensure locomotive and cab cars \n     have the required safety systems and that they are \n     functioning properly. After December 31, 2015, procedures for \n     pre-service inspections will include PTC as a legal \n     requirement. To be clear, Metra does not and will not support \n     any action that would cause our employees to operate our \n     trains in violation of any regulation.\n       This is not a decision we plan to make without thoughtful \n     consideration of all of our options and the impact this would \n     have on our customers and our employees. Operating in \n     violation of regulations poses serious consequences. Our \n     employees could face a personal civil fine of $25,000 per \n     violation as well as loss of their certifications. We place a \n     tremendous value on our employees and will not put them at \n     risk in this way. If these fines were to be paid by Metra, we \n     anticipate they could cost our agency nearly $19 million per \n     day.\n       The potential impacts of a shutdown of Metra service on our \n     customers, employees, Chicago area residents and others are \n     severe and far-reaching.\n       First, if Metra is unable to operate past the deadline and \n     we shut down our operations, our 300,000 weekday passenger \n     trips will have to be made by alternate means.\n       The great majority of our riders will likely be forced onto \n     our region's already congested roads and highways. In fact, a \n     report by the Texas A Transportation Institute found that \n     five of the 20 most congested roads in the nation are in the \n     Chicago area. This resulted in 61 extra hours behind the \n     wheel on average in 2014 because of delays caused by \n     gridlock.\n       A shutdown would result in an increase of vehicles on our \n     local roadways. Such action would be forcing our customers to \n     move from one of the safest modes of transportation to one \n     that is less safe, which was not the intent of the 2008 Rail \n     Safety Act. If Metra service did not exist, it would take 29 \n     extra lanes of expressways to accommodate our riders. As you \n     know, mass transit also reduces the carbon footprint in an \n     already congested and polluted region.\n       The shutdown would put many of our customers--those with \n     little or no other transit options--at risk at the beginning \n     of one of the historically coldest months in Chicago. This \n     includes seniors, students and low-income riders who depend \n     on Metra to get to work, school and doctors' appointments. \n     Metra is a lifeline for many in our region.\n       The shutdown would impact our local economy by contributing \n     to roadway congestion that already costs our region $7.2 \n     billion annually and by impacting communities whose residents \n     may not be able to go to work and collect their paychecks.\n       In 2014, Metra experienced the second-highest ridership in \n     history. Clearly, at a time when customers and their families \n     need us the most, a shutdown would be devastating. At a time \n     when funding sources are scarce, now more than ever we depend \n     upon growing our ridership revenue.\n       Further, if Metra shut down it could take several months to \n     restart our operations as a result of furloughs of train \n     crews and maintenance forces. This would place an enormous \n     financial burden on our employees, who would cease to collect \n     the wages they need to support their families. I want to \n     assure you that we take these matters seriously. We will do \n     all we can to prevent this crisis from happening within the \n     confines of the law as it exists today.\n       I would like to thank you for your support for legislation \n     that would responsibly extend the PTC deadline. As always, \n     Metra remains committed to implementing PTC as quickly and as \n     safely as we can, but like most of the rest of the U.S. \n     railroad industry, we simply need more time. We remain \n     hopeful that with your leadership, Congress will take \n     appropriate action. Please do not hesitate to contact me \n     should you require any further information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Don Orseno,\n     Executive Director/CEO, Metra.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Union Pacific Corporation,\n\n                                     Omaha, NE, September 9, 2015.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     information on positive train control (PTC) installation, and \n     the impacts if Congress does not extend the December 31, \n     2015, implementation deadline. This is an incredibly \n     important issue for the nation's rail shippers and \n     passengers, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.\n       Union Pacific is implementing PTC, and since the mandate in \n     2008, we have worked tirelessly to design, install, and test \n     the system. However, despite our best efforts, we will not \n     make the installation deadline. This is because PTC isn't a \n     simple and established off-the-shelf technology. Rather, PTC \n     is a complex new system comprised of several independent \n     technologies. Installing PTC requires integrating thousands \n     of components across the telecommunications spectrum along \n     tens of thousands of miles of track. The software must \n     continuously relay critical information such as speed limits, \n     train movement authorization, switch positions, work zone \n     locations, and other operational data. It must also factor in \n     locomotive and rail car mix, train length, weight, speed, \n     track conditions and terrain to determine safe stopping \n     distances. Based on this data, the system must calculate, \n     multiple times a second, all of these measurements to allow \n     the train to move safely. Finally, PTC must also be \n     interoperable, meaning that the Union Pacific system must \n     work with the systems of other railroads. Beyond these \n     formidable technical elements, we also face regulatory \n     obstacles to obtain the necessary spectrum and permits to \n     install wayside communication towers.\n       While we will not make the deadline, I want you to know we \n     take our responsibilities seriously, and we have made \n     monumental efforts to implement PTC. These include:\n       Investing $1.8 billion through June with another $200 \n     million for the rest of this year.\n       Hiring nearly a thousand workers to implement the \n     technology.\n       Acquiring spectrum and developing custom radio equipment.\n       Developing the software necessary to create an \n     interoperable PTC system.\n       Working with more than 50 vendors to develop or acquire \n     components.\n       We have made enormous strides toward implementation, and I \n     am very proud of the Union Pacific people who have gotten us \n     to this point.\n       We have installed PTC hardware and software on 13,480 miles \n     out of approximately 20,000 miles. The 20,000 miles we need \n     to equip represents roughly two thirds of our network.\n       We have installed 6,275 out of 10,000 wayside antennas.\n       We have partially installed (phases one and two) PTC \n     hardware on 4,500 locomotives, out of 6,500. (Locomotive \n     hardware installations must be done in three phases due to \n     the need to design and build the necessary components. The \n     first phase takes the locomotive out of service for one week. \n     The second phase takes the locomotive out of service for a \n     couple of days, and the third phase will take the locomotive \n     out of service for several hours.)\n       We expect to have PTC fully installed throughout our \n     network by the end of 2018. Then we will need time to test \n     the system before the FRA can certify it as implemented. PTC \n     is the largest and most complex technological undertaking \n     ever attempted by the freight rail industry. Without a period \n     to test the system to ensure that it works properly across \n     the estimated 63,000 miles of freight rail lines where it \n     will be installed, gridlock could occur as trains will simply \n     stop when they shouldn't. This could cause the entire \n     national rail network to meltdown, and the thousands of \n     customers and communities we serve would be significantly \n     impacted.\n       What will happen if Congress does not extend the deadline? \n     As you know, we have been contemplating that question for \n     several months now. Because we would be operating in \n     violation of federal law, and because we would be potentially \n     subject to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines and \n     expose ourselves to untold liability should a toxic by \n     inhalation gas (TIH) or passenger accident occur on a line \n     that was supposed to be equipped with PTC, it is our plan to \n     embargo all TIH traffic as well as passenger traffic on our \n     railroad. TIH traffic would be embargoed several weeks prior \n     to January 1, 2016, to ensure an orderly shutdown and clear \n     our system of TIH carloads prior to the end of the year. We \n     expect to issue the TIH embargo notice prior to Thanksgiving. \n     Commuter operations would cease before midnight on December \n     31, 2015, and long distance passenger\n\n[[Page S7018]]\n\n     trains will stop originating several days earlier to ensure \n     that all passengers reach their destinations before the \n     deadline.\n       I want you to know these decisions are not made lightly or \n     in haste. We carefully reviewed our options, which are \n     limited. Embargoing this traffic, which is the traffic that \n     necessitates PTC installation, is in the best interest of our \n     employees and shareholders. We simply don't see another \n     option.\n       This will cause significant economic disruption for our \n     country. Chlorine and anhydrous ammonia (fertilizer) are the \n     two largest TIH commodities we carry. Chlorine is not only a \n     feedstock for many products, it is also critical for many \n     cities to purify their drinking water. The suspension of \n     anhydrous ammonia shipments will mean farmers will be unable \n     to get the fertilizer they need to ensure healthy crops. \n     Finally, millions of commuters will be forced onto already \n     congested highways and roads. Again, we did not make this \n     decision lightly. We are in the process of notifying our \n     customers of this decision, and within the next month, we \n     will be letting them (and you) know of the exact date we will \n     have to start embargoing TIH to clear the network by the end \n     of the year.\n       Our decision to stop only the traffic that led to the \n     requirement to install PTC will be revisited if the Federal \n     Railroad Administration (FRA) imposes fines on freight trains \n     without TIH, as they are authorized to do. Should the FRA \n     take such a broad action, we will have to consider an embargo \n     on virtually all rail freight that we handle on lines that \n     are to be equipped with PTC despite its untold consequences \n     for the U.S. economy.\n       Finally, you asked how this decision could impact safety. \n     Extending the deadline would not diminish safety in the rail \n     industry. We are a safe industry. In fact, last year was the \n     safest year on record as was the year before that. PTC, when \n     ready and fully implemented, will be another mechanism to \n     continue that improvement, but it is not the only one we \n     employ and are pursuing. Rail inspections, wheel testing, \n     innovative technologies that predict when something will fail \n     so that it can be repaired or replaced before failure, and \n     employee engagement are just some of the other tools we use \n     to ensure a safe and efficient rail system.\n       However, failure to extend the deadline will increase \n     safety risks, not for the rail industry, but for the public \n     at large. Rail is the safest way to transport hazardous \n     chemicals. Overall 99.997% of all hazardous material \n     shipments by rail reach their destination without release \n     caused by train accident. However, if services cease, TIH \n     traffic will be forced to move by trucks on our nation's \n     highways. Union Pacific carries 27,000 carloads of TIH \n     traffic a year. If this commodity were to still move in \n     commerce, it would need to be carried by about 100,000 \n     trucks. Moreover, people who currently use commuter trains \n     would be forced onto the highways, creating an even more \n     congested mixture in some of our country's most dense urban \n     environments.\n       Chairman Thune, I thank you for your letter and your \n     leadership on this issue. We are committed to install PTC as \n     rapidly and safely as we can. I think our actions have shown \n     that. However, we will not make the end of the year deadline. \n     If Congress does not extend the deadline, we will embargo TIH \n     and passenger traffic on our network. Please do not hesitate \n     to contact me if you need additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lance M. Fritz,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Surface Transportation Board,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 2015.\n     Hon. John Thune,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thune: Thank you for your letter dated August \n     28, 2015, concerning the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 \n     (RSIA). RSIA requires rail common carriers to install \n     positive train control (PTC) on lines that carry passengers \n     and toxic-by-inhalation hazardous materials by December 31, \n     2015. In your letter, you observe that railroads are not \n     likely to meet that deadline, and you note that some \n     railroads have indicated that they may curtail service absent \n     an extension of the deadline. Given the likely disruptive \n     effect that a curtailment of service could have on the \n     economy, you requested that I respond to three questions. I \n     will answer each in turn.\n       First, you ask what information we have sought or received \n     from freight and passenger railroads on the actions they \n     might take absent an extension. On July 13, I sent the \n     Nation's largest freight railroads, as well as short line \n     carriers, a ``fall peak letter'' requesting information about \n     their ability to meet forecasted freight rail demand and any \n     challenges they see for the upcoming season. Two carriers, \n     CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) and BNSF Railway Company \n     (BNSF), stated in their response letters that they foresaw \n     PTC compliance as a significant challenge. CSXT stated that \n     the industry would not make the current year-end PTC \n     installation deadline but indicated that it was ``premature \n     to anticipate what decisions might be necessary should an \n     extension not pass.'' BNSF confirmed that it would not meet \n     the deadline and offered the possibility that ``neither \n     passenger nor freight traffic would operate on BNSF lines \n     that are required by federal law and regulation to have an \n     interoperable PTC system'' after the current deadline. \n     Additionally, we have received information about the railroad \n     industry's concern with the potential repercussions of the \n     deadline from reviewing recent testimony before Congress.\n       The Board has also obtained information about the status of \n     PTC compliance through informal meetings. These include \n     discussions at Railroad-Shipper Transportation Advisory \n     Council meetings and conversations that the Board's Office of \n     Public Assistance, Government Affairs and Compliance has had \n     with rail and shipper stakeholders. Based on these informal \n     channels, it appears that some railroads are considering \n     suspending all freight and passenger service on lines that \n     are required to be RSIA-compliant if an extension is not \n     authorized.\n       Second, you ask what would be the primary legal or economic \n     factors that could cause freight and passenger railroads to \n     consider suspending or reducing service. I understand that \n     railroads are considering a broad array of legal and economic \n     factors in deciding whether to suspend or curtail service if \n     the PTC deadline is not extended. Without commenting on the \n     merits of any particular concern, it would seem that the \n     railroads would be considering how noncompliance would affect \n     them in matters such as: insurance coverage; exposure to tort \n     or other commercial liability; labor-relations issues; and \n     potential civil penalty assessments by the Federal Railroad \n     Administration (FRA)/USDOT. And I assume that railroads are \n     also considering whether a railroad that has not implemented \n     PTC may suspend or curtail service (in the event the PTC \n     deadline is not extended) without violating its common \n     carrier obligation and without incurring liability to its \n     shippers. Additionally, railroads would likely consider \n     competitive and commercial factors, such as relative market \n     share and the likelihood of permanent loss of traffic, \n     revenue, and goodwill.\n       While many of the legal and economic factors identified \n     above are not directly within the Board's jurisdiction, \n     freight rail carriers do have a common carrier obligation to \n     provide service pursuant to a reasonable request. The common \n     carrier obligation includes service for hazardous materials \n     such as the toxic-by-inhalation commodities that partly \n     motivated RSIA's PTC requirement. At the same time, the \n     common carrier obligation is not absolute, and railroads can \n     lawfully suspend service for various reasons, including \n     safety. Prior agency cases assessing the reasonableness of \n     service embargos have been very fact-specific, examining the \n     reasons for the service suspension, the length of the \n     suspension, and the impacted traffic (among other factors). \n     Sometimes the Board has found that a railroad's actions in \n     initiating and maintaining an embargo were reasonable, but \n     other times the agency has concluded that a carrier acted \n     improperly by refusing to serve. Because prior safety-related \n     curtailment-of-service cases often involved services that \n     complied with comprehensive safety regimes administered by \n     FRA (and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety \n     Administration), a carrier-initiated curtailment of service \n     due to a failure to comply with RSIA would present a case of \n     first impression before the Board. I cannot predict the \n     outcome of such a case. My expectation is that the views of \n     the FRA, which has primary jurisdiction over rail safety in \n     general and over implementing RSIA in particular, would be a \n     critical consideration.\n       Third, you ask how the Board plans to proactively monitor \n     and analyze potential service issues that could arise if the \n     current statutory deadline is not extended. As I noted during \n     my confirmation hearings, I will continue to ensure that \n     service quality for all shippers remains a primary focus of \n     the Board. I have been reaching out to railroads and to \n     shippers, and I have directed our Office of Public \n     Assistance, Government Affairs and Compliance (OPAGAC) to \n     continue its outreach to freight and passenger railroads, \n     shippers, and other stakeholders affected by issues related \n     to PTC compliance. OPAGAC has held informal conversations \n     with our stakeholders and will continue to do so in order to \n     keep the Board abreast of developments and informed on the \n     perspectives of the public. Indeed, the rail service problems \n     that occurred in 2013-14 made clear that obtaining timely \n     information is one of the keys to managing service issues. \n     The STB has continued to collect and analyze rail service \n     data, including Amtrak passenger service data, as part of the \n     interim initiative we began in 2014. We also continue to make \n     progress on a permanent data collection rulemaking. My staff \n     speaks regularly with railroads and shippers to hear about \n     any potential service issues in real time. We will continue \n     these efforts with regard to the impact of RSIA and other \n     service issues, using a fair and balanced approach.\n       I recognize that PTC is an important tool to enhance the \n     safety of the Nation's freight and passenger rail network, \n     and that it needs to be deployed in a timely way. Following \n     up on our success in working closely with your Committee to \n     help resolve the service issues shippers faced in 2013-2014, \n     I look forward to the important dialogue about the issues \n     raised in your letter. Thank you for allowing me the \n     opportunity to express my views. If you have further \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Daniel R. Elliott III,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7019]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Remembering Walter Dale Miller\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday South Dakotans were saddened to \nlearn that former South Dakota Gov. Walter Dale Miller passed away on \nMonday evening.\n  Governor Miller served as South Dakota Governor for just 20 months--\nfrom April 1993 to January 1995--but during his brief tenure, he \nsteered South Dakota through a number of challenges and provided a \nsense of stability and calm during a period of upheaval.\n  In the wake of Governor Mickelson's tragic death, Governor Miller led \nthe State in grieving and secured funding for a memorial to the \nGovernor and the seven other South Dakotans who died when their plane \ncrashed as it was returning to our State.\n  When inmates at the State penitentiary rioted less than a month into \nhis tenure, Governor Miller succeeded in ending the standoff without \nloss of life.\n  When the Great Flood of 1993 struck the Midwest, he led South \nDakota's response and worked tirelessly to help those who were \naffected.\n  And when a Supreme Court decision shut down South Dakota's video \nlottery, resulting in a sudden revenue loss, Governor Miller ensured \nthat South Dakota's most important needs were met.\n  In all, Governor Miller spent nearly 30 years serving South Dakota in \nState government--first in the State legislature, then as Lieutenant \nGovernor, and finally as Governor. In every office he held, he served \nwith a commitment and integrity that were recognized by South Dakotans \nof all political persuasions.\n  I always felt a particular kinship with Governor Miller since we both \nhailed from western South Dakota, which we in our State like to call \nWest River. The Governor was from Meade County, and I grew up in a \nlittle town called Murdo.\n  I think for many South Dakotans, Governor Miller embodied the West \nRiver cowboy: independent, self-reliant, and courageous, with a deep \nand abiding love of the wide open spaces that still characterize South \nDakota's landscape. I know that is how I, along with many other South \nDakotans, will remember him.\n  I want to offer my deepest condolences to Governor Miller's wife Pat \nand to the Governor's children. You are all in South Dakotans' thoughts \nand prayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                       Russia and the Middle East\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we now have information that the Russians \nhave now launched airstrikes in Syria, ostensibly against ISIS. In \nreality, it is not clear. In fact, there is information that some of \nthose strikes were at Homs, and the latest information is that the \nSyrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that at least 27 people \nwere killed, and that 6 children were among the dead.\n  These strikes near the city of Homs, which is not under control of \nISIS, of the Islamic State--so already we are seeing the true \nintentions of Vladimir Putin, which are to maintain a strong position \nin Syria, his foothold in the Middle East, and his propping up of \nBashar Assad--Bashar Assad, who has killed at least 250,000 of his own \ncitizens through the horrible process of barrel bombing and has driven \nmillions into refugee status with the full and complete support of Iran \nand Vladimir Putin.\n  I say to my colleagues, over the past 6\\1/2\\ years President Obama \nhas sounded retreat across the Middle East. In fact, it was 1 year ago \nat this time when the President of the United States said: Our strategy \nis to degrade and destroy ISIS. A report yesterday said some 28,000 \nEuropeans and some Americans have come into the fight on the side of \nISIS. Mosul and Ramadi remain in the hands of ISIS. Of course, the \ncontinued advances of ISIS in Syria are well known.\n  In short, a year after the President made that statement, there is no \nstrategy, and there is no success. In fact, we now see the results of \nthis failure, which is a flood of refugees out of Syria and Iraq \nbecause they have given up hope of ever returning to their homeland. \nOur hearts go out to those who are victims and have had to flee their \nhomeland. We see these refugees. It breaks our hearts when we see a \nlittle baby's body washed up on the beach.\n  It did not have to happen. It did not have to happen. Everybody knows \nthat when the President of the United States said that we have drawn a \nredline in Syria and did not do it, it had a profound effect on the \nMiddle East, including Sunni Arab States, as well as Shia. Everybody \nknows that when the President turned down the recommendations of his \nSecretary of Defense, his Secretary of State, which happened to be \nSecretary Clinton at the time, and his Secretary of Defense, to arm the \nFree Syrian Army--and he turned it down--that was another seminal \nmoment.\n  This is a series of decisions or nondecisions which has led to the \nsituation we see today, where Vladimir Putin may have inserted Russia \ninto the Middle East in a way that Russia has not enjoyed since 1973 \nwhen Anwar Sadat threw the Russians out of Egypt. He is still on course \nto repeat this nightmare by withdrawing nearly all U.S. forces from \nAfghanistan as well.\n  As we see in the last couple of days, the Taliban is capturing the \nstrategic city of Kunduz. That is terrible in the respect that Kunduz \nis in the northern part of Afghanistan, where it was believed it was \nfairly stable, showing the ability of the Taliban and the effects of \nour withdrawal.\n  But I come back to Syria and the Russian activities today. After 4 \nyears in Syria, the United States has stood by as Bashar Assad with his \nwar on the Syrian people goes on and on and on.\n  It is this slaughter that has been the single greatest contributor to \nthe rise and continued success of ISIL. Have no doubt, it was Bashar \nAssad that gave birth to ISIL. The President has said for years--for \nyears--that Assad must go. But he has done nothing that has brought us \nany closer to achieving that outcome. My friends, it is not that we \nhave done nothing, but we have not done anything that would reverse the \ntrend and in any way further the goal that the President articulated a \nyear ago--that we would degrade and destroy ISIL.\n  In short, this administration has confused our friends, encouraged \nour enemies, mistaken an excess of caution for prudence, and replaced \nthe risks of action with the perils of inaction. Into the wreckage--\ninto the wreckage of this administration's Middle East policy--has now \nstepped Vladimir Putin. As in Ukraine, as elsewhere, he perceives the \nadministration's inaction and caution as weakness, and he is taking \nfull advantage.\n  Over the past few weeks, Vladimir Putin has been engaged in a \nsignificant military buildup in western Syria, deploying strike \naircraft--by the way, he is also deploying aircraft that are air-to-\nair, not air-to-ground; my friends, ISIS has no air force--significant \nbuildup of bombers, tanks, artillery, Russian military personnel.\n  Meanwhile, our Secretary of State calls Lavrov frantically and asks \nhim what is going on--not once, not twice, three times. My friends, it \nis obvious what Vladimir Putin is doing. These airstrikes are a logical \nfollow-on to his ambition, which he is realizing to, one, play a major \nrole in Syria, preserve the port of Latakia, prop up Bashar Assad, and \nplay a major role in the Middle East.\n  All of this is not lost on countries in the region. Today Vladimir \nPutin escalated his involvement as Russian pilots carried out their \nfirst airstrikes in\n\n[[Page S7020]]\n\nSyria. Initial reports, as I mentioned, are that they are hitting \ntargets that are not controlled by ISIL. That should fool no one \nbecause Vladimir Putin's primary authority and responsibility and \nambition are to prop up Bashar Assad against all of his enemies.\n  The White House has said: ``It's unclear exactly what Russia's \nintentions are.'' My friends, I am not making that up. The White House \nhas said: ``It's unclear exactly what Russia's intentions are.'' If the \nWhite House is confused about Putin's intentions and plans in Syria, \nthen the United States is in even worse trouble than many fear because \nit is not hard to discern what Vladimir Putin wants.\n  In fact, from Russia's military buildup in Syria to its recently \nannounced military and intelligence coalition with Syria, Iran, and \nIraq--remember, Iraq is the country where we lost thousands of American \nlives. Now, the Iraqi Government announces sharing intelligence with \nSyria and Iran--amazing, amazing. Putin's ambitions are blindingly \nobvious, my friends. He wants to prop up Assad, play kingmaker in any \ntransition, undermine U.S. policy and operations, and ultimately expand \nRussian power in the Middle East to a degree, as I mentioned, unseen \nsince 1973.\n  This week at the United Nations, President Obama said: ``The United \nStates is prepared to work with any nation, including Russia and \nIran,'' to resolve the Syrian conflict. It requires self-delusion of \ntremendous scale to believe that Russia and Iran have any interest in \nresolving the Syrian conflict. They seek only to keep the murderous \nAssad regime in power. Russia's intervention in Syria will prolong and \ncomplicate this horrific war. The main beneficiary will be ISIL, which \nhas fed off the ethnic and sectarian divisions fostered by the Assad \nregime.\n  It is tragic. It is tragic, my fellow Americans, that we have reached \nthis point. It is a Syrian conflict that has killed more than 200,000 \npeople, created the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II, \nspawned a terrorist army of tens of thousands, and now created a \nplatform for a Russian autocrat to join with an Iranian theocrat to \nprop up a Syrian dictator. It did not have to be this way. But this is \nthe inevitable consequence of hollow words, redlines crossed, tarnished \nmoral influence, leading from behind, and a total lack of American \nleadership.\n  My friends, today in the Washington Post there is an article by David \nIgnatius, who quotes Ryan Crocker, one of the greatest diplomats I have \never had the honor and privilege to know.\n  The article says:\n\n       ``Russia has played a horrible hand brilliantly. We folded \n     what could have been a pretty good hand,'' argues Ryan \n     Crocker, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served in nearly \n     every hot spot in the Middle East and is among the nation's \n     wisest analysts of the region. ``The Russians were able to \n     turn a defensive position into an offensive one because we \n     were so completely absent.''\n\n  Ryan Crocker is right.\n  I would also remind my friends that because of American inaction, the \ncountries in the region are making their own accommodations. Saudi \nArabia, UAE, and Qatar have all been to Russia for arms deals. The \nSaudi Arabians have bought $17 billion worth of weapons from Russia; \nUAE, $7 billion; Qatar, $5 billion. Would that have ever happened 10 \nyears ago? Of course not. But they see America leaving, and they are \naccommodating. And we have, of course, refused in many respects to give \nthe kinds of weapons particularly that the Kurds need.\n  I won't go on too much longer. I will summarize by saying that this \nis a very sad day for America and the world. The world is watching. It \nis not confined to the Middle East. We see Vladimir Putin continue to \ndismember Ukraine, and now some phony separatist elections are going to \nbe held in the area he now controls. The Chinese leader made some nice \ncomments about how they would stop the hacking that allowed them to \ncompromise our most important industrial, military, and other secrets. \nWe will see if that happens, but they are also continuing their \nexpansion in the islands in the South China Sea.\n  An absence of American leadership is very visible and very understood \nby nations throughout the world.\n  Today we see Vladimir Putin attacking with his airplanes not just \nISIS but others who are enemies of Bashar al-Assad. I would like to add \nthat these airstrikes are indiscriminate in nature, and there has been \nno attempt whatsoever to stop the horrible barrel bombing, as GEN David \nPetraeus recommended before the Armed Services Committee just a few \ndays ago.\n  So this is a bad day, and it is time for American leadership. It is \ntime that President Obama woke up to the realities in the world and \nreassert American leadership. That does not mean we are going to send \nthousands of ground troops back into Iraq or Syria, but it does mean \nthat we develop a policy.\n  I am told that these bombings--that the American Government had said \nthat American planes should not fly and that we have somehow approved \nof these airstrikes. I do not know if that is true. I hope that is not \ntrue. What we should be saying to Vladimir Putin is ``You fly, but we \nfly anywhere we want to when and how we want to, and you had better \nstay out of the way.'' That is the message that should be sent to \nVladimir Putin.\n  So I hope the American people understand how serious this is and that \nthis rogue dictator named Vladimir Putin, who is a thug and a bully, \ncan only understand a steadfast and strong American policy that brings \nAmerica's strength back to bear. We are still the strongest Nation in \nthe world. Now it is time for us to act like it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Government Funding and Abortion\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senate has now passed a continuing \nresolution to keep the lights on, to keep the government employees \npaid, to pay our military and make sure our veterans get the benefits \nthey are entitled to from now until December 11.\n  I think it is important to reflect on why it is we had to do this in \nthis way, with all of the attendant drama and the suggestion that we \nwere going to somehow shut down the government, which was never a \nlikelihood. The main reason we find ourselves in this posture is \nbecause for the first time since 2009, the Senate has actually passed a \nbudget. This new majority that was elected last November saw that one \nof the most important things we could do in terms of the basic \nfundamentals of good governance was to pass a budget--something that \nhadn't happened since 2009.\n  There are many benefits, of course, of passing a budget, but one of \nthe benefits was to allow the Appropriations Committee to begin to go \nto work and take up and pass 12 different appropriations bills that \nwould keep the whole of the Federal Government funded.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, there is a lot of policy written in \nthose Appropriations Committees. You can make a decision not to fund \nsomething because it is not working or maybe it is obsolete or outdated \nor perhaps to fund something else; say perhaps we need to reform the \nway this particular service is delivered and consolidate it in a way \nthat it is cost-effective and more efficient.\n  So it is important to pass a budget and to pass appropriations bills. \nUnfortunately, our Democratic colleagues are trying to use the \nappropriations process to hold it hostage in order to force us to \nincrease government spending. The way they try to do that is to \nfilibuster the appropriations bills and to say: We are not even going \nto take up a defense appropriations bill, the one that actually pays \nour troops and takes care of their families. Well, they are going to \nhave a chance to vote on a veterans appropriations bill very soon, and \nwe will see whether they keep up this tactic of holding hostage our \nappropriations process, creating all this unnecessary drama associated \nwith whether there is going to be a shutdown here or a shutdown there. \nIt is very important that we get back to work and we do the basic work \nof governance--passing a budget, passing appropriations bills. I know \nthe Presiding Officer agrees with that.\n  I think lost in all of this debate over government shutdowns and over \nappropriations bills has been the shocking\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\nvideos we saw of Planned Parenthood, these Planned Parenthood videos \nthat showed Planned Parenthood executives speaking callously about the \nunborn. These are late-term abortions. These are unborn babies who \ncould well be viable outside of the womb, because after 20 weeks, give \nor take 2 weeks, it is amazing what neonatologists and what medical \nscience can do. I know we have all seen babies as small as 1 pound or \nless who actually grow into thriving adults later on, and it is amazing \nwhat can be done even with these young babies as young as 20 weeks or \nmore. But of course these videos I think have served one important \nrole; that is, to be a wake-up call, to try to wake up the moral \nconscience of our Nation. Somehow we have trivialized this whole \nprocess and talked about choice and talked about the convenience of \nadults, when in fact there is another competing interest involved; that \nis, the potential life of a human being that is being overlooked.\n  At different times in our Nation's history I think we have seen that \nsomehow we became so desensitized, we became so self-focused on \nourselves that we forgot the fact that this speaks about our humanity \nand who we are as a people. So I think these sorts of wake-up calls \nthat these videos have provided have been useful if we make the most of \nthem.\n  I know that as we have talked about the continuing resolution and the \nso-called shutdown scenario--which is not going to happen--there has \nbeen concern that this might be the only way that we stop this horrific \npractice of late-term abortions and harvesting of fetal body parts for \nsale that were depicted in these videos. But I am thankful there are a \nnumber of pro-life groups in Texas and nationally who understand that \nwe need to make sure this is a long-term agenda and not just a one-vote \nsituation. As I mentioned yesterday, earlier this week two groups \ninvolved in the pro-life mission in my home State announced their \nsupport for efforts in Congress to hold Planned Parenthood accountable \nand to work toward long-term, meaningful change on the pro-life agenda. \nOne of those groups, the Texas Alliance for Life, released a statement \nthat affirmed actions taken last week--a vote to defund Planned \nParenthood and to redirect funding to other providers of women's health \nservices that are not involved in the abortion industry. If we are \ntruly concerned about women's access to health care--and we all are--\nthen why can't we take the money that goes to pay the No. 1 abortion \nprovider in America and redirect it to community health centers that \nactually do provide women's health services?\n  The statement of the Texas Alliance for Life went on to say that the \ngroup was ``not asking for a government shutdown over the issue'' and \nthat ``better options exist for achieving success.''\n  I want to spend a moment or two focusing on ``better options [than a \nshutdown] exist for achieving success'' because the Senate continues to \nwork on several measures, including key pieces of legislation that \nwould advance the culture of life in this country--legislation such as \nthe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This would do what Texas \nhas already done, which is to say there can be no elective abortions \nafter 5 months of gestation. It is at this stage in development--just \n20 weeks--that many experts believe an unborn child can feel pain. I am \nstill unclear why our Democratic friends across the aisle would block \nsuch a simple, moral imperative like protecting these young lives as \nthey did last week, but I would like to also remind our friends across \nthe aisle that this legislation is not going away, and we will not stop \nraising the visibility of this issue and making the point that a child \nat 5 months--a child with fingerprints and taste buds--deserves \nprotection under the law.\n  Our country also needs another piece of legislation that I \ncosponsored and that actually passed in the House. This is called the \nBorn-Alive Survivors Protection Act, which the Presiding Officer is the \nlead sponsor of. Quite simply, this bill would mandate that doctors \nprovide infant care to newborns who survive an abortion procedure. This \nis different, I think, in kind from the defund Planned Parenthood \ndebate. This is about the delivery of a born child and whether a \nphysician or the abortion provider has any duty--which they should--to \nmake sure that child gets the care they need so they can survive or \nwhether they can, at their option, simply end that life as part of an \nabortion practice. It is a sad commentary on the conscience of America \nwhen we need a law like this to spell out the fact that doctors should \ncare for babies once they are born.\n  This legislation was introduced last week, and I hope we are \nsuccessful--as I said, the Presiding Officer is the lead cosponsor--in \ngetting broad support of cosponsors on this bill. Then we can go to \nSenator McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and ask him to schedule \nthis legislation for a vote.\n  So this bill, along with the pain-capable bill, will not only save \nthousands of unborn lives a year, but if enacted would be the biggest \nstep forward for the pro-life movement since the Partial Birth Abortion \nBan Act was signed into law a decade ago.\n  Both of these bills are part of a long-term, proactive strategy to \nfight for the lives of the unborn and to make this country one that \ntruly prizes the life of the unborn as a young life with limitless \npotential. It took time for the enactment of the Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act. I was in the Senate when we passed that legislation. It is \nincredible to me it took as long as it did for that to pass, but it \nalso took a commitment from leaders to stand up, time and time again, \nnot to just have one vote and then call it quits, to say we tried and \nwe were unsuccessful, but to stay after it until we actually achieved \npassage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. I believe, with the same \nsort of long-term commitment on the Pain-Capable bill and on the Born-\nAlive bill, we can continue to make progress in this House, as well as \nthe House of Representatives, and to be able to tell our constituents \nback home we have changed the culture of Washington, DC, and on a \nnational level and shown the respect for unborn life it deserves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Sea Level Rise In South Florida\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I want to talk about what is happening to \nour environment in South Florida as a result of sea level rise. We can \nput this into political terms of climate change, but that seems to be \nan issue some want to deny. So I want to talk about what you can't \ndeny, and that is that the sea is rising, particularly as shown in \nSouth Florida.\n  A year and a half ago, I brought the commerce committee to Miami \nBeach and brought a whole series of witnesses, one of whom was a NASA \nscientist who testified that measurements--now, this is not a forecast \nand this is not a projection; these are measurements of the level of \nthe sea over the course of the last four decades--that the sea has \nrisen in South Florida between 5 and 8 inches.\n  The reason I am bringing this to the attention of the Senate today is \nthat I just returned from Miami, where the latter part of September, \nthe first part of October is the seasonal high tide, and the streets of \nMiami Beach are flooded. As a matter of fact, 2 years ago the mayor of \nMiami Beach, when he was campaigning for that position, did a campaign \ncommercial in a kayak on Alton Road, which is on the westerly side of \nthe barrier island, away from the ocean, and it was flooded. In the \nintervening 2 years, the city of Miami Beach, in cooperation with the \nlocal governments of all of the southeast Florida governments, has \nspent millions of dollars on big pumps so that when the tides come, \nthey can get the water out of the streets.\n  A year ago, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and I went down there at this \ntime of year--the seasonal high tide--and lo and behold the pumps \nworked and the pumps got the water back into Biscayne Bay so that the \nroads stayed dry.\n  But look what happened 2 days ago, as shown in this picture. This is \ndowntown Miami Beach. Do you see the fellow? It is above his ankles, \nand he is up on the curb. Right here is the curb. He steps down, and it \ncomes up to just\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\nbelow his knees. You see the cars. You see the water. That is downtown \nMiami Beach. This is not just the phenomenon of the full Moon; this is \nthe phenomenon of sea level rise.\n  Let's take another view. Here is a lady who is trying to keep her \nfeet dry, up on a wall. You can see that here is the sidewalk. Here is \nthe curb. Here is the street. As you can see, this is a middle part of \nthe barrier island of Miami Beach. This isn't right next to the beach. \nThis isn't right next to Biscayne Bay, on either side, the east and the \nwest, of the barrier island. This is in the middle where you have all \nof these--in this case, it is condominiums where people live.\n  What is causing this? What is causing it is that planet Earth is \nheating up. The measurements are there. Why is it heating up? It is \nsimply this: As the Sun's rays come in and hit the Earth, they reflect \noff of the Earth, and that heat radiates back out into space.\n  It is the same principle, for example, on the space shuttle. When I \nparticipated in the space program 30 years ago, when we were in orbit--\nin the early part of the space shuttle program, on the space shuttle \nColumbia, once we got in orbit, we opened those payload bay doors--and \nthey served as radiators of all the heat that is generated onboard the \nspacecraft. We radiated it back out into space so that the spacecraft \ndoes not overheat. So, too, planet Earth.\n  The natural phenomenon is that the Sun's rays hit the Earth and \nreflect back out. Some of the heat is retained, but most of that heat \nis radiated back out into space, until you start to create the effect \nof a ceiling high in the atmosphere of the greenhouse gases, such as \ncarbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Those gases start to create a \nceiling effect, so that as the heat is radiating back towards space, it \nis trapped, and therefore the whole planet starts to heat up. What is \nmost of the Earth covered with? The oceans. That is where most of that \nadditional heat is absorbed. Ninety percent of the heat that is trapped \nin the Earth's greenhouse effect is absorbed into the oceans of the \nplanet. As a result, when water is heated, water expands, and thus one \nof the phenomena of seeing the seas begin to rise. The melting of the \nglaciers, the melting of the polar ice caps, adding more--instead of \nfrozen glaciers, that is going into the sea, displacing water. And \nthose glaciers are melting. That adds to it as well, but it is the \ntrapping of the heat that is causing this phenomenon.\n  We have made projections as to what the heat is that we are trapping, \nbut now we have an instrument out in space that can precisely measure \nbecause there is a spacecraft that was launched earlier this year, \nDiscover, that has several instruments on it. One of the instruments, \nby the way--you can go to the NASA Web site and you can see in real \ntime, every hour and a half, another picture of the entire Earth on the \ndaylight side of the Earth. The spacecraft is placed 1 million miles \naway from planet Earth, between the Earth and the Sun. So the \nspacecraft, looking back at Earth, is always looking at the daylight \nside of the Earth as it revolves about its axis 365 days a year, as it \nrevolves around the Sun. That is one instrument.\n  There is another instrument, and that is the instrument which \nmeasures the amount of the Sun's heat that goes into the Earth and the \namount of heat that is radiated back out. If you subtract the amount \nradiated back out into space from the amount of heat that goes into the \nEarth, you get a precise measurement of how much of the heat sent by \nthe Sun is trapped in the Earth's atmosphere. Now we have a precise \ninstrument that will tell us exactly what that is instead of the \nscientific projections that we have used, and that is as a result of \nthis new satellite spacecraft called Discover that we just put up \nearlier this year.\n  We can't keep denying what in fact is happening. The proof is in the \npudding. The proof is right here. There is no other way you can explain \nthis seasonal high tide when for the last two centuries this barrier \nisland has basically been dry during the seasonal high tide but now we \nare seeing this.\n  The consequences of this are quite severe. First of all, 75 percent \nof Florida's population is along the coast. Florida is now the third \nlargest State. We have surpassed New York. We have 20 million people \nnow, and 75 percent of that population is along the coast. As the sea \nlevel rises and people have to start dealing with this, what do you \nthink is going to happen to the value of their property? What about \ntheir freshwater? Florida sits on a honeycomb of limestone that is \nfilled with freshwater. Saltwater is heavier than freshwater. As the \nsea level rises, it starts to penetrate that honeycomb of freshwater. \nThat is the substructure of the peninsula of Florida. That then causes \nsaltwater intrusion into our drinking water, into the water we have to \nuse to sustain life.\n  There are no good results as a consequence of sea level rise.\n  I once again bring up to the Senate that we have some who say this is \nnot real. In fact, here is the proof. The proof is in the pudding. \nThere is something we can do about it. What we can do about it is start \nadopting policies that will put less carbon dioxide into the \natmosphere, and that means we have to be diligent in making sure we \nenact policies to do it.\n  There are several different ways you can do that. One, of course, is \nthe regulatory way, which is going on right now, which a lot of our \ncolleagues don't like. You regulate smokestacks. You regulate the \namount of pollutants that can be put out and so forth. There is another \nway, and that is to use the private marketplace of supply and demand by \nputting a price or a fee on the use of carbon, and therefore the market \nwill dictate whether a person puts more CO2 into the air as \na result of burning carbon. That will drive the marketplace to find \nalternative fuels that are a lot cleaner so that we can show the rest \nof the world what we are going to have to do.\n  I think it was rather prophetic that last week the Pope continuously \ntalked about climate change in all of his speeches. I think it was also \nprophetic that the Chinese President, in his visit to the United \nStates--apparently they are so choked because of the pollutants in the \nair in major cities in China that they are finally coming to the altar, \nso to speak, and realizing that they have to do something about it. \nOtherwise, they are threatening the complete health of their people in \nChina.\n  With this newfound attention to this problem, let's do something \nabout it by building bipartisan support for a solution. That is the \nright thing to do. And this is just another reminder that what is \nhappening in Miami Beach right now is the wave of the future unless we \nchange our policies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senators Ayotte, Alexander, Burr, Collins, and Gardner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Montana's national forests and public \nlands have been a pleasure and a part of our State's heritage for \ngenerations.\n  As a fifth-generation Montanan and as someone who loves the outdoors, \nI recognize how valuable our public lands are and the importance of \nensuring access for generations to come to hunting, backpacking and \nfishing--traditions that I, like many Montanans, have been thankful to \npass along to my kids. I know firsthand the important role that the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund holds in protecting and increasing \nMontanans' access to our public lands.\n  That is why since coming to Congress I have been actively working to \nsecure funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund every year. In \nfact, through the appropriations process this summer, Senator Susan \nCollins and I successfully passed an amendment to increase the funding \nfor the LWCF program by nearly $14 million. This brought the overall \nfunding for LWCF to $306 million and ensured that LWCF did not lose out \non work for permanent authorization.\n  In Montana and throughout the country, the Land and Water \nConservation\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\nFund plays a critical role in achieving the goal of increased access. \nDespite the tireless efforts and the work of Senators Burr, Collins, \nAyotte, Alexander, and Gardner to move reauthorization forward, yet \nagain today, the authorization for LWCF will expire tonight. The \nContinuing Resolution did not include a reauthorization for LWCF.\n  Because LWCF is funded through royalties generated from offshore \nenergy development, it is a fundamental tool to help preserve and \nprotect Montanans' opportunity to enjoy hunting, fishing, and outdoor \nrecreation. In fact, during the August recess while I was back home in \nMontana, this is where I was: On the public lands of Montana. This is \nthe Beartooth Wilderness area. This is my wife Cindy and our dog Ruby. \nI have my fly rod on my back. This is, in fact, up near Granite Peak, \nMontana's highest peak. That is over 10,000 feet where that picture was \ntaken. It was a chance to enjoy our public lands--something that is an \nabsolute treasure for the people of Montana and the people of our great \ncountry.\n  LWCF keeps family ranches in the family and working. It is a \nfundamental tool that preserves and protects our opportunities to enjoy \nhunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation. It keeps forests in \nproductive use through the Forest Legacy Program, as in the Haskill \nBasin where my good friend Chuck Roady of Stoltz Land and Lumber works.\n  That is why it is so disappointing that reauthorization was not \nincluded in the CR we voted on today.\n  Under the current CR, LWCF will be funded, as will the rest of the \nFederal Government, through December 11. LWCF will be funded at fiscal \nyear 2015 levels and all projects will continue as planned. However, \nany new deposits into the fund will stop tomorrow, on October 1.\n  I have heard from many Montana businesses, outfitters, and guides who \nlove the outdoors and are very concerned about the program's lapse in \nauthorization. These small businesses rely on it for public access to \nMontana's treasured public lands for outdoor recreation which supports \nmillions of dollars of revenue and hundreds of jobs for our State.\n  Like Eric Grove of Great Divide Cyclery in Helena who has built his \nmountain bike business around the South Hills Trail System outside of \nHelena which was facilitated by LWCF. There are many other small \nbusinesses such as Eric's in Montana.\n  Before being elected to the Senate, before coming to Congress, I \nspent more than 12 years growing a technology company in Bozeman. We \nwere able to attract quality employees not only because we offered \ngood-paying salaries, but also because of Montana's unparalleled \nquality of life. In fact, our slogan was ``work where you also like to \nplay.'' The LWCF is a critical tool that facilitates recreation on our \npublic lands, allowing Montana businesses to attract world class \nemployees. We can't let it slip away.\n  I remind the Members of the Senate, we passed the reauthorization of \nLWCF. We have that in the bipartisan energy bill that passed the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee this year. I hope for cooperation from \nour friends across the aisle to bring that to the floor for a vote and \nmove it forward in regular order, which is the way the Senate should \noperate.\n  Now I wish to pause and yield to my distinguished colleague from the \ngreat State of New Hampshire, Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is also a big \nsupporter of LWCF. I am glad she has come to the floor today and is \njoining me in our fight to make sure we keep LWCF reauthorized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \nincredible support for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I love the \npicture showing the Senator from Montana and his wife because, just \nlike Montana, in my home State of New Hampshire, there are so many \nbeautiful places to hike. We have the White Mountain National Forest \nand places where the Land and Water Conservation Fund has made such a \ndifference in giving anyone an opportunity to ensure the use of our \npublic lands. In fact, having been born in New Hampshire and having \ngrown up there, I have so many fond memories of my childhood of hikes \nin our beautiful forests in New Hampshire.\n  Without the Land and Water Conservation Fund, we would not have been \nable to do--at this point there have been 650 individual acquisition \nprojects in the State of New Hampshire that have been supported by this \nincredible fund. In fact, one of my favorite things to do--as we think \nabout the important work that the Land and Water Conservation Fund \ndoes, it is in our forests such as the White Mountain National Forest, \nbut it is also in our cities. I live in Nashua, NH. It is our second \nlargest city. We have Mines Falls Park, which is a real jewel right in \nthe middle of the city. In the mornings, when I am in New Hampshire, my \nfavorite thing to do is get up early and go for a run through these \nparks that are beautiful with forested areas in the middle of the city \nthat so many people in Nashua enjoy every single day, including myself \nand my children. As I am running along, I see so many Granite Staters \nwho are taking a beautiful walk in the morning in the beautiful woods \nin the second largest city in New Hampshire.\n  So as Senator Daines has said, I am very disappointed that we did not \ninclude the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund in \nthe continuing resolution. Within hours, the authorization for LWCF \nexpires, so I believe we should act immediately to reauthorize this \nprogram. We should be permanently reauthorizing this program. That is \nwhat I have supported in legislation so that we are not in this \nposition and in this situation again in the future.\n  It is important to understand that the funds that go to LWCF under \nthe law were supposed to be there from leasing revenues from oil and \ngas leasing that were supposed to be specially dedicated for this \npurpose of giving the American people more access to public lands and \npreserving our natural beauty. Yet, historically, unfortunately, this \nmoney has been diverted, and not all of it has gone to the purpose for \nwhich it was collected, which is a classic Washington move. That is why \nI would like to see the funds go to where they were designated. I would \nlike to see reauthorization of this important program because there is \nbipartisan support for reauthorizing it and for preserving our great \noutdoors for everyone to enjoy.\n  There have been thousands and thousands of acres in New Hampshire \nthat have been preserved and protected for people to be able to use for \nall kinds of outdoor recreation in our State. In New Hampshire, as in \nMontana, the outdoor industry is important to the economy and to who we \nare in the ``live free or die'' State. In fact, if we look at what the \noutdoor recreation industry generates, it is $4.2 billion in consumer \nspending in our State annually, which directly supports 49,000 New \nHampshire jobs. In addition to that, the Outdoor Industry Association \nestimates that at least 76 percent of Granite Staters participate in \noutdoor recreation each year, but that doesn't surprise me. Having been \nborn in New Hampshire, having grown up there, I love our State, and the \ngreat outdoors is such an important part of our State. People in New \nHampshire love to go hiking, fishing, hunting, and use all types of \nrecreation in enjoying the beauty of our great State.\n  Protecting our outdoor spaces is not a partisan issue. We need to \nwork together to ensure the preservation of our environment for future \ngenerations to enjoy. As the mother of a second grader and a fifth \ngrader, a big part of my kids' life too is enjoying the beauty of New \nHampshire. I know that if we reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, not only in New Hampshire but across this country, \nwe will continue to preserve the beauty of our country and the open \nspaces so that everyone can enjoy them and get the exercise and be \nhealthy and enjoy the clean, fresh air they have an opportunity to \nbreathe, as well as our beautiful forests and beautiful lands in this \ncountry.\n  LWCF also has funds granted to the Forest Legacy Program, which has \nhelped conserve New Hampshire's forests, supporting our forest products \nindustry, and aiding wildlife preservation, to make sure we have \nhealthy, working forests, which is so important to our forest industry.\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\n  I call on my colleagues to act immediately to reauthorize this \nessential program, which has helped preserve the beauty of New \nHampshire and our Nation. This is one that I hope, with pending \nlegislation we bring to the floor, we will include a vote on \nreauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Our country is \nbeautiful, and this money was specially designated for this purpose. We \nshould stop diverting it. We should continue to use it for this very \npurpose so that everyone can enjoy the great outdoors and the beauty of \nthe United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Ayotte for her \ngreat comments and for speaking as well about her heritage that has \nbeen passed down in New Hampshire.\n  In this picture, this is not a selfie that was taken with a selfie \nstick. The reason we happened to have this picture is that we had our \nson along. Our son took that picture of my wife Cindy, our dog Ruby, \nand me.\n  These are lands that I hiked in when I was a little boy, when my \nparents introduced me to the public lands of Montana wilderness areas. \nOutdoor heritage is an important part of who we are as Americans, as is \nthe importance of preserving and protecting our clean water and our \nclean air.\n  I know our States' Governors don't want this program to lapse either. \nIn fact, in a letter sent yesterday from the National Governors \nAssociation, they stated that a lapse in authorization would create \nuncertainties for our States.\n  We can still do the right thing. We can still reauthorize this \nimportant program.\n  There was an appropriations bill that was passed which gave us \nfunding at the same level we had from last year, at $306 million. It is \nshort of where I would like to have it, and I know it is short of where \nSenator Ayotte would like to see it funded, but at least we held our \nfunding consistent with where we were at last year.\n  The energy committee, through the Energy Modernization Act, had the \nreauthorization provisions in it. That would permanently reauthorize \nthe program.\n  So there are a lot of options on the table to get this done. We can \nstill do the right thing. We need to double down our efforts and \nreauthorize this most important program. I am a proud cosponsor of the \nmultiple-piece legislation to make the LWCF permanent and the fight to \nreauthorize this program. In fact, I am the only Republican member on \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to cosponsor S. 338, \nSenator Burr's legislation, that will secure a permanent solution for \nLWCF.\n  Permanent reauthorization of LWCF is also included in the Senate \nEnergy Policy Modernization Act that we just talked about. It passed \nthe committee on a large bipartisan vote. In the coming days I think \nthe momentum behind reauthorization is only going to grow stronger. We \nhave that evidenced here today as I am joined by a number of my \ncolleagues who support the LWCF, and we are not going to let this \nconversation die. We are going to continue to fight for the permanent \nreauthorization of LWCF. It is a tool for public access. It is a tool \nto ensure that Montanans and the American people can have access to the \npublic lands.\n  I am hopeful the momentum will lead the House to prioritize \nreauthorization in the near future. It is vital that we permanently \nreauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund and not allow \nreauthorization to lapse. We need to get this reauthorization passed \nand on the President's desk.\n  I see that another supporter of LWCF, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nLamar Alexander, has joined us in this colloquy. I am glad to have \nSenator Alexander here and look forward to his comments on LWCF.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute Senator Daines. Since his \narrival in the Senate, he has been a strong fighter for the great \nAmerican outdoors, which he enjoys so much in the beautiful State of \nMontana.\n  He and I were talking not long ago about his next hunting trip. One \nthing that unites us on both sides of the aisle and unites Americans is \nthe great American outdoors. I often say that Egypt has its pyramids \nand Italy has its art; England has its history and we have the great \nAmerican outdoors.\n  One of the best ideas we have had in the government to support, \nprotect, and conserve the great American outdoors for the benefit of \nall Americans is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It was first \nproposed in the 1960s by the Commission headed by Laurance Rockefeller. \nThe Commission recommended a number of conservation issues. The idea \nwas very simple. It was to say that when we have an environmental \nburden, we should have an environmental benefit. If we are going to \ndrill for oil offshore, for example, that is an environmental burden. \nLet's take some of those revenues and use it for an environmental \nbenefit. So we have, since that time in the 1960s, money for the \nFederal Government and for State and local governments to conserve \nimportant parts of America.\n  I know in our State of Tennessee we celebrated just in the last few \nweeks the final acquisition of the Rocky Fork tract, about 10,000 acres \nin Unicoi and Greene Counties, which was a national priority of the \nForest Service. It provides great opportunities for Tennesseans to go \nhiking, to go hunting, and to go fishing. Those are the kinds of things \nwe like to do in our State. We don't have a lot of protected land like \nthey do in the Western States, and this was something the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund helped us to do.\n  In the 1980s President Reagan asked me to chair the President's \nCommission on Americans Outdoors. I worked with Gil Grosvenor, Chairman \nof the National Geographic Society; Patrick Noonan, the founder of The \nConservation Fund; and others. Our recommendation included full funding \nof the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and continuing to tie it to \nsome of the proceeds from offshore oil drilling.\n  In the Energy bill 9 years ago, when Senator Domenici was chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we actually made mandatory \na little bit of funding from the offshore drilling in the Gulf of \nMexico into the State side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nBut, we need to recognize the broad support for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, pass Senator Burr's bill, the Senator from North \nCarolina who has fought tirelessly to permanently reauthorize the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, and then we need to appropriate $900 \nmillion for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and gradually set \naside those special areas of our country that deserve to be protected.\n  I am here to say that even though it expires today, I am very hopeful \nwe can take some action very quickly to extend it at least temporarily \nand that soon we will have a chance to do what Senator Burr and Senator \nDaines proposed and something I proposed--and have supported during my \nentire adult life.\n  I see the Senator from Maine. I know of her interest in conservation \nand the outdoors. We need to get this done. The American people expect \nus to do it, and I fully support it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAINES. I want to thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \nleadership and unwavering commitment to the LWCF through the many \nyears.\n  We are also joined by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins. Senator \nCollins comes from the beautiful State of Maine and shares a passion \nfor the outdoors. I am grateful to have Senator Collins speak on behalf \nof the LWCF.\n  Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is such a pleasure to join my colleagues in supporting legislation \nthat would provide a short-term extension for the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, and I think you can see by the breadth of the number \nof Senators on the floor on the Republican side of the aisle supporting \nthis extension that this program has widespread support from Montana to \nNorth Carolina, to Tennessee, to New Hampshire, to the great State of \nMaine. All of us have come together to urge the Senate not to allow \nthis important conservation and recreational program to expire.\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\n  It was 50 years ago that the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act \nestablished America's most successful conservation and recreation \nprogram. The fund was designed to assure that outdoor recreation lands \nwould be secured on a pay-as-you-go basis for future generations. As we \nmark this anniversary, it is inconceivable to me that we would allow \nthis successful and valuable program to expire.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is arguably our most important \nand successful program of this type. There is nothing else like it, and \nit has widespread bipartisan support. While the funding for this \nprogram could continue to be appropriated beyond the September 30 \nexpiration date, the authority to collect new revenue into the fund \nwould expire. So we must act quickly today to reauthorize the LWCF so \nwe do not lose the important connection between the funding stores for \nthis conservation program and the program itself.\n  Investments in this landmark conservation program expand assets to \nthe outdoors to all Americans. We are living in a time where so many \nchildren and so many teenagers are spending all of their time inside \nbefore computer screens and tablets and iPhones. This is the program \nthat helps ensure that they have access to recreational activities \noutside--the great American outdoors. The Land and Water Conservation \nFund has created numerous outdoor recreational opportunities in every \nsingle State in the Nation and 98 percent of the counties across our \ngreat country. It is funding that will open key areas for hunting, \nfishing, and other recreational access to support our working forests \nand ranches, to acquire inholdings and protect critical lands in \nnational parks, national wildlife refuges, national forests, Civil War \nbattlefields, and other Federal areas that are so special to our \nheritage, and to support State and local projects from ball parks to \nrecreational trails.\n  If you have a bike trail, a ball park or a hiking path in your \ncommunity, it may well have been constructed with funds from the Land \nand Water Conservation Program. I support the permanent reauthorization \nof the program that has been introduced by Senator Burr and believe \nthat Congress has an obligation to make good on the promise that was \nmade to the American people back in 1964 to take the proceeds from \nnatural resource development and invest a portion in conservation and \noutdoor recreation.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has favorably \nreported a bipartisan bill that would permanently extend the program. A \nshort-term extension is needed now to provide the time over the next \nfew weeks for us to work together to achieve that permanent \nauthorization and consistent funding for this program and to help \nensure that the fund plays the strongest possible role in helping to \nrevitalize local communities for another 50 years.\n  I remain committed to working with Senator Daines, Senator Burr, and \nthe other leaders in this area, along with the bipartisan coalition \nthat truly spans the country to support creating a more stable long-\nterm plan for the LWCF that allows landowners, States, local \ncommunities, and conservation partners to plan for the future \nrecreational and conservation opportunities for our country. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support this 60-day extension.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. Again, I thank the Senator from Montana for \norganizing this colloquy and the Senator from North Carolina for his \nleadership in this area.\n  Mr. DAINES. I thank the Senator from Maine for those great remarks.\n  It is important to get our young people outside--outdoors. In fact, \nthis picture was taken about 5 weeks ago by my son with his smartphone. \nThe good news is that the smartphone wasn't working because it was so \nfar away from cell phone towers, but the camera did work, so he took \nthe picture.\n  It is important to get out and pass it on to the next generation to \nget our children out on the public lands. The LWCF has an important \nrole in ensuring that access and preserving it for generations to come.\n  We heard from the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte; from the \nSenator from Tennessee, Mr. Alexander; and the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins. I spoke from Montana. You can see the geographic diversity \nacross our entire country to support this program.\n  It is only fitting that the Senator from North Carolina is here now, \nMr. Burr. He has been the leader in permanent reauthorization for LWCF. \nThat is why both Senator Collins and I are proud cosponsors of S. 338, \nwhich would permanently reauthorize the LWCF. I thank the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, Mr. Burr, for his leadership and what he is doing to \nremove this uncertainty we have today in the LWCF and get it \npermanently reauthorized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daines and my colleagues who \nhave come to the floor and spoken.\n  It was my intention to come and ask unanimous consent for the Senate \nto consider a 60-day extension of the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nin terms of its configuration. I will not be doing that. I think we are \nmaking progress toward unanimous consent in the Senate, which is the \nbest way to get things done. So I will refrain from asking for that UC \nat this time.\n  If we don't act now, this program which has been successful for over \n50 years will expire today--tonight at midnight. This program has \ndelivered on its promise to conserve and enhance our natural landscape.\n  LWCF was set up for three reasons; No. 1, to protect areas within our \nnational parks' and national forests' existing boundaries. Let me \nemphasize that--the existing boundaries. There are some who claim the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund is only to create new national parks \nor to expand our current national parks. In many cases we have in-\nparcels that have been owned by individuals and we have waited for \ngenerational change for the opportunity to complete that footprint of \nour historic treasures. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is that \nseed money to go in and match it with private dollars to get that in-\nparcel and buy it from a generation that also believes it should be \nprotected.\n  No. 2, it provides the buffers for national trails and parkways, \nwildlife refuges and military battlefield parks--and I would also add \nmilitary bases, such as Fort Bragg.\n  Fort Bragg--I call it the ``Pentagon of the Army''--in Fayetteville, \nNC, actually received conservation awards for the last several years \nfor how they have treated the buffer zone around active military bases. \nEverybody is in conservation to some degree. It also was designed to \nprovide matching grants to States and local governments for working \nforests, State and local parks, as well as recreation projects, what \nSenator Collins talked about.\n  A lot of my colleagues on the other side of the Capitol have said: We \ndon't want to reauthorize this because it does not do anything. This \nought to all go to State and local. Boy, I don't know how to do it any \nfairer than to let those who are really involved in conservation every \nday decide where the most valuable leverage of those dollars can go. As \nyou notice, I am tongue-twisted because we always have a tendency here \nto say Federal dollars. These are not Federal dollars. These are \ndollars that were designed as royalties of the exploration of the Outer \nContinental Shelf. They should come to about $900 million a year. But \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, when they go through this \ngauntlet of appropriations in Washington, seems to only get somewhere \nbetween $300 and $400 million a year.\n  On a continual basis, they have been cheated from what the American \npeople embraced and said: We want you to have this. Imagine, what they \ncould have done if they had the money. But that gets thrown into the \ngeneral fund and dissipates. Some have said: You don't need to \nreauthorize this today. There is $20 billion in the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. No, I hate to tell you, America. It is sort of like \nSocial Security. We have used that money for something else. There is \nan IOU in there, but it has been designated for general funding \nreasons.\n  So, it is important that we not decouple the funding mechanism, which \nis the royalty, from the authorized program. Now, some have said: This \nis a land grab. Let me suggest to my colleagues that this is a land \nsolution. This is actually one of the Federal Government programs that \nI can honestly say works. LWCF has supported\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\n41,000 projects across the country in its life.\n  In my State alone, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has protected \nover 900 sites, from the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge to \nMount Mitchell State Park, the Blue Ridge Parkway, the Pisgah National \nForest. In North Carolina, outdoor recreation contributes $7.5 billion \nto our State's economy and supports 95,000 jobs. This is not just about \nconservation. It is about the economy.\n  It is hard for me to say to somebody from the West that the most \nvisited national park in America is the Great Smokies, in Tennessee and \nNorth Carolina, where most Americans would think it is out where you \nare. The most traveled national treasure, the Blue Ridge Parkway, is \nthe entry point to North Carolinas from Virginia. More Americans travel \nthat road than any road in our Federal park system.\n  Now, let me just suggest that Senator Daines is not the only one that \nhas pictures. This is from the Pisgah National Forest, where we have \nmany spectacular sites. But without the LWCF, we would not have \nprotected this piece--an unbelievable environmental component. Now, \nthey get better. This is a recent one--Catawba Falls. It is an LWCF \nsuccess story. It was acquired in 2010 through LWCF money. It made this \nfall open to the public. So for my detractors who say LWCF shuts it \ndown, it becomes part of the Federal Government, and nobody can use it, \nno, LWCF's mission is to open up treasures such as this for the use of \nthe American people.\n  In the case that we put it to States, hopefully States convert that \nto access for hunters and to recreational use. As to the last one, I \ndon't think Senator Daines has one that looks like this--Chimney Rock. \nHow do you not protect something like this? Chimney Rock is in North \nCarolina. The site is a good example of a project that will be \nsuspended if LWCF is not renewed. It is probably one of North \nCarolina's most loved monuments, but expansion of the site will halt \neventually if LWCF does not receive support.\n  You see, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is dollar-for-dollar \nthe most effective government program that has ever existed. It is hard \nfor me to believe, with as much support on both sides of the aisle as \nthis fund has, that it would be so difficult to get a unanimous consent \nrequest. But I am committed to work with my colleagues who still have \nreservations for some reasons to try to work through those reservations \nand then to shorten our differences with our brethren on the House side \nwho might not see this in the same light as I do.\n  But I think when most Americans see a picture like this, they see \nsomething to save, something to protect, something that is enjoyed not \nby Federal bureaucrats but by average folks who travel there over the \nBlue Ridge Parkway and end up at Chimney Rock, who go on the Blue Ridge \nParkway and end up at the Great Smokies. They were not acquired because \nof the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but they are protected, in \nmany ways, because of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let's have a unanimous consent request. \nLet's pass this and send it to the House, and let's at some point in \nthe not-too-distant future talk about a permanent reauthorization of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. This should not be an exercise \nthat we have every predetermined number of years. It should last as \nlong as the revenue source, which is our ability to explore our natural \nresources. Those natural resources fund the preservation of these \nhistoric and significant landmarks of America.\n  I thank the Senator for his time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAINES. I want to thank the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr. I thank you for your leadership on the LWCF. Senator Burr has \nbeen truly out in front, working first to get the temporary \nreauthorization here as a bridge until we get the permanent \nreauthorization. I appreciate the comments. See, this is not about a \nland grab. This is about a land solution, as Senator Burr said. It \nallows us, in many cases, to provide access to public lands that we \ncurrently do not have access to because they might be landlocked \nthrough private holdings.\n  So thank you, Senator Burr. In conclusion, I am hopeful that the \nmomentum that we are seeing here in the Senate will lead the House to \nprioritize the LWCF reauthorization in the near future. It is vital \nthat we permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nand do not allow authorization to lapse. We have less than 11 hours and \nthis program will lapse. We need to get reauthorization passed, and get \nit on the President's desk, and get this signed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I wish to join several Senators who have \ncome to the floor to talk about the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I \nknow Senator Burr and Senator Daines have spoken, and I think there \nwere several others who spoke about this very worthwhile program that \nhas been on the books for a very long time. I come to the floor to say \nI support their effort. I support the idea that we should be able to \nget a unanimous consent request so that we can extend the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  I thought I would talk first a little bit about the history because \nmy father, Stewart Udall, was one of the people who actually worked \nwith Congress to create the Land and Water Conservation Fund in the \n1960s. He worked with Wilbur Mills in the House of Representatives and \na number of other Members of Congress. The idea at the time was, here \nwe had this resource--offshore oil--and we were taking a resource that \nwas irreplaceable--the idea that once you use it, it is gone--and we \nwere saying: Why don't we dedicate some of those resources to the \npermanent protection of land, of parks, for the American people? So \nthat was the idea behind it, and it was endorsed by a nationwide \ncommission of very distinguished Americans who said: We aren't keeping \nup with the amount of parks and other public lands that our growing \npopulation needs. We all knew that the American people loved their \nparks, and the same is true today.\n  So this outdoor commission recommended something along this line of, \nhow do we make sure we are able to create these great national parks \nand create parks at the State and the city level? So the fund was \ndesigned in such a way that there was a State-fund side of the program, \nand on the State-fund side of the program, you could take dollars that \nwere dedicated to the State program, which would be Federal dollars, \nand match them at the State and local level and create a Federal park. \nSo in most of your communities today, if you drive around and you see a \nbeautiful park, if you go and look at the plaque, most of the time that \nplaque will say: Done in cooperation with the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  What local people have told me many times is that in the planning \nthey do to try to create a new park--they have an area that is growing \nor they have a housing development that has gone in--they say: How do \nwe get the money? Well, if they know there is going to be a Federal \nmatch and they are able to get the Federal money, they can do the \nplanning. They can go to their local taxpayers, raise some funds, and \nthen pool the money together and get a city park or a State park, that \nkind of thing.\n  As everybody knows well, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nfunded Federal purchases of land, from our national parks, to national \nwildlife refuges, to many other public lands. For example, in my home \nState of New Mexico, we have 14 national parks. We have a brandnew \nnational park that was just put into place within the last year called \nthe Valles Caldera National Preserve, which is one of the newest parks \nin the country. Here you have about 89,000 acres which is a collapsed \nvolcano that has been used in many different ways in the past but now \nis available for hunting, fishing, camping, and all sorts of outdoor \nrecreation. So this is something the people of New Mexico know.\n  I think the crucial point to make here is the economic one. We don't \nhave any doubt that investments in parks, wildlife refuges, and other \nFederal lands create many jobs outside those parks. They create jobs in \nthe gateway communities, but they also create jobs in the outdoor \nindustry. We have seen, with two new national\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\nmonuments that were just created in New Mexico, big economic growth 6 \nmonths and a year after the creation of those monuments. So this is \nabout the economic integrity of our communities.\n  In less than 11 hours right now on the clock, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund could expire. It has been in place for decades, and \nwe could let it expire because of the gridlock here. Well, we aren't \ngoing to do that. And why aren't we going to do that? Because we have \nMembers on both sides of the aisle who care about this.\n  I would like to say a word about Senator Burr. I have worked with him \nvery well. He is a member of the International Conservation Caucus in \nthe Senate, and he has taken a real interest in conservation around the \nworld and has been a real leader. Senator Burr has been out front on \nthis land and water conservation issue. He has led a letter to various \nofficials that 53 Senators signed that said: We want the Land and Water \nConservation Fund reauthorized before it expires. He has shown real \nleadership to make sure that as we approach this deadline, this doesn't \nhappen.\n  Senator Burr was on the floor just a few minutes ago. I want to say \nto him and the other Senators who worked with him that I think it is \nvery important that we continue to work in these last 11 hours to make \nsure the Land and Water Conservation Fund is continued. Obviously, what \nwe are trying to do right now is a 60-day period, but, as Senator Burr \nmentioned, the important thing is permanent reauthorization of the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund. Then the big task we need to get these \nPresidential candidates to face is we have to have the funding for it. \nIt always had a funding level that was reasonable and rational and \nsupported, but unfortunately we don't ever meet the funding level. The \nmoney is there. The money is in the fund. It comes out every year from \nthe offshore oil resources into the fund; it is just taken for other \npurposes. So we have to make sure we get a permanent Land and Water \nConservation Fund reauthorization and the funds in that are going to \nreally make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I see my good friend Senator Casey from Pennsylvania. \nI know he is waiting in line, and I am sure you are going to hear some \nwise words from him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the American people have gotten used to \nhearing bad news about their health care ever since the Democrats \npassed ObamaCare. It seems that each and every day there is another \nheadline about another way that the health care law is hurting people. \nLast Wednesday there was a remarkable amount of bad news in just 1 day. \nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, September 23, had this headline: \n``Health Insurers Defend Deals.''\n  If you flip the page over, the bottom half of that page has ``Cost of \na family health plan tops $17,000'' with a chart of rising costs. The \nannual cost of an employer family health coverage, the portion paid by \nworkers, continues to go up--1 day, one page. The top article is about \na wave of health insurance company mergers which we have been seeing \nrecently.\n  Now, the President said that his health care law would actually \nincrease competition among insurance companies. But just like a lot of \nthe other predictions that President Obama made, this one has not come \ntrue. You know, back in June, the insurance company Aetna announced \nplans to buy Humana. Then the company Anthem decided to buy Cigna.\n  Now, if these mergers are approved and continue to go through, it \nmeans that the five largest insurance companies in the United States \nwill now be down to three. The President said there would be more \ncompetition. Well, Americans are about to have much less competition. \nIt is not only because of the giant insurance company mergers. You \nknow, ObamaCare also set up health co-ops in 24 States. Now, these co-\nops were supposed to add competition to help keep prices down.\n  Taxpayers put up almost $2.5 billion to help these companies get \nstarted. Over the past few months, what has happened? These co-ops have \nbeen dropping like flies. Just the other day, regulators in New York \nshut down the largest ObamaCare co-op in the country. Why? Because it \nlost so much money. Now 215,000 New Yorkers have fewer options for \nwhere they can go to buy Washington-mandated insurance. This is the \nfourth co-op to fail in the past few months. Another one failed right \nbefore it. It had not even enrolled a single person. Think of that: \nGovernment loans set up a co-op that doesn't enroll anyone and closes \nshop. There is only one co-op of the original 24 that is actually \nmaking any money so it can stay in business.\n  Look, the American people know they are not getting the increased \ncompetition the President has promised. They also know they are not \ngetting the lower prices the President has promised.\n  Another article came out last Wednesday that talked about how much \nmore Americans are paying for their health care. This was a September \n23 New York Times headline: ``Health insurance deductibles rising \nfaster than wages.'' ``Health insurance deductibles rising faster than \nwages.'' Here it is--unaffordable care. This is from 2010 to 2015. \nWages are up 10 percent, premiums up 24 percent, deductibles up 67 \npercent. The article describes a recent study by the Kaiser Family \nFoundation. According to Kaiser, health insurance premiums for a single \nperson have gone up more than twice as fast as people's earnings since \nObamaCare became law.\n  We are talking about all of the people that get their health \ninsurance through work, which is about 150 million Americans. This is \nnot just a small group of people. This is all of the people that get \ntheir insurance through work. Deductibles have gone up almost seven \ntimes as much as earnings. It is an enormous hit to the finances of \nAmerican families. The article talked about how these high deductibles \nare hurting a woman named Beth Landrum. She is 52. She is a teacher.\n  The articles says that about 2 years ago, ``Beth saw the deductible \non her family's plan increase to $3,300 a year.'' She is a teacher. She \nis 52--$3,300 a year for the deductible under Obama's health care law.\n  So a couple years ago was when a lot of these ObamaCare mandates were \nreally starting to bite. The woman survived a brain tumor 10 years ago. \nSo here she is. She has insurance. She had a brain tumor 10 years ago, \nsuccessfully treated, but she is putting off having the MRI that has \nbeen recommended by her doctor. She says: ``My doctor's mad at me \nbecause I haven't had the MRI.''\n  They want to see if there is any recurrence of the tumor. She said \nthat she and her husband need to save up money to pay for the test, to \npay for the deductible--the $3,300 deductible. She has health insurance \nunder ObamaCare, and she can no longer afford to get care--coverage \nwithout care. The President continues to ignore this fact about his \nunaffordable health care law. You cannot afford to get care, not under \nObamaCare.\n  Now, President Obama promised that people would save $2,500 per \nfamily per year under the health care law. But average premiums are up \nnearly $4,000 since the law passed. Does the President really believe \nit is affordable? The new study by Kaiser only looked at insurance that \npeople get, as I say, through their jobs. It did not look at the \ndeductibles people are paying when they buy their own insurance through \nthe ObamaCare exchanges.\n  President Obama said that these plans would be cheaper than a cell \nphone bill. That is what he said--cheaper than a cell phone--easier to \nuse than Amazon for shopping on the web and cheaper than a cell phone. \nWell, let's take a look at the article in the New York Times. That is \nnot how it has worked out for Rebecca Bullard.\n  Now, Rebecca is 27. She purchased her plan through her State exchange \nfor $129 a month. To get that plan, she had to accept a deductible of \n$6,000. But she has ObamaCare. Oh yeah, the President can say: I did \nher a favor--a $6,000 deductible.\n\n  The article says that when she was worried that she had a cracked \nrib--do you know how she chose to take care of it? She chose to ask \nfriends on social media about what to do rather than go to a doctor \nbecause of the ObamaCare that was actually not worth very much to her. \nThat is how concerned she was\n\n[[Page S7028]]\n\nabout paying the out-of-pocket costs that ObamaCare brought her. She \nsaid, ``Now I don't even want to go to the doctor.''\n  Is that what the President promised the American people--deductibles \nso high that people don't even want to go to their doctor?\n  People may have coverage, but they cannot afford care. It is \nunaffordable under the President's plan and mandates. People are paying \nmore and they are getting less. So it is not surprising that this \nadministration is starting to worry. They have to figure out how to \nconvince people that it is worth signing up for this outrageously \nexpensive ObamaCare insurance. That is what the Wall Street Journal \nsaid in another article on September 23. There is a picture of the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell. There is a \npicture of her right here on this page. It says: ``Insuring More People \nSeen as Tough.'' According to this article, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services says that ``this open enrollment is going to be tougher \nthan last year.''\n  We know it is going to be tough for families who are getting hit with \nhigher premiums and other costs. Now, the Obama administration isn't \nworried about these people; what the Obama administration is now \nworried about is how tough it is going to be to sign up enough \ncustomers for this awful law. You know, by now they were supposed to \nhave 21 million people signed up for ObamaCare by next year. Right now \nthey have fewer than 10 million. They are not even halfway to where \nthey need to be and where they said they would be. What this means is \nif they don't get more young, healthy customers to sign up, this whole \nsystem is likely to collapse. That is why the Obama administration is \nworried. They are worried about the impacts of their ability to sustain \nthis law.\n  There is a reason that people haven't signed up. The people who \nhaven't signed up yet know this insurance is not a good deal for them. \nIt is not good for them personally; it is not worth it. About half of \nthe people who still don't have insurance have less than $100 in \nsavings. How is someone with less than $100 in savings supposed to pay \na $6,000 deductible?\n  Why won't the President answer these questions? Why won't the \nDemocrats come to this floor and answer these questions? I haven't seen \na Democrat come to address these issues or any of these headlines.\n  Look, President Obama promised the American people that his health \ncare law would produce lower costs and produce more choice. Instead, he \nhas given people fewer choices, more powerful insurance companies, \nhigher deductibles, and higher premiums.\n  We have had too many of these alarming headlines--and that is in just \n1 day alone--and too much bad news about ObamaCare. The American people \nget it. It is a bad deal for them personally.\n  President Obama is a lameduck. He forced a terrible program through \nCongress. It is time for Democrats in Congress to sit down with \nRepublicans and start talking about the kinds of health care reforms \nthat the American people need, that the American people want, and that \nthe American people deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Federal Perkins Loan Program\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the Perkins \nLoan Program, which we spent some time on yesterday and over the last \ncouple of weeks. Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin, who is with us now on \nthe floor, has worked so hard on this, as have many others. We have \nmore than a quarter of the Senate working together to try and get an \nextension of the Perkins Loan Program.\n  Many Americans are familiar with this program. It is one of the best \nways to guarantee access to higher education for young people across \nthe country. We have always said, and I have always said--and we will \nsay it again--if young people can learn more now, they will earn more \nlater. It is not just a rhyme. There is a direct connection between \nlearning and earning in the context of early education as well as \nhigher education.\n  We need to make sure all students, regardless of their income or the \ncircumstances of their birth, have a fair shot to go to college and \nhave the opportunity to reach their full potential. Perkins allows \nthose students to do just that. These are fixed-rate, low-interest \nloans meant for students with exceptional financial needs. Because \nthese loans are part of a revolving fund, as one student pays them off, \nanother student can use the dollars to receive a loan.\n  By way of example in one State, in Pennsylvania, in the academic year \n2013-2014, some 40,000 students at some 100 colleges and universities \nwere able to go to school because of these loans. That 40,000 student \nnumber in Pennsylvania is a much bigger number nationwide, of course--\nalmost 540,000. The actual number is 539,000 students.\n  So for many students this is the choice between going to college and \nnot going at all. It is that stark. For example, the Coalition of \nHigher Education Assistance Organizations tells us that one quarter of \nall loan recipients are from families with incomes less than $30,000 a \nyear. Unfortunately, because of inaction here in the Congress, these \nstudents will be left high and dry if we don't take action.\n  I shared a story yesterday of Nikki Ezzolo, who is going to school \nand is a recent graduate of Edinboro University in Northwestern \nPennsylvania. I mentioned yesterday also Kayla McBride--she is from \nTemple--and I will refer back to her story in a moment. But when we \nconsider Nikki's story or Kayla's or so many other young people in \nPennsylvania or across the country, we have to focus on what our \npriorities are here in the Senate.\n  We do have a bipartisan opportunity here. Democrats and Republicans \nare coming together to extend the Perkins Loan Program. By way of \nexample, when you consider those students in Pennsylvania, here is what \nit breaks down to when you go institution by institution. This will not \nbe a full recitation of all the institutions in Pennsylvania, but here \nare a few. In Pennsylvania, this is what this program could mean for \nindividual students and schools: At Temple University, 6,200-some \nstudents; at Penn State, 3,100; at the University of Pittsburgh, 2,800; \nand at West Chester University, 1,000. So those are the kind of numbers \njust to give a few examples of the impact.\n  We know Perkins has been part of our law and part of the life of our \ncolleges and universities for decades. Some 30 million Americans have \nbenefited. We have to consider what this means for those students, what \nthis means for our States and, of course, what it means for the rest of \nthe country.\n  I know we are going to be having more of a discussion here and \noffering a consent request, so at this time I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, while it appears we will avert a \ngovernment shutdown, another serious deadline with serious consequences \nlooms over this body. Tonight, unless the Senate acts by midnight, the \nFederal Perkins Loan Program will expire, impacting the education of \nover one-half million students across America. I am here now to call on \nall of my colleagues to join me in supporting the extension of this \ncritical investment in our Nation's students.\n  I am not alone in my desire to see us take action instead of creating \nwhat I would consider another manufactured crisis--a crisis of our own \nmaking. In fact, we have already seen strong bipartisan support for \nthis investment in our future. Senators Portman, Collins, Kirk, Ayotte, \nand Thune have joined with more than 20 Senate Democrats on a \nresolution urging the continuation of the Federal Perkins Loan Program \nsupporting low-income students in their pursuit of a higher education.\n  Yesterday Senators Collins, Portman, and Ayotte joined me and Senator \nCasey and Senator Murray here on the Senate floor in support of saving \nthis program. I am pleased the junior Senator from New Hampshire and \nSenator Casey are here with me now, once again calling to protect this \nincredibly important investment.\n\n[[Page S7029]]\n\n  On Monday, our colleagues in the House of Representatives unanimously \npassed a measure that would extend this student loan program for 1 \nyear, and I am here to call on my colleagues in the Senate to do the \nsame.\n  While I look forward to a much broader conversation about improving \nFederal support for students as we look to reauthorize the Higher \nEducation Act, we can't sit idly by and watch it expire as America's \nstudents are left with such uncertainty.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3594\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3594, which is at the \ndesk; that the bill be read a third time and passed and the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Reserving the right to object, rather than making a \nstatement, I hope it will be suitable to the Senator from Wisconsin for \nme to make my explanation of why I am objecting after I object. And I \nwill object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the goal here is to help students. The \ngoal here is to find ways to help college students find easier ways to \napply to a college and to avoid overborrowing. The goal would be to \ngive them a year-round Pell grant. The goal would be to simplify the \napplication form they have to complete. The goal would be to keep the \ninterest rates as low as we can. The goal would be to make it easier to \nrepay student loans. That is our goal.\n  Our education committee, in which the Senator from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania are very valuable members, is completing work \non the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act with just those \ngoals. We have had eight hearings. We are considering a number of \nbipartisan proposals to, as I said, simplify the grants and loans for \ncollege, to provide for year-round Pell Grants, to make it easier to \nrepay student loans and to discourage overborrowing, which is weighing \ndown these students.\n  One of the most important of those proposals, which was recommended \nto us by witnesses, is that we should simplify the process so there is \none grant and one loan. That would be a Pell grant and a loan. In the \nlast reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 2008, Congress \nagreed to sunset the Perkins Loan Program, and that is what is \nhappening now. I support sunsetting this program, although students who \ncurrently receive a Perkins loan would continue to do so.\n  As I said, our committee is hopefully finishing by the end of the \nyear our work on reviewing our student loan programs, including Perkins \nloans. The Perkins loan has a higher interest rate than other \nundergraduate loans. It does not give students the advantage of \nparticipating in income-based repayment programs--this is available in \nthe law for all students receiving Direct Loans which are not affected \nby this discussion--which allow students to pay back their student \nloans at no more than 10 to 15 percent of their disposable income every \nyear, and if after 20 to 25 years it is not repaid, it is forgiven. You \ncan't get that with a Perkins loan.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, reauthorizing the \nPerkins loan will cost nearly $5 billion over 10 years. Many witnesses \nbefore our committee have said that $5 billion would be better spent \npaying for more Pell grants, which will be necessary for simplifying \nthe student aid application, from authorizing a year-round Pell grant \nand from simplifying the repayment process.\n  So the question is, Do you spend the $5 billion for that or do you \nspend it for a program with a higher interest rate and without an \nincome based repayment program, and which many of our witnesses said it \nis time for this program to expire? I am one of a bipartisan group of \nSenators who propose we replace the Perkins Loan program with student \nloans that are simpler, have a lower interest rate and more generous \nrepayment opportunities.\n  We will finish our review of higher education by the end of the year. \nIt will be ready for the full Senate. We can look at all the various \nloan programs. We loan more than $100 billion a year. The Perkins Loan \nprogram is a very small part of that. All those other loan programs are \nstill available at a lower rate with a better income based repayment \nprogram. In the meantime, as I said, students who currently have \nPerkins loans will continue to have them while we continue our work.\n  So our goal is to simplify the system, make it easier for students to \napply for grants and loans, allow them to have year-round Pell grants, \nallow them to not overborrow so much, and to allow them to repay their \nloans back easier. The Perkins loan is not as effective a loan in \nmeeting those goals as the other loans that we have.\n  So I object at least until we have a chance to further continue our \nreview in the Senate education committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that my offer to \nextend the Federal Perkins Loan Program was just blocked by my \nRepublican colleague from Tennessee. While I understand and, frankly, I \nshare his desire to have a broader conversation about Federal student \naid as part of the Higher Education Act's reauthorization effort, I do \nnot think it is right or fair to end this program today with nothing to \nreplace it to the detriment of thousands of students in need.\n  I want to mention briefly the issue of the cost of its \nreauthorization because when the decision was made to sunset the \nprogram, a clawback provision was included that basically collects the \nloan funds back from the institutions that loan it out. It is actually \na revolving fund--which I will return to later--which makes it such a \nfiscally responsible loan program.\n\n  When I travel around my home State of Wisconsin, one of the things I \nhear the most about these days from my constituents is their \nfrustration that Congress isn't doing enough to make higher education \nmore affordable and more accessible. Yet, today, the fact that we just \nsaw a single Senator stand up and reject a bipartisan and commonsense \nmeasure to do just that is, frankly, a perfect example of why my \nconstituents and the American people are so upset with Washington.\n  Since 1958 the Federal Perkins Loan Program has been successful in \nhelping Americans access affordable higher education with low-interest \nloans for students who cannot borrow or afford more expensive private \nstudent loans. In Wisconsin, the program provides more than 20,000 low-\nincome students with more than $41 million in aid. But the impacts of \nthis program aren't just isolated to the Badger State. In fact, the \nFederal Perkins Loan Program aids over half a million students with \nfinancial need each year, and it does that across 1,500 institutions of \nhigher education.\n  Schools originate, service, and collect the fixed-interest-rate \nloans. And what is more, institutions maintain loans available for \nfuture students because it is managed within a revolving fund. Since \nthe program's creation, institutions have invested millions of their \nown dollars, their own funds, into the program. And in addition to \nmaking higher education accessible for low-income students, the program \nserves as an incentive for people who wish to go into public service by \noffering targeted loan cancellations for specific professions in areas \nof national need, such as teaching, nursing, and law enforcement.\n  As a Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee and as a Senator representing a State with such a rich \nhistory of higher education, it is one of my top priorities to fight to \nensure that the Federal Perkins Loan Program continues for generations \nto come. But, unfortunately, as we just saw, a single Senator stood up \ntoday and said no to students across America who ask for nothing more \nthan an opportunity to pursue their dreams--students such as Benjamin \nWooten, a 2004 UW-Madison graduate and small business owner from Genoa \nCity. His family fell on really hard times when he was attending \nschool. Ben told me:\n\n       The fact that I didn't have to pay interest while I was in \n     school was a huge help to me.\n       I was attending school full time, working and trying to \n     live on a meager budget. . . . I am a grateful and successful \n     small business owner.\n\n[[Page S7030]]\n\n       I paid my loan off in full about a year ago with pride and \n     excitement.\n       I know that when I repaid my loan it was returned to a \n     revolving fund and will be lent back out to other students in \n     need.\n\n  Today this body has stood up and said no to students such as Brittany \nMcAdams, a medical school student with a passion for pediatrics and a \npassion for helping the most vulnerable among us--something that \ndoesn't always yield a significant paycheck. Brittany said to me:\n\n       I want to be able to treat patients from all socioeconomic \n     levels, despite their ability to pay.\n       In other words, I want to do important work for less money \n     than most other physicians. . . . The Perkins Loan is so \n     valuable because it does not collect interest while we are in \n     school.\n       To me, that says the government believes that what I am \n     doing with my life is important.\n       That our country needs more doctors willing to tackle \n     primary care.\n       That while we need to pay for our graduate degrees, that \n     they are going to do their part to make it just a bit easier.\n       The Perkins Loan makes me feel valued and respected and \n     even more passionate about my work.\n\n  Finally, I am disappointed that, because of this body's inaction here \ntoday, we are letting down students such as Nayeli Spahr. Nayeli was \nraised by a single immigrant mother who worked two full-time jobs. She \nattended ten different schools in three different States before she \nfinished high school. Without the Federal Perkins Loan Program, Nayeli \nsaid her opportunity to get a college education would have been ``an \nillusionary dream.'' Today Nayeli is the first in her family to finish \ncollege and is now in her last year of medical school and is planning \nto work with those in underserved urban communities. She finished by \ntelling me:\n\n       The Perkins loan program helped me reach this point.\n       And, its existence is essential to provide that opportunity \n     for other young adults wanting to believe in themselves and \n     to empower their communities to be better.\n       Please save it!\n\n  We don't have to look very far to find the very significant impact \nthis investment has on American students. There are thousands of \nstories like the few I just shared, representing thousands of students \nwho are still benefiting from the opportunities provided to them by \nthis hugely successful program.\n  I am disappointed that the bipartisan effort I have led has been \nobstructed. I will continue to fight to extend this support for \nAmerica's students, and I hope the senior Senator from Tennessee will \nchange his mind so we can find a way to show the half million students \nwho depend on the Federal Perkins Loans that we stand with them and are \ncommitted to helping them build a stronger future for themselves and \nour country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come today to the floor first to thank \nthe Senator from Tennessee for taking my call last night as we \ndiscussed his objection to extending this, which, from my standpoint, \nfor the many reasons my college from Wisconsin stated, I think is a \nreasonable proposal to extend the Perkins Loan Program for a 1-year \ntime period. But I certainly understand some of the concerns my \ncolleague from Tennessee has with this particular loan program--and, \nquite honestly, all the loan programs--often in terms of the \naffordability of college loans.\n  But as the Senator from Tennessee stated, we share the same goal \nhere. Everyone in this body really does want every American to have the \nopportunity to get a good education, to get the tools so they can lead \na productive life and build a good life for themselves and their \nfamilies. That is a goal we all share, and we understand the importance \nof education and the affordability of it--making it accessible to every \nAmerican. But that is the point I want to make here.\n  We held a pretty interesting hearing in our Senate Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and we really took a look \nat these student loan programs and the potential effect on the \naffordability of college. In testimony today, we certainly found out \nthat the student loan program has exploded over the last 20 years, from \na level of about $100 billion in 1994 to now $1.3 trillion. On average, \nstudents graduating with a 4-year degree are about $29,000 in debt. \nThat is a concern. One of the reasons we are concerned about \naffordability is that the cost of college--again, in testimony--has \nincreased somewhere between 2.5 and 2.8 times the rate of inflation \nover the last few number of decades. I think it is a legitimate \nquestion to ask: Why? What is so different about what colleges and \nuniversities spend their money on that the cost would increase 2.5 to \n2.8 times the rate of inflation?\n  We had some explanation provided to our committee today, and it does \ninvolve Federal Government involvement, for example, in the \naccreditation process. We had one witness state that the supply of \ncolleges since the mid-1970s has increased about 14 percent, and yet, \nbecause we want to have more access for college, the demand for college \neducation has increased 111 percent. Part of the problem, in terms of \nthe increasing cost of college, is the fact that we are creating \nbarriers to entry through the accreditation process. So I think we have \nto take a very serious look at that.\n  Another thing that was quite troubling during our hearing is that \nthere have been a number of studies, including one from the Federal \nReserve Bank in New York, one from Northeastern University, that show \nthat 40 to 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed \nor underemployed, which means they are getting these college degrees \nand are not being able to put them to good use. That is something we \nshould really be taking a look at.\n  Again, I think it was a reasonable proposal to extend the Perkins \nLoan Program for another year for many of the reasons my colleague from \nWisconsin stated. A lot of people are counting on these. But I fully \nrespect what the Senator from Tennessee is trying to do--to consolidate \nthese programs, to make them more streamlined, to address the \naffordability issue--which really is something that we are really \nignoring far too often in this body as we take the Federal Government \nand we involve it more and more in higher education. We really have to \ntake a serious look at what the Federal Government's involvement has \nactually been in terms of the unintended consequence of making college \nless accessible because we have made it so much more unaffordable.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for taking my phone call \nand listening to my viewpoint. And I certainly appreciate his \ndedication to trying to achieve that same goal that we all share--\nproviding the accessibility for every American to have a good quality \neducation so they can build a good life for themselves and their \nfamily.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I have great respect for the senior \nSenator from Tennessee, but I disagree with him on his objection to \nextending the Perkins Loan Program for 1 year. This is why I disagree. \nI very much appreciate the work he has laid out and the goals he has \nlaid out in reauthorizing the Higher Education Act. Certainly, I think \nwe all want to make sure it is easier for students to repay their \nloans, and I share the goal of also making college more affordable and \nmore accessible for everyone.\n  But as I look at this timeframe of where we are with the work that \nwill be done by the HELP Committee, which the Senator from Tennessee \nchairs, by the end of the year, this is, unfortunately, what happens \ntoo often in Washington. With the Perkins Loan Program, 5,000 of our \nstudents in New Hampshire receive a loan from this program. So it is \nimportant to 5,000 Granite Staters.\n  If we wait until the end of the year and let it lapse, and then the \nCommittee does its work, there are so many other pressing things that \nneed to be addressed in the Senate--this is pressing too--and if we \ndon't get to it, we are in the position where the Perkins loans lapse.\n  I appreciate the work done by the HELP Committee--which I hope is \nbipartisan--to address this important issue of making it easier for \nstudents. But I don't think we should let this program lapse in the \ninterim. I think there is a very reasonable position here\n\n[[Page S7031]]\n\nto say, let's extend this program and not leave people hanging out \nthere.\n  Apparently, the House of Representatives agreed unanimously to extend \nit a year, to give that breathing room, and send over here earlier this \nweek the Higher Education Extension Act of 2015, to do that for the \nstudents who are including the Perkins loan as part of their student \naid package and, as I understand it, for those for whom this loan makes \nsense--low-income students, vulnerable students, the ones we want to \nfight for here--to make sure they have access to the American dream. \nThat is about $2,000 for students who are some of the most financially \nin need.\n  I understand there are other loans available. But when you look at a \nstudent aid package, it is usually a combination of loans, especially \nif you are someone who comes from a background where you aren't able to \npay for college yourself. I think the reasonable position here would be \nthis: Let's extend this; let's provide that certainty while the HELP \nCommittee is doing the work that I think we all agree on needs to be \ndone to address higher costs, to make it easier for students, to give \nmore transparency in this system for students and for parents, and to \nmake it easier for students to repay these loans.\n  I am here fighting for the 5,000 students in New Hampshire and for \nothers like them. I don't want them to be a victim of Washington \nuncertainty or those who come after them for whom the Perkins loans \nmake sense. Until we get to this broader discussion, which is an \nimportant discussion, let's not let this lapse on behalf of those \nstudents. I think there is a reasonable position that allows the \nimportant work of the HELP Committee to go forward, but it extends this \nimportant loan program.\n  With all the respect I have for the senior Senator from Tennessee, \nthis is something on which I agree with my colleague from Wisconsin and \nothers who have said: Let's not leave them hanging on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is \nalways eloquent as she is fighting for students in New Hampshire. I \nwant to assure her and any of those 5,000 New Hampshire students who \nalready have a Perkins loan are not affected by this. In fact, almost \nno students across the country who have a student loan are affected by \nthis. There are about $8 billion worth of outstanding Perkins loans out \nof $1.3 trillion in student loans. We are talking about less than 1 \npercent of all student loans. We are talking about students that might \nbe awarded loans a year from now. No one who currently has a Perkins \nloan is affected by this.\n  What is our goal here? Our goal is to help students afford college. \nHow do you help students afford college, No. 1, by continuing a program \nthat has a higher interest rate than the loan they could get in a \nregular student loan? No, the Perkins loan rate is higher than the \ninterest rate on a Direct Loan that every single undergraduate student \nwho applies for federal aid is entitled to. No. 2, by continuing the \nPerkins loan which does not have the income-based repayment program \noffered in the Direct Loan program?\n  What is that income-based repayment plan? It says that you can pay \nyour loan back over 20 to 25 years, not paying more than 10 percent to \n15 percent of your disposable income each year. If you are a teacher or \na firefighter or if you have a lower-income position, you are not \ntreated the same as someone with a higher income. You pay back less \nbecause you earn less. If you get to the end of the 20 years and you \nhaven't paid it back, your loan is forgiven. That is the law today. \nThat is a loan that is available to every single student going to \ncollege. A low-income student can take advantage of that.\n  What we are seeking to do in our discussions--and they are indeed \nbipartisan as are the proposals to change the structure of the loan \nprograms--is to say that instead of a combination of student loans, \nwhich is where you have a whole stack of confusing student loans and \nyou pay one to this part of the Federal Government and another to this \npart, you will have one student loan at the lowest possible rate. Under \nour proposal, you will make only one payment to the Federal Government, \nand you will have the advantage of a 20-year repayment. If you haven't \npaid it off, it is forgiven.\n  We will simplify your application for that loan from a 108-question \nform, which I can't hold up according to the Senate rules, to 2 \nquestions, and we will simplify the process for paying it back. That is \nhow we are proposing to replace the Perkins Loan program, but we \nhaven't made a decision about that.\n  We have had eight hearings. I am working with Senator Murray, the \nsenior Democrat on the education committee, and other members of the \ncommittee to make sure that we come to a conclusion. I am not sure what \nconclusion we will come to. But the argument I am making is the same \nargument that so many witnesses before our committee said: Simplify the \nstudent aid process. You are discouraging low-income kids whose parents \nmay never have gone to college. Those parents may say: Ok, you can go \nto college and we will help you, but in your senior year of high school \nyou need to fill out this 108-question form requiring information about \nyour taxes before you file your tax return. And sorry, you can't use \nyour Pell grant year-round.\n  After completing college, there is a complex repayment form. The \nprogram is generous, but it is so complex that you will never use it. \nWe are losing millions of students, most of them lower income, most of \nthem are the first in their families to go to college, because of the \ncomplexity of our student aid system. We have bipartisan proposals to \nsimplify it, and this is part of that. Instead of getting three Federal \nloans, you get one. You will be able to potentially borrow more, but \nyou will get a loan with the lowest rate and a generous income based \nrepayment program. Why wouldn't that be a better deal for the students \nwe are trying to help? Why would we extend something with a higher rate \nand no generous repayment program? That is the argument here.\n  I see no need to rush through the House and the Senate a subject that \nwe are considering in our committee--and debating it fully in a \nbipartisan way. We plan to mark up and have ready for the full Senate \nour proposal by the end of the year. I see no need to rush that through \nso fast. Every student with a Perkins loan today still has one \ntomorrow. Those who might apply for one next year will have time to do \nthat if for some reason the program is reinstated. They will also be \nable to apply for a Federal loan that now exists with a lower interest \nrate and a better repayment plan. That is my reason for standing here \ntoday because we are trying to help students afford college by \nsimplifying the process of applications and the process of paying their \nloan back. You don't make it easier with a loan with a high interest \nrate, no income based repayment program and a confusing bunch of loans.\n  You could come back and say: But this is an additional loan, and that \nwould be true. We haven't decided yet exactly how much a full-time \nstudent may borrow from the Federal Government in our new \nreauthorization. This is a third loan on top of the other two federal \nloans. How many Senators have stood up on this floor and complained \nabout the overborrowing of students, about how we have $1 trillion-plus \nof loans outstanding, and about how students can't pay back their \nloans? What we are saying to students is that we don't want to \nencourage you to overborrow. We don't want you borrowing more than you \ncan afford. What we want to offer you is a plain, clear, simple \nopportunity to borrow an amount of money at a low interest rate with a \ngenerous repayment plan, and we want to give the university you are \nattending more latitude in explaining to you whether you can pay that \nback or not. Now they are handcuffed. Who is putting them in handcuffs? \nThe federal government is. We have Federal laws that make it hard for \nuniversities to counsel students about how much to borrow. I don't \nthink we are doing students any favor by extending this loan. We are \nnot cutting anybody out of a loan who already has one. In fact, we are \noffering all students a low-interest-rate loan.\n  The last point I want to make is that it is a revolving fund. It is \ntrue that the Federal Government has contributed about two-thirds of \nthe revolving fund and the universities themselves contribute the rest. \nI heard from university presidents that they find this\n\n[[Page S7032]]\n\nloan useful as they put together their financial aid package. I have \nheard all of that. But for the last number of years, the Federal \nGovernment hasn't been contributing to the Perkins fund. For the last \nnumber of years, Congress has said that it is time to sunset the \nPerkins Loan program. Both President Bush and President Obama at one \ntime or another have recommended that we sunset the Perkins Loan \nprogram. Many of the witnesses before our committee said the same \nthing. They said: You are overwhelming these students and their \nfamilies. Give them something simple. Give them something direct. Give \nthem one grant. Give them one loan.\n  That is our proposal--one grant, one loan, and the loan will be at \nthe lowest possible rate--which is currently lower than a Perkins \nloan--with the most generous repayment terms that are responsible. The \nPerkins loan doesn't have those repayment plans. Make it available to \nevery single student at an amount that we would agree upon and then \nallow the universities, colleges, and technical schools to be able to \ncounsel these students. Don't borrow too much, because a loan is not a \ngrant. You can keep a grant. You are going to have to pay back a loan.\n  There has even been some talk--and I support the concept--of saying \nto the universities and schools that you are going to have to have some \nskin in the game. If you are one of those schools or universities with \ntoo great a default rate on your student loans, you will have to pay \nsome of the amount borrowed because we want you to take some \nresponsibility for it.\n  I, actually, am not one of those Americans who is so concerned about \nthe amount of student loans outstanding today. I think it is a pretty \nhealthy indication in many ways. We have $1.2 trillion or $1.3 trillion \nin outstanding student loans. We have about $900 billion in outstanding \ncar loans. The average student loan for a 4-year graduate is about \n$29,000. The average car loan is about $27,000. Your car will \ndepreciate. Your degree will appreciate. Some say it will earn you a \nmillion dollars more in your lifetime than you would otherwise.\n  The unemployment rate in America today for Americans with a 4-year \ndegree is 3 percent. The average income for those Americans is in the \nmid-40s. I think it is a pretty good investment if we can say to \nAmericans: Go on to the community colleges where the average tuition is \n$3,300--and the average Pell grant is about $3,300--if you are low-\nincome. For all intents and purposes, it is free today for most low-\nincome students. Go on and earn that degree and improve your skills. \nThat is the way you make it up the ladder in this country. In order to \nhelp, we will loan you some money at a lower rate with a generous \nrepayment term on top of that if you need it. But we are going to take \nsteps to make sure we don't loan you more than you can pay back.\n  I think that is a pretty good picture of the American dream--the \nunemployment rate of 3 percent, the average income that is almost twice \nwhat the average total student loan debt of an individual, a chance for \n2 years of community college or any 2-year school if you are low-\nincome, with the taxpayer paying the average tuition of $3,300. That is \na pretty good system. We are trying to make it better. But the right \nway to do this is to take all of this discussion that we have had in a \nbipartisan way--all of these things I have talked about have been \nproposed by Democratic Senators and Republican Senators--and finish our \nwork in the committee, which is the way our Senate is supposed to work, \nand then recommend to the full Senate what the student loan program \nought to be. If some Senators want to say that we want to take $5 \nbillion and for the next 10 years authorize extending the Perkins Loan \nProgram--that is what it costs, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--I am probably going to stand up and say: Let's take that $5 \nbillion and instead give a year-round Pell grant for students. Let's \npay for the Pell grants for all those students who are persuaded to go \nto college because we have simplified their application form and their \nrepayment form. We are going to have a lot more Pell grants, a lot more \nstudents getting degrees. If we do, we will have a lot more Americans \njoining the middle class.\n  We are all for helping students. We want you to succeed. But my \nargument is that so far I am not persuaded that you succeed more with a \nPerkins loan that has a higher rate and no repayment program than you \ndo with a student loan that I have described that is already available \nto you with a lower rate and a generous repayment program. This is a \nhealthy debate. It is one we are having in our committee. Actually, I \nam glad it has gotten the attention of enough Senators. We are hearing \nfrom college presidents all over the country. Soon we will have this \ndebate in our full committee and then on the Senate floor. I look \nforward to it, and I think the students of America will benefit from \nthe work we are doing in a bipartisan way.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I have been \ncoming to the floor for 22 weeks now--every time the Senate has been in \nsession during this cycle--to address another waste of the week, and \nthat is what I am doing here this afternoon.\n  The amount of money we would be able to save that has been designated \nas waste, fraud, and abuse has an estimated total of nearly $116 \nbillion, and though people continue to say we can't cut a dime because \nevery dime of taxpayer money is used for an essential function, that is \nsimply not true.\n  While we have not been able to come forward with what I believe is \nabsolutely necessary to stop this continued deficit spending and plunge \ninto debt--the larger issues that we will be dealing with later in this \nsession--we can at least hopefully stand together and support those \ndocumented spending waste, fraud, and abuse issues that have been \npresented to us by the various nonpartisan agencies that audit and look \nat how we control our spending.\n  Today I will add some more money to that amount by discussing an \nagency called the National Technical Information Service, NTIS. This is \nan agency within the Department of Commerce. It was created during the \nTruman administration to keep all the reports produced by the Federal \nGovernment in a central location and make them available to the \nAmerican public through sale. The idea here was that various research \npapers, and other studies which were conducted by various agencies in \nthe government, would be centrally located in one place and that the \nAmerican people would have access to that research and information. \nThey had to pay for the receipt of that, and it was a modest pay-for, \nbut the money they paid for that was to be used to pay for the \nadministrative costs of storing this information and providing it and \nmaking it available for people. Frankly, it was a good idea. It was the \nonly way we could truly access that. It had important information that \nthe government could access as well.\n  Times have changed. Obviously, the way we store information and the \nway we make information available to people is entirely different than \nit was back during the Truman administration some 70 years ago. Today \nthe American people access and conduct research using a variety of \ntools and methods, largely online and largely for free. The abundance \nof free information has obviously greatly decreased the need for the \nNTIS.\n  In fact, last year, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, found \nthat three-quarters of the documents added to the NTIS collection in \nthe past 20 years can be found elsewhere, and 95 percent of it can be \nfound for free by using a basic search on Google.\n  When testifying before the Senate, the Government Accountability \nOffice said ``the legislation that established NTIS requires it to be \nfinancially self-sustaining to the fullest extent feasible. However, \nthe increasing availability of the information that NTIS collects and \ndisseminates--primarily through the Web--has called the service's basic \nstatutory function into question.''\n  Well, that is a mild way of saying: Look, this is an outdated, \nantiquated way of providing benefits to the American people to get \nthese scientific papers and research. They no longer have to go through \nNTIS to get this information. It is available for free.\n\n[[Page S7033]]\n\n  The irony here is that if you do dial up NTIS on their Web site, a \nlarge message comes up--first thing on the screen--saying ``Before \npurchasing from NTIS, you may want to check for free access from'' and \nthen they list those Web sites. NTIS says you can use their Web site to \nget this information for free. They list the U.S. Government Publishing \nOffice's Digital System Web site, the Federal Government Internet \nportal, usa.gov, or a Web search conducted by a commercial search firm, \nsuch as Google.\n  In fact, one of my colleagues, who retired from the Senate just last \nyear, actually introduced a bill called Just Google It Act, a clear \nindication that we no longer need this agency and it no longer serves \nits function. That has been introduced again by Senator Kirk this year, \nand I have cosponsored it. This is an agency that is saying: Don't use \nus anymore. You can get it for free, and we will even show you how to \nget it for free. Why are we covering the cost of NTIS at a rate of $880 \nmillion over 10 years when that savings could be applied to reducing \nour deficit, giving money back, and not requiring that amount of money \nto come from taxpayers--or better used for another essential purpose of \nthe Federal Government.\n  What we are putting up and adding to our ``Waste of the Week'' this \nweek is another $880 million, bringing our total to nearly $117 billion \nof savings that has been declared through nonpartisan government \nagencies that oversee our spending as waste, fraud, and abuse. So \nMembers cannot come down here and simply say: Where are we going to get \nthe money to cover this or do that? They can't come down here and say: \nIt is impossible to cut any more spending. We have done all that we can \ndo, and now we need more revenue. That is simply not the case.\n  Each week I will continue to bring up examples that are documented by \nnonpartisan agencies to be totally unnecessary. This is a small step in \nthe direction of trying to deal with a much larger problem. That much \nlarger problem is something I have been dealing with since I came back \nto the Senate after the election of 2010, and I am going to continue to \ntalk about it even though it is not foremost on many people's minds \nright now, given all of the dysfunction and other problems we are \ndealing with. We must not ignore the fact that we are continuing to act \non a deficit-spending basis, meaning we spend more than we take in each \nyear, and we have to borrow the money to cover the difference.\n  Our national debt has moved to a staggering level of nearly $19 \ntrillion, and almost $9 trillion of that amount accumulated in less \nthan a decade. It was more than 200 years before we first reached the \n$1 trillion mark. We have been on a spending binge ever since then, and \nit has to stop or we will pay a huge price. The debt collector will be \nat the door.\n  We need to make a major effort, and hopefully we will make an effort \nthis year. I have already announced that I will not support any \nspending effort to continue funding for this government unless we put \nsome policy changes in to start us down the path to fiscal \nresponsibility. We are working hard on that, and I will outline a \nnumber of ways in which we can do that.\n  In the meantime, I am saying: If you can't go big, let's at least \nstart small. Let's at least take those things that we already know have \nbeen declared waste, fraud, and abuse by nonpartisan agencies. At least \nwe are taking steps in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Bipartisan Dialogue in the Senate\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, Tom Udall, the Senator from New Mexico, to talk about how to \ncome together to fix our broken Senate and specifically to invite our \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to engage in a dialogue \ntogether to address the dysfunction that we see so evident on the floor \nof the Senate day after day. What we have come to understand in the \ncourse of 2015 is that the frustration with a broken Senate is a \nbipartisan, equal opportunity frustration.\n  In 2013 and 2014, Democrats were in the majority and Republicans were \nin the minority. The majority was frustrated and couldn't get onto \nbills to start debate, and when we did get on the bills, we couldn't \nstart the process of having amendments; the time on the floor was being \nwasted. Now here we are in 2015 and the roles are reversed. Republicans \nare in control, and Republicans are frustrated that we can't get to \nbills and have them on the floor and that the amendment process is \nbroken. And on amendments, it affects the minority and the majority. So \nhere we have Democrats and Republicans with something deeply in common: \na common interest in fixing this broken Senate.\n  The perspective I bring to this goes back to when I first came to \nthis Chamber in the summer of 1976. I was an intern for Senator \nHatfield. I was assigned to work on a bill called the Tax Reform Act of \n1976 that came up on the floor of the Senate. I was assigned to follow \nthe debate because, of course, we didn't have television coverage at \nthat point and we didn't have emails at that point. I would meet \nSenator Hatfield out at the elevators, just outside these beautiful \ndouble doors, and brief him on the amendment, and he would go in and \nvote. Then, an hour later, we would do it all over again. Debate was \nlargely on amendments that were relevant to the main underlying bill. \nThere was no delaying, no wasted time between amendments. There was no \nagreement that had to be negotiated between the Democratic and the \nRepublican leaders; it was simply whoever got the attention of the \nPresiding Officer after the preceding amendment was completed. In a lot \nof ways, it represented how the Senate had operated since our founding.\n  But today we are in a very different place. Today we are in a place \nwhere multiple aspects of the Senate are broken. We all wrestle with \ngetting bills to the floor. We wrestle with wasting time and not being \nable to bring our amendments forward. We wrestle with the \nresponsibility of the Senate to execute advice and consent \nresponsibility on nominations in a responsible fashion. So I wish to \nspeak a little bit about these three areas, and, again, at the core of \nmy message is an invitation to a bipartisan dialogue to try to address \nthese issues.\n  Let's talk first about the motions to proceed to the floor. These \nmotions used to be routine. This is a chart which shows when there was \na necessity of doing a cloture motion--a motion to close debate on a \nmotion to get to a bill. This chart goes back to about 1915. From 1915 \nthrough 1960, no one ever contested a vote on whether to bring a bill \nto the floor. It just was not done. It was a social contract. It was \nvoted either up or down; let's go to the bill or not go to the bill.\n  Starting in 1962--and we see the accelerating number of red bars--it \nbecame more and more routine, through times when Democrats were in the \nmajority and through times when Republicans were in the majority, to \ncontest and obstruct the effort to even start debate on a bill. So this \nis an area we can work together to address.\n  Let's talk about the frustration of actually being able to debate \namendments. I thought one way of contrasting this would be to look at \nthe number of amendments the Senate has considered in different years. \nBack in the 1993 through 1995 session, 2000, roughly, or 1,961 \namendments were debated and voted on here in the Senate. The following \n2-year period, 1995 through 1997, 2,540 amendments were voted on. How \ndoes that contrast with the two previous Congresses? In 2011 through \n2013, we were under 1,000--974; from 2013 to 2015, just over 500 \namendments, or roughly one-fifth of the number that were considered 20 \nyears earlier. So those are the numbers.\n  But what it really looks like here on the floor is we get onto a \nbill, and then nothing happens because the tree has been filled--filled \nby the Democratic leader when the Democrats have been in the majority, \nfilled by the Republican leader when the Republicans have been in the \nmajority--so no one can introduce an amendment unless they have \nunanimous consent, and there is\n\n[[Page S7034]]\n\nalways someone willing to object. Therefore, we are paralyzed. This is \nan area we can address.\n  Virtually every Senate legislature has worked out a system where they \ncan come to the floor on a bill and immediately start considering \namendments. There are many different ways we can solve this problem, \nbut we won't solve it unless we come together as Democrats and \nRepublicans and work together to figure it out--figure out a way that \nwill work for both sides.\n  Let's turn to nominations. Here again we see that before 1960--this \nchart goes back to about 1915--we never had cloture votes on \nnominations. The nomination was proposed, debated, and then there was \nan up-or-down vote. That was the social contract. There could have been \nan objection to closing debate, but there wasn't. People understood \nthat the time is short and if a nominee has majority support, then that \nnominee for a judicial position, for an executive position, should be \nin that position; that we shouldn't allow one branch of government--the \nlegislative branch--to systematically undermine and attack the other \nbranches of government.\n  Now, it is true that we haven't quite reversed roles at this point in \ntime the way we did in terms of being here on the floor of the Senate \nsimply because both last session and this session we still have the \nsame President--we still have a Democratic President. But let's turn \nour minds to the next election in November of 2016, which is not that \nfar away--a year and a month a way--and then January 2017, when that \nnew President is going to take office. At this point, we have no idea \nwhether that will be a Democratic President or a Republican President \nand we have no idea whether control of this Chamber will be in \nDemocratic hands or Republican hands. But I do know that my Republican \ncolleagues across the aisle--if there is a Republican President, they \ndon't want this Chamber to systematically obstruct the ability of that \nRepublican President to be able to put capable people into the \nnecessary positions to operate the government. Our role is to screen \nout terrible nominees, not to systematically undermine the ability of \nan administration to function.\n  So as we look forward to 2017, not knowing who will be in charge, \nmaybe this is a window of opportunity where we can come together and \nwork out a plan to expedite nominations so that we can return to the \ntraditions of the Senate and serve our role of advice and consent \nwithout conducting a war on the judicial branch or a war on the \nexecutive branch.\n  This concept of a supermajority was not the vision of the Founding \nFathers. In fact, they worried about this. Madison spoke to it. So did \nHamilton. Madison talked about the danger of a supermajority. He said:\n\n       It would be no longer the majority that would rule: The \n     power would be transferred to the minority. Were the \n     defensive privilege limited to particular cases, an \n     interested minority might take advantage of it to screen \n     themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal, or, \n     in particular emergencies, to extort unreasonable \n     indulgences.\n\n  He continues to address supermajority rule and says: ``The \nfundamental principle of free government would be reversed.''\n  Let me translate that. What he is saying is that in a principled \ndemocracy, there is wisdom in the majority; that if the majority says \nthis is the right decision, that is the decision we should make. But if \nwe systematically go in the direction in which the minority says we \nshould go, then we have chosen the less wise option. Those decisions \nbuild up over time and undermine the success of the Nation, and that \nwould be a huge mistake.\n  Hamilton addressed this as well. He said--and this is Federalist \nPaper No. 22, and he was speaking from painful experience as a New York \nRepresentative in Congress that was created under the Articles of \nConfederation. He said that supermajority rule results in ``tedious \ndelays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of \nthe public good.''\n  I think a lot of Americans, when they think about the way Congress is \noperating now, would say: That is what we see. We see contemptible \ncompromises of the common good. We don't see 100 Members of the Senate \nworking together for the public. Instead, we see a lot of special \ninterest deals, contemptible compromises, really abuse of minority role \nin blocking.\n  They have seen both the Democrats in the minority this year, \nRepublicans in the minority before, so it is an equal opportunity \ncritique, if you will, toward both parties. Of course, our national \nrating is very low.\n  Again, as we look toward the future and have no idea whether the next \nPresident will be a Democrat or Republican, and we don't know whether \nthe next majority leader will be a Democrat or a Republican, we have a \nchance, an opportunity, an incentive to work together to establish new \nrules--rules that will make this place work again, rules that will \nrestore the Senate.\n  Senator Udall and I have laid out ideas on how we might address these \nthings, but those ideas--there is no one wisdom, no silver bullet. So \nlet's come together in a dialogue.\n  There are ideas that I absolutely love. I love the idea of a talking \nfilibuster. That is, let's get rid of the filibuster on motions to \nproceed. That is in sync with the way the Senate used to operate. Let's \nget rid of it on conference committees. That is the way the Senate used \nto operate. And on final passage, if 41 Senators want to continue \ndebate, then let's insist that one of them be on the floor speaking. \nThat makes it both a commitment of time and energy, which is not \nrequired now under the supermajority requirement, and it makes it \nvisible and transparent to the American public. So I love that idea, \nbut perhaps that is not an idea on which we can build a bipartisan \nbridge. I don't know, and I won't know unless we can come together in a \nbipartisan way to discuss it.\n  I love the idea of coming to the floor with a protocol for \namendments, since we have been so paralyzed, so that immediately five \namendments from the minority and five from the majority that are \nrelevant to the bill and that are in order could be offered. That would \nbe terrific. It would be a simple majority passage. I think if that was \ndone, then the majority and minority Members would hear from their \nleaders and say: Let's do five more on each side. But we wouldn't come \nto the floor and play music on C-SPAN because we can't even start \ndebate on an amendment. Let's use the valuable time we have on this \nfloor to do the people's work, not to sit here in deep-freeze \nparalysis.\n  I love the idea of establishing a rule that creates a specific way to \ndiscuss and debate rule changes. We don't have that right now. When we \nstart every 2-year Congress, we wrestle with how can we create a \nconversation over rules. There is no systematic way in our rules to do \nthat. I love the idea of us working together to lay out a way to do \nthat. I think it would serve this body well.\n  We need to work together to restore this body. It has often been \nreferred to by the nickname ``the world's greatest deliberative body.'' \nThat certainly is not an accurate description today, but together we \ncan restore that. We have a responsibility to the citizens of the \nUnited States to restore that vision.\n  Let's make deliberation work and characterize this body, not deep \nfreeze. Let's engage in respectful dialogue, not rigid partisanship. \nLet's take this moment, as we plan toward January 2017, and build a \nvision together, dialogue together, a vision of how to make the Senate \nwork for Americans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is my privilege to introduce my colleague from New Mexico, who has \nwrestled with this issue even before he came to the Senate and has been \nengaged in it from day one and has brought so much insight and wisdom \nto bear on this challenge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I have said many times. The Senate is too \noften a graveyard for good ideas. And the shovel is the broken \nfilibuster. I want to thank Senator Merkley for his remarks about the \nneed to reform the Senate rules. And I want to say a few words myself, \nbecause this issue continues to prevent this body from working for the \nAmerican people.\n  That is why we pushed for reform in the 112th Congress and in the \n113th Congress. Some said it was just a power grab by the majority--a \npartisan push--nothing could be further from the truth. Now that the \nshoe is on the\n\n[[Page S7035]]\n\nother foot, I think many Republicans are realizing the modern \nfilibuster may need reform.\n  Some of the same people who voted for, or supported, record numbers \nof filibusters in recent years are now complaining about the filibuster \nwhen Democratic Senators use it.\n  Conservative commentators, House Members, and Republican Presidential \ncandidates all are now talking about the filibuster.\n  Several years ago, a number of senior Republican Senators said \nSenator Merkley and I would step back once we were in the minority. \nThey said we would not try again, but we renewed our fight at the \nbeginning of this Congress. We are in the minority today. We hope that \ndoes not last long, but we support filibuster reform--regardless of who \nis the majority leader. The American people want a government that \nworks. Majorities will change, but the need for responsive government \ndoes not--at least it should not. So we will keep pushing for reform \nthat is fair, that reins in abuse, and protects the minority. That was \nour goal before and that is our goal now.\n  The heart of our proposal is the ``talking filibuster.'' It is \nsimple, it is reasonable, and it makes sense. If you oppose a bill, \nthen go to the floor and explain why. The filibuster was once used \nsparingly. It allowed the minority to be heard. But under the current \nrules, it is used too much and too easily. One Senator just needs to \nnotify the floor staff of his or her objection. The American people \ndeserve a real debate, not one Senator picking up a phone.\n  This is not news to our Republican colleagues, who are now in the \nmajority. In the last Congress, we voted on cloture 218 times. To put \nthat in perspective, the Senate voted on cloture only 38 times in the \n50 years after the rule was adopted in 1917. Filibuster reform will \nallow a majority to pass more legislation in the Senate. But as \neveryone who has served here knows, floor time is a precious commodity. \nThe ability to come to the floor and delay action by debating forces \ncompromise, and most importantly, filibuster reform would apply to both \nparties equally going forward.\n  If legislation is passed more easily under a reform scenario, it can \nalso be reformed, amended, or repealed more easily. Demanding one party \nto give up its rights under the rules will never succeed. The solution \nis to change the rules for both parties going forward on a permanent \nbasis.\n  We made some progress in the last Congress by allowing for simple \nmajority votes for qualified nominees for judicial and Executive \nappointments, and the Senate is working better. By changing the rules, \nwe confirmed 96 judges--more judges than any modern Congress since \n1980.\n  We also confirmed 293 Executive nominations in 2014--the most since \n2010. That was an important change. It was bold. It was necessary. And \nthe unprecedented mass obstruction by the new majority of this \nPresident's nominees only underscores that we did the right thing last \nyear. But, we still need broader filibuster reform.\n  We said it before, and we will say it again: We can do this with \nrespect for the minority, with respect for differing points of view, \nand with respect for this Chamber, but most of all with respect for the \npeople who send us here. The right to change the rules at the beginning \nof a new Congress is supported by history and by the Constitution. \nArticle I, section 5 is very clear. The Senate can adopt and amend its \nrules at the beginning of a new Congress by a simple majority vote. \nThis is known as the Constitutional Option. It is well named. It has \nbeen used numerous times--often with bipartisan support--since the \ncloture provision was adopted in 1917.\n  We opened the door, as we said we would, at the beginning of this \nCongress. Our reform proposal remains on the table. The majority leader \ncan bring it up at any time. This is not just about rules. It is about \nthe norms and traditions of the Senate.\n  I support any Senator's right to oppose bad legislation. The \nfilibuster has a role to play. The abuse of the filibuster does not.\n  Our constituents are waiting. There is a lot of work to be done. We \nneed to make sure we get it done, and get it done right. These are \ncommonsense reforms to restore the best traditions of the Senate. \nNeither side is 100 percent pure. Both sides have used the rules for \nobstruction. And no doubt they had their reasons. But most Americans \ndon't care about that. They don't want a history lesson or a lesson in \nparliamentary procedure. They want a government that is fair, \nreasonable, and works no matter which party is in the majority.\n  We changed the process for nominations, and that was a good start, \nbut, it was the beginning, not the end. We still have a lot of work to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to carry on a short colloquy \nwith Senator Merkley or maybe other Senators who could join us and also \nfor as much time as we may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Senator Merkley, I have listened very carefully, and I think you and \nI have worked diligently since we got into the Senate to try to make \nsure the Senate functions properly. What we want to see more than \nanything is bipartisanship, working together.\n  Whenever we have worked on the rules, I know one of our principles--\nwhich was a good one--was to draft rules so that they apply to either \nthe majority or minority. That is something I think we have done on a \nregular basis, is to look at the rules and say: If we do the right set \nof rules, then if we are in the minority, we will feel good about it, \nand if we are in the majority, they will work for us that way also.\n  I am wondering. I see calls of reform all around the Senate right \nnow. You see the Presidential candidates who look at our Senate rules \nand say there ought to be reforms. There ought to be filibuster reform. \nYou see Republicans over in the House almost every week raising the \nissue that there should be filibuster reform. We need democracy to \nwork.\n  Many of the outside scholars--people such as Thomas Mann, Norm \nOrnstein, and scholars like them--write books over and over again, and \nalways a big part of the reform package goes to the Senate rules.\n  So I would ask the Senator, do you think that we are really talking \nabout there being fertile ground right now for us to come together; \nthat this is a time, when enough people are speaking about this, that \nwe should be able to come together? And what we are urging--are we \nurging them to join us in some kind of format on the floor, off the \nfloor, to have a meeting with various Senators who have worked on this \nin the past? Is this a good time to do this?\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I think Senator Udall is absolutely accurate that this \nis the perfect moment to do it.\n  When we first engaged in this dialogue, we reached out to our \nRepublican colleagues. We held one-on-one meetings. We sought to \nchampion this. What we found was that the view of reform was polarized \non whether you were in the majority or the minority.\n  We said that we were going to have this test for what we put forward: \nthat what we put forward when we were in the majority is what we put \nforward when we are in the minority. If we don't think it would work \nfor us in the minority, then it is not an honest or fair appraisal of \nmaking the Senate work.\n  So now we have come to that test because here we are now in the \nminority and we are proposing the same set of ideas. This Senator \nabsolutely believes these ideas would make this place work better. It \nwould enable more bills to be debated, which is--to have that value \nwhen you are in the minority, to actually put your amendments forward \nand have that debate, is a gift.\n  Certainly it says that if you really believe--the idea that we put \nforward, a talking filibuster--if you really believe you want to block \nsomething, you have to stand on this floor and debate it. I think that \nis a way to keep the theory of the filibuster and return it to the \nsocial contract of the past where people understood that it was a \nsimple-majority body, as envisioned in the Constitution, as envisioned \nby Hamilton, as envisioned by Madison; that they had the experience of \nthe supermajority and knew that caused deep damage, but that if you \nreally believe in something so deeply, then you are willing to spend \nthe time and energy.\n\n[[Page S7036]]\n\n  So I think the things we crafted in the majority still hold up. But \nthe bigger point is this: Now that we have had a reversal, many of our \ncolleagues are experiencing firsthand the frustrations the minority can \ninflict on the majority. I think that opens a window of opportunity.\n  I have a list of 20 quotes. The Senator referred to people in the \nHouse--he is a former Member of the House--saying to their Senate \nRepublican colleagues: Why don't you do something to fix the Senate? \nAnd now we are standing here saying: Join with us in a dialogue to fix \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. UDALL. I say to Senator Merkley, I couldn't think of this being a \nmore appropriate time. I think it is fertile ground, and I think it is \ngreat that we have come here.\n  The important thing to remember is a point you and I both made in the \npast, and it has to do with the old movie everybody knows called ``Mr. \nSmith Goes to Washington.'' People always thought the filibuster was as \nit is portrayed in that movie. You have Mr. Smith coming to Washington, \nand he is concerned with a passion about an issue, and he thinks he may \nbe in the minority, but he wants to fight it out. He comes to the floor \nand he speaks about it, and he rallies people outside.\n  Now today, as we know, you don't see that very often. Actually, \nsometimes what people call a filibuster, we are at the early stage of a \nmotion to proceed before we even get onto the bill.\n  What we are doing is trying to return to ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington.'' What we want to see happen is a talking filibuster where \nevery Senator gets to talk.\n  As you and I know--you have been a real scholar and a student of the \nSenate in terms of its history--before there was this rule in place on \nthe filibuster, the tradition was always that every Senator had an \nopportunity to speak. That was a fine Senate tradition. It was \nestablished. They didn't have to write it down. Everybody said: We are \nnot going to take any action until we let every Senator speak.\n  The other part of it was just what you talked about in our amendment \nproposal--allowing Senators to offer amendments. Today we are so far \naway from that.\n  We have this motion to proceed. We don't even get onto the bill. That \ncauses so much mischief because you have all these procedural things \nthat happen in advance of even getting on the bill.\n  You were a leader in the Oregon Legislature, so I would ask you to \njust reflect a little on that because you have seen that when you get a \nbill on the floor, you work on it, you get to amend it, to debate it--\nand most of the time when people are working on it, they want to get to \nthe end game, but we are not able to do that. Was that your experience \nin working in the Oregon Legislature? If you get on the bill, that is \nhalf the work right there. And we are blocked here on the motion to \nproceed and the filibuster on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Indeed, my experience in the Oregon State Legislature \nwas dramatically different. In many ways, it was much more similar to \nthe way I thought the Senate was operating when I was here in the 1970s \nand then working for Congress in the 1980s. Once we got to a bill on \nthe floor of the Oregon House, where I served for 10 years and spent 2 \nyears as speaker, every moment was utilized in debate. There was no \nparalysis. People only had limited time. We were there to hear each \nother and to make decisions and certainly in a more expeditious style \nthan is the custom in the Senate. But what we had in common was floor \ntime was well utilized in the Senate in the past and well utilized in \nOregon.\n  As you were speaking about tradition and how the Senate worked, I was \nthinking about how all this began. When they had the first U.S. Senate, \nthey had in their rule book a motion to force a vote. They had that \nrule, but they never used it. Why didn't they use it? Imagine if there \nare 13 States and just 26 Senators and they stand here occupying a \nquarter of the space we now occupy and they say: Well, we certainly can \nextend the courtesy of hearing each person's insight or opinion before \nwe vote.\n  So after a couple of years, when they rewrote the rule book, they \ndecided not to include the rule. They didn't need it because they had \nthe courtesy of hearing each other. So suddenly there is a Senate with \nno rule on how to close debate and force a vote. And over time that \ncourtesy eroded. It was after World War I that the first time occurred \nwhen the Senate said: Well, let's enable a majority--a supermajority of \nthe Senate to close debate if there is too much abuse or paralysis.\n  The point is that the filibuster is not in the Constitution. Some of \nmy colleagues have said this is the way the Founders designed the \nSenate--to be a supermajority body. That is wrong, wrong, wrong. It is \nnot in the Constitution, it was not in the early Senate, and it was not \na major feature of the Senate in terms of it being a common experience \nuntil these recent years.\n  So if we can recapture the spirit and the courtesy of hearing each \nother's opinion but enable us to get onto the bill, debate the bill, do \namendments, and then if someone finds a moment of great principle, \ngreat heartfelt objection, and wants to spend the time and energy to \nextend debate, they do so in this visibile talking-filibuster fashion, \nI think that would be a huge improvement and well worth our time.\n  Mr. UDALL. I say to Senator Merkley, what you point out that is so \nimportant for people to understand--when we put the original bill back \nin there in World War I, it was put in so that a minority could not \nblock it. We had Woodrow Wilson as President. He was very concerned. We \nwere talking about national security during a war, and he wanted to arm \nour merchant ships. He got a bill out of the House of Representatives, \nand it was rolling toward the Senate. It was near the end of the \nsession, and he took that bill very seriously. He thought it was vital \nto the national security of the country, and he asked the Senate to act \non it. There were about 11 or 12 Senators, I believe, who had decided: \nWe are near the end of the session; let's just run out the clock. There \nwas no procedure to be able to get to the bill before the clock ran \nout. These 11 Senators took to the floor and they ran out the clock, \nand Woodrow Wilson said: No way am I going to allow that to happen \nagain. He got a bee in his bonnet on that one.\n  The next Congress that came in, the President said he wanted a rule \nso that wouldn't happen again. So they put in a rule which was at the \ntime 67 votes in order to cut off debate, and that rule has really been \nturned on its head with what is happening in recent times. The rule was \noriginally so that a small minority could cut off debate and could \nproceed to the issue. Now we have calls to the cloakroom, calls to the \nleadership. You and I don't know what is going on. We don't know why we \ndon't get on an issue. We go on a motion to proceed, and we have a \nmotion to invoke cloture and all these procedural things nobody \nunderstands, until people say: Why can't you get on the bill? Well, \nbecause the filibuster rule has been turned on its head. That is \nsomething people have to understand. We are not using this filibuster \nrule the traditional way that we used it in the Senate for the purpose \nit was originally put in.\n  As Senator Merkley pointed out on the motion to proceed--and I wanted \nto ask one more question about the motion to proceed. You talked about \nhow in 1962 we increasingly started to see obstruction in terms of the \nmotion to proceed. It would prevent bills from getting to the floor. \nThere wasn't any way to get on these bills. It jammed things up.\n  I will never forget the Senator whom I succeeded, Senator Pete \nDominici, a solid Republican who believed in the Senate. He came out \nand said we shouldn't have filibusters on a motion to proceed; we \nshould get right on the bill. I remember several Senators who came in \nin our class and after--Republican Senators--who said the same thing. \nSo I think there is a lot of room here.\n  I am asking you again, in terms of the motion to proceed and us \ncalling for a bipartisan effort--we should be able, with the people who \nare here, to either work on a motion to proceed, work on the talking \nfilibuster, or work on a variety of other amendment issues that are \ncrucial. Don't you think this is the time?\n  I just want to make sure before you leave that we make sure there is \nan invitation from us to 98 other Senators to sit down in some format, \nwhether it\n\n[[Page S7037]]\n\nis a bipartisan conference or something else, and talk about how we \nmake this place work better and how we make it more democratic.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. There are two former Members of the Senate right now who \nare working on a book that is coming out in January that will be \naddressing reform in the Senate, and that is Trent Lott and Tom \nDaschle. They have already issued a number of ideas about how to reform \nthis.\n  The point I am making is that when people leave the Senate, they \nreflect back and say: You know, there is a bipartisan opportunity, a \nbipartisan responsibility to make this Chamber work.\n  What we are saying is that this can't be accomplished through folks \nwho have left the Senate; that we must invite bipartisanship here and \nsolve it ourselves; and that any rule changes that are envisioned, any \nagreements that are forged have to be done here on the floor, and we \nare extending that invitation, as you put it, to our 98 colleagues to \nbe part of that dialogue.\n  We can draw on the ideas that our former Members have put forward as \na starting point. We can draw on the ideas that you and I have put \nforward, but these ideas, there is no one way to address this. We are \ninviting others to brainstorm together in a dialogue to try to gather a \nvision that perhaps we can commit ourselves to, in a bipartisan \nfashion, to enact at the start of the next legislature, when we realize \nwe may not be minority or majority, and that becomes a magical way to \nescape our current status as we are embattled and we are having deep \nemotional fights over foreign policy, social policy, and how to create \njobs in America--but to get some distance on that and say how to make \nthis Chamber work the way it was envisioned, because certainly I think \n100 Members can agree the Senate is broken. Would it not be phenomenal \nif, in a bipartisan effort, we were able to restore the U.S. Senate to \nbeing a great deliberative body?\n  Mr. UDALL. Yes, I say to Senator Merkley, you are absolutely right. I \nam just going to close by saying that the thing we have--and I said \nthis in the beginning. The thing we have worked on and tried to achieve \nis to make sure that when we crafted changes to the rules--motion to \nproceed, talking filibuster, how we allow each side to have \namendments--we have always said we could live with them if we were in \nthe minority.\n  We have been in the minority now for almost a year. In a couple of \nmonths it will be a year. We came out right at the beginning of the \nCongress and talked about our rules again. We proposed the same rules \nin the majority. We want to be fair to both sides, but what is more \nimportant isn't that fairness; it is the fairness to the American \npeople to get their democracy back again so it works.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                  Aurora, Colorado, Veterans Hospital\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, today marks a pivotal day for veterans in \nColorado and the Rocky Mountain region. Just minutes ago, the House of \nRepresentatives approved the Senate bill to extend several important \nauthorizations to Coloradans, authorizations important to the health \ncare of our country's veterans because the bill includes the \nauthorization to complete the Denver VA replacement medical facility.\n  After years of persistence, years of passion, years of emotion, we \nhave finally passed a bill to finish the job at the Denver VA \nreplacement facility in Aurora, CO. This bill will allow us to finish \nthe job, allowing the replacement facility that is critical for the \ncare of veterans in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region to move \nforward, to fulfill the promise we have made to our veterans.\n  This bill also turns the page on the gross mismanagement by the VA of \nthis project and will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to take over \nthe management of the project to ensure its completion without further \ndelay.\n  There is simply no acceptable excuse for how the project ended up in \nthis current state--years delayed, hundreds of millions of dollars over \nbudget. While the bill will turn the page on this day, it will not turn \nour focus away from reforms at the VA to ensure accountability and to \nensure this never happens again. I have worked with a number of my \ncolleagues to initiate these reforms, including an amendment to the \nDefense authorization bill that will get the VA out of the big \nconstruction business.\n  I come to the floor to say thank you--thank you to my colleagues, \nspecifically Senator Isakson, Senator Blumenthal, Senator Kirk, Senator \nTester, the majority leader, their staff, and my colleague Michael \nBennet for their leadership on this issue.\n  Of course, none of this would be possible without the incredible work \nof Mike Coffman, the Congressman representing the area, Ed Perlmutter, \nthe entire Colorado delegation who worked so hard to make this happen. \nThey have all provided a great service to veterans in passage of the \nlegislation out of the House today. Years from now, when veterans go to \nthis hospital to receive the care we have promised, they will enter \ninto what will be the crown jewel of the VA infrastructure, the crown \njewel of the VA system. It took a lot of hard work to get here.\n  Today I am excited, with the passage of the House bill, passage in \nthe Senate, that a bill is on its way to the President to finish the \njob, to complete the hospital, and to fulfill our promise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       Conduct of the Director of the St. Paul Office of the VBA\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern and \ndisgust at recent revelations of improper and dishonest conduct by \nsenior executives at the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the \ndirector of the St. Paul office of the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration.\n  According to a report released by the VA's Office of the Inspector \nGeneral this week, two Veterans Benefits Administration executives used \ntheir positions to assign themselves to different jobs that involved \nfewer responsibilities while maintaining their high salaries. One of \nthem has been the director of the VBA St. Paul regional office since \nOctober of 2014. The inspector general found that the St. Paul VBA \ndirector used her influence as director of the VBA Eastern Area Office \nto compel the relocation of the previous St. Paul office director. She \nthen proceeded to submit her own name for consideration to fill the \nvacancy she herself had created.\n  Taking on the job of directing the St. Paul regional office was \nactually a step down in responsibility for this administrator. In the \ninspector general's words, she ``went from being responsible for \noversight of 16 [regional offices] to being responsible for only 1 \n[regional office].'' But she kept her previous senior executive service \nsalary of $173,949 per year. She also received over $129,000 in \nrelocation expenses.\n  So look at this: She had a responsible job managing 16 regional \noffices. She created an opening by transferring the person under her. \nShe took that opening and went from supervising 16 regional offices to \nsupervising 1. Then she kept the same salary, going from 16 offices to \n1 office, and then took $129,000 in relocation expenses.\n  This is the kind of action that has created the breach of trust \nbetween our veterans and the departments that exist to serve their \nneeds. There are so many people who have such good will who work at the \nVeterans' Administration, including in Minnesota, and there are so many \ndeserving veterans who deserve their help. But to make this truly work, \nwe have to show that the people at the top are accountable.\n  What this director did was not responsible, it was not a good use of \ntaxpayer money, and it certainly was not fair to our veterans. This is \na senior executive who is supposed to be focused on ensuring that \nveterans are being served the way they deserve and who instead used her \nposition to push out one of her colleagues and get herself a plum \nassignment where she would have fewer responsibilities but at the same \ntime keep the same salary. This conduct is unacceptable. It erodes the\n\n[[Page S7038]]\n\npublic's trust in the VA. It is commendable that the VA inspector \ngeneral took action by referring these two cases to the U.S. attorney \nfor possible criminal prosecution. The VA needs to do right by our \nveterans and our taxpayers by holding bad actors accountable and \nimplementing reforms to prevent exploitation such as this from ever \nhappening again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want to talk today about the bill we are \nconsidering currently--the MILCON-VA bill. I urge the Senate to take up \nand pass an appropriations bill that does right by our Nation's \nveterans. I think it is very important. But the MILCON-VA bill before \nus today--and I might add along with the rest of the appropriations \nbills--is shackled to an unwise and unrealistic budget that locks in \ndestructive sequestration cuts and vastly underfunds programs vital to \nthis Nation's security and prosperity, and it doesn't deal with the \nchallenges the Veterans' Administration faces. Make no mistake about \nit, America's veterans would be severely shortchanged by this bill as \nit is currently drafted.\n  Coming from the State of Montana, where we have the second highest \nper capita veterans population, I cannot look in the eyes of our \nNation's brave men and women and say to them that this bill will \nfulfill our promise to you. This bill underfunds our veterans by over \n$850 million, subjecting the VA to the across-the-board spending caps \nthe majority is desperate to avoid on the Defense bill. That is \nhypocritical because, let's be honest with ourselves, caring for our \nveterans is a cost of war.\n  What we know and what the majority knows is that this bill is \nseverely limiting the VA's ability to fulfill its mission--caring for \nthose who have borne the battle. Need I remind everyone that just a few \nweeks ago, because of a surge in demand for hepatitis C treatments and \na historic increase in non-VA care referrals, the VA medical services \naccount ran out of money. As a result, we had to pass emergency \nlegislation to allow Choice Act funding to be used to shore up the VA \nand prevent a serious disruption for veterans across this country.\n  The budget pressures that caused that shortfall are the result of an \nunprecedented demand for services in terms of both numbers and \ncomplexity, and that demand will only continue to grow. At some point \nduring the next year, nearly half the veterans will be 65 years old or \nolder. Many of these folks will be seeking treatment to deal with the \neffects of toxic exposure--something we are struggling to better \nunderstand and treat and something that could have effects on their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  At the same time, a younger generation of veterans is struggling to \ncope with the unseen wounds of war. They are fighting to keep their \nlives and their families together, and for some of them it is a daily \nstruggle to overcome the suicidal thoughts that claim the lives of at \nleast 22 of their peers each and every day. Those are the stakes here. \nThey are that high.\n  We are also talking about an unprecedented demand for expensive new \ntreatments for diseases, such as hepatitis C, which are shorter in \nduration and which have fewer side effects and have cure rates \napproaching 100 percent. That is good news, but we have to have money \nto do that. We are talking about addressing a chronic shortage of \nmedical professionals, particularly mental health professionals in \nrural America, which greatly hinders our ability to provide veterans \nwith timely and quality care. We are talking about a growing population \nof caregivers who have been forced to abandon their jobs and their \nlivelihoods to care for loved ones with debilitating medical \nconditions, and we are talking about facilities that are literally \ncrumbling in some cases and severely impacting the delivery of care.\n  I believe we need more transparency and accountability from the VA to \nensure it is spending taxpayer dollars in a responsible way. But let's \nbe clear. Today we are asking more and more of the VA, and this bill \ngives them less than they need. Now is not the time to take a step \nbackward. If we do that, we are never going to catch up.\n  If we don't enact a commonsense, long-term budget that better \nreflects our priorities, our values, and provides the tools and \nresources required to fulfill our promises to veterans and their \nfamilies, then we should all question just what are we doing here.\n  Mr. President, there are cases when each of us has looked at a bill \nor amendment and said: You know, it is not perfect, but it is good \nenough. Sometimes that is what it takes to get work done around here. \nBut when it comes to our veterans, when it comes to restoring \nconfidence in the VA after the problems they have had in the last 2 \nyears, I don't think that is a path we should take.\n  I know my chairman, Senator Kirk, did his best in writing this bill \nto soften the blow of budget constraints that he was forced to meet. I \ntruly appreciate his efforts and his inclusiveness in working with me. \nBut the fact is that he was handed a no-win allocation by his party's \nbudget. You can't patch the holes in the VA budget created by \nsequestration. You can't shift money from known medical care \nrequirements--treatment for cancer, diabetes, or kidney disease, to \nname just a few--to plug gaps in emerging requirements, such as \nlifesaving but costly new hepatitis C treatments.\n  That is why I offered an amendment in committee to restore $857 \nmillion to bring the VA to its requested level. Unfortunately, none of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle joined me, and it failed \non a party-line vote. I am at a complete loss as to why we are now \nbeing asked to move to a bill that we all know underfunds the VA by \nalmost $1 billion. For what? So that we can send this bill to \nconference with the House, whose own VA bill underfunds the VA by $1.4 \nbillion--$600 million more than the Senate. That will not improve the \nquality or the timeliness of veterans health care nor will giving the \nVA authority to fire more doctors and nurses without due process.\n  It is time to stop the political games and maneuvering. To serve our \nveterans, to serve this country, and to serve all Americans, Congress \nmust establish funding levels driven by what the VA actually needs, not \nby some arbitrary mathematical formula. We need a rational, realistic, \nbipartisan budget agreement to replace the draconian sequestration \nfunding levels entrenched in the majority's fiscal year 2016 budget.\n  I have been calling on Senate leaders for months to sit down and hash \nout a long-term budget agreement. The majority leader's response was to \nwait until the day before the government was scheduled to shut down and \nthen pass a short-term CR. As early as tomorrow, we expect to vote on \nan appropriations bill that will drastically underfund the VA for the \nnext fiscal year. This is clearly an attempt to paint those of us who \nthink this bill is insufficient as voting against veterans.\n  That plan will not work because I am here to tell you that veterans \nare well aware of the funding shortfall. It is one of the chief \nproblems that is currently plaguing the VA. I will continue to provide \nadequate funding to support America's veterans.\n  While I am disappointed the majority wouldn't work with us on a \nbroader budget deal this summer, the CR that we passed today gives us \njust over 2 months to reach a reasonable budget agreement--an agreement \nthat will support our veterans, an agreement that Members on both sides \nof the aisle agree we need. That is the job we are elected to do. But \nmake no mistake, if we are having this same conversation on December \n10, we have failed--failed our veterans, failed the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to proceed to this bill so \nthat we can finally negotiate a bipartisan budget agreement that will \ndo away with the devastating impacts of sequestration and will instead \nprovide a responsible way forward to fund our government, to protect \nour national security, and to care for this Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7039]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Law of the Sea Treaty\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on climate change's \nradical alteration of the Earth's marine environments--particularly in \nthe Arctic--and how these epic changes in the environment strengthen \nthe case of U.S. accession to the Law of the Sea Treaty.\n  Competitors of the United States in the global economy are taking \nadvantage of climate change's environmental impact on the Arctic, \nparticularly how the disappearance of Arctic sea ice is opening new \nshipping lanes and access to the mineral resources in the Arctic \nseabed. Our competitors' advances in the Arctic are happening at the \nexpense of U.S. national security, energy development, and maritime \ntransit interests, and it is the failure of the United States to join \nthe treaty that is giving those countries a huge advantage of staking a \nclaim in largely unclaimed territory.\n  In the 3\\1/2\\ years since a partisan effort thwarted the Senate from \nproviding the necessary advice and consent of the Law of the Sea \nTreaty, the United States has ceded millions in potential economic \nopportunity in the Arctic, and we have no recourse to dispute the \nlegality of any of the territorial and economic zone expansions \ncountries like Russia are making in the Arctic waters and sea ice.\n  While the economic and territorial claims--including mineral, oil, \nand gas extraction rights--in the Arctic are not the only reason for \nthe United States to accede to the Law of the Sea Treaty, the situation \nin the Arctic is arguably the most dynamic due to the impact climate \nchange is having on the Arctic Ocean environment. As long as the United \nStates sits on the sidelines by not being a party to this treaty, our \nglobal economic competitors will continue to take leaps and bounds \nahead of the United States, accessing the opportunities we are \nsquandering.\n  The Arctic Ocean environment has experienced notable changes that \nhave tracked ahead of the global rise in temperatures. Starting in the \nmid-1970s, global average temperatures have risen 0.5 degrees \nCentigrade, with each of the last three decades being successively \nwarmer at the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850. \nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, \nthe 10 hottest years, based on average global surface temperatures, \nhave all occurred since 1998, with 2014 being the hottest year on \nrecord. However, many climate scientists are projecting that this year, \n2015, will surpass last year as the hottest year on record. Temperature \nincreases at the Poles have been even more significant, and the impacts \nand consequences are more severe.\n  I show this photograph here that points out that the data from the \nNational Snow and Ice Data Center shows that over the past 30 years, \nthe Arctic has warmed at a higher rate than any other region on Earth. \nArctic warming is causing changes to sea ice, snow cover, and the \nextent of permafrost in the Arctic.\n  According to NOAA, in the first half of 2010, air temperatures in the \nArctic were 4 degrees Celsius--7 degrees Fahrenheit--warmer than the \n1968-to-1996 reference period. Satellite data shows that over the past \n30 years, Arctic sea ice cover has declined by 30 percent during the \nmonths of September--the month that historically marked the end of the \nsummer melt season.\n  In this NASA survey photo from April 2012, you can see for miles \ntoward the horizon how thin the ice is over the Arctic Ocean, and you \ncan see open channels in the ice with icebergs in the background. That \nis a new phenomenon. That didn't exist many years ago.\n  This image is of the Arctic Ocean in April, 1 month into the spring \nmelt season. It shows just how thin the aerial coverage of Arctic sea \nis and in some places where the ice has disappeared altogether. While \nannual variation in ice coverage has always followed the seasons, the \nmelt periods are growing longer annually, meaning that much of the ice \nis never restored during the colder winter months.\n  The peak melt periods during the protracted melt seasons have opened \nup new shipping channels that we must start paying greater attention \nto.\n  A 2013 report in the ``Proceedings of the National Academy of \nSciences'' entitled ``New Trans-Atlantic shipping routes navigable by \nmid-century'' shows how declines of ice in the Arctic's rapidly \nchanging environment will have dramatic changes in international \nfreight movement.\n  Russia is already declaring that the Northern Sea Route through \nRussian territorial waters will rival the Suez Canal as a faster and \nmore efficient maritime passage between Europe and West Asia and the \nwest coasts of the United States, Canada, and East Asia. Climate, \nsurface temperature, and sea ice data were run through extensive \ncomputer modeling at UCLA, and the outcome produced pretty alarming \nresults showing how wide open the Arctic will likely become for trans-\nhemispheric transit between North America, Europe, and Asia.\n  Historically, Arctic shipping lanes to Western Europe and the North \nAtlantic, via the Bering Strait, which connect the ports of the \nPacific, including Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vancouver, \nAlaska, and all of East Asia to Western Europe and the North Atlantic, \nhave depended on ice breakers to clear channels and were only open \nduring narrow summer melt seasons. These northerly routes have \nhistorically been across the Russian side of the Arctic.\n  In recent years, the shipping channels have grown shorter in distance \nas what was once permanent and thick ice located at the Poles has \nbecome increasingly thinner with each passing warmer year. Each year, \nthe shipping routes across the Arctic are getting closer and closer to \nbeing ``over the top.''\n  The blue lines I depict on the chart I brought to the floor, this \nchart--this would not require any ice-breaking ships to assure clear \npassage during the peak of the summer melt seasons. The red lines are \nroutes that are passable by ships that can either break ice or follow \nbehind ice breakers. As you can see, from 2006 to the present, the ice-\nbreaking routes are very close to traversing directly over the North \nPole and all the other routes are in the Russian Kara, Barrents, and \nLaptev Seas.\n  The modeling data run through this peer-reviewed study, however, \nprojects that in 30 years the Arctic Ocean will reach near open water \nstatus, passable by most ships on either the Canadian or Russian side \nof the Arctic.\n  In the simplest of economic terms, climate change's impact on \ndiminished sea ice in the Arctic will be a major boon to foreign ports \nat the expense of U.S. ports.\n  The geopolitical consequences of a more open and expansive Arctic \nOcean is something we cannot afford to observe from the sidelines. The \nArctic's rapidly changing marine environment is influencing the \nterritorial claims our Arctic neighbors Canada, Russia, Denmark, \nGreenland, Iceland, and Norway are making, and all these countries are \nmaking legal advances under the law of the sea--the treaty we have not \nratified. The United States is the only Arctic nation not staking any \nexpanded claims in the Arctic, nor are we willing to challenge the \nactions of neighbors who may be encroaching on waters we may have \nclaims to.\n  The State Department cannot be blamed for not making claims or \nchallenging our neighbors because it is the U.S. Senate that has failed \nto give the State Department the ability to rightfully stake claims and \nchallenge the legality of our competitors' claims purely out of \nunfounded and ideologically partisan opposition to the United States \nbeing party to the Law of the Sea Treaty.\n  The law of the sea establishes international conventions allowing our \nneighbors to expand the reach of their economic zones, providing a \nframework for parties to the treaty to stake legal claims to mineral, \noil, and gas deposits along the Continental Shelf beyond the\n\n[[Page S7040]]\n\n200 miles of a country's conventional territorial seas--they can do \nthat under law of the sea, and we cannot; and to enjoy navigational \nfreedom between parties to the convention, making passage through \ntreaty partners' territorial seas easier--they can; we cannot. We have \nnot ratified the law of the sea. It provides legal certainty to their \nnations' industries operating in these dangerous yet potentially \nproductive waters--certainty that the United States simply cannot \nvalidly claim without being party to the Law of the Sea Treaty. Once \nagain, they can give certainty to their industries; we cannot.\n  Our Arctic neighbors' exploitation of Arctic resources is happening \nright now and is as real as climate change's impact on the Arctic \necosystems that is making these foreign economic ventures possible. \nThey couldn't do it before, but now they can do it. The reports our \nArctic Coast Guard fleet are making on the dramatic increase of \ncommercial vessel activity in Alaskan waters are testament to this new \nreality. The Coast Guard has monitored and reported on this growth, all \nof which has happened in the last decade. Heightened Arctic maritime \nactivity is directly contributing to the declining sea ice.\n  Both the Washington Times and the New York Times, while covering the \nPresident's recent trip to Alaska, reported on the increase of \ncommercial and naval fleet traffic transiting through and across the \nArctic.\n  In the New York Times story, Coast Guard Commandant ADM Paul F. \nZukunft stated: ``We [the Coast Guard] have been for some time \nclamoring about our nation's lack of capacity to sustain any meaningful \npresence in the Arctic.''\n  U.S. accession to the Law of the Sea Treaty has been a failure of \nmany Congresses, not just this one. The United States played a critical \nrole in the development of the treaty going back to the 1970s. The \nUnited States has the most to gain from being part of this treaty. For \nexample, we shaped the constructs of the treaty to be very favorable to \nthe United States, including giving the United States the only \npermanent seat on the international council that will oversee and make \ndecisions about seabed mining. Obviously that permanent seat remains \nvacant and decisions are being made about seabed mining in \ninternational waters without U.S. participation.\n  The estimated area of territorial expansion over which the United \nStates can claim sovereignty under the Continental Shelf expansion \nconventions of the treaty is estimated to be about 291,000 square miles \nor roughly one and a half times the size of Texas.\n  A broad set of stakeholders, ranging from the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, to environmental organizations, our Nation's military brass, \nindustry-specific trade groups representing commercial fishing, freight \nshipping, and mineral extraction, all support the ratification of the \nLaw of the Sea Treaty.\n  The combination of changes in the Arctic environment and changes and \nadvancement in the maritime industry technologies is making the \nbenefits this treaty stands to provide the United States greater and \ngreater with each passing year. As long as the United States is outside \nthe convention, our companies are left with two bad choices: Either \ntake their deep sea mining businesses to another country or give up the \nidea altogether. Meanwhile, China, Russia, and many other countries are \nalready securing their licenses under the convention to begin mining \nfor valuable metals and rare Earth elements.\n\n  Accompanying the previously mentioned New York Times story is a map \ndepicting the breadth and scope of the international claims that are \nbeing made in the Arctic, the most concerning of the claims are the \nones that Russia is making. This map demonstrates the urgency for U.S. \naction to ensure that these emerging opportunities don't pass us by and \ngo to our competitors.\n  The Law of the Sea Convention provides the international framework to \ndeal with these new opportunities. We are the only Arctic nation \noutside the convention. Russia and other Arctic states are advancing \ntheir Continental Shelf claims in the Arctic. Some of these claims \nencroach on waters that we could have a viable claim to if the United \nStates were a party, but we are not a party to the convention. Yet we \nwill willfully remain on the outside looking in, painfully complicit to \nlet foreign businesses better our U.S. industries. If the United States \nwere a party to the convention, the United States would have a much \nstronger basis to assert our interests throughout the entire Arctic \nregion.\n  Lastly, the absence of the United States from the treaty weakens our \nnational security. In 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff GEN Martin Dempsey testified before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee--I was present during that \ntestimony--on how our security interests are intrinsically linked to \nthe freedom of navigation. They testified in favor of the Law of the \nSea Treaty ratification.\n  The United States stands to gain considerably more from the legal \ncertainty and the public order this treaty provides on the oceans than \nany other country. The U.S. Armed Forces need the navigable rights and \nfreedoms provided under the Law of the Sea Convention, granting global \naccess to the world's oceans to ease and expedite movement to combat \nareas when necessary and to sustain our engaged deployed forces. In \n2012, the former Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman and \nranking member Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana made one of the most \ncogent set of arguments for U.S. accession to the treaty. In \nconclusion, let me quote what Senator Lugar told us at that time. I \nthink it is still relevant today. He said:\n\n       The substantial case for Law of the Sea is even stronger \n     today than it was in 2004 when I brought it up as chairman of \n     the committee. . . . Every year that goes by without the \n     United States joining the convention results in deepening our \n     country's submission to ocean laws and practices determined \n     by foreign governments without United States input.\n       Our Navy and our ocean industries operate every day in a \n     maritime environment that is increasingly dominated by \n     foreign decision-making. In almost any other context, the \n     Senate would be outraged at subjecting Americans to foreign \n     controls without United States input.\n       What many observers fail to understand about Law of the Sea \n     is that the convention already forms the basis of maritime \n     law regardless of whether the United States is a party or \n     not. International decisions related to resource \n     exploitation, navigation rights, and other matters will be \n     made in the context of the convention whether we join or not.\n       By not joining the treaty, we are abetting Russian \n     ambitions in the Arctic. We are making the job of our Navy \n     more difficult despite the longstanding and nearly unanimous \n     pleas of Navy leaders that the United States participation in \n     Law of the Sea will help them maintain navigational rights \n     more effectively and with less risk to the men and women they \n     command.\n       We are turning our backs on the requests of important \n     American industries that use the oceans and must abide by \n     rules established under this convention, and we are \n     diminishing our chances for energy independence by making \n     U.S. oil and gas exploration in international waters less \n     likely. . . . We will feel these costs more keenly in the \n     Arctic.\n       The decision . . . is whether the Senate should continue to \n     consign the United States to a position of self-imposed \n     weakness in our ability to influence ocean affairs despite \n     the fact that no organization has a greater interest in \n     navigable freedoms, a larger exclusive economic zone, or a \n     more advanced technological capacity to exploit ocean \n     resources.\n       The Senate should enthusiastically affirm the leadership of \n     the United States in this vital area of international \n     relations by giving advice and consent to the Law of the Sea \n     Convention.\n\n  I took the time to give a long explanation as to why I believe it is \nimportant for the Senate to exercise its responsibility to give advice \nand consent to a treaty that is the Law of the Sea. It is critically \nimportant that we take this issue up and that we ratify the treaty. As \nI said earlier, it is supported by the Chamber, it is supported by our \nmilitary, and it is supported by businesses. Laws are being made that \naffect the United States without our participation. By ratifying the \ntreaty, we will have a seat at the table, and we will be able to \nprotect our interests--our commercial interests, our security interests \nor whether it is the interests of our military.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't know how many times I have\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\ncome to the floor in the last several years or maybe in the last \nseveral days to talk about energy. In the process of talking energy, I \nalways say I am for ``all of the above,'' as a lot of my colleagues do; \nmeaning all forms of energy, which would be petroleum, natural gas, \nalternative energies, including biofuels and wind, conservation as a \nthird one, and nuclear energy as a fourth one. I still believe that. \nAlthough I believe some of my colleagues who say they are for ``all of \nthe above'' are for everything that is underground but not much above \nthe ground. So I think there is an inconsistency there.\n  With that background, I want to talk about something that is going to \nhappen tomorrow morning. The Senate banking committee is scheduled to \nmark up legislation called the American Crude Oil Export Equality Act. \nI don't have any fault with that action tomorrow.\n  This bill would repeal the four-decade ban on the export of \ndomestically produced crude oil. This ban was put in place in response \nto the Arab oil embargo, which created an energy crisis and led to \nfears of crude oil shortages. That goes back to the 1970s. The recent \ntechnologies of horizontal drilling and fracking of oil shale has \nresulted in enormous increases in domestic crude oil production and \nreduced oil and gas prices. This has led to the domestic oil industry's \ninsistence on repealing the export ban.\n  I am all for fair and free trade. I recognize that Iowa manufacturers \nand farmers benefit from the export markets. One of every five tractors \nproduced by John Deere is exported. Much of Iowa's agricultural \nabundance, both commodities and livestock, is exported. I understand, \nthen, the economic benefit and economic impact that vibrant export \nmarkets can have on the domestic economy, creating good-paying jobs, \nand on productivity.\n  What bothers me is not that Big Oil is on the cusp of achieving their \nhighest priority in getting Congress to pass a bill to repeal the \nexport ban, what bothers me is that Big Oil is pushing Congress to \nrepeal the ban, while at the very same time continuing to attack and \nundermine domestic renewable fuels. Iowa does not produce any crude oil \nor natural gas, but Iowa farmers lead the Nation in the production of \nhomegrown, renewable, clean ethanol and biodiesel.\n  Congress created the renewable fuel standard to guarantee that \nconsumers have a choice to buy clean renewable fuel. Big Oil has fought \ntirelessly to repeal and undermine the renewable fuel standard law \nbecause they are afraid of competition. If Big Oil wants to get the \nexport ban lifted, I would suggest they end their selfish pursuit of \nthe repeal of the renewable fuel standard.\n  Big Oil should be satisfied with achieving their highest priority, a \nrepeal of the export ban, and drop then their crusade against clean-\nburning biofuels. It is time for Big Oil to stop acting like pigs at \nthe trough. It is time for Big Oil to lay off the renewable fuel \nstandard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I understand the pending business is \nthat we are discussing the motion to proceed to the VA-Military \nConstruction bill, and I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this motion to proceed. And why? Well, because, quite simply, \nthis is a parliamentary maneuver. This isn't a real deal to get to real \nbenefits and real help for America's veterans or to modernize our \nmilitary bases. This maneuver, quite simply, is a scam. The Republican \nleadership knows we do not have enough resources for our veterans. This \nbill is inadequate. And to bring up an appropriations bill before we \nhave a new budget deal is really just a hollow gesture.\n  We passed a continuing resolution. I am so pleased we did that so we \nwould not have a government shutdown. We do not need a government \nshutdown. It is not in our national interest, it is not good for the \neconomy, it is not good for our standing in the world, and most of all \nit is not good for the way we need to help the American people, whether \nit is in the area of national security or economic security.\n  Having passed the CR, it is well known that the leadership on both \nsides of the aisle and the President want to negotiate a new budget \ndeal. So what does that mean? A new budget deal gives the Committee on \nAppropriations a top line--something called a 302(a). A 302(a) tells \nthe Committee on Appropriations what it can spend. We can't spend over \na 302(a) unless we waive the Budget Act. And the whole purpose of the \nnegotiation for the budget is to lift the cap through responsible, \nbipartisan, bicameral negotiations and to come up with additional \nrevenue by either cuts or new revenue.\n  My advice to my colleagues is don't go through trying to pass the \nbill when we know we are going to be getting a new allocation to truly \ntry to meet America's needs. We all say we love our veterans. Everybody \nwants to wear yellow ribbons, and we all want to go to Veterans Day \nobservations and so on. But I believe you show your support for \nveterans by deeds and in this case by putting forth the help we do need \nfor our veterans.\n  The bill pending now shows we need a new budget agreement. We need to \ncancel sequester--these across-the-board draconian cuts--so we can keep \nour promises to our veterans. Cloture on the motion to proceed is \nWashington-speak in order to filibuster a debate. The real debate here \nis whether the Senate will move forward with spartan Republican budget \nlevels or whether we will come up with a new deal that will enable us \nto lift the cap we have and move ahead to getting a real deal. The \nSenate passed the bill to keep the government open. Now we need a \nbudget deal that lifts the caps to make sure we have a 50-50 split \nbetween defense spending and domestic spending, acknowledging that \ndomestic spending also meets national security needs.\n  This bill is a perfect example. Military construction doesn't come \nout of DOD. There it is, in a domestic bill, and it is in the same \nsubcommittee as funding our veterans. In terms of funding our veterans, \nthe bill before us has an unacceptable cut of over $850 million from \nthe VA, yet at the same time VA costs are rising.\n  What am I talking about? Well, let's go to the new hepatitis C drugs \nthat are causing veterans to seek treatment and really get the help \nthey need. This inhibits us from buying the lifesaving drugs we need. \nThen there is the cost of the caregiver program. Those costs have \nnearly doubled since the original fiscal 2016 estimates that we \nreceived. And who are these caregivers? They are wives, spouses, \nparents taking care of really sick wounded warriors. You know those \npictures we see when we have a concert for a fundraising drive for a \nveterans charitable organization--those men who are bedridden, many who \ncan't talk, and some who have traumatic brain injury or some causing \ninjury that causes paralysis--your heart goes out to them, and we have \nfamilies taking care of them. Those families need help. The cost for \nthat care is doubling. Yet this bill doesn't take care of it. We say: \nOh, a grateful nation never forgets. Well, we seem to forget when it \ncomes time to voting on the budget.\n  We have held in the Committee on Appropriations hearing after \nhearing. The VA's Secretary McDonald testified that the budget request \nfor hepatitis C is too low by as much as $1 billion. In fiscal year \n2015 alone, the VA spent close to $700 million just on hepatitis C \ndrugs. I think we need to be able to give veterans the medications they \nneed.\n  Veterans care should not be held hostage to artificial budget caps, \nand veterans in the audience watching this should understand this is \nnot a single-year problem. This cap will be in place until 2021. \nRemember, we are not funding an agency; we are funding help for our \nveterans. We want to reduce that backlog. We want to make sure our \nhospitals are fit for duty. We want to make sure there are no waiting \nlists for veterans. We want to be sure that the way they showed up for \nAmerica, we are showing up for them. These veterans deserve to know \nthat promises we made will be the promises we keep.\n  I am asking my colleagues to get serious. Let's get a real budget \ndeal. I\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nknow the Republican leadership has been in contact with the President. \nWe need our Democratic leadership to be a part of that conversation. I \nam the vice chair of the Committee on Appropriations. This is the \ncommittee that puts the money in the Federal checkbook. I want to be \ncomplimentary about the chairman, the distinguished gentleman from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran. We know how to move bills, but what we \nneed are the right allocations given to us so we can make the right \ndecisions.\n  Now, can we make some trims here, can we make some strategic cuts? \nYes, but we need a new budget deal that lifts the caps. So I therefore \nwill vote no on the motion to proceed, which is parliamentary-speak, \nbut by voting no on the parliamentary maneuver I am saying we vote yes \nin meeting the compelling national needs we have.\n  Let's get a new budget deal, let's lift the caps, let's do it in a \nresponsible way, and let's help move America forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Signing Authority\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the junior \nSenator from Colorado be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or \njoint resolutions on Wednesday, September 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2101\n\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, from coast to coast the Land and Water \nConservation Fund is the primary tool that our Nation uses to fund the \nprotection of our natural and our cultural heritage. In my home State \nof New Mexico, the LWCF has protected some of our most iconic and \nfamous landscapes--places such as the Valles Caldera National Preserve, \nUte Mountain, and the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument. These are \nplaces families go back to year after year, generation after generation \nto camp, hunt, hike, and fish.\n  Our public lands are uniquely American, but the future of our outdoor \nplaces--all the places we enjoy as public lands--depends on the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund. We must permanently authorize and fully \nfund the LWCF. Permanently and fully funding the Land and Water \nConservation Fund will help ensure the outdoor places we all enjoy will \nbe protected for future generations to enjoy as well.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee be discharged from and the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 2101; I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read \na third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  I wish to point out the Federal Government currently owns over 600 \nmillion acres of land throughout the United States. In the opinion of \nmany Americans, that is way too much. Some of my colleagues are pushing \na piece of legislation that would reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--or LWCF--a program that is primarily used for land \nacquisition, and they want to do this without making a single reform to \nthat same program.\n  Before taking such a drastic and I believe misguided step, I would \nask my colleagues to examine the Federal Government's current \nlandholdings and in particular evaluate the manner in which they are \nbeing maintained.\n  In many Western States, the largest landholder is the Federal \nGovernment. In my home State of Utah, the Federal Government owns close \nto 70 percent of the land within the State. This reality is hard for a \nlot of my colleagues from States east of the Mississippi River to even \ncomprehend.\n  Imagine if the Federal Government could tell your constituents where \nthey could live, recreate, hunt and fish, and how they could earn a \nliving. Imagine that the Federal Government used its vast landholdings \nto block developments of the valuable natural resources. Imagine \nfurther that the Land and Water Conservation Fund was used to acquire \nprivately held lands from your constituents.\n  Given how much land the Federal Government owns, it is not surprising \nto find out that much of it is rather poorly maintained. Specifically, \nthe Department of the Interior currently has a maintenance backlog on \nFederal public lands with an estimated cost between $13.5 and $20 \nbillion. Instead of looking to acquire even more land through the LWCF, \nthe Federal Government should focus on properly managing the land it \nalready owns.\n  Make no mistake, LWCF is a land acquisition program. According to a \nCongressional Research Service report from October 2014: ``The $16.8 \nbillion appropriated throughout the history of the LWCF program has \nbeen unevenly allocated among federal land acquisition (62%), the state \ngrant program (25%), and other purposes (13%).''\n  Today we are talking about the expiration of the LWCF's ability to \naccrue additional revenues to the fund--nothing more, nothing beyond \nthat, just that. According to CRS, LWCF currently has an unappropriated \nbalance of around $20 billion that can be appropriated to implement \nLWCF projects. If we assume the current rate of appropriations, roughly \n$300 million per year, it would take around 60 years before that Fund \nwas exhausted. At full appropriation, $900 million, it would take about \n20 years. When we wake up tomorrow after allowing LWCF's authorization \nto expire, nothing will have substantively changed. Both the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources \nCommittee are working to reform the LWCF to address the numerous issues \nI have raised. I know I speak for many of my colleagues in the West \nwhen I say that LWCF reform, especially with regard to Federal land \nacquisition, is a necessary condition of reauthorization.\n  On that basis, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I also wish to speak to the issue of the \nobjection on this, the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Twenty-nine percent of all the land in the United States is already \nunder Federal ownership. Let me clarify. This is not Federal control--\nFederal ownership, 29 percent of the land. There is $20 billion in \ndeferred maintenance on that land--$20 billion. So there is a \nsignificant issue we face where a tremendous amount of land that is \nowned by the Federal Government is not being managed properly, \nincluding over $11 billion of that just in our national parks.\n  The issue here is, what is this Land and Water Conservation Fund \ngoing to be used for? Continuing to acquire new land. It is actually \nprohibited under the structure of this account, to actually do any of \nthe maintenance. So we are continuing to acquire new land constantly, \nexpanding landholdings, already at 29 percent of the total property in \nthe United States, but we are not doing maintenance on what we already \nhave, and we continue to complain there is not enough money to be able \nto go around and get this done.\n  If only this was the only program that actually did land acquisition \nin Federal control. In the past several years, there have been 130 \nconservation banks also set up by the Fish and Wildlife Service. These \n130 different conservation banks that are scattered around the United \nStates actually take private land and set it aside for what they call \nperpetual--perpetual--set-aside. This is land that is still in private \nownership, but that is under conservation that can never be changed \nfrom its current status. Just in the recent decades, 160,000 acres have \nbeen moved into what they are calling these conservation banks.\n  To reiterate, we have a growing amount of land that is being taken in \nFederal ownership through the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and \nthen we have a separate set of programs--and this is only one of many \nprograms--that is moving other land into Federal control and \nmitigation, and we have this expanding control of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\n  We should have National Parks. We should have land that is set aside \nfor public use. That is not the issue, but we are not taking care of \nwhat we currently have. The key issue is, what do we do with this \nprogram, and how do we reform it. As has already been mentioned, it is \nthe key issue. If the Land and Water Conservation Fund has a reform, \nthere are ways to be able to handle some of our deferred maintenance \nand the backlog that is there. If it doesn't have any reform at all, we \nare continuing to purchase new land, but one key thing that is in this \nas well, as it currently stands right now, the Land and Water \nConservation continues to function. Nothing changes about it. The only \nthing that changes, as of tomorrow, is that we are not adding new \ndollars into it. Twenty billion dollars is already sitting in that \nfund, enough money to fund this program at current rates for 65 \nyears'--65 years'--worth of savings that is already built up in this \nprogram. I think it is fairly safe at this point. Strangely enough, the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund is more stable than Social Security \nis.\n  So the argument is that there is some urgent emergency here to be \nable to take care of it, and to continue to add dollars to it without \nreform I think will not work. We need to reform this program. We need \nto manage carefully the land we have, and we can do that.\n  I would highly suggest that the committees continue to do their work \nto be able to continue to reform this program. With that, I would also \njoin in the objection to extending it as it currently exists today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, my colleague from Utah purports to speak \nfor westerners. I want to make it clear, he doesn't speak for New \nMexico, he doesn't speak for me, he doesn't speak for my constituents, \nand he certainly doesn't speak for the businesses that write letters to \nme speaking about how the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nbenefited their businesses--particularly businesses that rely on \ntourism and outdoor recreation, that rely on places like the Valles \nCaldera National Preserve, that rely on places like the Rio Grande \nNational Monument for their livelihood. The reason why, as westerners, \nI can take my kids out and go hunting on public land and the reason we \ncan go camping and cut firewood to heat our homes is because of the \npublic land the Land and Water Conservation Fund has provided in places \nlike New Mexico.\n  We had a hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. If \nanything, what we heard is that we didn't need to reform this program; \nthat, frankly, it was working better than just about any program in the \nFederal Government.\n  LWCF works. It has broad bipartisan support. It creates recreation \njobs that are key to Western States. LWCF buys from willing sellers in \nplaces that oftentimes reduce how much we spend on maintaining, \nprotecting, and managing our Federal lands. Imagine in-holdings that \nmake it harder for our foresters to manage wildfires and to protect and \ndo the work. We need to do a better job of managing wildfires across \nthe West.\n  So many of these issues that have been raised, particularly reform, \nare a red herring for what is truly an ideological opposition to the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund--a program that has put soccer fields \nand baseball diamonds in just about every little town across the United \nStates. All of my counties, many of my cities, have benefited from \nsports fields specifically from this fund for decades now, as well as \npurchases like the new National Wildlife Refuge in Albuquerque's South \nValley, the Valle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge, something the local \ncommunity has enormous pride in. They had a friends group set up for \nthis wildlife refuge before the refuge even existed.\n  So it is an indication of just how off base and out of the mainstream \nsome of our conversations in Washington, DC, have become that we have \nthis ideological opposition to the Land and Water Conservation Fund--a \nprogram that is actually working as it was designed to work and that \nhas broad bipartisan support from one coast to the other in this \nNation.\n  So I am disappointed in the actions of my colleagues. This issue is \nnot going away. We have a strong coalition. We are going to continue to \nfight for the reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nI would argue that we ought to stop taking money out of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund and using it to cover other expenses within the \ngeneral fund; that we should remain true to the concept of this fund as \nit was created back in the 1960s, under Secretary Udall, and return to \na level of fiscal responsibility, where the money flowing into the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund actually benefits land and water.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, time is running out for the Senate to act \nto save the Federal Perkins Loan Program.\n  If we do nothing, this critical program that makes college affordable \nfor 30,000 students per year in Illinois will expire at the end of the \nday.\n  Perkins was first authorized as part of the National Defense \nEducation Act of 1958; and, unlike Federal student loans that we often \nthink about, Perkins is a campus-based loan program.\n  Participating colleges and universities make low-interest federally \nsubsidized loans to students with exceptional financial need.\n  The program also offers forgiveness and cancellation options to \nqualifying borrowers.\n  The real key to Perkins is the flexibility it offers to schools to \nprovide financial aid to students to make up for gaps in costs that \nPell or other financial aid may not cover.\n  If a student has an unexpected change in the financial situation of \ntheir family, say a parent loses a job, Perkins allows a college or \nuniversity to step in and provide aid to that student to allow them to \ncontinue their studies.\n  The campus-based nature of the program means that students' \nindividual financial needs can be met more effectively, and in my home \nState of Illinois, more than 150 institutions of higher education \nprovide Perkins loans.\n  College presidents and financial aid administrators across Illinois \nhave told me that without this key piece to the Federal financial aid \npuzzle, many students may be left behind, unable to afford a college \neducation.\n  But it does not have to come to that.\n  The House sent us a bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support \nthat would extend this worthy program for another year.\n  I am disappointed that an attempt to take up and pass this House \nmeasure to continue the Perkins program was blocked today on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Despite today's setback, I hope the Senate will still act to extend \nthe Federal Perkins Loan Program and help keep college in reach for \nmore than half a million students across the country who rely on this \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7043-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7043-S7044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGETARY REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on \ndiscretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those \nlimits, while section 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 allows the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make \nrevisions to allocation, aggregates, and levels consistent with those \nadjustments. Today, the Senate passed\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nH.R. 719, the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015, with \nSenate amendment 2689, the continuing resolution. This measure included \na provision providing $700 million to the wildland fire management \naccount for the U.S. Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture \nthat was designated as emergency funding pursuant to section \n251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Deficit Control Act of 1985. \nThe inclusion of this designation makes this spending eligible for an \nadjustment under the Congressional Budget Act.\n  As a result, I am revising the budgetary aggregate for 2016 by $700 \nmillion in budget authority and $700 million in outlays. I am also \nrevising the 2016 allocations for budget authority and outlays to the \nAppropriations Committee by $700 million in budget authority for the \nrevised nonsecurity category and $700 million in outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this notice and the accompanying tables, \nwhich provide details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES--\n [Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and S.\n  Con.

Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous \nconsent request at the present time relating to the nomination of Brian \nJames Egan, of Maryland, to be Legal Adviser of the Department of \nState.\n  I will object because the Department of State has failed to fully \nrespond to almost a dozen outstanding letters dating back to 2013. In \naddition, on August 20, 2015, my staff met with Department officials in \nan effort to prioritize material for production. The Department has \nfailed to comply with its commitments, producing material late, failing \nto provide all requested material, and even failing to provide material \nto the Senate Judiciary Committee contemporaneously with providing the \nsame documents to Freedom of Information Act requestors.\n  This past August, I warned the Department that if it failed to change \nits ways that I would be forced to escalate the scope of my intent to \nobject to unanimous consent requests for Department nominees. Since \nthen, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chairman \nhas joined me in requesting witness interviews of Department employees. \nDespite the Department's commitment to make witnesses available and \nassist in the identification of additional relevant witnesses, none of \nthese interviews have actually been scheduled. The Department needs to \nrespond in good faith to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Thus far, it has \nprimarily been promises with little or no followthrough. The \nDepartment's good faith will be measured in documents delivered and \nwitnesses provided.\n  My objection is not intended to question the credentials of Mr. Egan \nin any way. However, the Department must recognize that it has an \nongoing obligation to respond to congressional inquiries in a timely \nand reasonable manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7044-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE MARINE MAMMAL CENTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Over the years, MMC \nsteadily expanded its efforts to emerge as the only organization \nauthorized by the National Marine Mammal Fisheries Service to rescue \nill or injured marine mammals along 600 miles of California coast.

MMC offers educational programs that engage the public and \nenrich science education for children, and their recently renovated \nheadquarters will expand these efforts by allowing visitors to watch \nrescued animals be cared for at their modern animal hospital facility.\n  For 40 years, MMC has worked tirelessly to protect our magnificent \nmarine animals, and I know their work will continue to make a profound \ndifference for this generation and every generation to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7044-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and \nhonor Calvary Baptist Church of Charleston, SC, who will celebrate \ntheir 150th anniversary on October 10, 2015.\n  In 1865, the Calvary Baptist Church was founded by Reverend Charles \nSmalls as the Baptist Church in Charleston. The church is known as a \nthe founding member of the Baptist Education and Missionary Convention \nof South Carolina and Gethsemane, the first African American Baptist \nAssociation in South Carolina.\n  Calvary was damaged, but not destroyed, by an earthquake in 1886, \nrebuilt after being burned down in April 1887, and repaired after a \n1938 tornado. Commendably, Calvary Baptist Church has endured tough \ntimes, but still managed to greatly prosper.\n  Calvary Baptist Church is an example of a group who remains committed \nto Christ and community. During the civil rights movement, the church \nfought for justice and equal opportunity. Their leadership has helped \nboth the Charleston community and our beloved country march forward.\n  Today, Reverend Arthur Evans, Sr., continues to lead the congregation \nwith praise, love, and worship. Calvary has shown tremendous faith \nthrough works of charity, and their honorable legacy will forever be \nappreciated. I acknowledge with pleasure the church's influence in \nCharleston and therefore recognize their growth, success, and 150 years \nrooted in faith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7044-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7044-S7045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OTTAWA UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 150th \nanniversary of\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nthe founding of Ottawa University in Ottawa, KS.\n  Ottawa University has grown from a single building in 1865 to a \ncomprehensive, global institution of higher learning dedicated to \npreparing and educating students to have a lifetime of enlightened \nfaith, exemplary service, inspired leadership, and personal growth and \nsignificance.\n  The university traces its roots to a strong partnership between \nBaptist missionaries and the Ottawa Indian tribe. In 1865, the \npartnership between members of the Baptist church and the Ottawa Indian \ntribe, under the leadership of Tauy Jones, led to the founding of a \nschool for the benefit of children of the Ottawa Indian tribe. \nOriginally chartered as a boarding school, OU's leaders also recognized \nthe importance of offering a college-level education and having a \ncollege to serve as an economic growth engine for the community \nemerging around the Marais des Cygnes River.\n  Ottawa University's partnership with the Ottawa Indian tribe remains \nstrong. In 2008, Kevin C. Eichner, president of Ottawa University, and \nChief John Ballard of the Ottawa Tribe of Oklahoma, entered into an \nagreement to grant, in perpetuity, free tuition and room and board to \nall certified members of the Ottawa tribe who wish to attend the \nresidential college in Ottawa, KS, or any of OU's adult on-ground or \nonline programs. This 2008 agreement has been widely embraced and \ncelebrated by members of the tribe and the faculty, alumni, board \nmembers, and friends of OU as emblematic of the institution's core \nmission and principles and its enduring commitment to maintaining a \nstrong partnership with the Ottawa Indian tribe.\n  Throughout its history, Ottawa University has pursued an innovative \napproach to higher education. In the 1970s, OU was among the first \nuniversities to embrace a growing demand for programs of higher \neducation specifically tailored to the needs of adult students, opening \nan adult campus in Kansas City in 1974; Phoenix, AZ, in 1977; \nBrookfield, WI, in 1992; Jeffersonville, IN, in 2002; and Chandler, AZ, \nin 2009. In 2008, OU began offering complete degree programs online.\n  Today, Ottawa University serves more than 5,000 students from 50 \nStates and six countries. The university employs more than 200 faculty \nand staff who are committed to ensuring that each student receives a \nhigh-quality education that honors OU's mission and history. Today \nthere are more than 23,000 distinguished OU graduates serving their \ncommunities, professions, and churches around the world.\n  Congratulations to Ottawa University on the 150th anniversary of its \nfounding, its enduring partnership with the Ottawa Indian tribe, and \nthe achievements of all faculty, staff, students, and alumni who have \ncontributed to the university's success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7045-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MIKE HORSLEY\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and the \nhighest regards that I speak on the retirement of my long-time friend \nand valued constituent James Michael Horsley. Mike announced his \nretirement as president of the Alabama Hospital Association earlier \nthis year and is planning to transition to his next venture in \nNovember.\n  Mike has had a long and distinguished career with the Alabama \nHospital Association and has represented well the interests of \nhospitals and the patients they serve. His tremendous knowledge of the \nhealth care industry has been a valuable resource for members of the \nAlabama delegation. This knowledge is grounded not only in his 24 years \nof service to the association but also in his service to the State as \ncommissioner of both the Alabama Medicaid Agency and the Alabama \nDepartment of Mental Health. His knowledge of health policy is \nunparalleled in the State and his expertise will be sorely missed as we \ncontinue to discuss the myriad of issues concerning health care \ndelivery.\n  Not only is Mike well versed in health policy, but he is also a \nskilled negotiator, who has been able to convene diverse interests and \nfacilitate lasting solutions that benefit all parties. He is respected \nas a man for his word, with a reputation for being ethical in all of \nhis endeavors.\n  Mike is a strategic thinker who possesses the ability to find \ninnovative solutions for seemingly insurmountable challenges. Under his \nleadership, Alabama's hospitals have been able to provide \nextraordinarily good care with very limited resources. In addition, he \nhas been very active in highlighting the inequalities of the current \nMedicare wage index payment mechanism and advocating for a change of \nthe broken system. I commend Mike's tireless work to reform the \nMedicare Area Wage Index, and I am proud to have worked with him on \nmany successful endeavors to improve the wage index. In 2003, after \nleadership by the Alabama Hospital Association, the Congress passed \nlegislation that improved the wage index for several rural States. The \naction resulted in payment gains for hospitals in Alabama of \napproximately $1 million per hospital per year. The State of Alabama \nhas been lucky to have him as their champion on this issue.\n  I also want to commend him for his exemplary service to his country \nas an active member of the U.S. Navy and as a long-time reservist. Mike \nwas a respected intelligence officer who retired at the rank of captain \nand was responsible for keeping many of our Navy men and women out of \nharm's way.\n  In addition to this remarkable career and military service, Mike is \nalso a devoted husband, father, and grandfather. He has been married to \nWanda for almost 40 years, and together, they have one son and two \ngrandchildren. In light of these and all of his many accomplishments, I \nwant to congratulate him on his outstanding career and to wish him the \nbest in his impending retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7045-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7045-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/30/senate-section/article/S7045-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7045-S7046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO TERMINATE THE DESIGNATIONS OF \nSEYCHELLES, URUGUAY, AND VENEZUELA AS BENEFICIARY DEVELOPING COUNTRIES \n    UNDER THE GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES (GSP) PROGRAM--PM 24\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as \namended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)), I am providing \nnotification of my intent to terminate the designations of Seychelles, \nUruguay, and Venezuela as beneficiary developing countries under the \nGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP) program.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to help build \na stronger health care workforce; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Blunt \nin the reintroduction of the Building a Health Care Workforce for the \nFuture Act.\n  According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, by 2025, \nthere will be a shortage of up to 90,000 physicians. Approximately 1/3 \nof the shortage, up to 31,100 will be in primary care. Individuals and \nfamilies living in underserved areas, urban and rural, will continue to \nbe those most disadvantaged by this shortage.\n  Last year, we expanded our health care system to provide health \ninsurance to millions more Americans. In fact, recent studies have \nshown that the uninsured rate has decreased to the lowest level since \n1997 over the last 2 years. In Rhode Island, the uninsured rate \ndecreased by half, down to 5 percent. As a result, millions of \nAmericans are going to the doctor for preventive health care for the \nfirst time. In order for these efforts to be successful, we must expand \nour health care workforce to ensure that we have enough health care \nprofessionals to treat the newly insured.\n  The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would \nauthorize programs that would grow the overall number of health care \nproviders, as well as encourage providers to pursue careers in \ngeographic and practice areas of highest need.\n  Building on the success of the National Health Service Corp, NHSC, \nScholarship and Loan Repayment Programs, and the State Loan Repayment \nProgram, this legislation would establish a state scholarship program. \nLike the NHSC State Loan Repayment Program, States would be able to \nreceive a dollar-for-dollar match to support individuals that commit to \npracticing in the State in which the scholarship was issued after \ncompleting their education and training. At least 50 percent of the \nfunding would be required to support individuals committed to pursuing \ncareers in primary care. The States would have the flexibility to use \nthe remaining 50 percent to support scholarships to educate students in \nother documented health care professional shortages in the state that \nare approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The Building a Health Care Workforce for the Future Act would also \nauthorize grants to medical schools to develop primary care mentors on \nfaculty and in the community. According to the Association of American \nMedical Colleges, graduating medical students consistently state that \nrole models are one of the most important factors affecting the career \npath they choose. Building a network of primary care mentors in the \nclassroom and in a variety of practice settings will help guide more \nmedical students into careers in primary care.\n  The legislation would couple these mentorship grants with an \ninitiative to improve the education and training offered by medical \nschools in competencies most critical to primary care, including \npatient-centered medical homes, primary and behavioral health \nintegration, and team-based care.\n  It would also direct the Institute of Medicine, IOM, to study and \nmake recommendations about ways to limit the administrative burden on \nproviders in documenting cognitive services delivered to patients. \nPrimary care providers treat patients in need of these services almost \nexclusively, and as such, spend a significant percentage of their day \ndocumenting care. That is not the case for providers who perform \nprocedures, like surgeries. This IOM study would help uncover ways to \nsimplify documentation requirements, particularly for delivering \ncognitive services, in order to eliminate one of the potential factors \nthat may discourage medical students from pursuing careers in primary \ncare.\n  Providers across the spectrum of care recognize that this bipartisan \nlegislation is part of the solution to addressing the looming health \ncare workforce shortage and have lent their support, including: the \nAlliance for Specialty Medicine, the American Association of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the American Association of Colleges of \nOsteopathic Medicine, the Association of Academic Health Centers, and \nthe Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\n  I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders as well \nas Senator Blunt and our colleagues to pass the Building a Health Care \nWorkforce for the Future Act in order to help ensure patients have \naccess to the health care they need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. McCaskill, \n        Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Baldwin, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Hirono, and Ms. \n        Warren):\n  S. 2110. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974 to provide for greater spousal protection under defined \ncontribution plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women's \nPension Protection Act of 2015.\n  Out in Washington State, I recently heard from a woman named Cathy. A \nfew years ago, Cathy said she got a taste of what it is like to have \nserious doubts about her future in retirement. Her husband was \nunemployed. On one income, they were trying to pay the bills, pay for \nhealth insurance, and pay for college tuition for their younger son. \nEvery month, Cathy said they had to dip further and further into their \nretirement savings. She said she would stay awake at night, worrying \nhow they were going to make it all work.\n  When I hear stories like Cathy's, it reaffirms for me what we should \nbe working on in Congress. We need to grow our economy from the middle \nout, not the top down. Our country should work for all families, not \njust the wealthiest few. That is especially true for seniors--who, \nafter a lifetime of hard work, deserve to live healthy, full, and \nfinancially secure lives.\n  I believe a secure retirement is one of the surest hallmarks of a \nstrong middle class. But seniors today are facing some daunting \nchallenges, just like Cathy.\n  Many Americans simply don't have enough savings. They are relying on \nthin Social Security checks that barely last until the end of the \nmonth. Sometimes, they are forced to choose between paying for \ngroceries or paying for a prescription.\n  Too often, it is women who struggle the most with financial hardship \nin retirement, more so than men. Why is this? Well, for one, women live \nlonger than men. So, they are more likely to outlive their retirement \nsavings.\n  But there are also some systemic challenges we need to address to \nmake sure women are better able to have a secure retirement. During \ntheir working years, women earn less than men. Today, women make just \n78 cents for every dollar a man makes. That is just patently unfair. \nWomen are more likely than men to work low-wage jobs. In fact, women \ncomprise two-thirds of all minimum-wage workers. It is plain and simple \nmath: Lower wages make it hard to support a family, let alone save \nenough for retirement. Women are also much more likely to work part-\ntime, sometimes so they can take on caregiving responsibilities.\n  This earnings gap leads to a retirement gap later in life. Don't \nforget, workers in low wage and part-time jobs, often don't have access \nto a retirement savings plan at work. A new GAO report shows that \nworkers in low-wage and part-time jobs are among the least likely to \nparticipate in a workplace retirement plan. It is mainly because these \nplans are not offered or because they are not eligible. Keep in mind \nthis is particularly problematic for women, because they make up the \nmajority of low-wage and part-time workers.\n  It is not that these workers don't want to save for their future. \nThis same GAO report found that when given the opportunity, a majority \nof part-time workers and workers in low-wage jobs do participate in \nretirement plans. For a long time, people assumed that these workers \nwould not take advantage of a workplace retirement account or that they \ncouldn't afford to save. This report busts that myth. Instead, it is \nthe lack of access to retirement plans that prevent many workers from \nsaving.\n  But, as if all that wasn't enough, 401k plans today lack basic \nconsumer protections. I have heard from advocates who work with women \nwhose husbands cashed out their 401k during a separation or right \nbefore a divorce. Right now, there is nothing in the law that prevents \nthat from happening. That is just not right.\n  Without consumer protections, both husbands and wives are at risk of \nhaving the rug pulled out from under them because their spouse made a \nfinancial decision without their knowledge.\n  These challenges--from inequality in the workplace to gaps in \nconsumer protections--won't just go away. In fact, they will only get \nworse until we resolve to do something about it for seniors today, for \nthose who want to retire in the next few years, and for future \ngenerations.\n  Thankfully, we can do something about it. We need to address the \ninequalities that women face during their working years. It is time to \nfinally ensure women get equal pay for equal work. The Paycheck \nFairness Act would tackle pay discrimination head-on. I hope we can all \nagree that in the 21st century, workers should be paid fairly for the \nwork they do, regardless of their gender.\n  We should raise the minimum wage to $12 by 2020. It will put more \nmoney in workers' pockets so they can spend it in their local \ncommunities and put more away for retirement. My bill will provide a \nstrong floor--a Federal bare minimum--that workers and cities can build \noff of and go even higher where it makes sense--like in Seattle in my \nhome State of Washington.\n  It is time to make more progress on paid sick leave, so women aren't \npenalized for taking care of their families. I have introduced a bill \ncalled the Healthy Families Act to allow workers to earn paid sick \ndays. Those solutions to empower women in today's workplace will pay \noff for their golden years to come.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce a bill with a number of my Democratic \nwomen colleagues. It is called the Women's Pension Protection Act, and \nit would take three major steps to protect women's retirement security.\n  First, my bill would expand spousal protections to cover defined \ncontribution plans, like 401(k)s. These protections already exist for \ndefined benefit plans, and it is just common sense to extend these \nprotections to defined contribution plans as well. It would help \nimprove access to retirement savings plans for part-time workers. This \nbill would improve women's financial literacy. With fewer traditional \npensions, people will need to make some difficult financial decisions \nin retirement. So, increasing financial literacy will be very important \nin the years ahead.\n  Ensuring women are able to access a secure retirement is part of my \nongoing work to help our economy grow in the way we know is strongest: \nfrom the middle out, not the top down.\n  Eighty years ago, Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security \nAct into law. At the time, he called it ``a cornerstone in a structure, \nwhich is being built, but it is, by no means, complete.'' We added on \nto that original cornerstone with Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older \nAmericans Act. Those programs laid the foundation for seniors to have \nsolid footing in America's middle class.\n  Now, it is time to build on that foundation. Because like FDR foresaw \n80 years ago, the structure of retirement security is still incomplete. \nWe need to start the next phase to address the pressing challenges that \nseniors face today.
