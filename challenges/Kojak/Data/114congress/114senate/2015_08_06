Mr. President, Congress needs to find a fiscally-\nresponsible solution to wildfire funding and fire borrowing. While the \nForest Service still has half a billion dollars remaining for fire \nsuppression, there are years when firefighting costs exceed predicted \nfunding levels. We need a focused discussion on this issue and I plan \nto begin the conversation with key offices and States--Wyoming, Oregon, \nIdaho, Arizona, Alaska, Washington, California, Nevada, Montana, \nColorado, and others that would like to join and will be constructive \nto its resolution. I know there are differences of opinion out there as \nto how to solve this problem, but the key to solving it is getting \neveryone in a room to discuss it. As cap adjustments are under the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on a durable and long-lasting solution that fits our fiscal \npriorities and is responsible budgeting.\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nWyoming that we need to find a solution to this problem and I have \nintroduced legislation with Senator Crapo that currently sits in the \nBudget Committee. Oregon is on fire and the Forest Service tells me \nthat with current fire seasons getting longer and current budgetary \nconstraints, the days of spending over 50 percent of their budget on \nsuppressing fires is here to stay. The time for talking is coming to an \nend and the time to negotiate a fix to this very serious problem is at \nhand. I would like to work under the leadership of my friend, the \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee, over the summer, on an answer \nto this chronic problem.\n Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nWyoming. Senator Murkowski and I have been working together to propose \na solution to this problem as well, and I am proud to be able to say \nthat we have been working with Senator Enzi, Senator Wyden, and our \nother colleagues. We have to enable the Forest Service to have both the \nresources it needs to deal with wildfires, but also the resources it \nneeds to manage the National forests. The current system of paying for \nwildfires by, perpetually, taking funding away from the programs that \nenable the Agency to maintain recreation facilities and complete \nimportant restoration projects is simply unacceptable. We can't sit \nidle and expect this budget issue to fix itself. We all agree a budget \ncap adjustment of some sort is the solution needed to end the practice \nof fire borrowing. I appreciate Senator Wyden's efforts to fix this \nproblem, and I appreciate Senator Murkowski's recent work to fix this \nproblem. Most of these solutions have the common theme of requiring a \nbudget cap adjustment, and we are looking to your leadership, Senator \nEnzi, to assist us with that. People's homes are burning because of \nthese wildfires. We need to get the Forest Service and the Department \nof the Interior the money they need to respond to wildfires, but we \nalso need to ensure the money is being well spent. We have a number of \nideas to round out the solution. I will be working over the summer with \nmy colleagues to develop comprehensive legislation that solves this \nbudget problem, but also ensures we see fewer large wildfires and fewer \nhouses being lost to them. Our solution--and I want to emphasize our--\nwill be a solution that is easy to explain to the public and that is \nable to get to the President's desk to be enacted.\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for his leadership on the important issue of \nwildfire\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nbudgeting. I think we all agree that the way wildfire management has \nbeen funded is broken and that it is past time that we fix it. Earlier \nthis year, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that I chair reported \nthe Interior Appropriations bill. My bill provided full funding for the \naverage annual cost of fire fighting over the past 10 years, and \nincluded a limited cap adjustment to access disaster relief funding \nonly if the agencies exhaust 100 percent of that 10-year average of \nwildfire suppression funds. This proposal would end the disruptive and \nunsustainable practice of borrowing from, and later repaying money to, \nother government programs to deal with fire emergencies, while also \nproviding up front the resources the agencies need to fight fires in \nall but the most extreme years. But there is more to the issue of \nwildfire budgeting as my colleague, Senator Cantwell, points out. We \nneed to ensure the dollars Congress appropriates are well spent. \nSenator Cantwell has some good ideas on how to do that. I stand ready \nto work with my colleagues to advance a solution that will finally fix \nthis longstanding problem in a fiscally responsible manner.\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to support the efforts of the \nSenator from Wyoming to address budgetary issues impacting how our \nNation fights wildfires. Like the State of Wyoming, Idaho's forested \nlands are consistently under threat of catastrophic wildfires. \nAccording to the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, in the last \nyear alone there were 1,456 wildland fires in Idaho that burned 714,057 \nacres. As more resources go toward fire suppression, resources that \ncould be used to implement projects that improve forest health, benefit \nforest communities, and enhance public safety are squeezed. We know \nthat wildfires are going to continue to be a threat, and we can better \nprepare for the increasing costs of wildland fire management by making \nneeded changes that will support the preparation of firefighters and \nland managers. That is why I partnered with Senator Ron Wyden in \nintroducing legislation, the Wildfire Disaster Funding Act, to provide \nfor more efficient and effective fire management. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues across the West, and in the Senate Budget \nCommittee in particular, on legislation that would better budget for \nour Nation's fire suppression activities.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to commend the Budget \nCommittee chairman for his ongoing efforts to tackle the fire-borrowing \nissue. We all agree that the Forest Service should receive the funding \nit needs to fight fires. I am also glad that there is growing agreement \nthat the Forest Service should budget for 100 percent of its wildfire \nsuppression costs as proposed in legislation introduced by me and my \ncolleagues, Senator Flake and Senator Barrasso. We also know that \nscience has shown how forest restoration is highly effective in \nreducing wildfire severity. I look forward to working with Senator \nWyden and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee on an agreeable \nsolution that protects wildfire prevention and wildfire suppression as \nthe two top priorities of the Forest Service.\n Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, there is wide agreement that the \ncurrent wildfire funding system is broken. There is no doubt that \nwildfires are disastrous and the cost to suppress them continues to \ngrow. But we cannot let the costly and disastrous nature of wildfire \nmake us lose sight that many of the costs of fighting fire can be \nanticipated. Like Senator McCain, I am pleased that there is growing \nconsensus that the fiscally responsible way to deal with these \nwildfires is to allow access to additional funds through a limited \nprocess only after agencies have been appropriated for 100 percent of \nthe anticipated costs of suppression. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on enacting this funding fix as well as incorporating \nprovisions that ease the removal of the hazardous fuels that create \nfire-prone landscapes.\n Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I want to thank the senior \nSenator from Wyoming and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee for \nhis steadfast approach to addressing budget priorities in a responsible \nand fiscally sound manner. There is bipartisan agreement to end the \npractice of fire borrowing. If Congress is going to consider budgetary \ncap adjustments under the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee, the \nForest Service should first budget for 100 percent of its wildfire \nsuppression costs before cap adjustments are made. In order to bring \ndown the long-term cost of wildfire suppression, Congress should also \nactively engage in supporting activities which reduce the cost and \nseverity of wildfire such as hazardous fuels treatments, thinning, and \nother active forest management projects. I have joined with Senators \nMcCain and Flake on legislation to address these issues. I have also \nput forward legislation to treat more acres to improve forest health \nand reduce the risk of wildfire. I want to work with my colleagues in \nthe Senate, and specifically Chairman Enzi, to prevent future fire \nborrowing and reduce the long-term economic and ecological costs \nassociated with wildfires.\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, yesterday, the Forest Service \nannounced that for the first time in its 110-year history, it is \nspending more than 50 percent of its budget just to fight wildfires. \nThe Forest Service expects this problem to keep getting worse. Within a \ndecade, they are projecting that firefighting costs will rise to two \nthirds of the Forest Service budget. The Forest Service can no longer \nsustain these costs of fighting wildfires while continuing other \ncritical functions of managing our Federal forests. It is long overdue \nthat Congress eliminate the vicious cycle of fire borrowing, where the \nForest Service is forced to dig further and further into its budget to \nfight fires at the expense of critical work to reduce hazardous fuels \nfrom the forest and other forest management. I am very grateful that we \nhave such a strong bipartisan group of colleagues working together on \nthis critical matter. I thank my colleagues who are joining me today, \nand I note that it is this kind of bipartisan cooperation that gets the \nissues done, along with the strong leadership of Senator Wyden who has \nchampioned this issue with a bipartisan bill for the last two \nCongresses, in addition to the strong leadership of Senator Murkowski \nwhich allowed us to take a big step in the right direction in the \nInterior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2016. It is crucial to our \ncommunities facing threats of wildfire that we keep this cooperation \ngoing. I will keep working with my colleagues to solve this urgent \nbudgetary crisis.\n Mr. DAINES. I want to thank Chairman Enzi for his commitment \nto solving the wildfire funding challenge that is increasingly forcing \nthe Forest Service to spend more of its budget suppressing fires rather \nthan preventing them through enhanced management. Like many other \nWestern States, Montana has already experienced several high-intensity \nfires this year. The fire season thus far has been one of the worst in \nthe past decade and has only made more evident the urgent need for a \nwildfire funding solution. As a cosponsor of the Wildfire Disaster \nFunding Act, I believe it is critical that Congress end fire borrowing \nand ensure that the Forest Service can spend more of its budget on \nmaking our National forests more resilient to fire, while also \nequipping the Agency with the tools and authorities it needs to restore \nactive management. I look forward to working with Chairman Enzi, other \nBudget Committee members, and fellow colleagues to find consensus on \nthese high-priority reforms.\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in wanting to \nfix the way we fund fire. We have to start using common sense and \nbudget for catastrophic wildfires like we do for other natural \ndisasters. Unfortunately, due to congressional inaction and growing \ncosts associated with fighting wildfires, the Forest Service is \nincreasingly turning into a firefighting agency. This means fewer \nresources for smart public land management. Montana's National forests \nbenefit our outdoor recreation economy, support timber jobs in rural \ncommunities, and preserve the drinking water that Montanans rely on. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto address both the issues of fire borrowing and the increasing costs \nof fighting fires. The Forest Service cannot continue to absorb these \nincreasing costs without undermining other critical priorities, from \ntimber harvest and research to conservation\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\nand recreation management. There is real bipartisan support for getting \nsomething done on this issue and I am confident a growing number of our \ncolleagues will join us as we push forward this fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/06/senate-section/article/S6431-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6431-S6432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which we will celebrate \ntoday, August 6. I want to spend a few minutes talking about Freedom \nSummer, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, \nthe civil rights challenges we still face today, and how Senators can \nwork together to make this a more perfect union and guarantee equal \njustice under the law to all Americans, as promised by our \nConstitution.\n  On January 23, 1964, the States ratified the 24th Amendment to the \nConstitution, which provides that ``the rights of citizens of the \nUnited States to vote in any primary or other [Federal] election . . . \nshall not be denied or abridged . . . by any State by reason of failure \nto pay any poll tax or other tax.''\n  Freedom Summer was a campaign in Mississippi to register Black voters \nduring the summer of 1964. In 1964, most Black voters were \ndisenfranchised by law or practice in Mississippi, notwithstanding the \n15th Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1870. The \n15th Amendment provides that ``the rights of citizens of the United \nStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by . . . any State on \naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.''\n  The national uproar in response to the deaths of three civil rights \nworkers--James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael ``Mickey'' \nSchwerner--helped lead to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nSouthern States, however, continued to impose barriers on African-\nAmerican citizens' right to vote even after the enactment of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964.\n  The following summer, Martin Luther King, Jr. and other civil rights \nleaders led a series of voter registration marches from Selma to \nMontgomery, AL. Ultimately, the marchers were met with force on March \n7, 1965, known as Bloody Sunday, at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \nMontgomery, AL. Television news reports shocked the conscience of \nAmericans, who could not believe that their fellow citizens were \nruthlessly beaten by the police while exercising their First Amendment \nright to peaceably assemble and petition their government for redress \nof grievances.\n  A few days later, President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed a joint \nsession of Congress and called for the enactment of the Voting Rights \nAct, ended his speech with the old refrain from the civil rights \nmovement: we shall overcome. Congress did act and pass the Voting \nRights Act, as this week we celebrate the 50th anniversary.\n  So as we celebrate the anniversaries of these landmark pieces of \ncivil rights legislation, we are reminded that there is more work to be \ndone. Today I must urge my colleagues to address the recent pernicious \nefforts to restrict the franchise and limit access to the fundamental \nright to vote. This past weekend, The New York Times Magazine ran an \narticle entitled ``Overcome,'' about a systematic effort by a small \ngroup of activists to dismantle the protections in the Voting Rights \nAct. I commend this article for review by my colleagues.\n  Two summers ago, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, which struck down section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, \ninvalidating the coverage formula that determines which jurisdictions \nare subject to the preclearance provisions of the act.\n  Congress must act to reverse the decision by the Supreme Court which \noverturned several important precedents. As much as we wish it wasn't \nso, racism has not disappeared from America and there continue to be \nindividuals and groups who would use our voting system to deliberately \nminimize the rights of minority voters. Congress overwhelmingly \nreauthorized the Voting Rights Act in 2006 after building an extensive \nrecord that made a compelling case for the continued need to protect \nminority voters from discrimination.\n  I strongly agree with Justice Ginsburg's dissent that ``in truth, the \nevolution of voting discrimination into more subtle second-generation \nbarriers is powerful evidence that a remedy as effective as \npreclearance remains vital to protect minority voting rights and \nprevent backsliding.'' I am deeply disappointed that the Court put \nvoting rights in jeopardy by ignoring reality and disregarding the \npower of Congress to enforce the 15th Amendment of the Constitution by \nappropriate legislation.\n  I am a proud co-sponsor of Senator Leahy's legislation, S. 1659, the \nVoting Rights Advancement Act of 2015. The Voting Rights Advancement \nAct of 2015 responds to current conditions in voting today by restoring \nthe full protections of the original, bipartisan Voting Rights Act of \n1965, which was last reauthorized on a bipartisan vote by Congress in \n2006, but significantly weakened by the Supreme Court in 2013.\n  Following the Shelby County decision 2 years ago, several States \npassed sweeping voter suppression laws that disproportionately prevent \nminorities, the elderly, and the youth from voting. The Leahy bill \nprovides the tools to address these discriminatory practices and seeks \nto protect all Americans' right to vote.\n  The Leahy bill establishes a targeted process for reviewing voting \nchanges in jurisdictions nationwide, focused on measures that have \nhistorically been used to discriminate against voters. The process for \nreviewing changes in voting is limited to a set of measures, such as \nvoter IDs, that have historically been found to have the greatest \ndiscriminatory impact.\n  Congress should also take up and pass the Democracy Restoration Act, \nDRA, S. 772, which I have introduced. The Democracy Restoration Act \nwould restore voting rights in Federal elections to approximately 5.8 \nmillion citizens who have been released from prison and are back living \nin their communities.\n  Notwithstanding the 15th Amendment, many States passed laws during \nthe Jim Crow period after the Civil War to make it more difficult for \nnewly-freed slaves to vote in elections. Such laws included poll taxes, \nliteracy tests, and disenfranchisement measures.\n  Some disenfranchisement measures applied to misdemeanor convictions \nand in practice could result in lifetime disenfranchisement, even for \nindividuals that successfully reintegrated into their communities as \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 did sweep away numerous State laws and \nprocedures that had denied African Americans and other minorities their \nconstitutional right to vote. For example, the act outlawed the use of \nliteracy or history tests that voters had to pass before registering to \nvote or casting their ballot.\n  The act specifically prohibits States from imposing any ``voting \nqualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or \nprocedure . . . to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the \nUnited States to vote on account of race or color.''\n  In 2015, I am concerned that there are still several areas where the \nlegacy of Jim Crow laws and State disenfranchisement statutes lead to \nunfairness in Federal elections.\n  First, State laws governing the restoration of voting rights vary \nwidely throughout the country, such that persons in some States can \neasily regain their voting rights, while in other States persons \neffectively lose their right to vote permanently.\n  Second, these State disenfranchisement laws have a disproportionate \nimpact on racial and ethnic minorities.\n  Third, this patchwork of State laws results in the lack of a uniform \nstandard for eligibility to vote in Federal elections, and leads to an \nunfair disparity and unequal participation in Federal elections based \nsolely on residence.\n  Finally, studies indicate that former prisoners who have voting \nrights restored are less likely to reoffend, and disenfranchisement \nhinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into their community.\n  The legislation would restore voting rights to prisoners after their \nrelease from incarceration. It requires that prisons receiving Federal \nfunds notify\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\npeople about their right to vote in Federal elections when they are \nleaving prison, sentenced to probation, or convicted of a misdemeanor.\n  The legislation is crafted to apply to Federal elections, and retains \nthe States' authorities to generally establish voting qualifications. \nThis legislation is consistent with congressional authority under the \nConstitution and voting rights statutes.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has been endorsed by a large \ncoalition of public interest organizations, including: civil rights and \nreform organizations; religious and faith-based organizations; and law \nenforcement and criminal justice organizations. In particular I want to \nthank the Brennan Center for Justice, the ACLU, the Leadership \nConference on Civil and Human Rights, and the NAACP for their work \nhere.\n  I also urge Congress to take up legislation that I have introduced in \nthe past with Senator Schumer, the Deceptive Practices and Voter \nIntimidation Prevention Act. Voter suppression and intimidation are \nstill very much alive in our Nation.\n  From misleading and fraudulent information about elections to voter \nintimidation and robocalls designed to suppress the vote, deceptive \nvoting practices are often aimed at depriving minority communities of \ntheir voice in our democracy. The U.S. Constitution guarantees and \nprotects the right of every American citizen to vote, and we have a \nduty to protect and ensure that right.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen a resurgence of deceptive voter practices \nin recent years. In 2006, during my own election to the Senate, \nthousands of minority voters in Maryland were targeted for misleading \ninformation designed to suppress their vote. Nationwide, there have \nbeen numerous reports of efforts to suppress the minority vote by \nputting out wrong information about election dates and location of \npolling places, along with suggestions that voters who had outstanding \nparking tickets would be arrested if they tried to vote.\n  This legislation is designed to protect voters across the Nation from \nelection fraud and voter intimidation by creating criminal penalties \nfor deceptive voting practices and by giving individual voters the \nright to take action. If deceptive practices are found to have occurred \nbefore election day, the U.S. Attorney General can take corrective \naction to halt distribution of such information and to set the record \nstraight. After Federal elections, the Attorney General also would be \nrequired to report to Congress on the allegations of deceptive \npractices and the actions taken to correct such practices.\n  Let me also mention another issue relating to civil rights, which is \nthe right to serve on a Federal jury. My view is that after release \nfrom prison, ex-offenders should be given both rights and \nresponsibilities. So in addition to restoring the right to vote as we \nseek to reduce recidivism and successfully integrate ex-offenders back \ninto the community, I would also permit ex-offenders to perform the \ncivic duty of serving on a jury of their peers.\n  This legislative change is a part of my BALTIMORE Act, S. 1610, the \nBuilding and Lifting Trust In Order to Multiply Opportunities and \nRacial Equality. I introduced this legislation after the death of \nFreddie Gray in Baltimore while in police custody. It also includes my \nEnd Racial Profiling Act, ERPA.\n  Next month the NAACP, which is headquartered in Baltimore, and other \ncivil rights groups will conclude its Journey for Justice march at the \nU.S. Capitol as part of their Justice Summer campaign. This historic \n860-mile march from Selma, AL to Washington, DC, will mobilize \nactivists and advance a focused national policy agenda.\n  This policy agenda seeks to protect the right of every American to a \nfair criminal justice system and uncorrupted and unfettered access to \nthe ballot box.\n  In particular, the march will call for the enactment of the Voting \nRights Advancement Act and the End Racial Profiling Act. Congress \nshould take up and pass these two critically important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  It would be the appropriate way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/06/senate-section/article/S6432-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6432-S6433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the \ngreat moral challenges of our time--human trafficking. The term human \ntrafficking involves crimes of forced labor, sexual exploitation, debt \nbondage, forced marriage, and the sale and exploitation of children. \nTrafficking in persons destroys people and corrodes communities. It \ndistorts labor markets and undermines stability and the rule of law. It \nis fueled by greed, violence, and corruption.\n  There are at least 21 million victims of human trafficking in the \nworld--and over 5 million of them are children, according to the \nInternational Labor Organization, ILO. Forced labor alone generates \nmore than $150 billion in profits annually, making it one of the \nlargest income sources for international criminals, second only to drug \ntrafficking. Trafficking victims range from women enslaved as domestic \nworkers in countries as diverse as Saudi Arabia and Singapore to Nepali \nconstruction workers building stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. \nIt also ensnares Rohingya and Cambodian men and boys on Thai fishing \nboats working to put fish in European and American grocery stores. It \nincludes countless Venezuelan women and girls, some lured from poor \ntowns in the interior to urban centers, who are then subjected to sex \ntrafficking. Even in our own country, cases of human trafficking have \nbeen reported in all 50 States.\n  Traffickers take advantage of conflict, the collapse of state \ninstitutions, and even natural disasters--like the recent earthquake in \nNepal--to prey on vulnerable civilians. We are witnessing terrorist \ngroups like ISIL and Boko Haram that proudly build their ``states'' on \nthe trade in and enslavement of women and children.\n  There has been some progress. This year marks the 15th anniversary of \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The TVPA, and the annual \nTrafficking In Persons, TIP, Report it mandates, have played a major \nrole in raising global awareness of human trafficking and galvanizing \nboth civil society and governments to address both labor and sex \ntrafficking crimes. The report analyzes the efforts of foreign \ngovernments, and our own, to comply with minimum standards for the \nelimination of trafficking in persons, as set out by the TVPA.\n  The TIP Report has been widely regarded as the ``gold standard'' for \ntrafficking information, and as an essential tool for ensuring \ncontinued progress against the scourge of human trafficking. The value \nof the TIP Report, and the United States' credibility on this critical \nissue, relies heavily on the integrity of that report.\n  On Monday, July 27, the Department of State released the 2015 TIP \nReport. I have great respect for the small, dedicated staff at the \nDepartment of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, as well \nas our numerous embassies around the world that help collect credible \ninformation for the report. Nevertheless, I was struck by the strong \nresponse to the 2015 report by outside country experts and frontline \nadvocates who have worked in the trenches on human trafficking for \nyears. They raised significant questions about the integrity and \nneutrality of the 2015 TIP Report and the decision to upgrade \nUzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, and Malaysia, among others. We need to \nlisten carefully to their views.\n  Of particular concern is the upgrade of Malaysia, which I want to \ndiscuss briefly. Malaysia has a serious human trafficking problem, \nwhich is why the State Department downgraded Malaysia last year to a \nTier 3 country in the TIP Report, a level that includes the worst human \ntrafficking offenders in the world. In Malaysia, the use of forced \nlabor is pervasive in agriculture, construction, electronics, and \ntextile industries, and the sex trade industry.\n  This year, the State Department upgraded Malaysia to the Tier 2 Watch \nList on the grounds that the government had made significant efforts to \ncomply with the minimum standards to combat human trafficking. Those \nefforts by the government included beginning to reform its flawed \nvictim protection regime, along with its legal framework, and \nconsultations with\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\ncivil society. The Malaysian authorities increased the number of \ninvestigations and prosecutions--although the low number of convictions \nremained disproportionate to the scale of the problem. The 2015 TIP \nReport states that the Malaysian Government had three convictions of \ntraffickers in 2014, a substantial decrease from the nine convictions \nreported in the 2014 TIP Report.\n  While Malaysia has taken small steps that seem to indicate some \nrecent progress, these steps do not appear to me to be sufficient to \njustify an upgrade. Evidence of the trafficking problems in Malaysia \ncontinued outside of the 2015 TIP reporting period, which ended on \nMarch 31, 2015. For example, in May 2015, mass graves believed to \ncontain bodies of 139 Rohingya trafficking victims were found in \nabandoned jungle camps along Malaysia's northern border, along with \npens likely used as cages for the victims.\n  Malaysia is a party to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, \nnegotiations. The juxtaposition of the administration's pursuit of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement in the case of Malaysia and the \nupgrade of Malaysia's TIP tier ranking at the same time has raised \nconcerns among some observers regarding the integrity and veracity of \nthe 2015 ranking process.\n  I look forward to hearing more from the administration in the days \nahead about the considerations taken into account for the TIP ranking \nprocess and, in particular, the decision to upgrade Malaysia. That is \nwhy Chairman Corker and I scheduled a hearing on this issue in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Archibald MacLeish, the writer and former Librarian of Congress, \nsaid:\n\n       There are those who will say that the liberation of \n     humanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a \n     dream. They are right. It is the American Dream.\n\n  We owe it to the millions of men, women, and children around the \nworld who suffer from the horrifying depredations of modern slavery to \nmaintain America's leadership, reputation, and resolve in the fight \nagainst human trafficking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/06/senate-section/article/S6433-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING YORK COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on September 5, 1995, York County \nTechnical College opened its doors in a hotel in Wells, ME, with five \nassociate's degree and certificate programs and 156 students. Now known \nas York County Community College, the college in 2015 has three \ncampuses, more than 30 programs, and some 1,700 full and part-time \nstudents. I congratulate this remarkable institution for 20 years of \ncontributions to the people of Maine's southernmost county and to our \nentire State.\n  This truly is a community effort. In the years before the school was \nestablished, business, civic, and education leaders in York County \nformed Partners for Progress, a coalition to address the challenge of \ndeveloping a better-trained workforce for a fast-changing global \neconomy. The demand for technical education was immediately apparent: \nby 1997, in just its third year, the numbers for enrollment and \nprograms both tripled. In recent years, York County Community College \nhas twice been named one of the fastest-growing community colleges in \nthe Nation.\n  In 2003, Maine's outstanding technical college system expanded its \nmission to become a community college system that enhances skills, \nstrengthens our State's economy, and increases access to college. \nNearly one-half of York County Community College students are first-\ngeneration college students, and some 40 percent of graduates go on to \nenroll at a 4-year college. Under the leadership of President Barbara \nFinkelstein, a dedicated faculty and staff, and a committed YCCC \nFoundation, York County Community College reaches out in many ways. \nWith programs for seniors and students of high school age and younger, \nlifelong learning is a core part of the school's mission. The Center \nfor Entrepreneurship encourages the innovation that is essential to our \neconomy. Arts and culture offerings and the ``Eggs and Issues'' \nspeakers program enrich the entire community.\n  The people of Maine are proud of our community college system. The \nreason is clear: students of all ages and backgrounds are finding \naffordable tuition and the skills they need to succeed. They are \nfinding real value.\n  York County Community College is an important part of that success. \nSince its inception, the college has educated more than 20,000 people \nin many fields, including medical fields, technology, business \nmanagement, skilled trades, and many other occupations. It has fueled \nthe economy, created opportunity, and helped improve the quality of \nlife for all. The accomplishments of York County Community College \nduring the past 20 years are inspiring, and I know the best is yet to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/06/senate-section/article/S6433-2", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING OUTSTANDING MINNESOTA LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize three \noutstanding Minnesota police officers. The Minnesota Police and Peace \nOfficers Association, the largest association representing Minnesota's \nrank-and-file police officers, recently met for its annual conference \nand named Sergeant Mark Ficcadenti of the St. Paul Police Department \nPolice Officer of the Year and gave Honorable Mention Awards to Officer \nMark Ross of the St. Paul Police Department and State Trooper Brian \nBeuning.\n  Sergeant Ficcadenti is a 30-year veteran of the St. Paul Police \nDepartment where he serves an indispensable role performing community \noutreach and forging relationships with the most vulnerable immigrant \npopulations. Sergeant Ficcadenti organizes events such as the East \nAfrican Junior Police Academy, Ramadan celebrations with the local \nSomali community, and the ``Safe and Sound'' program that allows people \nto meet and get to know local police officers. His tireless efforts to \nensure that the police department serves all communities has promoted \nsafety, encouraged community cooperation, and fostered trust in law \nenforcement.\n  Honorable Mention Award recipient Officer Mark Ross of the St. Paul \nPolice Department is a former school resource officer, whose awareness \nprompted him to look into a female high school student's frequent \nabsences and suspicious relationship with her father. After some \ninvestigation, Ross revealed that the student's father had been abusing \nand neglecting the young girl for years. The father was convicted and \nis now serving a 25-year sentence in prison. As a result of Officer \nRoss' actions, the young woman has graduated from high school and has \nbeen accepted into a Minnesota college.\n  The second Honorable Mention Award recipient, Minnesota State Trooper \nBeuning, exhibited heroism and outstanding professionalism when \ndispatched last year to help a woman trapped in her car during a flash \nflood in Beaver Creek, MN. After wading through knee-deep waters, State \nTrooper Beuning calmed the trapped woman by standing next to the car \nand speaking to her through a cracked window. Seconds after Trooper \nBeuning and firefighters removed the woman through the window of her \ncar, the vehicle was swept away by floodwaters. Three months after his \nact of bravery, Beuning was given the Officer of the Month Award by the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\n  I join all of my fellow Minnesotans in applauding these three \ndistinguished public servants. I would also like to thank not only \nthese three individuals but all of Minnesota's brave law enforcement \nofficers who keep our communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/06/senate-section/article/S6433-3", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6433-S6434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING INTERMOUNTAIN HEALTHCARE\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to pay \ntribute to one of the country's exemplary organizations, Intermountain \nHealthcare, which this year celebrates 40 years of service to people in \nUtah and the surrounding area. Based in Salt Lake City, Intermountain \nHealthcare has been a longtime provider of top-of-the-line care, as \nwell as a leading example among the country's integrated health \nsystems.\n  Prior to the organization's inception in 1975, the 15 hospitals that \nwould become Intermountain Healthcare were administered and operated by \nthe\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After deciding it would \ndivest its hospitals, the church yielded its responsibilities to a new, \nsecular, not-for-profit organization known as Intermountain Healthcare.\n  Since that time, Intermountain Healthcare has grown to include 21 \nhospitals across the State of Utah, as well as one in Idaho. In \naddition to its hospitals, Intermountain also includes more than 185 \nclinics and 1,400 multi-specialty doctors and advanced-practice \nclinicians. Its not-for-profit health plan, SelectHealth, serves more \nthan 750,000 members. Its integrated structure allows Intermountain to \nwork with people at all stages of their lives, before and after they \nmay require medical care, to optimize health. Intermountain Healthcare \nhas been completely dedicated to its mission of ``helping people live \nthe healthiest lives possible,'' and for the last 40 years it has \nsuccessfully accomplished that mission.\n  Intermountain strives to provide the highest quality care and \nservices to all at an affordable cost, at times, even providing care \nfor those unable to finance their own medical needs. In 2014, in more \nthan 268,000 cases, Intermountain Healthcare donated more than $384 \nmillion in services to those who were unable to pay. In addition, \nIntermountain operates safety net community clinics for people who are \nuninsured or who have low incomes, and it provides financial support to \n30 independent community clinics in the region. These clinics cared for \npeople in more than 366,000 visits last year. Among its many other \ncommunity benefits, Intermountain also provided $33 million to support \nmedical training programs, residencies, and other health-related \neducation. Intermountain Healthcare is a vital leader within the Utah \ncommunity and truly embodies its values of integrity, trust, \nexcellence, accountability, and mutual respect that are critical in the \nprovision of health care. Led by a volunteer board of trustees who \ndonate their time without pay themselves, Intermountain is making a \nhuge impact in the world of health care, as well as in the lives of the \nindividuals it serves.\n  Intermountain Healthcare has for years been recognized as one of the \nleading organizations of its kind. This year Intermountain Healthcare \nhad five hospitals included on the Truven Health Analytics annual 100 \nTop Hospitals study. There was only one other health system in the U.S. \nthat had five hospitals on the list. In 2014, Intermountain was named \nto the InformationWeek Elite 100 rankings, which compiles a list of top \nbusiness technology innovators in the U.S. These are just a few \nexamples from the resume of accomplishments and recognition \nIntermountain Healthcare has rightfully earned.\n  In addition to the administration of its health services and medical \ngroup, Intermountain Healthcare provides key emergency transport \nservices in its region. In 1978, Intermountain Life Flight made its \nfirst helicopter patient transport, making it only the seventh air \nmedical helicopter service in the United States. Life Flight now owns \nand operates 7 helicopters and 3 fixed-wing aircraft. This operation \nhas been crucial to locating, rescuing, and saving patients who are in \ntime-sensitive, critical condition.\n  The growth, quality, and innovation of Intermountain Healthcare is \nimpressive, but what stands out even more is this organization's \ncharacter. It has always sought to follow the highest ethical standard, \neven in cases when legal standards were lower or when transparency may \nhave led to embarrassment. One example was its decision to proactively \nnotify certain patients of possible exposure to a rare disease, even \nthough the risk was very low and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention said that notification was not required. Another example was \nits decision to voluntarily self-disclose potential compliance issues \nwith a Federal law to the U.S. attorney, even though it exposed itself \nto significant penalties. Intermountain is an organization that always \ntakes the high road, seeks to do the right thing, and raises the bar \nfor ethical behavior.\n  When I look at Intermountain Healthcare, I see an example to the \ncountry of what it means to serve. I see health care providers who make \npeople a priority rather than profit. I see an organization that values \nhonesty and ethical conduct with its patients, its peers, and the \ngovernment. We in Utah are blessed by such a high standard of conduct. \nMay we all follow this example as we fulfill our duty to honorably \nserve our fellow citizens and contribute to our community.\n  Please join me in commending Intermountain Healthcare on the \nleadership it has demonstrated and the positive influence it has had on \nAmerican health care in its first 40 years of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/08/06/senate-section/article/S6434-1", "month": "08", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REPORTS OF COMMITTEES DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of August 5, 2015, the \nfollowing reports of committees were submitted on August 6, 2015:\n\n       By Mr. ISAKSON, from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \n     with an amendment:\n       S. 833.
