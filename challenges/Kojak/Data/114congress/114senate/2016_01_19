Mr. President, it is clear that many Americans are \nconcerned about the administration's ability to properly vet thousands \nof individuals from Syria and Iraq. Elected officials in both parties \nhave expressed concern, too, as have administration officials. That is \nwhy many Americans are asking us to take a step back and press pause on \nthe program so we can ensure that we have the correct policies and \nsecurity screenings actually in place. The Senate will consider \nbalanced, bipartisan legislation tomorrow to do just that.\n  Passing the American SAFE Act, which the House has already done with \na bipartisan veto-proof margin, would show Americans that their \nconcerns are being heard here in Washington. The aim is to ensure that \nwe have facts first so we can help advance America's tradition of \ncompassion and address the legitimate concerns of her citizens at the \nsame time.\n  I will have more to say on this legislation tomorrow, but I urge \ncolleagues across the aisle to treat this issue with the seriousness it \ndeserves. This debate should be driven by facts and common sense and \nnot fear mongering about targeting widows and orphans or other straw \nman arguments the White House has made from time to time. Americans \ndeserve a vetting process they can have confidence in, and frankly the \nrefugees coming to this country deserve one too. Safeguards that weed \nout ISIL sympathizers can help ensure legitimate refugees to our \ncountry are not unfairly stigmatized.\n  The American people are concerned and looking to us to lead with both \nsafety and compassion. I am calling on colleagues to help us do so \ntomorrow by advancing this balanced and bipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S79-8", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S79]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEETING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I will have more to say tomorrow about the \nlegislation about which the Republican leader just spoke. Tomorrow \nafternoon we will have a vote as to whether we should move to the bill.\n  Along with the rest of the world, I was pleased to learn this weekend \nthat five political prisoners were finally released from Iran and will \nsoon be home with their families. These Americans were unjustly held, \nand I am glad they will soon be in the arms of their loved ones once \nagain.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n  Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is one of the most \npressing security challenges of our generation. A nuclear-armed Iran is \na threat to the national security of the United States, the State of \nIsrael, and the world.\n  Last summer I announced my support for the historic nuclear agreement \nthe United States and the global community made with Iran. This \nagreement required Iran to take significant steps to ensure that its \nnuclear infrastructure could not be used to build a nuclear bomb. These \nsteps include, among other things, dismantling thousands and thousands \nof centrifuges that are used to enrich uranium, removing from Iran its \nenriched uranium, thus reducing its stockpile and eliminating the core \nof its plutonium reactor. The end result of these steps is that Iran's \nbreakout time--the time it takes to make enough fissile material to \nbuild a bomb--has been extended from a matter of a few months to a \nyear, and some experts would say much, much longer.\n  Over the weekend, the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed \nthat Iran successfully implemented these initial requirements, an \nimportant next act in the implementation of the nuclear agreement.\n  I applaud President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, Secretary \nof Energy Dr. Ernest Moniz, and Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman \nfor using America's diplomatic power to make the world a safer place. \nThis diplomatic approach also avoids the significant costs and risks a \nmilitary option would pose. One need only look at Iraq to find out what \nmilitary options cost--trillions of dollars--because of the worst \nforeign policy decision in the history of our country: the invasion of \nIraq. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead, millions have been \ndisplaced, thousands of Americans are dead, and tens of thousands badly \nwounded. The diplomatic approach avoids the costs and risks the nuclear \noption poses.\n  No one should think all of the components of the Joint Comprehensive \nPlan of Action have been completed. They have not been. We are now at \nthe beginning of a critical period where Iran must allow unprecedented \ninspections designed to allow the international community to know if \nIran tries to break out and race toward building a nuclear weapon. We \nwill know about it.\n  Iran poses a threat to our Nation's most supportive ally in the \nMiddle East, the State of Israel. Over my four decades in Congress, the \nsafety and security of the Israeli people have been of the utmost \nimportance to me and to this Congress generally, as you can see with \nthe results of the last four decades. We must do everything and we must \nstrive to protect the Israeli people, and that is why Iran must be held \naccountable for any action it takes that poses a threat to that small, \nlittle democracy.\n  Iran must never obtain a missile capable of delivering a nuclear \nwarhead.\n  I am pleased the administration announced it would impose sanctions \non individuals and companies for providing support to Iran's ballistic \nmissile program. These tests were in clear violation of the United \nNations Security Council resolutions. One thing is clear: Iran must \ncontinue to be monitored with intense scrutiny.\n  I remain concerned about Iran's ongoing human rights abuses and \npolitical oppression. Iran also remains a state sponsor of terrorism, \nusing its proxies against Israel and against our interests throughout \nthe Middle East.\n  Congress must accept the critical role we play in providing vigorous \noversight of the Iran agreement and Iran's compliance with the \nagreement, addressing Iran's ballistic missile program and monitoring \nIran's actions in the region. This past weekend marked a key step \nforward to ensuring Iran never gains access to a nuclear weapon. We \nshould always remember that the Iran deal, as it has been called, was \nto stop Iran from having nuclear weapon capability, and that has been \naccomplished.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to keep Iran accountable \nand preserving the national security of both this Nation and our ally, \nthe State of Israel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S80-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S80]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPREME COURT REVIEW OF IMMIGRATION RULING\n\n  Mr. REID. On another subject, Mr. President, this morning the Supreme \nCourt announced its decision to review the Fifth Circuit Court's \nillogical ruling on President Obama's Executive actions on immigration. \nIt was only a question of time as to when it would come up because the \naction of the appellate court was so out of line and unprecedented.\n  I am pleased with the Supreme Court's decision to take a look at this \ncase. The President's Executive actions rely on well-established \nconstitutional authority, and I have full confidence the Constitution \nwill rule that these programs can be implemented.\n  While I was home recently, I met with undocumented parents of U.S. \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents. Instead of having the peace of \nmind that comes with deferred action, these law-abiding men and women, \nyoung and old, continue to live in constant fear of being separated \nfrom their families.

Mr. President, have you ever flown a drone? It used to be \nthat you had to fly helicopters or it used to be that you would fly \nwhat we call unmanned aerial vehicles, the ones that have been so \nhelpful to us in the war against terror. That would usually be an Air \nForce pilot. But now people can go to Best Buy or to Walgreens or to \nthe hobby shop and buy a drone this big. If it is an older model, it \nwould cost $100. If it is a newer model, it would cost $500. People can \nhave a lot of fun. As a matter of fact, I can't wait until they finish \ndevelopment of the drones they are testing right now that I can sit on, \nand then I can go from point A to point B and avoid the red lights and \nthe traffic jams and so forth.\n  Along with this new technology comes some, certainly, new challenges. \nSo as our commerce committee is approaching work on the FAA bill, the \nFederal Aviation Administration reauthorization--otherwise, in a couple \nof months that authorization law expires--we are going to have to \naddress the issue of drones because we have had now a number of near \nmisses of drones.\n  A study in December came out: 241 near misses. As a matter of fact, \nthe New York area airports clearly had the most with, in this study \nperiod, 86, but my State of Florida had both Miami and Orlando with a \nsubstantial number. At most of the major metropolitan area airports \nacross the entire country--Los Angeles, 39 near misses, and Chicago and \nBoston; we can go over the entire country--there is a substantial \nnumber.\n  Another report that came out just at the end of last year pointed out \nthat just in September there were 122 incidents and just in October \nthere were 137 incidents. If a seagull sucked into the jet engines of \nUS Airways could cause the complete loss of power so that Captain Sully \nSullenberger--since he couldn't get to an emergency landing in a \nfield--had to put it down in the Hudson River, and if a seagull with \nflesh and blood and seagull bones and webbed feet sucked into the \nengines can stall out a jet engine, we can imagine what a drone that \nyou buy at Best Buy this big made of plastic, but with metal parts such \nas the camera, what that would do, and it is just a matter of time, \nunless we take action.\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\n  Now, I have a picture here. I would like to zero-in on this. This is \na drone, the size that I just showed with my arms, flying past a palm \ntree in my State of Florida. But if that drone goes higher--higher than \nthe FAA limit right now of 400 feet--and gets into the flightpath of an \nincoming airliner or one that is outbound, then we have a major \ndisaster on our hands.\n  We want creativity. We want inventiveness. This is a new technology \nand it is great. Look at what we can do now with aerial photography so \nwe don't have to rent an airplane. Look, however, how it is being used. \nDid my colleagues know drones are being used to go over a prison wall \nand deliver contraband? How about the reverse: Getting messages out? \nSo, obviously, the government is going to have to get into it one way \nor another.\n  Now, one thing that we could do with this technology is we could \nrequire the software to be put in these drones that would prohibit it \nfrom getting close to an airport. There is that kind of technology. I \nsuppose we could put the software in it that would prohibit it from \ngetting above a certain altitude. But the question is this: When \nsomebody breaks those limits, how do we go about identifying them? \nShould there be some kind of registration number? Should there, in \nfact, even be licensure? We probably don't have to worry about \ncommercial uses such as aerial photography because those users are \ngoing to be very careful. However, for the hobbyist or the kid who can \nnow go and purchase a drone, we see the probabilities of an accident \nwaiting to happen.\n  Now, I don't have the answer. But in the next two months, as we are \ngetting ready on the FAA bill, we are going to have to come up with \nsome answers.\n  So I raise this issue for the Senate. It is a real problem. We have \nto face it. We have to address it. We have to prevent these kinds of \nterrible accidents that can occur if we do nothing.\n  I intend to do something on the commerce committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk about something that was \noverlooked late in the year as we passed the surface transportation \nbill--the highway bill. It was called the Fix America's Surface \nTransportation Act or the FAST Act. It wasn't very fast.\n  I am glad to see the President signed the law last month. It is one \nof the things people understand they can't do for themselves--along \nwith defending the country--having a transportation system that works \nand taking advantage of who we are as a nation, being strategically \nlocated in as fine a place as you can be to do business, to create jobs \nand opportunity all over the world.\n  The FAST Act in my State would provide $5 billion to Missouri over \nthe next 5 years to improve our roads, bridges, and rail system. That \nis the amount of money we will send in over the next 5 years. We are \neither slightly a donee State or slightly a donor State. We might be \nbetter off if we kept all the money, but that is not what is happening \nright now.\n  We are certainly better off if we know what the highway program looks \nlike for 5 years. An effective transportation plan is good for the \ncountry, but it is particularly good where I live. If you look at any \nmap of the river structure of the country or any railroad map of the \ncountry or any highway map of the country, a significant part of coming \ntogether of all three of those--rail, water, and highways--all happens \nright where we live.\n  Because we are the hub of the railway, highway, and water systems, it \nis very important that we have a system that makes the most of that \nwhere we live. When I had a chance to speak to the Missouri House of \nRepresentatives in Jefferson City over the first week of the year, I \ntold the Missouri General Assembly that this is a competitive advantage \nfor us, but we need to make the most of it. When we had the highway \nbill that we have had in the 5 years the Presiding Officer and I have \nserved in the Senate, nobody could rely on anything.\n  This is the first 5-year bill we have had in 17 years. But before \n2009, we just ended a 4-year highway bill. Then, since 2009, we have \nhad 37 short-term extensions of the highway bill. So if there is \nanything fast about the FAST Act, it certainly wasn't quickly getting \nto a highway bill that works. The longest of those 37 extensions was 2 \nyears. I think the second longest may have been 6 months. Not only is \nthat no way to build roads and bridges, but it is clearly no way for \nlegislators to have an idea in our home States of how to respond to \nthat plan. By the time you try to figure out how to respond to the \nplan, how you can maximize it to the advantage of your State--my State \nor anybody else's--and how we can maximize that plan to our advantage, \nthe plan is over with.\n  By the time you have a legislative session, look at the plan, the \nState department of transportation analyzes it, and you start talking \nabout it, the 6-month extension of the highway bill is over--or even \nthe 2-year extension. There are all kinds of studies that indicate a \nsignificant loss of what you can buy with the money you are spending if \nthe highway bill is 2 years or less. I think the discount is about 30 \npercent because people don't bid as competitively as they would bid to \nbe part of those projects. They are not willing to move people to where \na major project needs to occur. They cannot buy the equipment and plan \nto depreciate it out. So you wind up paying a lot more than you would \nhave to pay. That is where we have been since 2009.\n  The States have been the place where they didn't have any way to \nmaximize a Federal program because the Federal program was gone before \nthey could really calculate how they could most take advantage of it.\n  So I hope that now we do one of the things that people really expect \nthe government to do--one of the reasons they pay the taxes and one of \nthe reasons the tax for transportation has always been pretty well \nreceived. People think: OK, I pay a tax when I fill up my car with \ngasoline, fill up my car with diesel, fill up my truck with diesel or \nfill up my truck with fuel. When I do that, I pay a tax and then I use \nthe roads. So that seems fairer to people than most taxes, but we \nhaven't had a system that allowed us to make the most of that.\n  In our State, 22 percent of the major roads of Missouri are now \nconsidered in poor condition. The American Society of Civil Engineers \ngives us a C, and this is one of the areas where we would want to be an \nA. If you are a C instead of an A, the average Missouri motorist pays \nabout $400 more a year in extra maintenance because we are trying to \nmaintain a system that has gotten into poor condition.\n  Some 44 percent of our highways are congested. Congestion costs \nmotorists a lot of money in just wasted fuel. You don't have to spend \nmuch time around Washington in a car to realize how much time you can \nwaste in traffic, but we see that happening more and more all over the \ncountry.\n  In our State we have more bridges than any other State, and they are \nin among the worst conditions of the country, with 30 percent of our \nbridges rated as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. There \nwas just a TIGER grant awarded to replace the Champ Clark Bridge across \nthe Mississippi River, which I believe was built in 1919. If that \nbridge has to be shut down before it can be replaced or would have been \nshut down, the detour to get to where that bridge gets you is 75 or 80 \nmiles driving around to where that bridge currently takes people.\n  We have many bridges in our State that are county bridges; they are \nnot State bridges. I have talked to county commissioners, and one of \ntheir principal concerns is this: What about the fund that helps us \nwith our off-system bridges? Senator Casey and I created a fund to do \nthis in 2012. We added it to the 2012 highway bill. Since then, it has \nprovided about $775 million annually to States. Out of that State fund, \nwhenever you are part of the off-system road system, the State pays 85 \npercent of a bridge that the county otherwise in most cases wouldn't be \nable to replace. We have one county that I think\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\nhas 4,000 people and 40 bridges. That is a lot of bridges for 4,000 \npeople to try to be responsible for. It is our smallest county, and \nthat is maybe a different debate, but they have 40 bridges. We have \nmany bridges in our State.\n  The county road-county bridge system has about 50 percent of all the \nbridges we have in Missouri. The bridge system and the highway system \nare critical to us if we want to compete. As the middle of the country \ngrows things and makes things, it is a great opportunity for us to get \nthings--not just onto the river system and onto the railway system--all \nover the country and all other the world. Transportation really \nmatters.\n  The FAST Act--and I have a hard time saying the FAST Act without \nthinking how slow the FAST Act really was in getting passed--creates \ntwo freight-based programs that allows States to compete for funding \nfor major projects. In a world where we want to compete, we need to \nfigure out how we can compete more effectively. How do you get things \nto places where they are made into products? How do you get things that \nare grown and need to be shipped to places? How do you get them to \nplaces in a better way? In the life of this bill, the State of Missouri \nshould receive about $150 million to look at those freight projects \nbecause those projects and the effective use of how you get things to \nplaces create jobs.\n  The Missouri Department of Transportation has already developed a \nState freight plan to encourage strategies. Now this bill makes that \nplan more of a reality.\n  The FAST Act also includes some help for our Nation's rail systems. I \nhad a bill, the Track, Railroad, and Infrastructure Network Act, that \nwhen you are improving a railroad system, it allows you to have the \nsame kind of streamlining that we were recently able to provide for \nhighway construction. You don't get caught up on something that has to \nbe needlessly litigated for long periods of time when, in fact, what \nyou really need to be doing is getting that highway finished in the \nhighway part of this bill or have the expedited ability for these \nissues to go to the top of the list and to get resolved so that people \ncan get the things they make where they want to get them. They can get \nthe things they buy quicker than they would get them otherwise. They \ncan get to work, they can get to school, and they can get to the \nhospital when somebody is sick.\n  I mentioned that, particularly because we just had floods in our \nState in the last few days. For a while, Interstate 70, Interstate 44, \nand Interstate 55--all three--were closed. There was a time when two of \nthose were closed at the same time. They were closed for 24 to 36 \nhours, and it makes a difference in how people are able to live their \nlives.\n  The Federal Permitting Improvement Act that I cosponsored was also \nincluded in the bill. This is a piece of legislation that Senator \nPortman and Senator McCaskill introduced. It will now allow better \ncoordination between the deadline setting for permitting decisions--the \nsame kind of thing for highways that we are also doing for railroads--\nto make this important transportation system work.\n  Looking at the United States, Winston Churchill once said we were the \nbest located country in the world--an ocean on either side and \nneighbors that we could deal with north and south. And the ability to \nget anywhere would be another addition to that location advantage we \nhave.\n  The FAST Act includes two important provisions to give relief to \nelectricity providers. One is a law that creates emergency route \nworking groups for electricity and other things. If you have a vehicle \nthat needs to get from Oklahoma to Joplin, MO, after the tornado, you \ndon't have to get it especially permitted and authorized to come across \nthat State line in what has been declared an emergency.\n  The same thing would have happened in recent days in several places \nin our State close to a border, close to the equipment they need. The \nflood means there is an emergency. Now those vehicles can cross the \nState line without having to have the special permission that needed to \nbe received in the past.\n  Secondly, the Grid Reliability Act that I introduced with my Missouri \ncolleague Senator McCaskill simply improves reliability. If you have \ntwo conflicting Federal agencies--one saying you can only use that \nplant so much of the time and another saying we have an electric \nemergency--you have to use every facility you have to provide the \nelectricity that is needed, and that can now be done.\n  There are many committees of jurisdiction here. The commerce \ncommittee that I am a member of is certainly the committee that is \nfocused on infrastructure, focused on ports and other things that I \nhaven't mentioned a lot but that are very important.\n  I have mentioned at other times on the floor of the Senate that this \nis one of the great accomplishments of the first year of this Congress \nthat may easily go overlooked, but I can tell you that county officials \nall over America and State legislative bodies all over America are \nlooking at this bill and figuring out how do we use this as a way to \nmove our transportation system into the 21st century, how do we use \nthis to help provide opportunity, and how do we use this to help \nprovide the kinds of jobs that provide the kind of pay that families \nneed to live on and to live the kinds of lives they would like to live.\n  I look forward to seeing this bill implemented. I think all of us \nneed to watch carefully to be sure that we are making the most of one \nof the responsibilities of government. Defending the country and having \na transportation system that works are both things that individuals and \nfamilies can't do for themselves. I believe the FAST Act gives us a \nbetter chance than we have had since 2009 to look at the future with a \ngreater degree of certainty and to work in an area that is critically \nimportant for the country but even more important for Missouri and \nothers who live in the middle of these transportation networks, where \nthey come together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on a \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 4038, also known as the American Security \nAgainst Foreign Enemies Act. This bill would prohibit the admission \ninto the United States of refugees from Iraq or Syria or any other \nrefugee who has been present in those countries in the last 5 years \nunless that person receives a thorough background investigation.\n  The bill would require the Director of the FBI to certify to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and also to the Director of National \nIntelligence that each of those persons has received a background \ninvestigation that is sufficient to determine whether he or she is a \nthreat to the security of the United States. Then, as a second \nprovision, the Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous \nconcurrence of the Director of the FBI and the Director of National \nIntelligence, would have to certify to Congress that each refugee is \nnot a security threat; and finally, it requires the Homeland Security \ninspector general to conduct a risk-based review of all certifications \nfor the admission of Iraqi and Syrian refugees made by the Department \nof Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Director of National \nIntelligence each year and provide an annual report to the Congress.\n  This bill passed the House overwhelmingly and in a bipartisan manner \nin November. I intend to vote on the motion to proceed tomorrow. This \nis a conversation we need to have in the Senate. This is not an issue \nwe can take lightly, despite the plea from President Obama in his State \nof the Union Address. We cannot allow America's welcome mat to become a \ndoormat for radicalized Islamic extremists who are hardwired to kill \ninnocent people and destroy our way of life.\n  Unless and until the United States can figure out a foolproof \nscreening process to prevent terrorists from masquerading as refugees \nto infiltrate our neighborhoods and our communities, President Obama \nneeds to listen\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nto the concerns voiced by more than half of the Nation's Governors, \nlawmakers on both sides of the aisle on both sides of Capitol Hill, and \nthe American people from across the entire country.\n  After the September 11 attacks, we paused our refugee admission \nprogram to reassess its security vetting procedures, so there is \nprecedent for suspending the refugee program, and this bill does not \nsuspend the refugee program--only in regard to the single instance that \nI know; that is, we have been threatened that people were going to be \nsnuck into the country under the umbrella of refugee, and of course \nthat is from Iraq and Syria.\n  We need to move cautiously in accepting refugees from Iraq and Syria \ngiven the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, CA, and even elsewhere \naround the world. We need to fully understand the risks and the schemes \nthat these terrorists are using before we open our doors to 10,000 more \nSyrians. Other countries face the same challenge.\n  Just last week, the French Interior Minister warned his colleagues \nabout the intent of the Islamic State to use authentic-looking Syrian \nand Iraqi passports to smuggle its operatives into Europe. There is no \ndoubt that the group has obtained thousands of blank passports and \nintends to facilitate travel by counterfeiting those documents, but \nmore importantly, we must consider a pause in accepting these refugees \nuntil we can be sure our background checks and investigations are the \nbest they can be. However, today there is little doubt, even from our \nleading intelligence officials that we may not be able to stop a Paris-\nlike attack because we cannot tell who among the thousands of Syrian \nrefugees that the administration wishes to resettle here are \nterrorists.\n  The Director of the FBI, James Comey, said: ``My concern is that \nthere are certain gaps . . . in the data available to us'' in screening \nSyrian refugees. This data, such as fingerprints, background or \nbiographic information, is crucial for adequate screening of potential \nrefugees entering the United States. Director Comey also said: ``There \nis risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but \nespecially from a conflict zone like that.''\n  The United States has been successful in fighting off many large-\nscale terrorist attacks on our soil, but of course it only takes one \nmistake. Just last month, the FBI arrested two individuals who reside \nin the United States and entered the country as refugees, one of whom \nwas arrested for attempting to knowingly and willfully provide material \nsupport and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant.\n  A Federal agent testified last week that one of the men charged \nplanned to set off bombs at two Houston malls. I asked for the \nimmigration and criminal histories of these individuals to investigate \nfurther and satisfy myself, and I am still waiting for their response. \nThe concerns are real. The threats are real. We cannot jeopardize our \nnational security simply by rolling out our welcome mat to these \nterrorists.\n  President Obama's lack of strategy in Syria has exacerbated this \nhuman catastrophe. Similarly, this administration has no inclination or \nstrategy to create conditions where refugees can one day return home \nsafely to their own homes. By housing these refugees, the United States \nis only aiding in a short-term treatment of this whole massive refugee \nproblem and the problems of warfare in the Middle East while at the \nsame time risking the safety of the American people. We must instead \nfocus on defeating ISIS and alleviating the current humanitarian \nmisery, all while creating a future for Syrian refugees in their \nhomeland.\n  The No. 1 responsibility of the U.S. Federal Government is to protect \nthe homeland and to secure the country against all threats. Moving this \nbill on our vote tomorrow is one step we can take to advance this \nprinciple and to show our concern that the No. 1 responsibility of the \nFederal Government is the defense of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Adoptee \nCitizenship Act, legislation that will secure citizenship for adopted \nchildren. I wish to thank Senator Coats for cosponsoring the bill with \nme, along with Senator Merkley, and Senator Gillibrand is also a \ncosponsor.\n  The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 guaranteed citizenship to most \ninternational adoptees. This was very important because sometimes \nchildren have been adopted, they come over to live in this country for \nyears, and, in fact, for some reason--the paperwork wasn't filed--they \ndo not actually have their citizenship. The problem with that law back \nin 2000 was that it did not apply to adoptees who were over 18 at the \ntime the bill was passed. I am sure there were some reasons for that, \nbut it really makes no sense because a kid who was 17 at the time and \nhad been legally adopted was no different from a child who was 19 at \nthe time who had been legally adopted.\n  What our bill does is very limited. It fixes that. The loophole \ndenies some adult adoptees the right to citizenship even though they \nwere legally adopted by U.S. citizens and raised in the United States. \nThey are over 18, so they have for the most part lived in the United \nStates for a very long period of time. In fact, they were over 18 back \nin the year 2000.\n  The bipartisan Adoptee Citizenship Act would fix this problem by \ngiving citizenship to international adoptees--people who were legally \nadopted, who were 18 in the year 2000 or older--regardless of how old \nthey were when the Child Citizenship Act passed. These adoptees grew up \nin American families, they went to American schools, they lead American \nlives, yet adopted children who are not covered by the Child \nCitizenship Act are not guaranteed citizenship. Because of their lack \nof citizenship, adoptees have been refused admission to college and \nturned down for jobs. This constant threat to the life they know is \nunjust, and this bill would simply ensure that international adoptees \nare recognized as the Americans they truly are.\n  The bill is especially important in my home State of Minnesota. Many \npeople don't know this, but Minnesota actually has one of the highest \nrates of international adoption in the country. Minnesota families have \nopened their homes and their hearts to children from all over the \nworld--from Vietnam, to Guatemala, to Nepal, to Haiti.\n  As cochair of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I have worked \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support adoptive \nfamilies and children. Our children--all kids--deserve so much more \nthan a roof over their heads and a bed to sleep in. Each and every \nchild deserves a loving home, a nurturing family, and a brighter \nfuture. That is what this bill is all about. It fixes something. It \ncloses a loophole. It has bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to \nconsider voting for it. There is obviously a lot of interest from \nadoptees all across the country who have been living with this, through \nno fault of their own, for years and years and years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S83-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S83-S84]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      MAJOR ADRIANNA VORDERBRUGGEN\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to honor U.S. Air Force \nMaj. Adrianna Vorderbruggen, who was tragically killed in the line of \nduty 4 days before Christmas when a Taliban suicide bomber rammed his \nmotorcycle carrying explosives into a joint NATO-Afghan patrol near \nBagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. She was the highest ranking \nmilitary officer there who was killed. There were several others who \ntragically lost their lives as well.\n  Today I had the honor of attending the major's funeral service at the \nFort Myer Memorial Chapel. Senator Franken was also there. She was laid \nto rest with full military honors at the Arlington National Cemetery. \nShe is survived by her wife Heather, her son Jacob, her father Joseph, \nand her brothers, Dan, John, and Chris. I will\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\nnote that three of the four members of the family--since I was just \ntalking about adoption--were, in fact, adopted.\n  Adrianna was a native of my hometown of Plymouth, MN, where she \nattended my alma mater, Wayzata High School. She excelled in both \nacademics and athletics and was a 3-year starter on the Wayzata High \nSchool women's soccer team. This is a very large suburban high school. \nThe year she was a starter and captain, she led the team to the State \nchampionship. She was also the captain of the Wayzata High School \nhockey team.\n  She went on to the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado and graduated \nin 2002. In her senior year, she led the women's rugby team to the \nnational championship title. She was their cocaptain, so you can \nimagine. She was a starter on the soccer team and helped lead that team \nin high school to a State championship. She was the captain of the \nhockey team, which is a big deal in Minnesota, of a big high school, \nand she was also the cocaptain of the rugby team and helped lead that \nteam to a national championship title in the Air Force. We can imagine \nthe leadership Adrianna had shown through her life. She always loved \nsports--something that was talked about a lot today by her family.\n  After graduating, she attended the Air Force Special Investigations \nAcademy and was deployed to Iraq until 2005. In 2009 she was selected \nas an Air Force Institute of Technology student in forensic sciences \nand earned a master's degree in forensic sciences at George Washington \nUniversity. In 2010 she became a special agent for the Air Force Office \nof Special Investigations, which investigates felony-level crimes \ncommitted by or against Air Force personnel in the United States and \noverseas.\n  Major Vorderbruggen was also an outspoken opponent to the military's \nformer don't ask, don't tell policy. She and Heather, an Air Force \nveteran, were among the first servicemembers to marry after the policy \nwas rescinded in 2010. Adrianna chose to serve her country in spite of \nthe military's policy and fought for reform rather than hiding her \nidentity. As her older brother Chris said, ``She inspired us all, I \nthink, by just being herself, and being proud to be who she was.''\n  Adrianna was known by her family and friends for her positive \nattitude and her infectious smile. At the service this morning, her dad \nremembered Adrianna's ability to remain upbeat even under challenging \ncircumstances. And she loved their little boy, Jacob, who was there \ntoday with a loving family around him.\n  Major Vorderbruggen will be remembered for the work she did in \nservice to her country and the work she did to make sure all brave men \nand women in uniform receive the honor and the dignity they so \nrightfully deserve.\n  I am proud to call Maj.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in support of \nJustice Wilhelmina Wright's confirmation as a district court judge for \nthe District of Minnesota. Justice Wright, as the members of the \nJudiciary Committee learned during her fine hearing, is a dedicated \npublic servant with a distinguished career spanning the State and \nFederal legal system. She is the first person in the history of \nMinnesota to serve at all three levels of the judiciary and receive \nthis nomination. She served as a district court judge in Minnesota, she \nserved for the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and she now serves on the \nMinnesota Supreme Court. Her 15 years of judicial experience make her \nready to do this job on day one, and I can state that when you hear the \nstatistics about the overload for the District of Minnesota, we need \nher to start tomorrow on day one.\n  Her qualifications are impeccable. Justice Wright has sat on panels \ndeciding over 2,000 cases and presided over nearly 700. Yet with all \nthose cases and all these opinions, there were no serious questions \nraised at all about her being biased or unfair in some way in her work \nas a judge. In fact, it was the opposite. She has the support of former \nSenator Norm Coleman, a Republican, and many others in our State who \nhave served across the aisle. Her qualifications reveal a thoughtful \nand a talented jurist, one who applies the law to the facts of each \ncase.\n  Justice Wright currently serves as associate justice of the Minnesota \nSupreme Court, a position she has had since her appointment in 2012. As \nthe first African-American woman to serve on the court, Justice Wright \nhas earned the respect of litigants, lawyers, and judicial colleagues \nalike.\n  Justice Wright was born in Norfolk, VA. She graduated from Yale \nCollege cum laude in 1986 and received her law degree from Harvard Law \nSchool in 1989. After law school, Justice Wright clerked for Judge \nDamon Keith of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. She then went into \nprivate practice for 5 years at Hogan & Hartson. Before long she felt \nthe pull of public service. She joined the Office of the U.S. Attorney \nfor the District of Minnesota and has been a dependable and dedicated \nleader of the Minnesota legal system ever since that time. During her \ntime as a Federal prosecutor, she received the U.S. Department of \nJustice Director's Award and the Department's Special Achievement \nAward.\n  If you look at her path before she became a judge, every step of the \nway she excelled. She excelled growing up. She excelled in college and \nlaw school in terms of her record. She excelled as a judicial clerk, \nshe excelled in private practice, and she excelled in the U.S. \nattorney's office, where she received numerous awards. She was then \nappointed by, I believe, Gov. Jesse Ventura. She did not start her \ncareer as a political appointee. He was in the Independent Party. She \nserved as a Ramsey County district court judge from 2000 to 2002, when \nshe was appointed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.\n  She served for 10 years until her most recent appointment to the \nMinnesota Supreme Court. Justice Wright is also involved in a variety \nof civic and bar activities. She devotes 50 hours per year to educating \nthe public on the law.\n  If that is not enough, Justice Wright has also worked to improve the \nlegal system. She has been a member of the Minnesota Judicial Council, \nthe Minnesota Courts Public Trust and Confidence Working Group, and the \nMinnesota State Bar Association Task Force on the Minnesota Bar \nAssociation Model Rules of Professional Conduct. In 2006, the Minnesota \nWomen Lawyers honored her with the Myra Bradwell Award for her service, \nand in 2012 the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers presented her \nwith the President's Award.\n  The law has always been more than a profession for Justice Wright. It \nhas been central to her own development. Growing up, she watched her \nparents fight the Norfolk, VA, school system to ensure her access to \nthe same educational opportunities as everyone else. The protections \nenforced by the legal system were crucial to her family's struggle. As \nJustice Wright has said about the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. \nBoard of Education: ``Aside from the Bible, that court order was the \nmost important written document in my family's life.''\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n  The law worked for Justice Wright. In turn, she has dedicated her own \nlife to the law and to fairness and impartiality.\n  Justice Wright deserves to be confirmed. As I said, the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing went extremely well. She has the support of many \nmembers of the committee. In fact, her nomination went through without \nan objection when we had the vote. She explained any questions that the \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee had--and there were some, obviously. \nA very good Senator asked a lot of questions on the committee. She \nexplained any question they had about past legal writings from law \nschool and other issues. They felt secure in her nomination and passed \nher out of committee without any objection. No new issues have been \nraised since that time. There were no serious questions about the 2,300 \ncases she handled. I can't think of many nominees we have had with that \nkind of record.\n  I would add that this nomination is particularly important to the \nDistrict of Minnesota. The U.S. Judicial Conference has deemed the \ncurrent vacancy in our State to be a judicial emergency. Our district \ncaseload has increased significantly in recent years. In 2014, the \ndistrict saw a 57-percent jump in case filings, with nearly 6,000 \nFederal cases currently pending. Judge Davis assumed senior status last \nAugust, vacating the position for which she has been nominated. Failing \nto fill this judicial vacancy is failing the people of Minnesota.\n  I am so proud of my colleagues and thank them for their support, both \nDemocrats and Republicans on the Judiciary Committee who will be voting \nfor her today. Justice Wright is the type of nominee we strive for--the \nbest candidate for the job. We had a bipartisan committee led by two \nprivate practice lawyers, one having served as U.S. attorney for the \nState of Minnesota under the first President Bush and the second \nPresident Bush, Tom Heffelfinger. He chaired this committee which \nlooked at so many qualified nominees and made this recommendation to \nSenator Franken and myself. So this process from the beginning has been \ncompletely bipartisan and impeccable and we are proud of that process.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nJustice Wright as ``well qualified'' to serve as a district court judge \nfor the District of Minnesota, which is the highest rating the \ncommittee awards. It is based on a confidential peer review of Justice \nWright's professional competence, integrity, and judicial temperament.\n  As Senator Coleman, a former Senator from the State of Minnesota, a \nRepublican Senator, said: ``I fully support her nomination and have \ncommunicated that to my former colleagues.''\n  Why does Senator Coleman support this nomination? Because he looked \nat the record of a woman of integrity, a woman who had not one case \nquestioned before the very thorough Judiciary Committee, who has the \nsupport of many of the Republican Senators--no objections raised when \nthe vote was taken. This is exactly the kind of nominee we want.\n  Justice Wilhelmina Wright will make a fine Federal district court \njudge for the District of Minnesota. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this superb nominee. The people of Minnesota need and deserve a \njudge of Wilhelmina Wright's caliber. We are proud of our Federal \njudges in Minnesota. Some came from Democratic administrations, some \ncame out of Republican administrations, but they have always had the \nreputation of integrity. Justice Wright will continue to uphold that \nreputation of integrity.\n  I ask my colleagues to support her.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor. I also see that my \ncolleague Senator Franken is here as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for her remarks about \nWilhelmina Wright. I join her in rising not just in strong support but \nenthusiastic support for Justice Wilhelmina Wright's nomination to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota. We call \nher Justice Wright because she is on the Minnesota Supreme Court. She \nhas been an excellent consensus nominee.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Leahy for \nworking to ensure that the Judiciary Committee reported out her \nnomination favorably. I would also like to thank Leader McConnell for \nscheduling this afternoon's vote.\n  As of today, Justice Wright's nomination has been pending for 279 \ndays--more than 9 months. The seat she has been nominated to fill has \nbeen declared a judicial emergency. So I am pleased the Senate is \nmoving to confirm Justice Wright and that Minnesotans seeking justice \nwill soon be able to have their day in court.\n  Justice Wright is, without question, the best candidate for this \nposition. Not only did she earn a stellar reputation as a Federal \nprosecutor in Minnesota, but Justice Wright is the only person in our \nState's history to serve as a judge at all three levels of Minnesota's \njudiciary. In her 15 years on the bench, Justice Wright has heard more \nthan 2,000 cases, and none of her rulings in those cases raised concern \nduring her hearing, which is why her nomination was approved without \nobjection by the Judiciary Committee in September. For those who have \nknown her, this comes as no surprise. Justice Wright understands the \nrole of a judge. Her unwavering commitment to fairness and \nimpartiality, as well as her reputation for professionalism, explains \nwhy Justice Wright enjoys a deep well of support in Minnesota from both \nsides of the aisle, and I emphasize that.\n  Senator Klobuchar and I formed a bipartisan selection committee to \nassist us in identifying a nominee for this vacancy. That committee was \ncochaired by Tom Heffelfinger, a Republican former U.S. attorney for \nthe District of Minnesota under Presidents George H.W. Bush and George \nW. Bush. They are two different people, H.W. and W. Bush, both \nPresidents.\n  In recommending Justice Wright to Senator Klobuchar and to me, Mr. \nHeffelfinger said that her nomination ``continues the long Minnesota \ntradition of selecting federal judges based on their professionalism \nand experience, rather than political connections. Justice Wright \nembodies everything one could look for in a federal judge: experience, \nintellectual firepower, a calm and patient demeanor, and a deep \npersonal understanding of the issues facing the people of this \ncountry.''\n  I think everybody on that panel absolutely agreed with Tom \nHeffelfinger, who is a great public servant. If Tom Heffelfinger, who \nis a great public figure himself, says those words, they are high \npraise indeed. And it was echoed by other conservative voices before \nJustice Wright's hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Chairman \nGrassley noted that several Republicans had called him to voice support \nfor her nomination. One of those calls came from my colleague in the \nHouse, Representative Erik Paulsen, who represents Minnesota's Third \nDistrict.\n  It is clear to me why the people of my State, regardless of their \npolitical persuasion, support her nomination. Justice Wright's \nintegrity, her dedication to public service, and her commitment to \nequal justice reflect Minnesota values.\n  I strongly urge that all of my colleagues support Wilhelmina Wright, \nand I look forward to her confirmation. This is very important. We have \nother judges who are up for confirmation who come from States such as \nIowa and Nebraska. They have been signed off by both of their Senators, \nincluding the Presiding Officer. This is a bipartisan commission with \nbipartisan support, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for Justice \nWilhelmina Wright, who now sits on the Minnesota Supreme Court, to sit \non the Federal district court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, our Nation celebrated the \nbirthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He is a hero to millions of \nAmericans for\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nhelping to break down racial barriers in this country. It is fitting \nthat today the Senate is turning to a confirmation vote that will \nincrease racial diversity on our Federal bench. Justice Wilhelmina \nWright is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Minnesota. Justice Wright currently \nserves on the Minnesota Supreme Court. She is the first African-\nAmerican woman to serve on that court and the first person in Minnesota \nhistory to serve as a judge at all three levels of the State judiciary.\n  I commend Senators Klobuchar and Franken for their tireless efforts \nin helping to move this nomination to a vote. A vote on her nomination \nis long overdue. Justice Wright was nominated in April 2015, over 9 \nmonths ago. She was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by \nunanimous voice vote over 4 months ago. After months of needless delay, \nwe could and should have voted to confirm her at the end of the last \nsession.\n  I know Justice Wright will make a superb Federal judge. Since 2012, \nshe has served as an associate justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court. \nFrom 2002 to 2012, she served on the Minnesota Court of Appeals, and \nprior to her tenure on that court, she was the first African-American \nto serve as a judge on the district court in the second judicial \ndistrict, Ramsey County, Minnesota, from 2000 to 2002. In her 15-year \njudicial career, Justice Wright has presided over or served on panels \nthat decided more than 2,000 cases.\n  Prior to her appointment to the bench, she was a Federal prosecutor \nfor the district of Minnesota for 5 years. Justice Wright graduated \nwith her B.A., cum laude, from Yale University and earned her law \ndegree from Harvard Law School. Upon graduating from law school, she \nclerked for Judge Damon J. Keith on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit. With her considerable professional experience, it is no \nsurprise that the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary has \nunanimously rated her ``Well Qualified'' to serve on the district \ncourt, its highest rating. She also has the enthusiastic support of her \nhome State Senators, Senators Franken and Klobuchar.\n  Based on her wealth of judicial experience and broad support, I \ncannot think of any good reason why Justice Wright should not be \nconfirmed with an overwhelming vote.\n  After Justice Wright is confirmed, there will be votes under a \nbipartisan agreement on three other district court nominees--one to the \ndistrict of New Jersey, one to the southern district of Iowa, and one \nto the northern district of Iowa. These nominees will be confirmed by \nPresident's Day. After we return to session in February, I hope that \nRepublican leadership will continue to schedule nominees for \nconfirmation votes to address the 72 current judicial vacancies that we \nface today, 32 of which are judicial emergencies.\n  A Politico article last week discussed demands from certain extreme \nconservative groups for Republican leadership to shut down the \nconfirmation process and block all judicial confirmations for the \nremainder of the year. I am hopeful that the majority leader will not \nlet moneyed Washington interests decide whether we will uphold our \nSenatorial oath to provide advice and consent to the President on \njudicial nominations. Shutting down all judicial confirmations would be \na dangerous departure from prior practice. In the last 5 Presidential \nelection years, the Senate has confirmed an average of 30 judicial \nnominees in the final year prior to Election Day. As both chairman and \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have worked with \nRepublicans to confirm judicial nominees, report nominees out of \ncommittee, and hold hearings for nominees well into September of \nPresidential election years.\n  This was the case in 2008, when I was chairman of the committee with \na Republican President, and we worked to confirm judicial nominees as \nlate as September of the Presidential election year. In fact, Senate \nDemocrats helped confirm all 10 of President Bush's district court \nnominees pending on the Senate floor in a single day by unanimous \nconsent on September 26, 2008. This was similarly true in 2004, when I \nwas ranking member of the committee with a Republican President, and we \nworked to confirm nominees as late as September of the Presidential \nelection year.\n  Any attempt to shut down the judicial confirmation process to satisfy \nmoneyed Washington interests groups would be wrong. It would only work \nto harm our justice system and the American people we were elected to \nrepresent. Outstanding nominees from Tennessee, Maryland, New Jersey, \nNebraska, New York, and California have been pending on the floor for \nmonths. Nearly all of them would fill emergency vacancies. Votes on \nthese nominees must be scheduled without further delay.\n  In addition to these pending nominees, there are also four \nPennsylvania district court nominees and a Rhode Island nominee that \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee is poised to report out this month. And \nin committee, nominees from States represented by Republican Senators--\nincluding Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, and Indiana--\ncontinue to wait for a hearing. It is up to the Senators from those \nStates to urge their leadership to consider these nominees without \ndelay so they can serve the people of those great States.\n  I urge a vote for her confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time on both sides be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Wilhelmina Marie Wright, of Minnesota, to be United States District \nJudge for the District of Minnesota?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The United States must stand \nshoulder-to-shoulder with India in facing this common security threat. \nAs violent, Islamic extremism emanating from Pakistan continues to \nthreaten the long-term stability of the region, it is increasingly \nimportant that Pakistan reject such aggression and do everything in its \npower to root out and eliminate these terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S87-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S87-S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday Americans once again paused to \nremember a great and prophetic leader, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. Chances are, you heard a snippet yesterday of Dr. King's immortal \n``I Have a Dream'' speech.\n  Maybe you heard a tape of Dr. King dreaming of that day when ``my \nfour little children will one day live in a nation where they will not \nbe judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their \ncharacter.'' That is the Martin Luther King, Jr., that we like to \nremember: the dreamer. But Dr. King did more than inspire us. He \nchallenged us. And he challenges us still.\n  Dr. King told us about his dream for America in 1963. He was murdered \nin 1968. In the 5 years between the March on Washington and his death, \nDr. King's mission--and his challenges to us--grew.\n  Like the prophet he was, in his final years, Dr. King spoke more and \nmore frequently and forcefully about injustice. Many of the injustices \nthat Dr. King spoke of remain with us today. Some are even greater \ntoday than when Dr. King died.\n  Three years after Dr. King's assassination, the writer Carl Wendell \nHines penned a poem which he entitled, ``A Dead Man's Dream.'' These \nare his words:\n\n     Now that he is safely dead let us praise him\n     Build monuments to his glory, sing hosannas to his name.\n     Dead men make such convenient heroes.\n     They cannot rise to challenge the images we would fashion \n           from their lives.\n     And besides,\n     it is easier to build monuments\n     than to make a better world.\n     So now that he is safely dead\n     We, with eased consciences, can teach our children that he \n           was a great man,\n     Knowing that the cause for which he lived is still a cause\n     And the dream for which he died is still a dream\n     A dead man's dream.\n\n  So wrote the poet Carl Wendell Hines 45 years ago.\n  The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were \ntwo of the most important laws passed in the last century. Dr. King's \nleadership and the sacrifices of millions of other men and women of \ngood faith who believed in his mission were indispensable to the \npassage of those two historic laws.\n  But Dr. King knew that civil rights and voting rights were only \npartial victories without economic justice. As he, himself, said of the \nnow iconic Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins: ``What good is having the \nright to sit at a lunch counter if you can't afford to buy a \nhamburger?''\n  At the end of his life, Dr. King was planning what he called the Poor \nPeople's Campaign. He was challenging America to offer greater economic \njustice and opportunity to poor people of all races and backgrounds. We \nhave much more work to do if we are going to make that part of Dr. \nKing's dream a reality.\n  The Great Recession ended officially in 2009. Economic growth has \nreturned to America. But for African Americans and many other \nAmericans, economic fairness is farther out of reach than it's been in \ndecades.\n  Wall Street has regained all of the value it lost in the Great \nRecession and then some. But middle-class and working-class Americans \nhaven't recovered from that economic disaster.\n  When you factor in inflation, the average American family hasn't had \na raise since 1971, shortly after Dr. King's death. A recent survey \nshows that 62 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their \nsavings accounts--and a third of those undersavers have no savings \naccount at all.\n  In 1965, the average CEO was paid 20 times as much as the average \nworker in his or her--usually his--company. Today the average CEO earns \nmore than 295 times as much as the average worker.\n  The economic disparities are even greater when you factor in race. \nThink about this: African Americans are almost three times more likely \nto live in poverty today than White Americans. And the median net worth \nof White households is 13 times the level for Black households.\n  We have a long way to go to achieve Dr. King's dream of economic \njustice and fairness in America. We should strengthen the Wall Street \nreforms that Congress passed to prevent a repeat of the kind of \nrecklessness that caused the Great Recession, not gut those reforms.\n  Dr. King was murdered in Memphis, TN, where he had gone to show \nsupport for striking sanitation workers. Two months earlier, two black \nsanitation workers in Memphis had been crushed to death by faulty \nequipment. The city's sanitation workers organized a strike for job \nsafety, better pay, and the right to unionize; and Dr. King took on \ntheir cause.\n  For years now, the rights of working people to band together and \nunionize has been under attack--an attack financed by wealthy corporate \ninterests.\n  Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in \nFriedrichs v. California Teachers' Association, which asks the Court to \noverrule decades of precedent protecting the ability of working people \nto win fair wages and working conditions through effective unionizing.\n  If we truly believe in the America Martin Luther King gave his life \nfor, we should protect the right of workers to form and join unions, \nnot work to diminish and destroy that right.\n  The words that Dr. King spoke at the 1963 March on Washington have \nbecome part of our American creed. But the 1963 March was not the first \ntime that Martin Luther King had spoken to a large crowd in Washington.\n  In 1957, on the third anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic \nBrown v. Board of Education decision that found segregated, ``separate \nbut equal'' schools to be inherently unequal and unconstitutional, a \n29-year-old Martin Luther King spoke in Washington at a rally billed as \na Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. For 3 years, Southern States had \nengaged in what they called ``massive resistance'' to the Supreme \nCourt's ruling.\n  Martin Luther King titled his remarks at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage \nGive Us the Ballot. His message was simple: If Congress and other \nelected officials will not enforce the law of the land, give African \nAmericans the ballot, and ``we will elect legislatures that will.''\n  Eight years later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. For years, \nthe Voting Rights Act was hailed by both parties as a great \nachievement. It was repeatedly reauthorized by large, bipartisan \nmajorities in Congress.\n  In 2013, however, a slim conservative majority on the Supreme Court \ngutted the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder by striking \ndown the provision that required certain jurisdictions to preclear any \nchanges to their voting laws with the Department of Justice.\n  If we truly believe in Dr. King's dream for America, let's work \ntogether to restore the Voting Rights Act this year.\n  One year to the day before he died, Dr. King delivered a sermon at \nRiverside Church in New York City that cost him the support of many old \npolitical allies. It was a speech condemning America's actions in the \nwar in Vietnam.\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\n  If Dr. King were alive today, I think he would be heartbroken, and he \nwould challenge us to confront the tidal wave of guns that have turned \nso many American neighborhoods into combat zones.\n  Yes, the Second Amendment speaks of a right to bear arms. But \nchildren ought to have a right to play on school playgrounds without \ngetting caught in gang crossfire.\n  Americans ought to be able to go to a movie or to a college lecture \nor a church Bible study class without risking being killed by someone \nwho is too sick or too dangerous to have a gun but has one anyway.\n  Martin Luther King was taken from us by gun violence. If we truly \nbelieve in his dream, let's work together to find ways to keep guns out \nof the wrong hands.\n  ``It is easier to build monuments than to make a better world.'' That \nis what the poet said. But people don't elect us to do the easy work. \nThey expect us to do the hard work, the necessary work, of making \nAmerica better, fairer, and more secure.\n  I ask my colleagues: Let's work together to advance economic justice, \nprotect voting rights, and end the violence that is turning too many \nAmerican neighborhoods into war zones. In short, let's work together to \nadvance Dr. King's dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S88-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                          REMEMBERING AL WITTE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Albert \nMatthew Francis Witte, a University of Arkansas professor emeritus, \nformer NCAA president, and World War II bombardier who recently passed \naway December 23, 2015, at the age of 92.\n  Witte, born in Pittsburgh, PA, enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps in \nNovember 1942 after graduating high school. His prominent military \ncareer included flying 35 missions with the 15th Air Force in Italy as \na second lieutenant bombardier, and he was awarded the Distinguished \nFlying Cross for his service.\n  After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University \nof Chicago, he went on to the University of Wisconsin School of Law, \nwhere he practiced law in Milwaukee. Witte spent the rest of his career \nat the University of Arkansas School of Law, where he officially \nretired in 1994, but continued teaching until the fall 2015 semester.\n  ``He taught at the University of Arkansas School of Law for nearly \nsix decades--that's almost two-thirds of the school's 91-year \nexistence,'' Stacy Leeds, the dean of the University of Arkansas School \nof Law recently said of Witte.\n  His passion for law led to his involvement in many professional \nrelated projects, including member of the Fayetteville Planning \nCommission, member of the Arkansas Bar Association, a legal consultant \nto the Southern Governor's Conference, and a special assistant Arkansas \nattorney general, just to name a few.\n  Witte's experiences made him a trusted confidant and consult to many \nin the University of Arkansas's athletics department as well. Twenty \nyears of service as the university's faculty athletic representative \nallowed him to work with the Southwest and Southeast Conferences, the \nCollege Football Association, and the National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation. His NCAA involvement included terms as Division I vice \npresident and the association president in 1989.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Congress, I am privileged to recognize the life \nof Albert Matthew Francis Witte. As a member of the Greatest \nGeneration, he lived a life of service. He leaves a lasting legacy \nthrough his brave military service, countless efforts on behalf of the \nUniversity of Arkansas, and the knowledge he shared with several \ngenerations of attorneys across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S88-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING HECLA MINING COMPANY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 125th \nanniversary of Hecla Mining Company, which is celebrating a remarkable \nmilestone in its long and important history in the State of Idaho.\n  Hecla Mining Company was formed in October of 1891 for the purposes \nof acquiring and trading mining claims in what was then north Idaho's \nnewly discovered Silver Valley. Mining played an integral role in the \nsettlement of the West and, in particular, north Idaho. The resulting \nmining boom employed thousands of people living in the region. The \nSilver Valley has produced more than 1.2 billion ounces of silver. \nHecla is now the last of the area's pioneer mining companies and the \nlargest primary silver producer in the United States.\n  Hecla has not just weathered the storms of the last 125 years; \nrather, it has been shaped by them. The company and its workers' grit \nand resolve enabled their perseverance through the Panic of 1893, the \nGreat Depression, and two World Wars; and they have had many \nachievements worthy of reflection. The minerals produced by Hecla \nplayed a key role in our Nation's defense and continue to play an \nintegral role in the pursuit of alternative energy sources and other \nessential uses. Silver is a key ingredient for solar voltaic cells and \nis important for modern electronic and medical applications.\n  Hecla also advanced techniques that improved mine worker safety and \nworks to deepen its connection with the communities in which it \noperates, while resolving legacy environmental issues. Additionally, \nHecla is currently taking the Lucky Friday mine to 10,000 feet below \nthe surface--opening up more than 20 years of additional resources.\n  The company and its approximately 1,300 workers provide tremendous \neconomic and charitable benefits to communities and our Nation. Hecla's \ncharitable foundation has provided more than $1.5 million in the last 7 \nyears alone in support of education, youth activities, community \nhealth, and infrastructure. The company estimates that its Lucky Friday \nMine in north Idaho has provided more than $1 billion to the local and \nState economy in the last 5 years.

During the trip, the family also met \nwith Save Our Sisters girls, who had been rescued from sex trafficking, \nand participated in a sports day for the special-needs children at the \norphanage.\n  Sheradia has Burkitt Lymphoma, a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that \naffects her immune cells. But despite all she has been through, she \nstill has a desire to help others in need. I commend Sheradia and her \nfamily for their work to help and support the children at the Save the \nChildren India School. Sheradia's heart for service and her dedication \nto improving the lives of others is something that all Montanans can be \nproud of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S88-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S88-S89]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSS BRYANT\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ross \nBryant, the director of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, \nmilitary and veteran services center. It gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize Mr. Bryant who does so much for Nevada's veterans, active \nmilitary members, and their families pursuing academic degrees.\n  Mr. Bryant served in the U.S. Army for 24 years before beginning his \ncareer to help fellow veterans and active servicemembers. He began \nworking at UNLV 14 years ago, starting as commander of the UNLV Army \nROTC program. He later took on the position of\n\n[[Page S89]]\n\ndeputy director of the Institute for Security Studies before accepting \nhis current role as director of the military and veteran services \ncenter. As director, Mr. Bryant works to help active military members \nand veterans experience a fluid transition from the battlefield to \ncollege life. He also developed numerous university and community \noutreach programs for UNLV to help active military and veteran students \nbe successful in their academic pursuits.\n  Through his tireless efforts, Mr. Bryant has contributed greatly to \nUNLV's achievement of being named a military friendly school by GI Jobs \nfor 5 consecutive years, as well as making the Military Advanced \nEducation's list of top military-friendly colleges in 2015. UNLV now \neducates over 1,475 Active-Duty military members, Reservists, National \nGuard members, veterans, and their families, in part due to the efforts \nof Mr. Bryant. I am grateful to have Mr. Bryant working on behalf of \nNevada's brave men and women.\n  Through collaborative efforts during the last legislative session, \nMr. Bryant was a key contributor in attaining passage of legislation \nfor UNLV to waive fees for Active-Duty military members. The program \nalso reinforces UNLV's presence at Nellis Air Force Base, where a \nclassroom is available for Active-Duty military members and their \nfamilies to take courses. His efforts have brought southern Nevada's \nmilitary community the academic support that it deserves.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have had no \ngreater honor than the opportunity to engage with the men and women who \nserved in our Nation's military. I recognize Congress has a \nresponsibility not only to honor the brave individuals who serve our \nNation, but to ensure they are cared for when they return home. I \nremain committed to upholding this promise for our veterans and \nservicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. I am grateful to \nhave allies like Mr. Bryant working towards a common goal: fighting to \nensure the needs of our veterans and Active-Duty military members are \nmet.\n  Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMr. Bryant for all that he does for UNLV's military community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S89-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S89]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WENDY DAMONTE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Wendy \nDamonte for her years of dedication to bringing northern Nevada in-\ndepth news coverage. Wendy was an upstanding member of KTVN's news team \nfor 21 years and an important face in Nevada journalism. While she will \nbe departing from the anchor desk, Wendy's tireless dedication to the \nReno community will continue as she embarks on a new journey as vice \npresident of advocacy and community partnership at Renown Health.\n  Wendy joined KTVN's news team in 1994, shortly after graduating from \nthe University of Nevada, Reno with a broadcast journalism degree. Her \npassion in the newsroom quickly moved her up the ranks and led to her \nanchoring KTVN's evening news program, as well as reporting on medical \ninformation on her ``Health Watch'' segment. As part of KTVN's news \nteam, Wendy went above and beyond in her career to bring Nevadans the \nmost up-to-date and accurate news. Her work in our community is \ninvaluable.\n  Throughout her tenure with KTVN, Wendy covered a variety of stories, \nincluding medical breakthroughs in Nevada, breaking news stories, and \npersonal health stories. Specifically, Wendy shared an extremely \npersonal story, covering the challenges her mother faced while fighting \nbreast cancer. Wendy's coverage led to significant legislative changes \nin the fight against breast cancer. She was a key contributor in \nhelping push legislation in Nevada mandating that doctors inform women \nabout their breast density.\n  As someone whose family has been touched by cancer, I understand the \ndifficulties that come with this terrible disease and am thankful to \nhave people like Wendy working to eradicate cancer and increase \nawareness. I am pleased to say that I have worked with Wendy to raise \nawareness of the Breast Density and Mammography Act of 2015. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of this legislation, which similarly requires \nmammography facilities to include up-to-date information about breast \ndensity. Wendy's work has truly touched the lives of many across \nnorthern Nevada, and we can't thank her enough.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Wendy for \nher years with KTVN and for her work to create a healthier northern \nNevada. Although her time at KTVN may be coming to an end, her efforts \nto pursue her goals will continue. I wish her well in all of her future \nendeavors and at her new position at Renown Health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S89-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S89]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GEORGE HEARTWELL\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nremarkable achievements of George Heartwell who, after 20 years of \nservice to the city of Grand Rapids, 12 of them as mayor, won the city \ninternational acclaim for environmental sustainability and artistic \ncreativity.\n  Mayor Heartwell, an ordained minister in the United Church of Christ, \nhas served the citizens of Michigan's second largest city with honor \nand distinction. A graduate of Michigan's Albion College, Mayor \nHeartwell served the public in a variety of roles prior to his city \nhall service. Mayor Heartwell helped Grand Rapidians achieve the \nAmerican dream through his work as president of Heartwell Mortgage \nCorporation. Mayor Heartwell led Heartside Ministry, helping the \nhomeless of Grand Rapids, and was also president and CEO of Pilgrim \nManor Retirement Community.\n  Mayor Heartwell entered Grand Rapids City Hall in 1992, serving the \nfirst of four terms as a city commissioner representing Grand Rapids' \nThird Ward. He took office as mayor in January of 2004. Under his \nleadership, the city of Grand Rapids withstood the economic storms \nrattling the State of Michigan, finding methods to deliver city \nservices in sustainable ways.\n  It is Mayor Heartwell's environmental sustainability efforts which \nhave won the city international awards. During his tenure, city \ngovernment implemented a variety of environmental measures, including \npurchase of renewable resource energy, use of alternative fuels in city \nvehicles, continued attention to water quality in the Grand River, and \nwidespread implementation of energy conservation measures. In January \n2007, the United Nations recognized Grand Rapids as a Regional Center \nof Expertise in Education for Sustainable Development.\n  Thanks to Mayor Heartwell's leadership, Grand Rapids is widely \nrecognized as one of the most sustainable cities in America. In 2010, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Grand Rapids the Nation's Most \nSustainable City award, and in 2012, Mayor Heartwell was given the \nfirst place Climate Protection Award by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. \nMore recently, Mayor Heartwell was one of only 20 individuals chosen to \nserve on President Obama's Task Force for Climate Preparedness and \nResilience.\n  Mayor Heartwell has also focused on making Grand Rapids a more \nsocially equitable city. Concurrently, the city has enjoyed a decrease \nin crime rates and an increase in its economic strength. Grand Rapids \nis widely recognized for its support of the arts and was recently named \nas number 20 of the 52 Places to Go in the World in 2016 by the New \nYork Times.\n  It is my great pleasure to congratulate Mayor George Heartwell on the \nlasting impact he has made throughout his service to his hometown, the \ncity of Grand Rapids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S89-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S89-S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING PAUL KINSMAN\n\n Mr. ROUNDS.

After earning his law degree, Paul began 28 \nyears of public service to the people of South Dakota. We are a better \nState and a better people because of his hard work and dedication.\n  As an administrative law judge, the deputy commissioner of \nadministration, the director of property taxes and special taxes, the \ncommissioner of Administration, and the secretary of Revenue, he \ninspired his coworkers with\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\nhis intelligence, his humor, and his tenacity for getting things done.\n  During my 8 years working as Governor of South Dakota, Paul served as \ncommissioner of the Bureau of Administration and secretary of Revenue. \nHe was a burly teddy bear of a man. No matter how hard the problem or \nhow challenging the issue, whenever we met, he had a gleam in his eyes \nand a smile on his face that told me without words that we were going \nto solve that problem or meet that challenge. And we did because of \nhim.\n  As an administrative law judge and tax collector, he earned the \nrespect and admiration of the public, even when his rulings and \napplication of law were not in their favor. He was straightforward and \nfair, which South Dakotans appreciate.\n  As the head of Bureau of Administration, he led and championed many \nprojects that increased the efficiency of State government to serve the \npeople and preserved the heritage of South Dakota in the people's \nhouse--our State capitol.\n  But more important than all of his career accomplishments is the kind \nof person Paul Kinsman was. He was a loving husband, father, \ngrandfather, and friend to all who knew him. He had a tremendously \npositive impact on the many thousands of people he met and touched with \nhis kindness and generosity.\n  With this, I welcome the opportunity to recognize and commemorate the \nlife and legacy of this public servant and my friend, Paul Kinsman.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S90-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING HANKO'S METAL WORKS, INC.\n\n Mr. VITTER.

Building upon a reputation for craftsmanship and \ningenuity, Hanko's continues to develop innovative products, including \ndeveloping the first oilfield gauging boats that were used to help in \nthe recovery efforts following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, \nwhich devastated Louisiana's vulnerable coastal wetlands and the Gulf \nof Mexico.

FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Lee, \nMr. Sasse, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Risch, Mr. Cotton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cornyn, \nMr. Boozman, and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following concurrent \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 27\n\n       Whereas American democracy is rooted in the fundamental \n     truth that all are created equal, endowed by our Creator with \n     certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, \n     and the pursuit of happiness;\n       Whereas few freedoms were more valued by those who settled \n     this nation than the freedom of conscience, prompting Thomas \n     Jefferson to declare in the Letter to New London Methodists, \n     dated Feb. 4, 1809, that ``no provision in our Constitution \n     ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights \n     of conscience against the enterprises of the civil \n     authority'';\n       Whereas the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which \n     was drafted by Thomas Jefferson and considered by him to be \n     one of his greatest achievements, was enacted on January 16, \n     1786, and became the forerunner of the Free Exercise Clause \n     of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution;\n       Whereas ``the right to freedom of religion undergirds the \n     very origin and existence of the United States'', a freedom \n     which was established by our Nation's founders ``in law, as a \n     fundamental right and as a pillar of our Nation'', as noted \n     in section 2 of the International Religious Freedom Act of \n     1998;\n       Whereas the role of religion in American society and public \n     life has a long and robust tradition;\n       Whereas those who have studied American democracy from an \n     outside perspective, such as Alexis de Tocqueville, have \n     noted that religion plays a central role in preserving our \n     government because it provides a moral base that is required \n     for democracy to succeed;\n       Whereas the Supreme Court has affirmed in Town of Greece v. \n     Galloway that ``people of many faiths may be united in a \n     community of tolerance and devotion'';\n       Whereas the principle of religious freedom ``has guided our \n     Nation forward'', as expressed by the 44th President of the \n     United States in his Presidential Proclamation on Religious \n     Freedom Day in 2011, and ``is a universal human right to be \n     protected here at home and across the globe'', as expressed \n     by the 44th President of the United States on the same \n     occassion in 2013;\n       Whereas ``Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right \n     that must be upheld by every nation and guaranteed by every \n     government'', as expressed by the 42nd President of the \n     United States in his Presidential Proclamation on Religious \n     Freedom Day in 1999;\n       Whereas the First Amendment protects the right of \n     individuals to freely express and act on their religious \n     beliefs, as well as the freedom of all individuals to not be \n     coerced to profess or act on a religious belief to which they \n     do not adhere;\n       Whereas ``our laws and institutions should not impede or \n     hinder but rather should protect and preserve fundamental \n     religious liberties'', as expressed by the 42nd President of \n     the United States in his remarks on signing the Religious \n     Freedom Restoration Act of 1993;\n       Whereas for countless Americans, their faith is an integral \n     part of every aspect of their daily lives, and is not limited \n     to their homes, to houses of worship, or to doctrinal creeds;\n       Whereas ``religious faith has inspired many of our fellow \n     citizens to help build a better Nation'', where ``people of \n     faith continue to wage a determined campaign to meet needs \n     and fight suffering'', as expressed by the 43rd President of \n     the United States in his Presidential Proclamation on \n     Religious Freedom Day in 2003;\n       Whereas ``from its birth to this day, the United States has \n     prized this legacy of religious freedom and honored this \n     heritage by standing for religious freedom and offering \n     refuge to those suffering religious persecution'', as noted \n     in section 2 of the International Religious Freedom Act of \n     1998;\n       Whereas Thomas Jefferson noted in 1822 that the \n     constitutional freedom of religion is ``the most inalienable \n     and sacred of all human rights'', and also wrote in 1798 that \n     each right encompassed in the First Amendment is dependent on \n     the others, ``thereby guarding in the same sentence, and \n     under the same words, the freedom of religion, of speech, and \n     of the press: insomuch, that whatever violated either, throws \n     down the sanctuary which covers the others'';\n       Whereas religious freedom ``has been integral to the \n     preservation and development of the United States'', and \n     ``the free exercise of religion goes hand in hand with the \n     preservation of our other rights'', as expressed by the 41st \n     President of the United States in his Presidential \n     Proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 1993; and\n       Whereas we ``continue to proclaim the fundamental right of \n     all peoples to believe and worship according to their own \n     conscience, to affirm their beliefs openly and freely, and to \n     practice their faith without fear or intimidation'', as \n     expressed by the 42nd President of the United States in his \n     Presidential Proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 1998; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the 230th anniversary of the passage of the \n     Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom on Religious Freedom \n     Day, January 16, 2016; and\n       (2) affirms that--\n       (A) religious freedom includes the right to live, work, \n     associate, and worship in accordance with one's beliefs for \n     people of any faith or of no faith;\n       (B) all Americans can be unified in supporting religious \n     freedom, regardless of differing individual beliefs, because \n     it is a fundamental human right; and\n       (C) ``the American people will remain forever unshackled in \n     matters of faith'', as expressed by the 44th President of the \n     United States in his Presidential Proclamation on Religious \n     Freedom Day in 2012.\n\n

Mr. President, some months ago, in the midst of debate on \nthe nuclear agreement with Iran, I came to the Senate floor to remind \nmy colleagues of some recent history involving other negotiations \nundertaken with troubling regimes that turned out to serve our national \nsecurity interests.\n  I reminded my Republican colleagues that John Kennedy negotiated with \nthe Soviet Union during the Cuban missile crisis, saving us from \nnuclear war. I reminded them that Richard Nixon negotiated with the \nChinese on normalizing relations, even while that Communist regime in \nChina was providing weapons to the North Vietnamese, who were using \nthem against American soldiers. I, of course, reminded them that Ronald \nReagan negotiated with the Soviets while the Communist nation had \nthousands of nuclear weapons pointed at the United States, was \noccupying Eastern Europe, and was supporting troubling regimes around \nthe world.\n  Let us also recall how many on the right in the political spectrum \nsavaged then President Reagan for negotiating with the Soviets on \nnuclear arms. Let me read an excerpt from the January 17, 1988, New \nYork Times about the opposition--eerily familiar to what we have been \nhearing in the debate on the Iran nuclear agreement--Reagan faced in \nnegotiating an arms agreement with the Soviets:\n\n       Already, right-wing groups . . . have mounted a strong \n     campaign against the INF treaty. They have mailed out close \n     to 300,000 letters opposing it. They have circulated 5,000 \n     cassette recordings of Gen. Bernard Rogers, former Supreme \n     Commander of NATO, attacking it. And, finally, they are \n     preparing to run newspaper ads this month savaging Reagan \n     as a new Neville Chamberlain, signing an accord with \n     Hitler and gullibly predicting ``peace for our time.''\n\n  Conservative Washington Post columnist George Will said in a 1987 \nNewsweek column of negotiating arms agreements with the Soviets, \n``Reagan has dramatically advanced the moral and psychological \ndisarmament of the West by emphatically siding with those . . . who \nemphasize the role of ideology, and hence the radical differentness and \ndangerousness of the Soviet threat.''\n  The conservative National Review's May 22, 1987, edition had the \nfollowing cover entitled ``Reagan's Suicide Pact'' concerning Reagan's \nnegotiation with the Soviets. While opposed by some at the time, few in \nthis Chamber would look back today and say that these negotiations were \na mistake or that the agreements that were reached between Reagan and \nthe Soviets didn't actually serve long-term American national security \ninterests.\n  So we are here today with the fulfillment of the first stage of a \nhistoric agreement between world powers and Iran that has effectively \neliminated that country's ability to build a nuclear weapon--a weapon \nthat could have threatened our close allies and the world.\n  Only a few months after this agreement was reached, Iran has met its \ncritical commitments. It destroyed its only source of weapons-grade \nplutonium by literally pouring concrete into the heart of the reactor. \nIt shipped 98 percent of its low-enriched uranium, at least 25,000 \npounds--some 12 tons--of this low-enriched uranium out of the country. \nRecall that thanks to the interim agreement, Iran had already shipped \nout all of its more dangerous highly enriched uranium. It dismantled \nand removed two-thirds of its centrifuges--thousands of its \ncentrifuges--and it has allowed international inspectors unprecedented \naccess to its nuclear facilities and supply chain.\n  A simple question to the critics of the Iran nuclear agreement: \nToday, is Iran closer or further away from the development of a nuclear \nweapon? The answer is that it is further away. There is no other \nreasonable conclusion.\n  Do you remember the speeches given by Prime Minister Netanyahu and \nmany of the critics of this agreement? They were telling us that Iran \nwas weeks away from developing a nuclear weapon. Now by consensus we \nbelieve they are at least 1 year away from developing a nuclear weapon \nif they completely walked away from this agreement. Without a nuclear \nweapon, Iran is not the same kind of threat to the Middle East, Israel, \nor to the world.\n  All of what I said has been verified by international inspectors. Do \nyou recall Ronald Reagan reminding us to trust but verify? We verified. \nThe agreement gives inspectors continued access in perpetuity. In a few \nmonths, Iran has gone from a breakout time of a nuclear weapon from a \nmonth or 2 to at least 1 year. Quite simply, under Barack Obama's Iran \nnuclear weapon agreement, their program has finally been brought to a \nhalt without firing a shot--something no previous administration had \nbeen able to accomplish. That such a difficult task was accomplished is \na testament to the tireless work of our former colleague and current \nSecretary of State John Kerry and his team. This Senator thinks of all \nthose who worked so hard on this for so many months to achieve it.\n  Tough diplomacy has also brought home a number of Americans who were \nunjustly held in Iran. These Americans had not even left Iranian \nairspace before many of the Republicans running for President unleashed \nanother wave of worn-out rhetoric criticizing the President's effort \nthat led to the release of these Americans being held prisoner. They \nalso failed to offer a substantive alternative approach. Let me remind \nthe naysayers that it was Ronald Reagan who traded weapons to Iran for \nseven American hostages being held by Iranian terrorists in Lebanon--\nnot a handful of nonviolent sanctions violators but weapons to what was \nthen our arch enemy who had only recently held more than 60 American \ndiplomats as hostages for 444 days. By the time the sales were \ndiscovered, more than 1,500 missiles had been shipped by the Reagan \nadministration to Iran and only 3 hostages had been released. They in \nturn were replaced with three more, sadly, in what then-Secretary of \nState George Shultz called ``a hostage bazaar.''\n  I have met the families of those held hostage, and I can't say what I \nwould\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\ndo in each case if I were President in those heartbreaking situations. \nBut I do know it is far easier for these Republican Presidential \ncandidates and critics of this administration to arm-chair the \nSecretary of State or President than to actually make the tough \ndecisions that brought these men and women back home to the United \nStates.\n  While I applaud the nuclear deal and the release of the detained \nAmericans, I am under no illusions about the Iranian regime. I believe \nthere is a faction in Iran that wants Iran to integrate into the global \ncommunity and reject Iranian belligerence in the region. Certainly a \nlarge number of the Iranian people feel that way. But there are deeply \ntroubling hardliners in Iran as well. They continue to support some of \nthe most troubling groups in the region, from Hezbollah, to Hamas, to \nthe Assad regime. They continue to imprison their own people for \nwanting more freedoms. They threaten Israel, our closest ally in the \nMiddle East, and the region's broader security.\n  I hope that recent events mark the beginning of a gradual change away \nfrom these hardline policies and that we can continue to work with \nwiser voices on shared challenges such as Afghanistan and Syria. Until \nthen, the administration has wisely maintained sanctions on Iran for \nits support of these terrorist groups and human rights violations.\n  I also strongly support the most recent sanctions related to Iran's \nballistic missile testing announced by the Obama regime. The world will \nhave ongoing, intensive inspection of Iran's remaining nuclear \ninfrastructure to make sure there is no cheating on the agreement.\n  It is always easy to threaten force or simply say that troubling \nregimes must bow to a rhetorical demand. It is another thing to \nactually use diplomacy to reach these goals. Let's not forget the price \nin lives, treasure, and regional upheaval that the Iraq war caused us--\nprices we continue to pay to this day. To end Iran's nuclear weapons \nprogram without another devastating war is remarkable and worth the \nrisk. We should follow the words of President Kennedy: ``Let us never \nnegotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/19/senate-section/article/S97-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
