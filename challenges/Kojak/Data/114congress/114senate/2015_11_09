Madam President, I would like to welcome Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington.\n  Today's visit between President Obama and the Prime Minister was the \nfirst time the leaders of our two countries have met in over a year. It \nwas also their first time meeting since President Obama concluded his \ndeal with Iran.\n  We know that deal is likely to entrench Iran's nuclear threshold \ncapabilities while helping subsidize terrorist groups, such as \nHezbollah and Hamas, that are dedicated to Israel's destruction. We \nknow that the President's deal does not even require Iran to recognize \nIsrael's right to exist.\n  So I am sure these leaders had much to discuss. I am sure they \nengaged in a frank discussion. But a relationship based on frank \nexchanges of views--a relationship centered on substance rather than \njust personalities--is important for both of our countries. It is, in \nfact, healthy.\n  That is certainly true when we hear Iran's Supreme Leader reiterating \ncalls for Israel's destruction. That is certainly true when we hear him \nsaying that change will never happen as he continues to rail against \nour own country.\n  So it is good that Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama had a \nchance to meet today. It is good that the Prime Minister will have an \nopportunity to visit the Capitol again tomorrow as well.\n  We appreciated his last visit very much. It was important to hear the \nperspective of a leader for whom threats from countries like Iran and \nterrorist groups like ISIL and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad are hardly \ntheoretical.\n  That was made clear when I led a congressional delegation to the \nMiddle East last month that included Congressman Barr and Senators from \nArkansas, South Dakota, and Iowa. We met with leaders in Jordan, Iraq, \nand Afghanistan, and in Israel we had a chance to visit with the Prime \nMinister. It was productive, it was eye-opening, and it underlined a \nkey point.\n  Israel's Prime Minister is a great friend of the United States. The \nbonds between our nations are strong. And I hope we can all find ways \nto strengthen them further because the threats facing both our \ncountries are real, and they are certainly worrying.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7845-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today the Senate continues its \nconsideration of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nappropriations bill. This appropriations bill is a modest step in the \nright direction. It provides resources and will address the veteran \ncare backlog, including 770 new claims processors and 200 new appeals \nadjudicators. It expands medical treatment for veterans, and it \nprovides State grants for extended care homes in rural areas, which is \nextremely important.\n  I want to make sure one thing is understood and is very clear. If it \nhad been up to Republicans, this legislation would have shortchanged \nAmerica's veterans. Let's remember that Republicans' original \nappropriations bill for the VA was a far cry from this funding measure \ntoday. They ranted and raved, but in the process, would have cost the \nveterans $2 billion. The Republicans' bill included devastating \nsequester caps that would have underfunded the Veterans' Administration \nby billions of dollars. If Republicans had passed their bill, 70,000 \nvets would not receive the care they deserve--70,000.\n  The reason the Senate is considering this much improved \nappropriations legislation is because Democrats refused to go along \nwith Republican efforts to underfund veterans and our middle class. \nInstead, Democrats held firm to stop devastating sequester cuts from \nhitting America's domestic priorities. Because we refused to let \nRepublicans undermine care for our veterans, funding for the Veterans' \nAdministration is more than $2 billion over what it would have been.\n  Democrats refused to let congressional Republicans do what they \nalways do: disregard the needs of the middle class--in this case middle \nclass veterans--those people at home we so try to protect. In the \naftermath of President Bush's two unpaid-for wars, Republicans have \nmade little effort to meet the Nation's obligations to its veterans. \nThe work that has been done in recent years to do a better job for our \nveterans, including wounded warriors legislation and on and on, are \nthings that we on this side of the aisle proposed and passed.\n  This is symptomatic of today's Republicans. They want to start and \nfund wars overseas, but when the bill comes--when the time comes to \nmake good on the promises to our servicemembers, many Republicans are \nnowhere to be found.\n  Taking care of our veterans is one of the prices of war. It is one of \nthe costs of a robust defense that keeps America safe. To neglect that \nresponsibility is callous, and some say immoral.\n  We can do better by our Nation's veterans. This appropriations bill \nis a start. We still have a long way to go in meeting our commitments \nto the brave men and women who defend our country and have defended our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7846-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7846-S7847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FOREIGN SERVICE NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for more than 3 months, the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa has been blocking the confirmation, the promotion of more \nthan 20 career Foreign Service officers.\n  These Foreign Service officers are career diplomats. They are some of \nthe finest people in our government. They are brave. They work in some \nof the most remote, difficult, and crime-ridden war zones in the world. \nMany of these Foreign Service officers are always ready to serve at a \nmoment's notice in hotspots throughout the world--hot spots like Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  These diplomats are not partisan; they are diplomats. They are not \npolitical appointments. That is why it is troubling to see the senior \nSenator from Iowa politicize their promotions. He admits that he is \nblocking the promotion of these Foreign Service officers until he gets \nanswers about Secretary Hillary Clinton's emails and her aide, a woman \nby the name of Huma Abedin.\n  I have told Senator Grassley he is making a mistake by targeting \nthese fine public servants. They have worked all over the world. With \nrare exception, they know multiple languages. But instead of changing \ncourse and doing what is right by these diplomats, Senator Grassley \nseems to be doubling down on his obstruction.\n  As the Senator from Iowa digs in on this failed policy, more innocent \npeople--these diplomats--are being caught in the resulting backlog. \nLast month, the Senate received several letters containing more than \n600 Foreign Service promotions. In years past, it didn't matter if \nDemocrats controlled the Senate or Republicans, they would have passed \nthat list quickly in a matter of a day or two, with no opposition, of \ncourse.\n  Times have changed, and these lists of 600 career Foreign Service \nofficers sit unpassed before this body. Among the 600 individuals on \nthis promotion list are two people from Iowa. These Iowans--that is \nright, two of the constituents of the senior Senator from Iowa are \nbeing denied a promotion.\n  Why are nonpartisan public servants being used as political pawns, \nespecially if they are being blocked just because Senator Grassley \ndoesn't want Hillary Clinton to be the next President of the United \nStates. I haven't heard who he is supporting--Trump, Carson, Cruz, \nRubio, Bush, Christie, or a long list of others. But, obviously, he \ndoesn't want Hillary Clinton to be elected.\n  So I ask the senior Senator from Iowa: Is he blocking two of his own \nconstituents? Why? Should Senator Grassley allow all of the Foreign \nService lists to be confirmed by the Senate without further delay? Of \ncourse he should. We could confirm them right now.\n  It is time for my friend from Iowa to end these foolish campaigns to \nundermine Secretary Clinton. Under Senator Grassley's leadership, the \nJudiciary Committee continues to hound the State Department for \ninformation about Secretary Clinton and her staffers. He and his fellow \nRepublicans want emails. He wants to see timesheets for State \nDepartment employees, as do some other Republicans. Committee staff \nwants transcribed interviews with email vendors, and they want \nmaternity leave records for one of Secretary Clinton's closest aides, \nHuma Abedin.\n  Think about that: Republicans want to know how long a member of \nSecretary Clinton's staff took for her maternity leave. Is that \nludicrous? Of course it is.\n  Those who know Ms. Abedin best can vouch for her integrity and her \nwork ethic as a close aide to Senator Clinton for decades. When her \nreputation was attacked in the past--that is Ms. Abedin's--Republicans, \nincluding Senator John McCain, defended her.\n  Here is what Senator McCain said: ``an intelligent, upstanding, hard-\nworking, loyal servant of our country . . . the daughter of immigrants \nwho has risen to the highest levels of our government on her \nsubstantial personal merit.''\n  Can my colleagues imagine wanting to know if she took off too much \ntime to have a baby?\n  Let's remember that she is a staff member, not a principal. It is one \nthing to level charges at an elected Member of Congress or the \nadministration. It is a completely different matter to target a staff \nmember, especially someone who Senator McCain says ``represents the \nbest about America.''\n  How much money would a Republican Congress waste to try to bring down \nHillary Clinton? We don't know by the numbers. We have already seen \nthat the so-called House Select Committee on Benghazi has wasted 18 \nmonths and more than $5 million. Numerous other committees have \nconducted similar investigations. We don't know how much they have \ncost, but it is millions.\n  How much taxpayer money is Senator Grassley and the Judiciary \nCommittee wasting on its anti-Clinton campaign? We know how much money \nand staff are being devoted to investigating Secretary Clinton in the \nHouse--$8,000 to $10,000 a day, and that is low-balling. How many \nmillions of dollars are the American people paying for the Judiciary \nCommittee to duplicate the House's wasteful political attacks?\n  The senior Senator from Iowa is always talking on the floor about the \nproper use of taxpayer resources. He should walk into his bathroom, \nlook into the mirror, and find out what he is doing about the proper \nuse of taxpayer resources. He should be willing to tell us about the \nresources his committee has used to investigate Secretary Clinton.\n  The American people deserve to know how much money is being spent on \nthese investigations, especially if\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\n600 honorable Foreign Service officers are going to be used as \npolitical pawns in a crusade to keep Hillary Clinton from being elected \nPresident. I hope he will drop his opposition to career diplomats and \nother important nominations so we can give these good people the \npromotions they have earned.\n  As I travel the world through these many years, Madam President, I \nalways go to the embassies, and I always ask them to see as many of the \nstaff there as possible. I tell them there is no finer group of people \nrepresenting America today than our Foreign Service corps, and I stand \nby that. It is a shame that I have to come to the floor and talk about \nthis. We should pass these nominations tonight with no further delay.\n  Would the Chair tell us the schedule of today's business in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7847-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will defer my remarks until the \nchairman of the VA-MILCON appropriations subcommittee comes, and after \nhe speaks, I will.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  It will be some time before Senator Kirk arrives, so I do want to \ngive my remarks for the purpose of other folks who would like to talk \nabout this bill.\n  I rise today along with Senator Kirk to usher the legislation through \nthis Chamber, the VA-MILCON appropriations bill, as quickly as \npossible. I want to thank Senator Kirk for his work on this bill. As I \nsaid last week when we began debating the VA-MILCON appropriations \nbill, this legislation has huge significance. It marks a good-faith \neffort on behalf of this body to move forward with an appropriations \nbill that responsibly invests in our national security, our economy, \nand our country.\n  I also think that, among all the appropriations bills to move \nforward, it is right and just that a bill to honor our commitment to \nour Nation's veterans be the first one to break the gridlock.\n  I recognize that the VA-MILCON appropriations bill that came out of \nthe committee last spring fell far short of what the VA needs to \nprovide the care our veterans have earned. But now that Congress has \npassed the budget agreement, we have crafted a substitute amendment \nthat will bring this bill closer to where it has to be to meet the \nneeds of the brave men and women who have served this country. This \namendment will provide an additional $1.9 billion for VA medical \nservices. This amendment fixes a flawed bill.\n  The bill passed out of the committee in May grossly shortchanged our \nveterans and undermined the ability of the VA employees to do their \njobs, and that is one of the reasons I voted against it. Now, 6 months \nlater, we are about to right the committee's wrong and make investments \nthat we have known all along the VA needs. The money will help allow \nthe VA to address an increased demand for hepatitis C treatments, \nbolster health care for rural veterans, and will ensure that we can \nbetter recruit and retain VA doctors and nurses in every State of the \nUnion. It also provides better care for Vietnam veterans who are \nreaching retirement age and treats the physical and mental ailments of \nveterans returning home after 15 years of war in the Middle East. These \nare investments the VA desperately needs to do its job.\n  Now, I know the VA has been under a microscope, and it should be. It \nis responsible for honoring a promise, and when that promise is broken, \nwe need to do more than to say ``I am sorry.'' We need to fix it. This \nsubstitute amendment before the Senate will begin to right these \nwrongs, and you have my word that I and others will be scrutinizing how \nevery dollar is spent because we can't afford to make these investments \nwithout knowing they are producing real results for the courageous \nservicemembers who have earned it.\n  Colleagues are encouraged to provide amendments in a timely manner \nbecause we all would like to pass this bill before Veterans Day. Once \nwe pass the bill, it will prove we are serious about living up to \npromises that we make to our Nation's veterans. It will empower VA \nemployees to do their jobs and provide veterans with the care they have \nearned.\n  It is not just health care. This bill will improve consideration of \ncompensation claims for injuries suffered during their service. It \ngives the VA the tools to maintain our national cemetery system. It \nsupports the Office of the Inspector General, which we need in order to \nensure that the VA is living up to the demands that we have placed upon \nit.\n  It adds $170 million for military construction. These funds will go \ntoward additional projects to enhance our military readiness, \nparticularly for the Air Force and its Reserve elements, and it will \nset the stage for future appropriations bills that responsibly invest \nin education, energy, infrastructure, and in our public lands.\n  I am very happy that we are considering this bill today. Hopefully, \nwe can finish this bill tomorrow, as we should. It will take some \ncooperation, but I think the Senate is finally ready for some \ncooperation. I look forward to that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I am back on the floor once again for my \n``Waste of the Week.'' I have been doing this for well over 20 weeks--\nhighlighting waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayers' money. It is said we \ncannot afford to cut another dime, that programs are too important.\n  I question that since the Government Accountability Office, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, and the congressional accounting \noffice have all looked at various Federal programs and said: Why in the \nworld are you doing this in the first place? It is no longer relevant. \nIt is a waste of money. The function has already been taken care of.\n  Today we are going to highlight yet another situation where this \nmoney ought to be going into either higher priority uses--such as \nDepartment of Defense or funding soldiers or veterans or something such \nas that--or not take it from the taxpayer in the first place. And as we \ndocument each week, our account keeps growing in terms of money that \nfalls clearly into the category of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Today's situation is a little bit different because the money is not \nbeing spent. Then the question is, OK, it is reserved for something, \nright? It was, but that action has been fulfilled. So why is that money \nstill sitting there and who is using it or if it is not being used, why \nisn't it redirected and returned to the taxpayer?\n  Let me talk about this program.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, the United States has pursued \nvarious paths of energy development in order\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\nto power our communities. One of the ways we have pursued energy \nproduction is through uranium enrichment and nuclear reactors. Today, \nthat is not a popular way of providing power.\n  By the way, it is totally environmentally pure. There is no carbon \ndioxide, nitrous oxide, or any other emission issue here that is \nharmful to our environment. Yet we have suspended all this for various \nreasons--mostly the concern about a situation where it gets out of \nhand, even though today's technology can essentially provide safety for \nthat.\n  Nevertheless, when Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, the \nUnited States Enrichment Corporation, USEC, was authorized and stood up \nto provide more privatized uranium enrichment services for the U.S. \nGovernment and utilities that operate these nuclear powerplants. And \nthere are several dozen operating in the United States. Previously, \nthis service was provided by the Department of Energy and its \npredecessor agencies, but now this law appropriated taxpayer dollars to \na newly established USEC Fund, which is a revolving fund in the \nTreasury to carry out the purposes of this new organization, the United \nStates Enrichment Corporation.\n  The law also appropriated taxpayer dollars to the fund revolving in \nthe Treasury to carry out their purposes. Let me describe this fund in \na little more detail.\n  Four years after the creation of the fund, Congress passed the USEC \nPrivatization Act, which authorized the USEC's sale to the private \nsector--a pretty good move, I think. There are a lot of things the \nprivate sector can do more effectively and efficiently than the Federal \nGovernment. This was a privatization effort that was successful. It \ntransitioned from a Federal to a private corporation, and today it \noperates as a private company, not a Federal company, separate from the \nFederal Government, under a new name; therefore, it is no longer under \nthe control of the Federal Government.\n  What has become of the money that was funded? The USEC Fund was \nauthorized to pay for the expenses of the USEC's privatization and for \nthe environmental cleanup expense for ``disposition of depleted uranium \nstored at government-owned enrichment plants operated by the USEC.'' \nThat was a logical objective. We did not want this depleted uranium \nstored onsite. We needed to dispose of it. So we took the money in the \nfund and used that to take care of the uranium that was stored and that \nneeded to be disposed of.\n  Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office issued a \nreport that said that the ``purposes for which the USEC Fund was \nauthorized after privatization have been fulfilled, and the Government \nAccountability Office has not identified any other purposes for which \nthe USEC Fund is currently available''--in other words, mission \naccomplished. Mission complete. No other use of the fund has been \nauthorized, and so the money is just sitting there. There is a pot of \nmoney sitting in the fund that has no federally authorized use. \nWhatever you want to call it--a zombie fund, a fund that simply has no \npurpose--its life is over, yet it lives on.\n  How much is in this fund? The GAO found that the USEC Fund's \nremaining balance is expected to be over $1.6 billion in 2015--not \nexactly small change.\n  Predictably, the Department of Energy says: Ah, there is a pot of \nmoney. Why don't we use it for something else?\n  Well, it is not authorized for anything else. It was money \ncontributed from the Treasury to this fund for a specific purpose, and \nthat was to clean up the environment, to dispose of the uranium, and to \nprivatize the program.\n  The GAO report further stated that ``DOE's effort to utilize USEC \nfund moneys instead of general fund appropriations to support a \nresearch and development effort would diminish transparency in \nbudgeting.'' In other words, the Department of Energy is saying: Oh, we \nhave a slush fund over here. Let's use it for something.\n  Well, transparency and accountability are important when it comes to \nspending taxpayer dollars, and every one of us here in the Senate ought \nto be cognizant and recognize how critical and how important it is to \nspend hard-earned taxpayer dollars wisely, effectively, and efficiently \nand not request it from them if it doesn't have that purpose and \nachieve that purpose.\n  By the same token, if we have a pot of money--$1.6 billion--sitting \nin a fund that has no authorized use, that ought to be returned. That \nought to be returned to the taxpayer in one of two ways: one, directed \nto an absolutely essential need that only the Federal Government can \nprovide, or two, it ought to go back to the taxpayer. It shouldn't be \ntaken from the taxpayer. So since the authorized purposes of the USEC \nFund have been fulfilled and Congress has given no new authority or \nappropriation, the money needs to be rescinded.\n  I am not the only one supporting this course of action. The GAO \nrecommends that Congress rescind the entirety of the $1.6 billion, and \nCongress has attempted to rescind this pot of money before. In fact, \nthe House of Representatives included language in a 2014 appropriations \nbill to do so. But it is now time to actually return the money. There \nare attempts being made. If we can successfully achieve this, we can \nsave the taxpayer--by rescinding this $1.6 billion, if we do that, we \nwill then add up to our ever-growing total of wasted, abused, and \nfraudulently used money. In this case, this appropriated money--money \nsitting there waiting to be returned and rescinded--will bring our \ntotal to almost $119 billion of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  That ends the narrative this week, and we look forward to next week \nand bringing forward yet another waste of the week.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are having a lot of discussion, and \npeople are lined up now talking about this event that is going to take \nplace in the middle of December. It is going to be the 21st COP. It is \na meeting that the United Nations puts on every year. It has been on \nfor 21 years now. They are all saying: This is the time. This is what \nthey say every time--for 21 years--that we are going to adopt something \nin this country.\n  Prior to now they had been using legislation to reduce the emissions \nof CO2 and the devastation that will be on our economy. \nThere is nothing different now--except everything. As time has gone by, \nit has not been their friend. We have the alarmists who really believe \nthat the world is coming to an end because of global warming. Some of \nthem actually believe that. For a lot of them, it is the thing to do. \nYou have Tom Steyer with $75 million trying to resurrect this as an \nissue. There are some who really do believe it. The problem is, time is \nnot doing them a favor because every time a week or a month goes by, \nsomebody else comes out with some new information.\n  A recent NASA study that was published in the Journal of Glaciology \nfound that gains in the Antarctic ice sheets are much greater than the \nestimated losses. This runs counter to the IPCC 2013 report that \nsuggests there was a net loss of ice on the continent.\n  Let's look for a minute at what the IPCC is. The IPCC is an arm of \nthe United Nations. They have put together these studies of people, and \nthis has been going on now for more than 15 years. The only \nqualifications you need, I guess, to be one of the scientists is you \nhave to believe in this.\n  We have testimony from a lot of different members of the scientific \ncommunity who have said that their position in opposition to the \nanthropogenic gases causing global warming, causing destruction of the \nEarth, has caused them not to be a part of this.\n  There is no better evidence of that than in 2009 when they came out \nand made it very clear that the science they are dependent on was the \nIPCC, and it was totally discredited with what they call climategate. \nWe have\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\ntalked about this on the floor several times. I thought that would have \nended it in 2009, but it didn't. I mentioned that background only \nbecause we have the Paris trip coming up, and there will be a lot of \npeople going there to try to fortify their positions.\n  Since the 1970s, the IPCC climate model historically predicted a \nsignificant increase in global temperatures, and we haven't really seen \nthis. The frequent statements held up by the media showing each month \nthat passes is the ``hottest month on record'' willfully ignore the \nmargin of error contained within these datasets. Simply put, the 15-\nyear hiatus--the hiatus, as it is called--is showing that, yes, we went \nthrough a period of time when there was warming. Then all of a sudden, \nsome 15 years ago--16 years ago, it leveled off and it hasn't warmed \nsince that time. This has been a problem for the individuals who \nbelieve this.\n  Let me go back. This is from memory, but I am sure it is right \nbecause I have said it so many times. The first time they talked about \nglobal cooling was in 1895. In 1895, they came out and said that we are \nnow worried about a new ice age. They coined that term. They said that \nit is going to be catastrophic. Then about 20 years later--it was in \n2018--it changed. All of a sudden, there was global warming. There was \na warming. This was the first time the term ``global warming'' had been \nused. At that stage, things were warming up from that point until 1945. \nIn 1945, it was rather interesting because that was at the end of World \nWar II, and another cold spell came in.\n  The interesting thing about this is if you look back historically, \nthe greatest surge in emissions of CO2 in America happened \nright after the Second World War in 1945. That precipitated not a \nwarming but another cold spell. In fact, they used the term ``ice \nage.'' In the 1970s, it started warming.\n  If you follow this, about every 30 years this changes. God is still \nup there. We are still going to have a change in climate. What \ndisappointed them, on the other side, is that all the things they have \nbeen saying about global warming--it stopped 15 years ago, and it has \nleveled off.\n  Despite the clear evidence that the science of global warming is not \nsettled, environmental alarmists are pushing ahead with an economically \ndevastating agenda that is more about ideological outcomes than \ncombating global warming. These efforts will come to a head at the end \nof this year when the United Nations hosts the 21st Conference on \nParties, COP, session in Paris. With this upcoming international \nspectacle, we should not only be questioning the science, but also the \nintentions and promises each country is making.\n\n  Just last week, China was exposed for underreporting the amount of \ncoal it burns by about 1 billion tons a year for the last 15 years. As \nthe New York Times stated:\n\n       Even for a country of China's size, the scale of correction \n     is immense. . . . The increase alone is greater than the \n     whole German economy emits annually from fossil fuels.\n\n  They are talking about just the increase of what China has agreed to. \nThey are saying they are reducing some of their emissions. The increase \nthat they admit is going to come will still be far greater than the \nwhole German economy emits annually for fossil fuels.\n  Then there is India, a country whose climate pledge is based on the \npremise that developed countries, such as the United States, will pick \nup these costs to the tune of $2.5 trillion over the next 15 years--\njust over $160 billion a year. India stands to gain from American \ntaxpayer dollars. Keep in mind that each year for the last 21 years, we \nhave had about 192 countries come in, and their job--in order to come \nin and join the big party--is to say, yes, we are going to do something \nabout reducing CO2 emissions.\n  I have a lot of activity in Africa, and there is someone I know very \nwell who lives in a little country called Benin, West Africa. His name \nis Luke. He was an official in Benin, West Africa.\n  I went up to him and I said: How come you are at this thing? You know \nbetter than to believe in this whole idea of global warming.\n  He said: Well, look. We have an opportunity to share in something \nlike $100 billion because we are a minority country. Besides that, this \nis the biggest party of all every year.\n  So we have these things that are the motivations for people coming \nin. Even the United Nations bureaucrats have been very candid about \nwhat they hope to achieve through the international climate \nnegotiations, which has nothing to do with saving the environment.\n  The former French President, Jacques Chirac, when addressing the \nKyoto Protocol, described it as the ``first component of an authentic \nglobal governance.''\n  Margot Wallstrom--I remember this because I was there at the time she \nsaid it--former EU minister, stated that international agreements are \nabout the economy and ``leveling the playing field for big business \nworldwide.'' That has nothing to do with the environment.\n  Most recently, Christiana Figueres, the U.N.'s top climate official \nwhen talking about the Paris climate conference said--she was running \nthis thing for the United Nations--``This is probably the most \ndifficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally \ntransform the economic development model, for the first time in human \nhistory.'' She is the person who is supposed to be making the case.\n  Even the United States' global warming commitment to the \ninternational community is questionable. President Obama is committing \nthe United States to cut its emissions by 26 to 28 percent by 2025. \nThis promise is also just as questionable and hollow as what we are \nhearing from the countries I mentioned.\n  The chart itself is self-explanatory. This is the gap that is in \nthere. Not only does the President not have the backing of the Senate \nand the American people, but outside groups are finding that the \nPresident's method to achieve these reductions through climate \nregulations--primarily the Clean Power Plan--is faulty.\n  According to a recent analysis by the U.S. Chamber, the President's \nintended national determination contributions, the INDC--that is what \nthey used to say what commitments are being made--are about 33 percent \nshort of meeting stated targets. On July 8, a former Sierra Club chief \nclimate counsel testified before my committee--I chair the Environment \nand Public Works Committee--about his own analysis that has found an \neven greater gap.\n  Right now, the Clean Power Plan is a regulation that is promoted by \nthe President. Starting in 2002, they tried to pass legislation. After \nwe analyzed this legislation, we discovered that it would have cost the \nAmerican people somewhere between $300 and $400 billion a year.\n  Whenever I hear a big number like that, what I always do is go back \nand get the latest figures from my State of Oklahoma as to how much \nthis means to each family that files Federal income tax, and this \nlegislation would cost each family about $3,000. That is a lot of money \nfor the people in my State of Oklahoma. Yet, by their own admission, it \nis not going to accomplish anything.\n  My colleagues might remember Lisa Jackson. Lisa Jackson was chosen by \nBarack Obama to be the first director of the EPA. I asked her a \nquestion right before the Copenhagen party in 2009. I said: Now, you \nare going to come out with an endangerment finding, and if you have \nthis endangerment finding, who is going to be the scientist?\n  She said: Well, the IPCC.\n  I said: Well, assuming that you pass this legislation--they were \ntrying to pass the cap-and-trade legislation that I just described, \nwhich would have cost between $300 and $400 billion at that time--will \nthat reduce the CO2 emissions worldwide? Keep in mind, Obama \nchose her to be the director of the EPA.\n  She said: No, it wouldn't do that because this isn't where the \nproblem is. The problem is in China, India, and Mexico.\n  In fact, you can carry it one step further. If you are going to have \na reduction in it and then that chases our manufacturing base to other \ncountries where they don't have restrictions, then those countries will \nbe countries like China and India that don't have any controls on \nemissions, so it will end up costing even more.\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\n  I mentioned that the President is going there in spite of where the \nAmerican people are. This is very interesting because back in 2001 and \n2002, major polling showed that the No. 1 concern at that time was \nglobal warming. And now that same poll--this is the Gallup poll that \ncame out in March--said it is No. 15, and that is dead last as far as \nAmericans are concerned. The American people have caught on.\n  The President is setting up the American economy to suffer great pain \nfor no gain. The rising cost of energy will not only restrict access to \naffordable and reliable energy, but it will also undermine our \nbusinesses' ability to compete on a global scale and will ultimately \nship jobs overseas to these other countries that will be increasing \nemissions for the next decade.\n  The outcome sounds a lot like the United Nations bureaucrats' hope \nfor ``leveling the playing field for big business worldwide.'' It was \nMargot Wallstrom who made that statement, and I quoted her a minute \nago.\n  It is no wonder the President is working so hard to circumvent \nCongress's role in committing the United States to an international \nagreement on climate change. He is playing to the wishes of the \ninternational community to include French Foreign Minister Laurent \nFabius who, when talking about the forthcoming international climate \nsummit, said that an agreement needed to be reached that would allow \nthe President to make a commitment ``without going to Congress.'' That \nis the whole idea.\n  It is not just this one; there are other areas as well. Last week we \nwere discussing the big water bill for a long period of time. \nHistorically--always in this country--the control of water has been \nunder State jurisdiction, and if it is under State jurisdiction, the \nonly exception was navigable waters. About 5 years ago, there was an \neffort by a Senator from Wisconsin and a Representative Oberstar from \nMinnesota to try to pass legislation that would take the word \n``navigable'' out, and that would have meant that everything would go \nfrom the States back to the Federal Government. Not only did we defeat \nthose bills, but both the Senator and House Member were defeated at the \nnext election in 2010.\n  The American people have caught on, and the summit is going to go \nforward, and I can assure my colleagues that we will have a big \ndelegation from the United States of America at the summit and will \ntalk about what America is going to do. Again, they are trying to do it \nthrough regulation. They tried to do the water rule legislatively, but \nthey couldn't do it. So now the President is trying to do it with a \nrule. We have gone through this with ozone and other things. We will be \nfaced with this, and clearly the President's agreement is about his \nlegacy more than promoting a policy that is in the best interest of the \nAmerican people. Americans need to not only question a science that is \nnot settled, but a policy that is being used to appease \ninternationalists at the cost of America's future prosperity.\n  We have gone through this now for quite a while--I would say for the \nlast 18 years or so. The problem we are having--and I see a lot of the \nyoung people here--is that so many of the young people actually believe \nthis stuff. One of the reasons they believe it is that they are taught \nit.\n  This is a terrible confession for me to make. I have 20 kids and \ngrandkids, and one of them--I won't say which one--when she was in \nsixth or seventh grade came to me and said: Pop-I--the ``I'' is for \nInhofe--why is it that you don't understand global warming?\n  I said: Honey, show me why you are asking. She showed me the \npropaganda coming from the EPA and going through our school system. It \nis incredible.\n  In spite of that, the facts are there, and it is not going to work \nany more this time than it did during the 21 last visits.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                      Defense Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, Veterans Day is approaching on \nWednesday, and as the Presiding Officer knows, this is a very important \nday across the country. It is certainly an important day in my State of \nAlaska. Alaska has a statistic--I certainly like to talk about it a lot \nin hearings and on the Senate floor--of having the highest number of \nveterans per capita than any other State in the United States. It is \ntruly an honor to be serving a State that has so many veterans who have \nserved our country, and we look at Veterans Day as a very important and \nvery somber day.\n  We are also home to thousands of active duty military members and \nreservists--in large part because of our strategic location in Alaska.\n  I was home, like a lot of Members of the Senate, this past weekend, \nand in Alaska we are already beginning to celebrate Veterans Day in \nchurches, community halls, private homes, and parades. This weekend I \nhad the honor of attending a few of these events. I went to a parade in \nAnchorage and a wonderful church service yesterday. It is so moving to \nsee and hear from all of our veterans. Again, I had the opportunity to \ndo that this weekend. I met with World War II veterans--the ``greatest \ngeneration''--Korean War, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Cold War \nveterans.\n  I went to a number of these events and an issue came up--an issue \nthat I think is important for this body to know about since our \nconstituents are asking about it: What the heck is going on in \nWashington, DC, where Senators are filibustering the funding of our \ntroops? What is going on? It is a good question. It confirms something \nthat I think a lot of us sometimes forget. We look at the procedural \nmaneuvers here on the Senate floor--filibusters, blocking funding for \nour troops--and sometimes we think that the American people aren't \nwatching. Well, they are watching, and our troops are watching. Not \nonly are our troops at home watching, but importantly, our troops \noverseas who are literally risking their lives during this Veterans Day \nweek, protecting our Nation, protecting us, and protecting our \nsecurity. They are watching and so are their families.\n  When Members of this body decide to block funding for our troops, \nknown as the Defense appropriations bill, the people know it. They \nespecially know it when it has happened on this floor not once, not \ntwice, but three times. The minority leader on the other side of the \naisle has decided to filibuster our troops three times in terms of \ntheir funding. What is really amazing about that is that bill came out \nof the Appropriations Committee with a huge bipartisan majority. The \nlegislation to support our troops is very bipartisan. So, why? I was \nasked this back home. I truly could not provide a coherent answer for \nthe veterans, for their families or for our troops.\n\n  I have heard a number of reasons on the Senate floor as this was \nbeing debated. I believe the minority leader said it was a waste of \ntime. I guarantee my colleagues that the vast majority of Americans \ndon't agree with him on that. I heard something about Republican tricks \nwith regard to the budget deal.\n  I just don't know why we would filibuster the Defense appropriations \nbill that funds our troops three times, including one time last week. I \nwish the minority leader would come to the floor and give a simple \nanswer for why he insists on continually filibustering funding for our \ntroops during the week of Veterans Day and, more importantly, when \nthousands--thousands--of young American men and women are risking their \nlives right now--right now--defending this Nation overseas.\n  Some people are starting to fear that Members of this body are not \nmaking our troops the highest priority. They are starting to fear that \nwe are not concerned about the welfare of our troops and our Nation's \nsecurity. Now, I don't believe that is the case. I have the honor of \nsitting on the Veterans Affairs Committee. I also serve on the Armed \nServices Committee, and I believe that is a very bipartisan committee, \nwhere everybody is focused on our national security and our troops. As \na matter of fact, I talked to a reporter last week and told her how on \nthe Armed Services Committee so many Members on both sides of the aisle \ncome together and focus.\n  We have veterans in this country who still carry scars of their \nmilitary service who were not supported by the public, who were not \nsupported by the Congress. In particular, many of our veterans who \nserved in Vietnam came\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nhome and were ridiculed. They were not treated well. They were spit on. \nWe can never ever go back to that shameful period of American history--\nnever.\n  This week we have important work to do on these issues. We have a \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill we will \nbe voting on in the next few days. Again, that bill was previously \nfilibustered. I don't know why, but it looks as though we are going to \nmove forward on that. We have a defense authorization bill, which is \nhugely important for the men and women of our military. It was vetoed \nby the President. Again, it is not clear why the President vetoed it. \nWe are going to take that up again.\n  The bottom line is this: enough playing politics with our troops, \ntheir families, and our national security. It is time to come together \nduring this week, of all weeks--the week of Veterans Day--to come \ntogether in a bipartisan way on these important bills that we are \ntaking up this week to support our troops, to support our veterans, to \nsupport our national defense in the finest tradition of this body, in \nthe finest tradition of the U.S. Senate. Filibustering the Defense \nappropriations bill three times is not in the finest tradition of this \nbody. We need to move beyond that. Doing so this week--the week of \nVeterans Day--will send an important message to the American people \nthat we know what the highest responsibility of the Congress is. It is \nto defend this Nation and to take care of the troops and the veterans \nwho have sacrificed and whom we honor this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator have Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge support by the \nSenate for the 2016 MILCON-VA appropriations bill.\n  Last year this bill's funding for our veterans was $65 billion and it \nis now $71.2 billion. That is a $6.2 billion increase over last year. \nThe President requested $70.1 billion for fiscal year 2016. This bill \nprovides $1.1 billion more than the President's request for this \nupcoming legislation.\n  Last week we agreed to debate this bill by an overwhelming vote of 93 \nto 0. We have record-level funding to fix the disability claims backlog \nat the VA in this bill. There are new protections for whistleblowers, \ndoctors, and nurses at the VA who are protected when they report \npatient abuse. This bill protects the protectors of our veterans.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I truly appreciate that from the \nPresiding Officer.\n\n\n                40th Anniversary of American Agri-Women\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the American Agri-Women who \nare celebrating their 40th anniversary this year. The American Agri-\nWomen officially began in November of 1971, with the Kansas Agri-Women \none of the earliest State groups. Forty years later, the American Agri-\nWomen have grown to represent tens of thousands of women involved in \nall aspects of agriculture in all 50 States.\n  It is rather amazing that membership includes women of all ages from \nmany different professions within the agriculture industry. These \ntalented women are farmers, ranchers, and consumers; they are students, \naccountants, educators, marketers, managers, researchers, and even \nelected officials, among many others.\n  It is impossible to list all of the accomplishments these hard-\nworking women have achieved for the agriculture industry over the last \nfour decades, but perhaps their biggest success has been initiating the \nnational Agriculture in the Classroom Initiative--a program that \ncontinues to be widely implemented in schools all over the country to \neducate children on modern agriculture.\n  Throughout the year, the Agri-Women have been engaging in their \n``Drive across America'' tour--a road trip across the country to spread \nthe word of the vital role women play in agriculture. Their drive ended \nlast week in Maine, where they hold their annual convention.\n  During this tour, they also educated consumers on all the challenges \nthat farmers and ranchers face and highlighted the role the United \nStates plays in the global food system.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet with many of these women and \ndiscuss the work of the agriculture committee during their stop in \ntheir trip to Washington. They met with many members of the committee \nand many others interested in agriculture. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill join me in celebrating the last 40 years of American Agri-Women \nand the hard work of all of the women in our agriculture community, \nwithout whom the United States would be unable to provide the highest \nquality food, fuel, and fiber domestically and around a very troubled \nand hungry world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the MILCON-VA Subcommittee bill that we \nwill be taking up over the next day or so is critically important not \nonly for our military from a readiness standpoint but also for our \nveterans. We are approaching Veterans Day this Wednesday.\n  I hope we are able to put politics aside on this bill and do what is \nright not only for the military but for the men and women who have \nserved this country in the military. If there are amendments that folks \nhave, I would ask that they bring them to the managers as quickly as \npossible so we can go to work on them and clear them, if possible, and \nif not, push them off for another day.\n  This is really an important piece of legislation. We continually talk \nabout conflicts around the world and we continually send our men and \nwomen there, with no argument from them. They do a job we are all very \nproud of: protecting the freedoms of this country. The second half of \nthat story is making sure we do right by them when they come back home. \nThat is what this bill is about--doing right for our veterans when they \ncome back into civilian society again.\n  With that, I encourage the Members of this body to break from what we \ntraditionally do; that is, play politics with a lot of things, and do \nwhat is right for our men and women who serve, our veterans, and for \nour military from a readiness standpoint in the bill within the MILCON \ncomponent.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Affordable Care Act\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, we are in the beginning stages of open \nenrollment for the Affordable Care Act, which extends through January \n31, 2016. I wanted to briefly come to the floor today to make sure the \nbody knows that over the course of the next 2\\1/2\\ months their \nconstituents will have an opportunity to save hundreds if not thousands \nof dollars by shopping around and finding the most affordable plan \navailable to them but to also make everyone aware that despite the \noverwhelming success of the Affordable Care Act--the uninsured rate in \nthis country has dropped by 30 percent since its inception only a few \nyears ago--there are still some who have not gone onto the exchanges \nand found a plan that can bring them into the ranks of those who now \nhave affordable insurance for the first time.\n  This is an important period for people across this country, but it is \nalso a moment for us to reflect on what has happened over the course of \nthe last 2 years, especially given all of those who were naysayers, all \nthose who predicted the country would fall apart or at the very least \nthe health care economy would fall apart after the passage of the \nAffordable Care Act. Of course, the exact opposite has happened.\n  We have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of people who don't \nhave\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\ninsurance. We have seen people be able to gain enormous savings on the \namount of money they spend on health care.\n  We have seen the amount of money the Federal Government spends on \nhealth care dramatically reduced--a $1.2 trillion savings over the \nbaseline when the ACA was passed, the amount of money the Federal \nGovernment is projecting to save over a 10-year period of time.\n  We have seen quality get better. Indicators--from hospital \nreadmissions to infection rates--are all going in positive trendlines \nbecause, of course, the Affordable Care Act isn't just about getting \npeople access to affordable care, it is also about transforming our \npayment system away from one that just bases our reimbursement system \non the amount of medicine practiced to one that is actually rewarding \nthe quality and outcomes that are gleaned as a part of our health care \nsystem.\n  It is a triple whammy. More people have access to affordable care; we \nare spending less money than we had planned to spend, by dramatic \nnumbers, from the Federal perspective; and we are getting better \nquality outcomes.\n  Lots of us have ideas about how we can improve the Affordable Care \nAct, and we hope that with the legislative fights behind us and with \nthe judicial fights largely behind us, we can now focus on ways to \nperfect this law. But there is no question that it is returning \nenormous benefits to people across this country.\n  Here is just another quick way to look at it. As shown here, this is \nthe percentage of uninsured by county across the country. Here is 2013. \nYou can see that in almost every county, we have north of 16 percent \nuninsured. But look how quickly these numbers change. Look how quickly \nalmost every county, at least in the sort of vast swath of territory \nfrom the Northwest across to the Northeast, moves down to 2015, where \nwe have majority sections of the country with close to 10 percent \nuninsured--a 30-percent national reduction in the number of people \nwithout insurance. We still have these big gaps where people are in the \ncoverage gap, people who are making so little money that they don't \nqualify for Medicaid but also can't get into the subsidies, but this is \nenormous progress all across the country. We can make more progress, \nand a lot of that comes through consumers being educated during this \nopen enrollment period as to the choices in front of them.\n  Here are some stunning numbers. Eighty-six percent of current \nenrollees--people who are on Affordable Care Act plans today--can find \na lower premium plan at the same level before tax credits by returning \nto the marketplace to shop for coverage. If every consumer in the \ncountry went back and shopped for the lowest cost premium plan at the \nsame level, the total savings across the country would be $4.5 billion. \nThe average consumer--let's say you bought a silver plan last year and \nyou decided to shop for a better deal this year--can save about $52 a \nmonth. That results in a savings of about $625 a year. So shopping can \nsave you money.\n  You might be satisfied with your plan--and the satisfaction numbers \nare pretty remarkable. Seventy-five percent of people who are on the \nexchange today report being wholly satisfied with their plan, which is, \nfrankly, a higher satisfaction level than for those who are on private \ninsurance outside of the exchanges. But even if you are satisfied, go \nback and look at the plans that are available to you. You can find a \nplan that will get you the same coverage for lower costs. Let's make \nsure people are getting that return on their investment.\n  The good news is that there is more choice out there than ever \nbefore. Every year since the inception of the Affordable Care Act, \nplans have been added to these State-based and Federal exchanges. The \naverage number of issuers on an exchange was 8 in 2013 and then 9 in \n2014 and then 10 in 2015. So choice for the average consumer is \nincreasing. Now, there are certain areas in which choices maybe stayed \nthe same or maybe in some areas choices have been reduced, but on \naverage across the country, you have more choices today than you did \nbefore, so there is no excuse not to go back out and try to find a plan \nthat saves you some money.\n  In Connecticut, we are probably the poster child for effective \nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act. We are a small State. We \nhave a congressional delegation of only five in the House of \nRepresentatives. Yet we have had 700,000 Connecticut residents who have \nobtained health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, either on \nthe exchange or on Medicaid. We have gone from an 8-percent uninsured \nrate--so we were already on the low end--down to a 3.8-percent \nuninsured rate. That is a remarkable number over the course of just a \nfew years. We only have so much progress we can make when we have under \n4 percent uninsured, but we have a goal of putting 10 to 20,000 people \non the Affordable Care Act over the course of this open enrollment \nperiod.\n  Nationally, because we have made so much progress, the goals are \ngoing to be modest compared to years past as well, but the point of \ncoming down to the floor today is to say that at this point in the \nimplementation, when we have made such great progress, we want to \ncontinue to try to kick down the uninsured rate. But the real benefit \nin open enrollment is going to come not simply by reducing the number \nof people without insurance but by making sure that everybody is on the \nplan that best represents their financial and medical needs. Again, \nthat number--across the country, $4.5 billion could be saved between \nnow and the end of January--is pretty remarkable.\n  This Senator has been on the floor a number of times, along with my \ncolleagues, to talk about the simple premise that despite all of those \nwho have been rooting for the Affordable Care Act to fail, it has \nworked. It has worked from an empirical basis and an anecdotal basis. \nThe statistics don't lie. There are dramatic reductions in the number \nof people without insurance, dramatic reductions in the pace of health \ncare inflation, and dramatic improvement in the quality of medicine \nbeing practiced across the country.\n  We all have stories of individuals from our State whose lives have \nbeen transformed by this act. There are parents who no longer have to \nworry about their children being locked into a future dictated by their \nillness, cancer patients who now know they are going to be able to have \naccess to an affordable product and will never be denied access to \nhealth care just because of their illness, and taxpayers who see a \ntrajectory of health care spending that is not going to bankrupt this \ncountry as fast as it would have had we not put changes inside this \nact.\n  So open enrollment is open until January 31, 2016. I encourage all my \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues to get the word out about this. \nEveryone has constituents who can benefit. Whether or not you support \nthe Affordable Care Act, it is the law of the land and your \nconstituents can benefit from it. We should all be out there talking \nabout the potential for our constituents collectively to save almost $5 \nbillion if they shop on Affordable Care Act exchanges between now and \nthe end of January.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senators Kirk and Tester for \ntheir bipartisan leadership on a measure that is vastly improved since \nthe vote we had on a similar measure recently. I know this topic is \nvery close to the heart of the Presiding Officer, and I thank him for \nhis leadership as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It is \ntruly a tremendous challenge that we are working step by step to \naddress.\n  About a month ago, I came to the floor to help raise serious concerns \nabout the funding levels in the MILCON-VA appropriations bill that we \nare now addressing because it contained serious, egregious shortfalls. \nAs a result, I could not support it. Veterans in Connecticut as \nrecently as this weekend asked me how and why I could vote against a \nmeasure that provided funding for the VA. My answer is: It wasn't \nenough. It wasn't good enough. It failed to do the job.\n  This measure, fortunately, is a profoundly important step toward \naddressing the needs of our veterans and keeping faith with them, \nmaking sure that we leave no veteran behind. This new version provides \nwhat many of us have been fighting to achieve--real help for our \nveterans.\n  We are about to consider an amendment that would restore much needed \nfunding to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Kirk-Tester \namendment provides a much needed increase in funding for the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, bringing full funding to that agency--$71.2 \nbillion. That amount is $2 billion more--to be precise, $1.97 billion--\nover the previous reported bill, which will supplement the VA's medical \nservices. This additional funding is not window dressing. It is not a \nconvenience or a luxury. It will allow the VA to more appropriately \naccount for treating hepatitis C, supporting the family caregiver \nprogram, and providing care in the community. Demand for care from the \nVA has continued to grow in recent months, and I will continue with my \ncolleagues and with the Department to ensure that the VA is spending \nthe funds in an appropriate manner, with integrity and responsiveness, \nto provide high quality, timely health care to our veterans.\n  This bill also fully funds the operation of the VA Benefits \nAdministration. The VBA has been plagued by problems, some of them \nattributable to underfunding, and this amount at $2.69 billion will \nfacilitate the transformation from a paper-based claims process to a \ndigital one. It will allow the VA to hire hundreds of new claims \nprocessors, speeding and streamlining the system so that veterans \nreceive the benefits they have earned and are spared the rigamarole and \nredtape that has so often produced a backlog.\n  Recognizing increased demands, the bill also provides an increase of \n$20\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\nmillion for funding VA-State extended care facilities. It provides $20 \nmillion in rural health care funding specifically for construction \ngrants, meeting the needs of State extended care homes in rural areas. \nWe are demonstrating here how the VA can partner with States to \nflexibly and efficiently deliver long-term care to an aging \npopulation--like other segments of our population, the VA beneficiaries \nare aging--sparing them the time and expense of constructing and \noperating new VA facilities.\n  I have also filed important amendments to improve the provision of \nhealth care and research at the VA, ensuring that the VA is providing \ngender-specific prostheses, for example--particularly important as we \nsee more and more women serve in combat zones--as well as ensuring that \nVA research dollars are spent in areas of toxic exposures. These \npriorities ought to be at the top of the list for all. They are for me.\n  VA continues to have a significant need for resources and personnel. \nSecretary McDonald indicated just last Friday that the agency continues \nto need about 4,300 more physicians and 10,000 nurses. I am working \nwith the VA on legislation to meet this need. I look forward to working \nwith my colleague, the Presiding Officer, as well as the Appropriations \nCommittee to address these priorities and others that are so critically \nimportant to final passage of this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7854-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONDEMNING PALESTINIAN TERROR ATTACKS AGAINST ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, since the beginning of October, \nPalestinians armed with knives, meat cleavers, guns, and cars have \ncarried out approximately 77 attacks, leaving 159 Israelis wounded and \n12 dead. Two Americans have been killed in these gruesome attacks, \nincluding Richard Lakin, who was a Glastonbury, CT, elementary school \nprincipal and civil rights activist before he moved to Israel in 1984. \nConnecticut grieves for our dear friend and colleague to our educators \nthere, who perished while seeking peace. That was his goal. That was \nhis mission.\n  The Palestinian Authority must be held accountable for incitement, \nand it must work to stem this tide of visceral violence. Repeated, \nreprehensible attacks on innocent Israeli civilians follow President \nAbbas' dangerous disavowal of commitments made during the peace \nprocess. He has disavowed those commitments, and he has renounced them. \nThese attacks must be stopped with leadership from the Palestinian \nAuthority.\n  That is why I have introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator \nAyotte, and more than half the Senate has now joined with us to stand \nwith Israel, to condemn these Palestinian terror attacks, and to \nreaffirm Israel's commitment to the continued maintenance of the status \nquo on the Temple Mount. I look forward to returning to the floor to \nhave this resolution passed. It is time the Senate spoke out over this \nviolence that has engulfed Israel and threatens everyday Israelis \ntrying to live their normal lives in peace. It is time for America to \nspeak out, as it is doing now, day in and day out.\n  I have visited Jerusalem, Israel's capital, and seen how remarkable a \nplace it is, both in terms of being home to three monotheistic faiths \nand in the remarkable way that Israel has maintained respect and proper \naccess for all religions and for their practices.\n  Israel stands alone as a nation committed to tolerance and respect \nfor all faiths. This resolution serves as an expression of our support \nand our solidarity with Israel in bringing this violence to an end and \nas our resolve to help stabilize security for both Palestinians and \nIsraelis.\n  I have said before--and I feel more passionately and deeply now than \never before--that Palestinian political goals will never be achieved \nthrough violence. As efforts to deescalate this situation move \nforward--and I support them--this resolution calls on all parties to \nreturn to the negotiating table immediately and without preconditions. \nIsrael is already committed to peace negotiations without \npreconditions. I continue to support a two-state solution that is \nacceptable to all parties, involving direct negotiations with the \nactive and sustained support of the United States and the international \ncommunity.\n  My hope also is that the United States will continue to support \nIsrael by reaffirming our unshakeable commitment to Israel's security. \nToday, President Obama met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. I hope that \nmeeting will serve to bolster the bonds between our two great \ncountries. I understand it went well. I certainly hope it did.\n  I joined Senator Bennet, along with 14 other Senators, in writing to \nthe President and urging him to prioritize discussing with Mr. \nNetanyahu the historic renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding on \nU.S. Military Assistance to help Israel prepare for, respond to, and \ndefend against threats that are more pressing and dangerous than ever, \nand to ensure its qualitative military edge.\n  I note that my wonderful friend and colleague from Illinois is \nwaiting to speak, so I will end here and say that the current MOU \nprovides $30 billion in assistance to Israel through fiscal year 2018.\n  As threats in the region continue to evolve, including Iran's \npotentially malign influence, the administration must engage at the \nhighest level to continue to develop a shared understanding of threats \nconfronting Israel by strengthening the MOU that serves as the \nfoundation of our bilateral security efforts.\n  I will always fight to uphold Israel's security, and I am committed \nto opposing efforts to delegitimize Israel. We can stand together on a \nbipartisan basis, and this cause must always be bipartisan, must always \nbe above politics. I will continue to work toward ensuring that the \npartnership in this body and the partnership between the United States \nand Israel is strengthened and enduring.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Blumenthal. I join him in condemning the violence \nthat is taking place in the streets of the Middle East and Jerusalem \nand other places. I also join him in calling for a two-state solution \nso that we can have both the Palestinian people and the people of \nIsrael living safely and securely without fear of any kind of military \naction from one against the other. That should be our ultimate goal, \nand we should renew that goal regularly. I join him in what he had to \nsay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7854-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7854-S7855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on another topic, you can't serve in the \nSenate without some level of patience. It takes forever to get things \ndone around here--that is, the big things.\n  Fifteen years ago, I introduced a bill called the DREAM Act. That was \n15 years ago, the year 2000. What were we going to do with these young \npeople who came to the United States--brought here as babies, infants, \ntoddlers, children--when they finished high school and were looking to \nthe future? The DREAM Act said that if they have no serious criminal \nissues, if they have finished school, we will give them a chance--a \nchance to work their way toward legal status and citizenship.\n  I introduced that bill 15 years ago. It has had its ups and downs. At \ntimes it has passed in the House; other times it has passed in the \nSenate. We have never been able to align those two bodies to pass the \nbill at the same time.\n  It was June 27, 2013--almost 2\\1/2\\ years ago--when it last passed in \nthe Senate. It was part of comprehensive immigration reform. Sixty-\neight Senators voted for that bill--14 Republicans and 54 Democrats. It \nwas a bipartisan bill, comprehensive immigration reform.\n  We took the bill and sent it to the Republican-controlled House of \nRepresentatives, and they refused to call the bill or even debate it on \nthe floor of the House of Representatives. It was frustrating. A group \nof us had worked for months to put that bill together. The House would \nnot even consider it, wouldn't even debate it, didn't offer an \nalternative. They were silent. Virtually all of them were silent but \nnot every one of them.\n  This was a historic meeting in the city of Chicago. These two \ngentlemen are my friends, one my colleague from Illinois, Congressman \nLuis Gutierrez, and the other the new Speaker of the\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Paul Ryan from Janesville, WI. \nThey appeared at a famous setting in Chicago, the City Club, and talked \nabout immigration. Let me read what Congressman Paul Ryan said as a \nvisitor joining Congressman Gutierrez in 2013:\n\n       We all must acknowledge that we have an immigration system \n     that's broken. It is not serving our interest as a nation. \n     Our broken immigration system does not serve our national \n     security interests. Our broken immigration system does not \n     serve our economic security interests. Our broken immigration \n     system does not serve our family interests.\n\n  Congressman Ryan went on to say:\n\n       And so, when Republicans and Democrats look at this \n     situation and see something that's broken, we need to fix it. \n     We have to offer people a path to earned legalization. We \n     have to invite people to come out of the shadows.\n\n  That was an extraordinary statement. It was heralded not just in \nChicago but around the country as a statement that a leader would make \ntrying to lead his party into a positive view toward immigration \nreform. It was a statement made by Congressman Paul Ryan in the year \n2013. I applauded it, praised it. Many of us did.\n  But now we have another statement by the new Speaker of the House, \nPaul Ryan. He has basically said that the Republicans are going to do \nnothing--nothing on immigration. He says he can't trust the President, \nand as long as he can't trust the President, he is going to do nothing \nas the new Republican leader of the House. So he is going to consider \nabsolutely no legislation to fix our broken immigration system.\n  Why did President Obama take the actions that he did, creating a \nprogram known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA? \nIt was the President's response to the failure of Republican leaders in \nthe House to even consider the issue of immigration.\n  What is DACA? DACA is a program created by Executive order that gives \nto these young people who qualified as DREAMers temporary status in the \nUnited States so they cannot be deported. They have to come forward, \nsubmit themselves for a criminal background check, pay a fee, and be \nmonitored. If they should get in trouble, commit a crime, they are \ngone, they are deported. So far, 700,000 of these young people have \ncome forward as part of the DACA Program.\n  The House Republicans have tried to stop the program, eliminate the \nprogram. I assume that, like some candidates for President, they want \nto deport all these young people. That is unfortunate because many of \nthese young people who now have at least temporary protection by DACA \nare doing some absolutely extraordinary things. I would like to talk \nabout one of them this evening.\n  This young lady's name is Maricela Aguilar. She is from Speaker \nRyan's home State of Wisconsin. In 1995, when Maricela was 3 years old, \nher mother brought her to the United States to give her a better life. \nMaricela's family settled in Milwaukee, WI. She worked hard and \nexcelled in school. During high school, Maricela was on the honor roll, \nwas a member of the National Honor Society, and was captain of the \ncross-country team. At the same time, she was active in her community; \nshe was a volunteer at a homeless shelter.\n  When it came time to apply for colleges, she wanted to stay close to \nher family. She wanted to stay in Speaker Ryan's home State of \nWisconsin. She applied to a lot of schools. She was offered a full \ntuition scholarship to Marquette University in Milwaukee. That is an \nextraordinary school. My son went there, so I am partial, but it is an \nextraordinary school because it gave her a chance.\n  Keep in mind that this young lady, because she is undocumented, \ndoesn't qualify for any government assistance--none. Sacrifices had to \nbe made by her family and others to help her go to Marquette. She went \nthere. She was on the dean's list, double major--political science and \nEnglish literature. She worked part time as a waitress to make ends \nmeet to pay for her college expenses. She became involved in advocating \nfor immigration reform.\n  In 2010 Maricela was here in the Senate Gallery along with hundreds \nof other DREAMers when the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act due to a \nRepublican filibuster. We got a majority of votes; we couldn't get 60.\n  I met with Maricela in 2011 when she came to Washington to talk about \nher concerns about DREAMers just like herself who faced deportation.\n  In 2012 Maricela graduated with honors, in the top 10 percent of her \ngraduating class at Marquette in Milwaukee, WI.\n  Later that year President Obama created the deferred action plan that \ngave her and hundreds of thousands of others a chance to stay and not \nbe deported. She was able to apply and go to graduate school at \nBrandeis University in Boston. She continues to work on immigration \nreform and is a leader of the Student Immigration Movement of \nMassachusetts.\n  She is going to return to Milwaukee when she graduates, she promises. \nShe wants to become a public school teacher so she can use her \neducation to help young people in the city where she grew up. She is a \nloyal Wisconsinite, a loyal member of the Milwaukee community.\n  I would say to Speaker Ryan: She wants to be a part of your State for \nthe rest of her life.\n  Maricela and other DREAMers have so much to give America. Can we use \nmore public school teachers with her talent? Of course we can. But \nSpeaker Ryan and other Republican leaders in Congress have made their \nagenda clear: They want to shut down this program and tell Maricela she \ncan't stay to continue her education. They want to deport her to her \ncountry, which she hasn't been to since she was 3 years old and has no \nmemory of it. She would be deported to Mexico, a place she may have \nexperienced as a toddler but can't even remember.\n  Will America be a stronger country, will Wisconsin be a better State, \nwill Milwaukee be a better city if Maricela is now told to leave after \nshe has obtained her bachelor's degree and is working on her graduate \ndegree? I think the answer is clear: If she stays, we will all be \nbetter for it and she will be better for it.\n  Instead of deporting DREAMers like Maricela, Speaker Paul Ryan should \nsupport DACA and work with the Democrats to pass comprehensive \nimmigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7855-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7855-S7856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Wednesday, Americans all across the \ncountry will gather to honor all those who have fought for freedom and \nthank them for a debt we can never fully repay. Whenever freedom is \nthreatened, our brave men and women of America have answered the call.\n  In honor of Veterans Day on Wednesday, I will take a moment to \nrecognize an amazing Illinois veteran, part of what we call the \n``greatest generation.''\n  It was December 7, 1941--as FDR said just a few steps away from us in \nthe House Chamber, a day which will live in infamy. The Imperial \nJapanese forces launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. That also \nhappened to be the 22nd birthday of Tony Gargano, and it was the day he \ndecided he would enlist in the U.S. Navy. Tony was assigned to a ship \ndisguised as a merchant marine vessel. He and his shipmates didn't wear \nNavy uniforms or carry IDs, and their ship had no guns.\n  In November of 1942, a German ship--also disguised as a merchant \nvessel--sank the ship Tony was on. Tony survived and was taken as a \nprisoner aboard the German ship. Then he was turned over to the \nJapanese, where he spent the next 3 years as a prisoner working in a \ncoal mine. Every day he would come out of the mine covered head to toe \nwith coal dust. In those 3 years, Tony never had a chance to take a \nshower, never could wash his hands--3 years. He worked more than 10 \nhours a day on less than 8 ounces of water and 6 ounces of spoiled \nrice.\n  Here is how he described his experience:\n\n       They torture you. They beat the hell out of us. You'd try \n     to get up and they'd beat you back to the ground. You prayed \n     to God they would kill you.\n\n  By the time the war was over and the Red Cross arrived, Tony couldn't \nbelieve he was still alive. After he arrived in the United States, they \nquarantined him for weeks. He couldn't even call his family to tell \nthem he was alive. But he made it, and he came home.\n  Now fast-forward 70 years. Tony is 95 years old. He marvels at his \ngood fortune. After the war, he came home and\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\nmarried Julia Elliot, the love of his life. They worked 6 days a week. \nHe was maitre d' at Elliot's Pine Log Restaurant in Skokie, IL. He \nwatched his son and daughter grow up and enjoyed the arrival of five \ngrandchildren and five great-grandchildren. What a life.\n  Last month Tony Gargano came to Washington with the Honor Flight. He \nvisited the White House and the World War II Memorial. He shared his \nstory with the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress. \nThey asked him: ``What do you think of when you look back on your \nlife?''\n  Here is what Tony said:\n\n       Everything turned out pretty good. I met a nice, young \n     lady. We got married, and spent 60 beautiful years together. \n     I have no complaints.\n\n  Isn't that an amazing statement for a man who served 3 years as a \nprisoner of war and was nearly killed in the effort. The joys of Tony's \nlife have outshined the horrors of that war. If you ask Tony if he is a \nhero, he says:\n\n       There were others who had it much worse. The people we \n     should honor are the ones where the white crosses are. Those \n     are your heroes.\n\n  Tony is right, but Tony is a hero too. Tony Gargano faced an \nunspeakable evil with grace, courage, and determination. He lived his \nlife with love in his heart, and that makes him, even to this day, a \ntrue American hero.\n  It is the service and sacrifice of people like Tony we will continue \nto honor not just on Veterans Day this Wednesday, but we should honor \nthem every day. Too often servicemembers return home only to find \nthemselves facing a myriad of challenges, from the physical and mental \nwounds of war to struggling to find work, an education or a home. We \ncan't simply commemorate their service by waving our flags, marching in \ntheir parade, and then forgetting them. We have to ensure that veterans \nand their families have access to the best health care, education, \njobs, and housing.\n  I have been committed to this effort, and I have one program I am \nparticularly proud to have been a part of. It is called the VA \nCaregivers Program. It provides the families of severely disabled Iraq \nand Afghanistan War veterans the support they need to keep the veterans \nhome with their families. Thousands of veterans and their caregivers in \nIllinois and nationwide participate. It is a big, successful program. I \nrecently introduced legislation to expand it so it covers all veterans.\n  We know veterans face unnecessary delays and claims, processing and \nreimbursement, and I have worked hard to cut down on that backlog. I \nhave also tried to make our VA hospitals and medical centers in \nIllinois and across the country the best. It is the new method of \nmedical service being provided to our veterans, and it has to be the \nbest.\n  I have been proud to sponsor bills to strengthen post-traumatic \nstress disorder for veterans and their families as well as improve \northotics and prosthetics research and education. I have been proud to \nhelp veterans get homes and jobs. For example, just this year the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development and U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs awarded more than $674,000 in grants to assist \nhomeless veterans in my State through a tenant-based voucher program.\n  Let me say a word about a program I visited just this last week in \nChicago, which is an extraordinary program. The program is called Rags \nof Honor. It was created by my friend Mark Doyle. He wanted to do \nsomething to create good-paying jobs for homeless veterans, and so he \ndecided to print T-shirts and hired homeless veterans to do it. It is \non its third year now, and my friend has basically underwritten it, but \nthe fact is, it is a success.\n  These men and women who were living in their cars or living on the \nstreets now have good-paying jobs making T-shirts. These T-shirts are \nall made by veterans, some of whom were homeless. These are all \nAmerican products, all American made, and they are selling them and \npeople are buying them. Northwestern University decided they would turn \nto them and have them print T-shirts for some of their needs at the \nuniversity. I have used Rags of Honor T-shirts in my campaign. It is an \nexample of what can be done to help our veterans--just by one man who \nwas willing to dedicate a big part of his life to do it, and there are \nso many more like him.\n  I wish to thank all of those who have risked and given of \nthemselves--even the families of those who have given their lives for \nthis Nation--and for the wounds they suffered, the sacrifices they \nmade, and the freedoms we enjoy which they secured. We remember and \nhonor the service of every American veteran, not only at the eleventh \nhour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month but every day of the \nyear, because even though servicemembers and veterans like Tony Gargano \nmay shy away from being labeled as heroes, they are truly of the most \ndeserving of that honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7856-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7856-S7857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CAROLYN LUCILE McDONALD SHIPP\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to honor a native Utahn and dear \nfriend on the occasion of her 80th birthday.\n  Carolyn Lucile McDonald Shipp was born on December 5, 1935, in the \nL.D.S. hospital in Salt Lake City, UT. She is the first living child \nborn to Andrew Melvin and Lucile McDonald. She is the sister to three \nbrothers, two deceased, and two sisters, one deceased. She was born in \nthe midst of the Great Depression and lived through the rationing in \nWorld War II. The Utah she grew up in was very rural. The only thing \nbetween the house she was raised in and the mountains was a great \ngully.\n  Carolyn's family home had no TV until she was a teenager, but she \nloved listening to the radio on Sunday afternoons. Raised with a strong \nwork ethic, daily and weekly chores were a must do before any \nrecreation. Her home had only one bathroom for a family of seven and \nshared a party line telephone with four neighbors.\n  Carolyn was an accomplished pianist and in the a capella choir, but \nit was dancing that gave her the greatest joy growing up. She took \nballet and excelled at tap dancing. Carolyn was popular in high school \nand recalls those carefree times very fondly.\n  A classic beauty--many have compared to the movie star Kim Novak--\nCarolyn was a natural at modeling and was asked to represent East High \nin a number of fashion shows during her senior year in high school.\n  Carolyn treasured her time at East High in Salt Lake City and \nmaintains strong friendships to this very day with many of her friends \nfrom that time. Her grandchildren are very impressed that their \ngrandmother went to the now famous East High School of the High School \nMusical movie fame.\n  From high school, Carolyn went to the University of Utah, where she \npledged the Alpha Chi Omega sorority, where she was the exchange \nchairman responsible for planning parties. She dated athletes and \nmajored in elementary education. She recalls that, as soon as she began \ntaking classes in elementary education, she knew she was born to teach \nchildren.\n  After college, Carolyn spent a summer working and playing in Hawaii \nand then settled in as a young teacher back in Utah. During her second \nyear of teaching, she was introduced to Royal Shipp, who became her \nhusband and the great love of her life. They were married in the Salt \nLake City Temple.\n  Carolyn has loved being married and has described it as ``having a \nslumber party every night with your best friend.'' During their early \nmarried life, Carolyn continued teaching while Royal continued his \neducation.\n  A few years after their marriage, Carolyn and Royal, along with their \ntwo small daughters, Becky and Kristy, moved to Virginia, so Royal \ncould work in Washington, DC.\n  The family stayed in the DC Metro area and added another girl, Julie, \nand finally a boy, Philip, to the family. The family grew up during a \nturbulent time in our country: the Vietnam war, Watergate, and the \nintegration of the public schools all contributed to an uneasy climate. \nBut no matter what was going on outside the home, Carolyn and\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nRoyal made sure their home was a safe and loving place.\n  Carolyn was a stay-at-home mother until her youngest started first \ngrade. At that time, she began to prepare for her second career, a \ntutor for children with learning disabilities. Carolyn worked for many \nyears at the Potomac School in McLean, VA.\n  As she raised her family, Carolyn held a number of stake and ward \nleadership positions in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day \nSaints, including Relief Society president and Young Women's president. \nHer faith has always been an integral part of Carolyn's life. For many \nyears, Carolyn and Royal have served in the Bella Vista Spanish Ward, \nwhere they are dearly loved. Carolyn also served with Royal as area \nhumanitarian missionaries in Colombia and Venezuela. Carolyn continues \nher service as a worker in the Washington, DC, temple.\n  As a mother and a grandmother, Carolyn has worked to create family \nmemories and traditions. She decorates her home for all the holidays \nand takes great pride in having fresh flowers, candles, lovely dishes, \nand table arrangements. Every Christmas, her grandchildren put on a \nChristmas program. Every Easter features an egg hunt at her home. \nBirthdays and other milestones are always celebrated with a special \nfamily dinner.\n  Most years, Carolyn and Royal host the entire family for a weekly \ntrip to the Outer Banks, NC. The family cherishes this time as it has \ncontributed to lasting memories and close ties between siblings and \ncousins alike.\n  People are the treasures of Carolyn's life. She relishes the company \nof her friends in her book club and her social group, ``The Times \nClub.'' She travels to Utah regularly to reconnect with her high school \nand college friends.\n  Her 12 grandchildren are the lights of her life. She regularly \nattends school and church function featuring her grandchildren. She \nnever misses a single one of her grandchildren's plays or concerts, and \nshe travels regularly to Kansas to see her grandchildren participate in \nstudent government activities, cheerleading, and playing sports. \nCarolyn helps her grandchildren as they make the transition into \nadulthood by supporting them on their LDS missions, foreign travel, \ncareer development, and assisting with wedding preparations.\n  Carolyn Lucile McDonald Shipp is the embodiment of service, love, and \ncompassion. It is a privilege to help her celebrate her 80th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7857-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7857-S7858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WORLD WAR II HEROES AND HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, November 11, Americans across \nthe country will gather to honor those who have fought for our freedom \nand thank them for a debt we can never fully repay.\n  This year marks the 97th anniversary of the end of World War I. Our \nvictory in that ``war to end all wars'' showed us that we could not \nignore the rest of the world. And as President Clinton said, ``while \nthat war proved our strength, it did not prove our wisdom. . . . We \nturned our backs on the rest of the world. We ignored the signs of \ndanger. Soon we had a Great Depression, and soon that depression led to \naggression and then to another world war--one that would claim a half \nmillion American lives.''\n  Whenever freedom is threatened, our brave men and women have answered \nthe call to serve. Today, I would like to highlight our debt to the \nheroes and survivors of World War II. Earlier this year, we \ncommemorated International Holocaust Remembrance Day and paid tribute \nto the nearly 6 million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime. This year \nmarks the 70th anniversary that Allied Forces entered concentration \ncamps--like Auschwitz-Birkenau--and liberated thousands of prisoners.\n  On the eve of this Veterans Day, nine American heroes and Holocaust \nsurvivors are being honored in my home State of Illinois. Today, I want \nto share their remarkable stories. As the memory of the Holocaust \npasses from those who were there to the generations that weren't we \ncan't forget the importance of remembrance.\n  GEN Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme commander of Allied Forces in \nEurope, understood this and documented what he saw. After visiting a \nliberated Nazi camp, he urged Washington to send congressional \ndelegations to witness Nazi crimes firsthand so that in the future \nthere could be no attempt to dismiss these allegations as \n``propaganda.''\n  With the remaining eyewitnesses in their twilight years, the \nresponsibility to ensure that future generations never forget these \natrocities falls to us. I want to commend these men and women for their \nbrave actions and quiet courage. Today, we honor their sacrifice by \nremembering the horrors they witnessed and proclaiming in one unified \nvoice: ``Never again.'' I am privileged to honor them and remember \ntheir stories. They are true heroes.\n  I would like to acknowledge Dr. George Brent, Edith Stern, Margie \nOppenheimer, Hannah Messinger, Walter Reed, Joseph Dobryman, Lewis \nPazoles, Harry Nichols, and Anthony Gargano. But behind every name is a \nstory. I ask unanimous consent to have their stories printed in the \nRecord.\n  Our hearts break for these men and women who mourn their families. \nBut while their stories agonize, they also inspire. Their lives are not \njust stories of survival; they are stories of triumph and grace in the \nface of unspeakable evil. I want to thank each of them for the courage \nto share their stories.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            Dr. George Brent\n\n       When George was 14 years old, he and his entire family were \n     transported by cattle car to Auschwitz-Birkenau with \n     thousands of other Hungarian Jews. When they arrived at the \n     camp, those who were still alive were dragged off the cars \n     and forced into one of two lines. An SS soldier decided \n     whether they would go left or right. George and his father \n     were sent one direction--to live; his mother and ten year-old \n     brother were sent the other direction--to die.\n       As the Allied Forces advanced, George was sent on a death \n     march from Auschwitz and then on a coal train to Mauthausen-\n     Ebensee Concentration Camp in Austria. On May 6, 1945, \n     General Patton's 3rd Army Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron \n     liberated the camp. Here's how one of General Patton's tank \n     commanders described what he saw: ``thousands of skeleton-\n     like figures who were skin and bones. The living laying side \n     by side, often times indistinguishable, from the dead.'' \n     George was one of the prisoners that survived. He was moved \n     to a displaced persons camp and learned how to be a dental \n     technician. In 1949, George came to America. He learned a new \n     language and started a new life.\n       In 1950, he joined the United States Air Force and served \n     as a dental assistant during the Korean War. Following his \n     service, he attended dental school at the University of \n     Illinois--and has practiced dentistry until 2011--when he \n     retired at the age of 81. Dr. Brent not only survived these \n     horrors, he thrived. George Brent may not have been born in \n     America, but he is an American hero.\n\n\n                              Edith Stern\n\n       In February 1942, when Edith, 21 years old, and her parents \n     were deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. She met and \n     married her husband, Otto Rebenwurzel, at Theresienstadt. In \n     1944, not long after the wedding, Edith and her mother were \n     sent to Auschwitz where a sign mockingly read, ``Work makes \n     you free.'' At Auschwitz, Josef Mengele stood before them to \n     decide their fate. Left meant survival, for a few weeks at \n     least. Right meant death in the gas chamber. Edith's mother \n     was sent to her right. She was 55 years old when she died. \n     Edith was sent to a forced labor camp.\n       In 1944, while Edith was in the Theresienstadt Ghetto with \n     her husband, she became pregnant. By early 1945, her \n     pregnancy began to show and she was transferred to the \n     Grossschoenau labor camp. Edith was liberated from \n     Grossschoenau when she was nine months pregnant. Still \n     dressed in her striped blue prison uniform, she immediately \n     went into labor. Three days after giving birth, the baby she \n     named Peter, died.\n       Edith moved to the United States in 1964 and became an \n     administrator at the Self Help Home on the South Side of \n     Chicago. After living through the horrors of war, Edith's \n     belief in the goodness of mankind was unshakable. She devoted \n     her life to helping others rebuild their lives. What an \n     inspiration.\n\n\n                           Margie Oppenheimer\n\n       Seventy-seven years ago, Margie awoke to a Nazi soldier \n     pointing a rifle at her face--she was 14 years old. It was \n     November 9, 1938, Kristallnacht--the night of broken glass--\n     when Nazi soldiers coordinated attacks all over Jewish \n     communities in Germany and Austria. Windows were smashed. \n     Synagogues burned. Homes and Jewish-owned stores ransacked \n     and looted. Margie's family apartment and small department \n     store were destroyed. This night began seven years of terror \n     for Margie and her family. She was sent to five concentration \n     camps: Sloka, Riga-Kaiserwald, Bruss-Sophienwalde, Stutthof \n     and Goddentow. As a prisoner of these camps, she hauled \n     backbreaking cement bags, was beaten with clubs, broke \n     concrete, laid bricks, fought hunger . . . fear . . . and\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\n     typhus. Through it all, she repeated the words: ``I WILL be \n     strong. I want to live.''\n       One day at the Stutthof concentration camp, Margie was \n     emaciated and unable to work. She was placed into new \n     barracks and had the Roman numeral II scrawled on her \n     forearm--it was a death sentence. That night, two of her \n     friends did the unimaginable. Without saying a word, they \n     pulled a helpless Margie under an electric fence to another \n     side of the camp and they scrubbed off the number on her arm. \n     She was no longer marked for death.\n       On March 10, 1945, Margie was liberated. She was 21 years \n     old. In 1953, Margie and her husband came to the United \n     States. She became a nurse. And just as her friends helped \n     her at the Stuffhof camp on that fateful night, she devoted \n     her life to helping those who couldn't help themselves.\n\n\n                            Hannah Messinger\n\n       In 1938, Hannah and her family were forced to abandon their \n     home and business. A few months before her twentieth \n     birthday, Hannah married Karl Kohorn. In 1941, Carl was \n     deported to the Theresienstadt Ghetto. Two weeks later, so \n     was Hannah. Hannah worked as a hairdresser--an occupation in \n     high demand--because the Germans wouldn't allow women to have \n     long hair. In 1942, Hannah's parents and sister arrived at \n     Theresienstadt, but stayed only three days before being \n     deported to Auschwitz.\n       Hannah is one of the last living witnesses to the \n     International Red Cross visit to Theresienstadt on June 23, \n     1944. The Nazis created an elaborate hoax to show how well \n     Jews were being treated under the ``benevolent'' Third Reich. \n     It was lie. More than 33,000 inmates died as a result of \n     malnutrition, disease, or the sadistic treatment by the Nazis \n     at Theresienstadt.\n       On May 8, 1945, Allied Forces liberated the Merzdorf labor \n     camp--where Hannah was moved to. But when she returned to \n     Prague she learned that all her family members were murdered.\n       After the war, Hannah began corresponding with an Aunt in \n     Budapest--her last surviving relative in Europe. In the \n     letters, Hannah poured her heart out sharing Holocaust \n     experiences and losses and recounting the suffering she and \n     her loved ones endured. When her aunt read the letters out \n     loud, a friend of the family, Imre, was listening and fell in \n     love with her writings. Imre began to correspond with Hannah \n     directly. Through those letters, they fell in love. Hannah \n     moved to the United States in 1946. Eventually, Imre joined \n     her. They married the following year and moved to Chicago. \n     Hannah has created pencil drawings based on her experiences \n     as a prisoner in several concentration and labor camps from \n     1941-1945. A number of her pieces can be seen at the United \n     States Holocaust Museum in 2010 and in the Smithsonian. \n     Hannah's work allows future generations to better understand \n     her experience and see it through her own eyes.\n\n\n                              Walter Reed\n\n       On Kristallnacht, Walter was jailed by Nazi soldiers for 3 \n     days--he was 14 years old. In 1939, his parents put him on a \n     Kindertransport (children's transport) to Belgium. This \n     decision saved his life. Walter lived in a boys home near \n     Brussels until the Germans invaded in 1940. Walter and more \n     than 90 other children escaped to southern France, where they \n     lived in a barn and later in an abandoned chateau--they \n     became known as the ``Children of La Hille.''\n       In 1941, Walter was able to leave France for New York. He \n     became a U.S. citizen in 1943 and returned to Europe in 1944 \n     as a soldier in the United States Army. Walter served in the \n     95th Infantry Division under General George Patton. His team \n     was charged with interrogating German prisoners and civilians \n     near the front lines. Walter first arrived in the United \n     States as a survivor of the war and he returned as an \n     American hero.\n\n\n                            Joseph Dobryman\n\n       In 1941, Joseph was 18 years old and forced into the \n     Bialystock Ghetto with his parents and two brothers. The \n     Ghetto was liquidated in 1943 and everyone was sent to camps. \n     Jospeph and his brother Henry were separated from the rest of \n     their family. In 1943, they sent to the Lomza Ghetto and then \n     to the Danzig, Auschwitz-Birkenau and Bergen Belsen \n     concentration camps for the rest of the war. Joseph and Henry \n     were liberated from Bergen Belsen by Allied Forces in 1945. \n     They were the only members of their family that survived.\n       In 1949, Joseph married Nettie Goldberg and they made their \n     way to the United States. They had no family waiting for \n     them, but Joseph found work as a plumber and went to school \n     at night to learn English. Joseph and Nettie settled and \n     raised their family in Skokie, Illinois, where he still lives \n     today.\n\n\n                             Lewis Pazoles\n\n       Lewis was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the son of Greek \n     immigrants. Immediately after graduating high school, Lewis \n     was drafted into the U.S. Army. On April 6, 1944, Lewis \n     joined a medical battalion attached to the 83rd infantry and \n     shipped out in a convoy to England to prepare for the \n     Normandy invasion. Corporal Lewis Pazoles and his unit, \n     followed General Patton's Army to Omaha Beach on June 11, \n     1944--five days after D-day. His unit proceeded to fight in \n     the Battle of the Bulge--and moved through the Ardennes, \n     Rhineland and Central Europe toward Germany.\n       On April 11, 2045, the 83rd liberated Langenstein--a sub \n     camp of Buchenwald--where they found about 1,100 malnourished \n     and emaciated prisoners. The prisoners were forced to work 16 \n     hour days in nearby mines and were shot if they were too weak \n     to work. Corporal Pazoles' unit reported that the death rate \n     at the camp was about 500 a month. The 83rd Infantry also \n     recovered Nazi documents later used by war crime \n     investigators.\n       In 1946, Corporal Pazoles was honorably discharged--he was \n     20 years old. He returned to the United States and became a \n     partner in his family's grocery store business in Chicago. \n     Today, Lewis and his wife reside in Palos Hills, Illinois.\n       Here are some of the honors that Corporal Pazoles received \n     during his service: The Victory Medal, The European African \n     Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon with 1 Silver Battle Star, 3 \n     Overseas Service Bars, the Good Conduct Medal, the Purple \n     Heart, and a Bronze Star. Lewis Pazoles is an American hero.\n\n\n                             Harry Nichols\n\n       Harry was born in Alliance, Ohio, and was drafted in the \n     U.S. Army in 1942. On June 6, 1944, Harry was in the third \n     wave of U.S. forces who stormed Omaha Beach in Normandy, \n     France. Known as Operation Neptune, it was the largest \n     amphibious operation ever attempted. More than 160,000 Allied \n     troops landed along the 50-mile stretch of heavily fortified \n     French coastline to fight the Nazis. Afterward, Harry fought \n     in the battle of St.-Lo and the Battle of the Bulge. He \n     helped liberate the French cities of Laval, LeMans, Orleans \n     and Nance. Harry also fought through Luxemburg and Holland, \n     crossed the Rhine River into Germany and up the Elbe River \n     before May 7, 1945--V-E Day.\n       In 1945, while training with his unit to fight in the \n     invasion of Japan--the Japanese surrendered. Harry returned \n     home to Ohio and began working in a bakery. In the late \n     1940s, he made his way to Chicago where he worked as a \n     waiter, a grocer and florist. Harry Nichols is an American \n     hero.\n\n\n                            Anthony Gargano\n\n       On December 7, 1941, Tony's 22nd birthday, the Japanese \n     attacked Pearl Harbor. Less than six weeks later, Tony \n     enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to one of three \n     ships masquerading as merchant vessels. In 1942, he and his \n     shipmates were captured by the Japanese and taken to Hakodate \n     prison camp on an island just north of mainland Japan. Tony \n     remained a POW for three years and was set free the day the \n     Japanese surrendered and abandoned the camp. He returned to \n     America, married the love of his life--Julia--and worked six \n     days a week as a maitre'd at Elliot's Pine Log Restaurant.\n       For nearly 70 years, Tony has kept the details of war and \n     the horrors of his imprisonment to himself, but has recently \n     began to share his story. Tony will tell you, he is not a \n     hero, his brothers lost in battle are the heroes.

Mr. President, after finally scheduling a few confirmation \nvotes on Federal judges last month, Senate Republicans have reverted \nback to holding up the confirmation process for no good reason. The \nAmerican people and the entire Federal justice system depend on the \nMembers of this body to fulfill our constitutional duty of providing \nadvice and consent on judicial nominees. This senatorial duty is one we \ncannot neglect. However, that is exactly what has happened since Senate \nRepublicans took over the majority this year.\n  I had hoped that last month's judicial confirmation votes were an \nindication that Senate Republicans were finally ready to make progress \non the backlog of well-qualified and uncontroversial nominees awaiting \ntheir confirmation vote. But again, this week, there is no sign of when \nthe next judicial nominee will receive a vote. This is no way to lead \nthe Senate. When Senate Democrats were in the majority during the last \n2 years of the Bush Presidency, we had already confirmed 34 judges by \nthis same time. I have heard Republicans trying to justify their \nslowdown on judicial nominations by claiming they should somehow \nreceive credit for 11 judges confirmed at the end of the last Congress. \nThat excuse holds no water. It is well-established Senate precedent \nthat all pending consensus nominees should be confirmed before the end \nof a year. And even if we added those 11 judges to the 9 confirmed this \nyear, that would still bring us to only 20--which is a far cry from the \n34 Democrats confirmed in the last 2 years of the Bush administration.\n  The process of confirming judges is about ensuring that the American \npeople have a fully functioning judiciary. Instead, because of \nRepublican obstruction, judicial vacancies have increased by more than \n50 percent since they took over the majority, and caseloads are piling \nup in courts throughout the\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\ncountry. Equally alarming is the fact that the number of judicial \nemergency vacancies since Senate Republicans took the majority has \nrisen by 158 percent. These vacancies impact communities across \nAmerica, and it is doing the most harm to States represented by at \nleast one Republican Senator. Of the 66 current vacancies that exist, \n48 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in States with at least one \nRepublican Senator.\n  We should take action right now and hold confirmation votes on the 21 \njudicial nominees pending on the floor. The next pending district and \ncircuit court nominees--who will both fill judicial emergency \nvacancies--were nominated 1 year ago, yet both are still awaiting the \nmajority leader's action to simply schedule their confirmation votes. \nThe next district court nominee on the Executive Calendar is LaShann \nHall, an outstanding African-American woman who has been nominated to \nserve in the Eastern District of New York. And directly following that \nnomination is Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo who, when confirmed, will be \nthe first ever Hispanic judge from Pennsylvania on the third circuit \nand only the second Hispanic judge to serve on the third circuit. Judge \nRestrepo has strong bipartisan support from his home State Senators, \nSenator Toomey and Senator Casey. At Judge Restrepo's hearing, Senator \nToomey stated that ``there is no question [Judge Restrepo] is a very \nwell qualified candidate to serve on the Third Circuit'' and \nunderscored the fact that he recommended that the President nominate \nJudge Restrepo. Although there is an urgent need to fill the emergency \nvacancy on the third circuit, the Republican leadership has refused to \nhold a confirmation vote. All Democrats support this nominee. I hope \nSenator Toomey will seek a firm commitment from his Republican \nleadership to schedule a vote this week for Judge Restrepo.\n  In addition to Judge Restrepo, a number of these pending nominees \nhave the support of their Republican home State Senators. Just last \nweek, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted out two Iowa nominees \nrecommended to the President by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. However, if Republican obstruction continues and if home \nState Senators cannot persuade the majority leader to schedule a vote \nfor their nominees soon, then it is unlikely that even highly qualified \nnominees with Republican support will be confirmed by the end of the \nyear.\n  No Senator has raised a single objection to any of the 21 judicial \nnominees pending on the floor. Each one was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee by unanimous voice vote, and each has the backing \nof their home State Senators, including Republican Senators. Senate \nRepublicans have no excuses left.\n  I hope the Republican Senator from Pennsylvania and the other \nRepublican Senators will implore their leadership to schedule votes on \nthe judicial nominees pending on the floor without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7859-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DETENTION OF HOSSAM BAHGAT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is no right that is more fundamental \nto a democracy than freedom of expression. When this right, enshrined \nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is threatened or \ncurtailed, dictatorship is the predictable result. Regrettably, that is \nwhat we see happening in Egypt today.\n  Like others here, I received word this morning that Hossam Bahgat, an \nEgyptian journalist and one of that country's prominent human rights \ndefenders, has been detained and may be charged in military court. He \nis apparently accused of publishing false news related to an article \nabout an allegedly foiled military coup.\n  According to information I have received, an October 13 article by \nMr. Bahgat described the military prosecution of 26 officers and 2 \nMuslim Brotherhood members for allegedly planning to overthrow the \ngovernment. The next day, the same publication printed the article in \nEnglish under the title, ``A coup busted?'' For this, Mr. Bahgat is \nbeing investigated by military prosecutors and could face 1 or more \nyears behind bars.\n  According to Mr. Bahgat's article, which was based on the indictment \nin that case, authorities had summoned or arrested most of the \ndefendants in April. Some of the detained officers alleged that they \nwere tortured during interrogations inside military intelligence \nheadquarters. Eight of the officers and the two Muslim Brotherhood \nleaders who were prosecuted in absentia were sentenced to life in \nprison, Mr. Bahgat reported. The rest were sentenced to between 10 and \n15 years.\n  Lawyers for Mr. Bahgat have reported that military prosecutors are \ninvestigating him for allegedly violating articles 102 and 188 of the \npenal code, both of which are minor, vaguely worded offenses that \nconcern the publication of false news.\n  Article 102 allows the prosecution of anyone who ``intentionally \nbroadcasts false or tendentious news, data, or rumors, or propagates \nsubversive propaganda, if this is liable to disturb the public \nsecurity, spread terror among the people, or harm the public \ninterest.'' It provides for an undefined period of detention and a fine \nof up to 200 Egyptian pounds, US$25.\n  Article 188 allows prosecution of anyone who ``with ill intent \npublishes false news, data, or rumors, or forged or fabricated papers, \nor falsely attributed to others, if this is liable to disturb the \ngeneral peace or provoke panic among the people or harm the public \ninterest.'' It provides for detention of up to 1 year and a fine of up \nto 20,000 Egyptian pounds, US$2,490.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, Mr. Bahgat was not the first \njournalist to report on the alleged military coup. In a statement, Mr. \nBahgat's lawyers stated that he had no criminal intent and that other \nmedia outlets had previously reported the verdict.\n  It is well established that civilians should not be prosecuted in \nmilitary courts, yet that is what is happening to Mr. Bahgat. In \nOctober 2014, President al-Sisi greatly expanded military court \njurisdiction for a period of 2 years, allowing the military prosecution \nof civilians for crimes that occur on ``public'' or ``vital'' property. \nSince then, Egyptian media outlets and human rights groups have \nreported that thousands of civilians have been charged in military \ncourts, many of them for acts related to protesting and the Muslim \nBrotherhood.\n  Egypt's military courts operate under the authority of the Ministry \nof Defense, not civilian judicial authorities. According to human \nrights groups, they typically deny defendants the rights accorded by \ncivilian courts, including to be informed of the charges against them, \nthe right to a lawyer, and to be brought promptly before a judge \nfollowing arrest. This is particularly concerning given the pattern of \nabuse of detainees in Egypt.\n  As a former prosecutor who has served as both chairman and ranking \nmember of our Judiciary Committee, I have spoken many times about the \nimportance of an independent judiciary. Nowhere is this needed more \ntoday than in Egypt, where sham trials, some lasting only a few \nminutes, followed by sentences of death or life in prison, are common.\n  I hope the Egyptian Government will see the wisdom of proceeding no \nfurther in its attempt to silence reputable journalists like Mr. \nBahgat. Sometimes the news is favorable; sometimes it is unfavorable. \nThat is the way life is, and it is not for government officials--\nwhether elected or unelected--to decide what their citizens should \nread.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7859-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7859-S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RALPH BAGNESKI\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and honor Ralph \nBagneski, Milwaukee County's 2016 Veteran of the Year. Mr. Bagneski has \nserved our Nation for 35 years with distinction. As we observe Veterans \nDay, I am proud to pay tribute to him and to his fellow Wisconsin \nveterans who have served our Nation to protect and defend the American \nfreedoms we hold dear.\n  A native of Milwaukee, Mr. Bagneski enlisted in the United States \nMarine Corps after his graduation from Washington High School. He \nserved on Active Duty during the Vietnam war from 1967 through 1971, \nleaving full-time service having achieved the post of rifleman squad \nleader, 96th Rifle Company. From 1973 to 1987, Mr. Bagneski also served \nin the Wisconsin National Guard, attaining the rank of first sergeant. \nIn addition, Mr. Bagneski served for more than 15 years in the United\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nStates Army Reserve, where he achieved the rank of command sergeant \nmajor.\n  During his military service, Mr. Bagneski received numerous \ndecorations, two of which were the Legion of Merit and the Meritorious \nService Medal. Both honors are given to members of the United States \nArmed Forces who distinguished themselves by exceptionally meritorious \nconduct in the performance of outstanding services and achievements. \nNotably, he also received the National Infantry Association's Order of \nSaint Maurice, an award recognizing those who make significant \ncontributions in support of the infantry and who represent the highest \nstandards of integrity, moral character, professional competence, and \ndedication to duty.\n  Beyond his military service, Mr. Bagneski has demonstrated \nextraordinary service to his fellow servicemembers through his \nleadership in Wisconsin Vietnam Veterans Chapter 1, the American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Stand Down. He has served his \ncommunity as a firefighter and EMT, as a Little League baseball coach, \nand as an active leader in Brewery Workers Local 9.\n  Mr. Bagneski's lifetime of service to his country, his State, his \ncommunity, and his fellow servicemembers is an example to us all. I am \nhonored to congratulate him as Milwaukee County's 2016 Veteran of the \nYear and thank him for dedicating his life to the values we pay tribute \nto on Veterans Day--duty, honor, and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7860-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TESS BRADY\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Tess \nBrady, a lifelong resident of Stanford, MT. Montanans pride themselves \nin their care and deep respect for all aspects of our communities, and \nTess Brady's commitment to bettering Stanford is no exception.\n  Tess is the founder of Stanford Beautification, a nonprofit effort \nthat continuously provides service to improve the appearance of Main \nStreet in Stanford. Tess does an amazing job multitasking the various \nongoing projects she directs. While her many loyal and generous helpers \nare critical to these efforts, she is the real fireball behind the \nprojects.\n  One ongoing project Tess devotes herself to is the planting and \nupkeep of flower displays along Main Street and at the Stanford \ncourthouse. She takes a water tank on the back of an ATV every day \nduring the summer and waters the flowers--a loving gesture that takes \nher most of the day.\n  When fall comes around, you can find Tess working and delegating \ntasks for the Scarecrow Festival--a seasonal event that began as a \ncompetition among businesses and townspeople to decorate Main Street. \nIn winter, Tess devotes her time to maintaining Christmas decorations \nthroughout the season, despite Montana's snowy winters.\n  It makes me incredibly proud to see a Montanan so devoted and loyal \nto her town. Tess truly represents the fundamental Montana values of \nhard work and service, and I am grateful for the work she does for the \nStanford community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7860-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7860-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/09/senate-section/article/S7860-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE ON NOVEMBER 5, 2015\n\n  At 12:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.
