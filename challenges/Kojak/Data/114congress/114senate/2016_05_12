Mr. President, I rise today to welcome a constituent, the \nsenior pastor of Lee Park Church in Monroe, NC, Chris Justice, to the \nSenate.\n  Chris's story is an inspiring one. In 2005, Chris was a well-known \nbroadcaster on dual television stations in Charlotte, NC. In November \nof that year, Chris was called by the Lee Park Church, a congregation \nof 50 faithful, at which time he committed to be their pastor and to \nsplit his time between the church and being a broadcaster.\n  Chris kept that pace up for the next 3 years as he grew a church. He \nunderstood that God's calling was to the church and to service, not \nnecessarily to broadcasting.\n  Let me just say that Pastor Chris has grown that church to a lively \ncongregation that is involved in their community. His senior leadership \nthere has provided the nurturing that is needed for a community to find \ntheir calling in life as part of that church. From the beginning of his \ncareer as a news anchor, Chris always wanted to give back and to be \npart of the community. He is surely doing that today.\n  Today, Pastor Chris continues to do so, and he has followed the \nsimple strategy that remains the mission of the church--preach the word \nand love people. I think that sums up Pastor Chris--preach the word and \nlove the people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague, \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina. I welcome Pastor Chris, his \nlovely wife, and friends of the Steward family who came to visit this \ngreat Capitol and to grace us with his presence.\n  I will give you a different story. I have been to Lee Park. I was \nthere for an annual event, and I was invited there to be a pimento \ncheese judge. Let me warn you never to volunteer to taste 29 different \nvarieties of pimento cheese.\n  Pastor Chris has said that they have refined the event now, but what \nstruck me most about that event is how much the people who were at that \nevent love Pastor Chris and love the Justice family.\n  You have done a great job in Monroe. We thank you for your service to \nthe great citizens of the State. We thank you for your service to this \ngreat body today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2715-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after much deliberation from both sides \nof the aisle, today we will complete our work on the Energy and Water \nappropriations bill. We know this bill is the result of a great deal of \neffort, research, and collaboration across the aisle. It passed out of \nthe committee unanimously. It was subject to nearly two dozen \namendments from both parties on the floor. As Senator Alexander pointed \nout yesterday, we have clearly had an open process from the start that \nbenefited both sides.\n  The energy security and water infrastructure bill is important for \nour country. We know it will support commerce, public safety, waterway \ninfrastructure, energy innovation, and our nuclear deterrence posture.\n  We know it is important for the way forward on appropriations as \nwell. Remember, following regular order--especially on the \nappropriations process--allows both Democratic and Republican Members \nto better represent their\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\nconstituents' views. It provides for more open debate and deliberation. \nIt offers a path to reaching a kind of product both sides can support. \nEmpowering Members to make more judicious decisions about how taxpayer \ndollars are spent is something we should all want. So we know the \nappropriations process is important.\n  I urge my colleagues to work together to keep moving these \nappropriations bills as both sides have expressed interest in doing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2716-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Republican Presidential nominee--\nit is hard for me to say these words--Donald Trump, comes to Capitol \nHill. He secured the party's nomination. He did that last week. Donald \nTrump will meet privately today with Speaker Ryan and Republican Leader \nMcConnell. It is just the latest sign that Republican leaders in both \nHouses are marching lockstep with Donald Trump.\n  Senator McConnell has fully embraced Donald Trump. He said last week \nwhen Trump secured the nomination: ``I have committed to supporting the \nnominee chosen by Republican voters.''\n  While speaking with reporters earlier this week, the Republican \nleader sounded enthusiastic about Trump's chances in the general \nelection. I guess he should be giddy about a Trump Presidency. Donald \nTrump is everything the Republican leader and his party could ever want \nin a nomination.\n  Trump's policy decisions are identical to the Republican Party \nplatform. Today, when they meet in an hour or two, Senator McConnell \ncan discuss that consensus with Trump.\n  Let's talk about the Supreme Court. Donald Trump and the Senator from \nKentucky can talk about their obstruction--for the first time in the \nhistory of the country--to a Presidential Supreme Court nomination. It \nhas never happened before. We have had some stalling and a couple of \nfilibusters, but this is one where people didn't want to meet with him. \nA few of them have broken from that. They certainly don't want to have \na hearing, and they don't want to vote.\n  It was Trump who said Republicans should ``delay, delay, delay'' \nfilling the Supreme Court vacancy. Following Trump's lead, the \nRepublican leader has personally overseen the blockade of Judge \nGarland's nomination, forcing Senators to fall in line.\n  Let's talk about Trump and women. When they get together they can \ntalk about their policy about being anti-woman. Since Senator McConnell \nhas so enthusiastically embraced Trump, we can only assume he agrees \nwith Trump's view that women are dogs and pigs. We can only assume that \nthe Republican leader is not repulsed by Donald Trump's vulgar behavior \ntowards women. Look at the New York Times story yesterday with his \ncavorting with Howard Stern and how they talked about women.\n  After all, the Republican Party has spent years blocking every \nsubstantive bill for American women--equal pay for equal work. This \nRepublican Senate has undermined women's health at every turn, trying \nto turn Planned Parenthood into a punching bag--even though millions \nand millions of American women have been helped by Planned Parenthood.\n  They will have an opportunity this morning to talk about the anti-\nLatino vote. They can discuss their anti-immigrant policies and their \nagenda. Since the Republican leader is all in for Donald Trump, we can \nonly assume that he approves of Trump's calling immigrants rapists and \nmurderers, and the DREAMers as being mules for drug dealing.\n  I assume they can have a long discussion about the wall--how high it \nshould be, how they are going to get the Mexicans to pay for the wall--\neven though most people think the idea is insane.\n  Let's not forget Republicans have demagogued Latinos and immigrants \nfor decades. They are doing it today.\n  The Republican leader voted against comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Under Senator McConnell's leadership, Senate Republicans almost came \nwithin hours of shutting down the Department of Homeland Security \nbecause of President Obama's executive actions on immigration.\n  They can talk about their outlook on families. Donald Trump and the \nRepublican leader can mention how little they have done for American \nfamilies. Except now, in today's news, they are going to cut Medicaid \nand Medicare. I guess that is because he is getting lined up for the \nmeeting with Paul Ryan, because that is his No. 1 issue.\n  Since the Republican leader has firmly established himself in Donald \nTrump's corner, one can only assume he is OK with Trump's shady \nbusiness practices. He doesn't mind that Donald Trump rips off hard-\nworking Americans, filed bankruptcy many, many times, and has a \nuniversity that is corrupt. And the trial will go forward during the \nelection.\n  Sadly, a disregard for the middle class is an all-too-familiar \nposition for today's Republicans. The Republican Party refuses to \naddress the minimum wage, college affordability, or any other \nlegislation that helps families.\n  Here is a doozy. They can spend a lot of time talking about climate \nchange. Trump and the Republican leader can, in this private \nconversation, talk about denial of climate change. But 97 percent of \nall scientists worldwide believe it is here. It is upon us. Ask the \nsenior Senator from Florida. He will tell you it is here. Look at what \nis happening in Miami. You can talk to the Senators from Virginia, and \nthey will tell you what is happening in military bases on the coast of \nVirginia.\n  Donald Trump's highest ranking supporter in Congress, Senator \nMcConnell, assumingly agrees with Trump that climate change is a hoax--\nhere is what Trump said--perpetrated by Chinese manufacturers. That \nposition fits with a Republican Party that refuses to acknowledge the \nenvironmental and national security threats posed by climate change. If \nelected, Trump and Senator McConnell would lead the nation backward on \na climate change denial agenda that would put polluters first and make \nthe United States the laughingstock of the world.\n  More than 170 countries have agreed to address climate change because \nof U.S. leadership, but Trump and McConnell have stated publicly that \nthey will walk away from this.\n  Let's talk about what Republicans like to talk about--what is \nhappening with the economy--keeping in mind that Bill Clinton balanced \nthe budget. Keep in mind that when George Bush came to the Presidency, \nthere was a $7 trillion surplus over 10 years. With two wars unpaid for \ncosting trillions of dollars and with tax cuts not being paid for, that \nsurplus has long since gone.\n  So they can talk about that. They can talk about how Trump has said \nthat he thinks America should default on its debt. Just get the people \nwe owe money to take less money. That is what he said. He doesn't want \nto pay our national debt. It seems that, on that issue, there is little \ndistance between him and the Republican leader.\n  Senator McConnell has presided over a Republican caucus that has \ntaken America to the brink of default on a number of occasions, not the \nleast of which is shutting down the government--this great government--\nshutting it down for 17 days--closed, out of business.\n  So Donald Trump and the Republican leadership should have a long, \nlong conversation. They have a lot to talk about. At some point in the \nconversation, Donald Trump should thank the senior Senator from \nKentucky. Trump owes his candidacy to the Republican leader and the \npolicies he has led. It was the obstructionist, anti-woman, anti-\nLatino, anti-Muslim, anti-middle-class, anti-environment, anti-Obama, \nanti-everything Republican Party during the last 8 years that has made \nDonald Trump a reality.\n\n  I note that no one is on the floor. Will the Chair announce what the \nSenate is going to do this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2716-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2716-S2717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on March 10, this body, the U.S. Senate, \npassed legislation to address what is a growing problem in all of our \ncommunities, and that is the heroin and prescription drug epidemic.\n  On March 10, this body voted for a comprehensive bill called CARA, \nthe Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. It deals with prevention, \ntreatment, and recovery, helping our law enforcement, getting \nprescription drugs off the shelves of our bathrooms so they are not \nbeing used to get people into this addiction, and helping to stop the \noverprescribing with a drug monitoring program. This was a \ncomprehensive approach intended to help our communities deal with this \ngrowing problem. The No. 1 cause of death now in my home State of Ohio \nis not car accidents anymore, it is overdoses. It is overdoses from \nprescription drugs and heroin.\n  Since March 10, I have come to the floor four times--this is now the \nfifth time--every week we have been in session since then, to urge the \nHouse to act quickly on CARA, because with a 94-to-1 vote, with that \nkind of consensus built around this place, which is highly unusual, it \nshows that this is a problem in all of our communities and all of our \nStates. We spent 3 years putting together the legislation. We worked \nwith experts from all around the country. We sought out best practices. \nThis is not just a matter of throwing more money at a problem, this is \na matter of taking the resources in Washington, spending them more \nwisely and targeting them toward what we know works--toward evidence-\nbased programs, prevention, treatment, and recovery that has actually \nshown promise to be able to begin to turn the tide on this horrible \nepidemic.\n  The House has begun to act, and I am encouraged by that. Obviously, I \nwish they had taken up CARA right away and sent it to the President. I \nthink it would have been already helping in our communities in \nsignificant ways.\n  During the time between when the Senate acted, March 10 to now, we \nhave lost 7,400 Americans to drug overdoses. We lose a fellow citizen \nevery 12 minutes on average, but the House is moving, and yesterday the \nHouse passed, legislation in the form of over a dozen different bills, \nsmaller bills that will help with regard to this problem that I think \nare steps in the right direction.\n  Today they are planning to take up a more comprehensive bill, the \nCARA legislation, that has also been reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee--as it was in this body--and perhaps a couple other bills as \nwell. I am told that vote is likely to occur today, and that is great. \nI am concerned the legislation that passed in the House still leaves \nsome gaps, and those gaps are in some significant areas. I am hopeful \nsome amendments will be adopted today to help fill some of those gaps \nso we can indeed have a comprehensive approach to this issue.\n  Sadly, this issue is not getting better; it is getting worse. The \nU.S. Drug Enforcement Administration just last week conducted their \nNational Drug Prescription Take-Back Day, where you take drugs off the \nshelf and put them into a disposal unit to get rid of them so that your \nkid or grandkid or somebody visiting your home doesn't get these \nprescription drugs and misuse them. They had a record number of drugs \nturned in, 893,000 pounds of unwanted medicine; that is, 447 tons of \nprescription drugs that were not needed. I am grateful for those who \nparticipated in the take-back program. This is good news, to get these \ndrugs off the shelves and be sure they are not being misused, but \nunfortunately that is just the tip of the iceberg, and it shows the \nseverity of this problem.\n  We have continued to see communities throughout my State and \nthroughout the country being torn apart by this issue and families who \nare being devastated. Last week, a man pled guilty to involuntary \nmanslaughter in Columbus, OH, because his infant son had ingested \nfentanyl-laced heroin and died. Last week, we also saw the arrest of \nthree people who drove to Steubenville, OH, to buy heroin, and then \nwhile driving they used it in the car with a 4-year-old with them. This \nall happened in the last week. Last week, a 23-year-old pregnant woman \nand her unborn child were found dead of an apparent overdose in New \nCarlisle, OH. Yesterday, an Akron man pled guilty to selling heroin to \nhis uncle who subsequently died of an overdose. In Cleveland, we have \nlost 148 people to drug overdoses in just the first quarter of this \nyear. That is double--double--last year's rate in Cleveland, OH--one \ntown in one State.\n  By the way, the plurality of these deaths is that a majority were \nfrom fentanyl--fentanyl often laced with heroin. Fentanyl is a \nsynthetic heroin that is about 50 times more dangerous. It is a growing \nproblem in my State of Ohio.\n  Unfortunately, these headlines are just the tip of the iceberg. We \nsee this death toll rising, and it is tragic, but we also need to focus \non the wounded, not just those who overdose but those who, because they \nhave this addiction, have lost their job, cannot get their lives back \ntogether, are separated from their families. As one recovering addict \ntold me: The drug was everything. I abandoned my kids, my wife.\n  These are also people who are ending up in our jail system. \nProsecutors back home tell me the majority of the crime--one county \nprosecutor told me a couple of weeks ago, 80 percent is being committed \nbecause of this issue--so theft, stealing in order to pay for a habit, \nand ending up in the prison system. All of us are paying for that of \ncourse.\n  Everywhere I go in Ohio, people tell me about how this epidemic is \naffecting them. I had a townhall meeting the week before last, a tele-\ntownhall with 25,000 people on a phone call. We do these once a month. \nA gentleman called in and he wanted to talk about the CARA legislation. \nHe seemed to know a lot about it. He focused on the treatment part of \nit. His voice had a quiver.\n  So I asked him: Would you mind sharing? You are on the line with a \nlot of people, but would you mind sharing why you are so interested in \nthis issue? Again, he was focused a lot on the treatment side, and \nthere was silence on the line. I knew what he was going to say.\n  When he came to the point where he could speak, he said: I lost my \ndaughter. Then he proceeded to tell the story. It was of a child who \nhad started with prescription drugs, ended up with heroin, had \ncommitted some crimes--probably theft--ended up in and out of prison. \nShe had finally come to the point where she was willing to face up to \nher addiction. She was ready to go into treatment to start long-term \nrecovery. She had committed this to her parents. He said they took her \nto the treatment center. There was a 14-day wait. They pleaded: Can she \nget in someplace else? No; no room at the inn\n\n[[Page S2718]]\n\nand a 14-day wait. During those 14 days is of course when she overdosed \non heroin.\n  His point was very simple: You guys need to do more to help provide \naccess to treatment and the right kind of treatment. That is what this \nlegislation does.\n  Last Tuesday, I spoke at an opiate conference, the Ohio Association \nof County Behavioral Health Authority's annual meeting, with record \nattendance this year of over 1,000 people. I heard from doctors, \nnurses, counselors, social workers, attorneys, law enforcement, all \nsaying the same thing to me, which is: Rob, this problem is not getting \nbetter. It is getting worse.\n  Washington does have a role to play, to be a better partner with \nState and local government and with the nonprofits that are in the \ntrenches dealing with this issue every day. The Kaiser Family \nFoundation last week released a survey that showed that 44 percent of \nthe public knew someone who struggled with addiction to opioids. Of \nthose 44 percent, one in five said it was a family member; one in five \nsaid it was a close friend; one in five said it was an acquaintance; \ntwo-thirds overall said they want the State government and the Federal \nGovernment to do more about this addiction epidemic. Of course they do. \nPeople are desperate to figure out how to get at this issue.\n  Again, our approach is evidence-based. It is based on the testimony \nof the experts around the country. It is based on best practices, what \nis working what is not working. Is Washington going to solve this \nproblem? No, but we are part of the solution. It is going to be solved \nin our communities and in our families. We can turn this tide. We have \nin the past. We can do it again. The question is whether we are serious \nabout it and whether we can move this legislation through the House, \nthrough the Senate, get it to the President, and get it working in our \ncommunities.\n  In countless parts of Ohio, at the State and local level, people are \ntaking action. I am encouraged by that and I applaud them for it. In my \nhometown of Cincinnati, the police force at the University of \nCincinnati is now carrying Narcan and getting training to know how to \nuse it. By the way, that is in this legislation to provide training to \nensure people aren't just getting the naloxone, that they know how to \nuse it. This is a miracle drug called Narcan--naloxone--so that when \nsomeone has overdosed, they will be able to bring them back.\n  I have been in drug treatment centers all over my State, and I have \nheard the testimony, including a man who told me: I died. I faced my \nown death. I saw my father in Heaven. I was gone. Narcan brought me \nback to life. That is why I am in this treatment center, because that \nis how I hit rock bottom.\n  So it is important, but the training needs to include, as you are \ngiving people Narcan to use for their loved ones, giving it to the \npolice officer to use when they are responding or a firefighter--I \nwould tell you that if you go to most of our firehouses around the \ncountry, you will find there are more runs for heroin and prescription \ndrug overdoses than there are for fires. That is true in my State, and \nit is probably true in yours. But if you are providing Narcan to \nsomebody, you need to give them the ability to tell these people: Here \nis the treatment center. It is not enough just to save a life from a \ntragic occurrence like an overdose; we also have to figure out how not \nto be--as some firefighters and police officers told me--saving that \nlife again and again but instead getting these people into the right \ntreatment and recovery programs so they cannot just have their lives \nsaved but begin to lead full and productive lives.\n\n  I am very encouraged by something that happened yesterday. Stephen \nStack, the president of the American Medical Association, issued a \npublic letter to physicians. I think this is a major step forward. I \ndon't know Stephen Stack, but I read his letter very carefully because \nI think he is putting his finger on something that the medical \nprofession has been slow to realize. His letter said this:\n\n       [F]ar too often, [opiate addiction] has started from a \n     prescription pad. . . . I call on all physicians to . . . \n     avoid initiating opioids for new patients with chronic non-\n     cancer pain . . . limit the amount of opioids prescribed for \n     post-operative care . . . register and use your state \n     prescription drug monitoring program . . . [and] reduce \n     stigma to enable effective and compassionate care.\n\n  That is a step in the right direction. I hope every physician in the \ncountry gets a copy of this letter.\n  We have incredibly compassionate, caring physicians out there, but we \nneed to face the facts. There has been overprescribing, and that is \npart of the issue. Four of the five people in my State of Ohio who will \ndie from heroin overdoses over this next month will have started with \nprescription drugs. There is a link here. We need to face it, and the \nmedical profession needs to face it. In the Senate, we have taken \naction. A 94-to-1 vote is not the typical way things happen around \nhere, as you know. That is highly unusual. That shows the seriousness \nof this issue.\n  One of the things I am concerned about in the alternative to CARA \nthat is being voted on in the House today is that it omits some of the \nkey pillars, including a drug take-back program, which I think is \nimportant, and prescription drug monitoring programs.\n  What we have in our legislation is very simple. It gives incentive \ngrants to States to set up prescription drug monitoring programs. Most \nStates have them already, but to have them so they work with other \nStates, we need interoperability between the States.\n  My own State of Ohio borders many other States, and what they tell me \nis this: We can have this prescription drug monitoring program for \nOhio, but if someone goes to Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nMichigan, or Indiana, we don't know. And if this is in our legislation, \nthat would help. We hope that is added to the House bill.\n  Prevention, recovery support services--I hope those are being adopted \nin the House as amendments. If they are not, we are going to work hard \nto get those included in conference. We are not going to send a bill to \nthe President that is not comprehensive.\n  With regard to prevention, there are some provisions that were \nomitted from the House alternative, including a national awareness \nprogram to let people know what is going on with prescription drugs. \nThat connection we talked about a moment ago is incredibly important. \nIt will save lives. It will bring people's lives back on track. It will \navoid the situation where somebody goes to get his or her wisdom teeth \npulled, they are given narcotic pain pills, they end up getting \naddicted and then move to heroin as a cheaper alternative, and sadly, \nin some cases--including a father who testified before a congressional \ncommittee in Ohio a week ago Friday--die of an overdose. That is what \nis happening.\n  Prevention is important. The prevention grants we have are important. \nThey are the most effective way to fight back against this epidemic, in \nmany respects. If we can keep people from getting into the funnel of \naddiction in the first place, think of the lives that can be saved, the \nfamilies that can be kept together rather than torn apart, the \ncommunities that will not be devastated by this spike in crime.\n  Think of the impact on our economy and people not going to work. They \nsay there is a $700 billion economic impact based on addiction.\n  It is the faces of addiction we care about the most. Think about \nMarin Riggs from Pickerington, OH. She was a high school student. She \nwas about to graduate. She was very smart. She had good grades. She was \na star athlete. She was popular, full of life. It seemed like she had \nit all. She made a mistake; she tried heroin with her boyfriend. She \nbecame addicted. Something changed physiologically in her brain to give \nher this disease. It is a disease. Her parents started missing money \nfrom their wallets. Charges started showing up on her dad's credit \ncard. She tried to quit. She went into rehab. She wrote in her journal \nthat she was heroin's ``worst enemy.'' She was going to beat this \nthing. But she relapsed. The grip of this addiction is horrible. Her \nbrother found her dead of a heroin overdose 2 weeks after her 20th \nbirthday.\n  This can happen to any family anywhere. It knows no ZIP Code. It is \nnot an inner-city problem. It is not a suburban problem. It is not a \nrural problem. It is everywhere. Addiction doesn't ask what your \npolitical party is, either. That is why we kept this nonpartisan. It is \nnot just bipartisan.\n\n[[Page S2719]]\n\nThat is why I hope we can move this legislation quickly to the \nPresident and get him to sign it into law, because it is needed right \nnow, and prevention needs to be part of it.\n  Marin's mom, whose name is Heidi, is letting her voice be heard \nthroughout Ohio. She is educating kids and parents about the dangers of \nexperimenting with drugs. I commend her for that. I am so grateful for \nher and the other moms and dads around Ohio who are doing that. They \nare amazing.\n  Tonda DaRe came to testify before the Judiciary Committee. Her \ndaughter's name was Holly. Holly died when she was in her early \ntwenties. She started Holly's Song. She is talking to people, working \nwith people, families, letting them know what the dangers are but also, \nif they have a son or child who is addicted, letting them know how to \nget them into treatment and recovery so that other lives will not be \nlost.\n  I have heard stories of these teenagers whose wisdom teeth are being \ntaken out and they end up getting addicted to Percocet and Vicodin. \nAngie Trend of Lake County is one of them. She told me her son was 16 \nwhen he had his wisdom teeth taken out. He is one of the lucky ones; he \nis now in recovery. He is 25 years old. But the pain and agony that \nfamily went through when he was age 16 to 25 could have been avoided.\n  When I think of these stories, I cannot leave out prevention. It has \nto be part of it.\n  I started my own anti-drug coalition in my home State, in my home \ncity, about 20 years ago. It continues to be effective today. It is all \nabout prevention, getting the entire community engaged and involved. \nThat is what needs to happen on a national basis, and it needs to \nhappen now in order for us to save lives.\n  The approach we took in writing this legislation, the Comprehensive \nAddiction Recovery Act, was unusual around here. We spent 3 years \npulling together experts and getting best practices but also accepting \nideas from anywhere where there was a good idea. We didn't care whose \nidea it was; all we cared about was whether it worked.\n  I know that these statistics about heroin addiction and overdoses are \nheartbreaking. They can be pretty discouraging. But I also know there \nis hope. I have run into people from our State who have struggled with \naddiction and who have found their way to treatment and effective \nrecovery--usually it is long-term recovery--with support from family \nand friends and others who have been through addiction. Now they are \nback on their feet, and they are not just productive, working members \nof our communities, but they are helping others.\n  I heard the story of Courtney Golden. She was addicted to oxycodone. \nShe received treatment and has been clean for 7 years. She is now the \ndirector of an outpatient counseling center. I heard the story of Terri \nSkaggs of the Sojourner House in Portsmouth, OH. She was addicted for \n17 years, but after 17 years, she didn't give up. She has now been \nclean for 2 years. They beat this, and they are helping other people. I \nsee this at every treatment center I go to.\n  There is hope. We can turn the tide, but it does require this \ninstitution to pull its act together and get a good bill out of \nconference that is comprehensive, that is evidence-based, that is going \nto make a real difference throughout our communities, and get that bill \nto the President for his signature.\n  We have lost more than 7,400 Americans since the Senate passed this \nlegislation on March 10. Every 12 minutes, we lose another American, \nanother one of our fellow citizens. Partial solutions will not suffice. \nWe need a comprehensive approach. I will insist on it, as will others.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time today. I am encouraged by \nwhat the House is doing on the floor. I hope the next time I come to \nthe floor, I will not be talking about how the House must act but, \nrather, congratulating the House for acting and congratulating the \nPresident for signing a legislative initiative that will make a \ndifference in my home State and in our communities all around this \ncountry.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks my colleague from \nOhio made about this opioid issue and the impact it is having on our \ncitizens and particularly on our young people. I support his \nsignificant contributions and efforts in terms of dealing with this \nproblem. It is affecting my State, his State, and all of our States.\n  We are passing legislation to deal with it, but it is going to take \nmore than legislation; it is going to take an all-out effort by \neverybody. To watch our kids, our children, our young people, and \nAmericans become addicted and victims of this scourge that is taking \nplace is disheartening, to say the least. We need to do all we can to \naddress that. Our State is trying to do that and making some \nsignificant steps forward. We all have a long way to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2719-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2719-S2721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WASTEFUL SPENDING\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, that is not why I am here today. I come \ndown every week, as my colleagues know, to talk about the waste of the \nweek. While I am dealing with documented evidence of the waste of \ntaxpayers' money through waste, fraud, and abuse and while we have \ntotaled up well over $150 billion of documented waste, it is only a \npebble in the sea, a grain of sand compared to what we are doing by \nallowing deficit spending to plunge us ever more into debt.\n  Without a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, this body \nhas not had the discipline to match our spending with the revenues that \ncome in or the political will to go to the American people and say: If \nyou want this much government, this is how much it is going to cost. \nInstead, we say: We will give you what you want, and we will borrow the \nmoney to cover it because we don't have the tax revenue. And we don't \nhave the will to say: We have to raise your taxes if this is what you \nwant. It has put us in a dire situation from a financial standpoint. It \nis not talked about as much as it should be. But when I returned to the \nSenate, having been elected in 2010 to serve another term, our debt \nlevel was bad enough at that point at $10.7 trillion. But under this \nadministration, in less than 8 years, it has almost doubled. It is now \n$19.2 trillion, I think is the latest, and the clock is ticking. Tune \nin to my Web site and you will see the debt clock. It is stunning to \nsit there and look at how fast those digits are turning of money that \nis being borrowed, which we have to pay interest on and which is \nslowing down our economy and crippling our future generations.\n  I see the young pages sitting here on the steps. Many of them have \nlistened to my ``Waste of the Week'' speeches. I want to tell you that \nmy generation--I am not pointing fingers at one party or another--has \nfailed to achieve some kind of fiscal discipline that will put you in a \nposition where you can inherit from my generation something that my \nparents and our parents and our generation gave to us, and that is a \nprosperous, growing, dynamic economy that gave us the opportunity to \nget an education, gave us the opportunity to be engaged meaningfully in \nthe workforce, become homeowners, raise a family, save for our kids' \nfuture.\n\n  I stand here as a father with 3 children and 10 grandchildren. It is \nsickening to me to think about the challenges they are going to have \nbecause my generation didn't step up to the responsibility of running a \nfiscally sound economy through the decisions we make in the U.S. \nSenate, U.S. Congress, and the White House. Yes, I have blamed this \nPresident for not treating this in a serious enough manner. We made \nevery type of effort you could think of in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and \nwe finally threw up our hands and gave up because of the six or seven \nthings that were presented to the President over that period of time, \nhe has rejected every one of them. I was part of one of those \nnegotiations and was very involved with that negotiation. I directly \ndealt with the President and his top people. We gave him a lot of what \nhe said he wanted, and in the end he turned it down.\n  I wish I had the clock ticking behind me. We are getting ever deeper \ninto debt, and that will have a significant impact on the country.\n  I was speaking on the floor yesterday. The growth--if you can call it \nthat--in the latest quarter is 0.5 percent. That is about as anemic as \nit\n\n[[Page S2720]]\n\ngets, teetering on falling into a recession. That is what the statistic \nshows for growth during the first quarter of 2016. The number comes \nfrom the Department of Labor. It shows that there was a very low amount \nof new jobs. Those new jobs basically replaced those who were retiring. \nIt is far below what we need to provide meaningful jobs for people in \nthis country.\n  After having failed over a period of years to put together a \ncredible, long-term plan to deal with our debt crisis, balance our \nbudget, and stop adding more to our debt, I have come down to show my \ncolleagues documented evidence of the waste, fraud, and abuse that \nnonpartisan agencies have inspected and told us about. For over 40 \nweeks, I have been in this cycle of coming to the Senate floor to \nidentify yet a new waste, fraud, or abuse, and the total is \nsignificantly trending toward $200 billion worth of waste. It is no \nwonder that Americans at home are furious with the dysfunction that is \ntaking place in Washington and demanding change. We see this on both \nsides of the aisle. The people have said: We have had it. It is enough. \nWe are done with you guys and gals. We need to shake this place up. A \nrevolution is taking place across the country. The country is finally \ngrasping onto the fact that we have simply not been functional. The one \nway we can be functional, or at least do something, is to have the \ngovernment's own accountability office, which looks into the programs \nthat are part of what we have enabled and provides the needed spending \nfor certain areas--if they see there is fraud, waste, and abuse, can't \nwe at least do something about that? That is the reason I am here \ntoday.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the U.S. armed services. I am a \nveteran, and I served on the Armed Services Committee during my \nprevious tenure in the Senate. I have a deep regard and respect for the \nneed for adequate spending to provide for our common defense. That is \nthe first obligation in the Constitution that we swear to when we are \nsworn into the U.S. Senate. There is no agency that is exempt or \ngetting a pass if they are engaged in bad decisions that spend and \nwaste money, especially if they don't correct those things that are \npointed out by their own inspectors general or government agencies that \nlook into all of this.\n  Today I am talking about the Department of Defense. They are not \nimmune from issues of waste, fraud, and abuse, and we need to document \nthose as well. One of the reasons we need to document those is they \nneed every penny they have because their portion of the budget is \ncontinuing to shrink due to our dire fiscal situation. At the very \nleast, we have to make sure they are not wasting money because it is \nneeded to protect and provide security for Americans. This waste of the \nweek involves expenditure in Afghanistan, where we have troops and \ncommitments over there. They had a request for cargo planes. We need \nplanes to transfer cargo between the bases and different parts of \nAfghanistan. So the decision was made to provide 20 cargo planes to \nfulfill that mission. The Department of Defense went to the country of \nItaly. Maybe they went to Italy because they are part of the coalition \nand felt obligated to buy some equipment from them, and so they bought \n20 Italian cargo planes. The purpose of the purchase was to support the \nAfghan Air Force, and as I said to transport troops and equipment \naround the country.\n  At the time the Afghans had old, out-of-date, Soviet-era Russian \nplanes and the Department of Defense wanted to replace them, so again \nthey went to Italy to purchase these planes. The purchase price for 20 \nof these cargo planes was $486 million. That is a lot of money, but I \nam not here to say they should have paid less or should have paid more. \nThat is what the price was and that is what they negotiated. This was \ndocumented by two inspectors general who looked at this program and \nsaid: Wait a minute. We have a problem here, guys. The first problem \nwas they didn't buy 20 cargo planes, they only bought 16 planes. The \nprice was $486 million for 20 planes, and somehow only 16 arrived. I am \nnot sure what happened to the other four planes, so there were problems \nfrom the beginning.\n\n  It became abundantly clear early on that these planes were not made \nto fly in the type of conditions that exist in Afghanistan. Afghanistan \nhas a lot of desert, sand, wind, and these planes apparently have all \nkinds of problems flying in that kind of atmosphere. You would have \nthought that since we were there, we would know this because our own \nplanes fly in that atmosphere. I think somebody basically didn't do \ntheir homework and say: Before we pay out $486 million, maybe we ought \nto make sure the planes we are buying to replace the old Soviet planes, \nwhich we know don't work, can fly in the atmosphere here. Since we have \nhad problems with some of our own planes, we need to make sure these \nplanes are capable of holding up under these type of conditions.\n  As it turned out, they flew the planes for only 9 months, and in \nthose 9 months they accumulated 235 hours of flight time, and one of \nthe reasons for that is because they were constantly in the maintenance \nshop having repairs made because of the conditions they were flying in. \nThe planes were purchased on the basis that they could get 4,500 hours \nout of each plane and that would carry a lot of cargo. I can understand \nwhy they wanted them, but because the problems they had were so \nextensive, it turned out they needed a lot of spare parts. When they \nlooked in terms of what it would cost to buy new spare parts for these \nplanes, the total came up to another $200 million. So on top of the \n$486 million, another $200 million would have to be added to that. \nSince they didn't have the money to do that, they said: Let's take 6 of \nthe remaining 16 planes off the airfield and tear them down for spare \nparts. So now we are down to 10 planes. We started with 20, somehow \nthey only got 16, and now they decommissioned 6 planes and used them \nfor spare parts for the other planes so they wouldn't have to spend the \n$200 million. Now we are down to 10 planes at a cost of $486 million, \nbut even after that they continued to have problems and so they decided \nto scrap the whole thing.\n  You would have thought somebody somewhere with different conditions \nwould want to buy those planes. We are now down to 10 planes. Maybe \nthey could have taken the spare parts off those planes and maybe \nsalvage a few more, but, no, the decision was made to scrap those \nplanes and decommission them. So they decided the next step was that \nsince we can't use them, let's just tear them apart. This is a nice \npicture of what happened to the planes.\n  Here we have a nice pile of scrap. They said we have to salvage \nsomething so they said: Let's sell the scrap. We spent $486 million for \nplanes that were sold for scrap. We sold the scrap for 6 cents a pound \nand we retrieved $32,000. We spent $486 million, decommissioned 6 \nplanes so we could get spare parts, which meant we only had 10 planes, \nand since that didn't work, they just took a bulldozer to that, \nscrapped it, and now this machine is picking up the scrap and probably \nputting it in the container and selling it for 6 cents a pound.\n  I come down here every week, and these stories are just mind-\nboggling. The taxpayer hears about these stories and some might say: In \nthis atmosphere, maybe we shouldn't be exposing all of this. No, we are \nexposing it so we can stop this and have an efficient and effectively \nrun government doing the essential things the Federal Government needs \nto do and not getting itself into this constant week after week after \nweek--look, there have been books written by Senators. My former \ncolleague Tom Coburn wrote a book about waste, which basically \ndocumented hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. \nHe stepped down from office 2 years ago, and we miss him. I am just \ntrying to carry on his legacy, probably in a less effective way than he \ndid, by exposing what is happening with Americans' tax dollars.\n  Every day people haul themselves out of bed, start their coffee, get \nin the car, go to work, come home, try to save money, look at their \npaycheck, and when they see the amount of money that is being deducted \nfor taxes, they say: Ok. Well, maybe that is what we need to do to \nprotect our country and provide for programs. And then when they learn \nabout stuff like this, they say: What am I going to work for, just to \nturn this money over to Washington so they can spend it and make \ndecisions like this.\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\n  This is one of 40-some presentations I have given on the Senate \nfloor, and I will keep doing this as long as I stay in the Senate \nbecause our people need to know and put pressure on their \nrepresentatives. They need to think about this so the next person they \nelect to walk into the White House will hopefully have the courage to \naddress our fiscal problems in a way that is not going to put our next \ngeneration in such dire situations.\n  With that, I add to our ever-growing list of waste, fraud, and abuse \nanother $486 million for a total of $162,764,055,817. Think how that \nmoney could be used for essential items like Zika, Ebola, research at \nthe National Institutes of Health, education, paving roads, doing \ninfrastructure repairs--any number of things that need to be done, \nwhich is how that money could be better used than selling used airplane \nscrap for 6 cents a pound. Think about the money that could be returned \nto the taxpayers that they wouldn't have to pay in taxes if we could \nsimply run a much more efficient, effective government.\n\n  Spending is a huge issue. It needs to be addressed in this election. \nThe American people need to be aware of where we stand. Where we stand \ntoday is substantially worse than when I arrived to start my second \nterm in the Senate 5\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I want to talk about the Obama \nadministration's nuclear agreement with Iran and the many ways the \nagreement has failed to rein in Iranian hostile behavior over the \ncourse of the last year.\n  Over the last week, I thought it was interesting that there was great \nreluctance on the part of people who voted in an enabling way to allow \nthe Iranian agreement to occur to take a stand on the position that Mr. \nCotton brought to the Senate floor, where we would not now give Iran \nmillions of dollars to purchase heavy water that they would use in \ntheir nuclear activities and obviously continue to produce.\n  In addition to that, I saw on Monday of this week that Iran tested a \nvariant missile with a range of over 2,000 kilometers capable of \nstriking Israel. Over and over again, we see Iran participating in \nhostile behavior and, somehow, none of that behavior violates either \nthe spirit or the `letter of the agreement that was discussed as such \nan important breakthrough with what was going to happen in Iran.\n  For those of us who predicted that Iran's behavior would not change \nand that behavior in the neighborhood would change in fear of what \nwould happen because of Iran--I think those predictions are becoming \nmore and more obviously true.\n  On April 2, 2015, a framework agreement was reached on that program. \nHere we are a year later. This agreement seems not to have accomplished \nany of the things that we would want to accomplish with the country of \nIran.\n  According to President Obama: ``Iran so far has followed the letter \nof the agreement, but the spirit of the agreement involves Iran also \nsending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not \ngoing to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare \nbusiness off.''\n  That is an absolute quote from the President.\n  Now, why we are concerned about scaring business off from Iran, I \ndon't know, because another quote from the administration over and over \nagain is that Iran is the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. I think if \nwe were talking more about that activity of Iran and less about what \nthey need to encourage business activities, we would be doing what we \nshould be doing.\n  Jennifer Rubin wrote in the Washington Post that ``his comments are \ncurious both because the `letter of the agreement' seems to be forever \nchanging to incorporate Iran's demands and because despite Iran's \nactions, the president continues to make more and more concessions.''\n  The administration sold this deal on the promise that we would see a \ngreat change in behavior. Take, for example, the behavior that has \noccurred: Iran's continued disregard of the United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions dealing with ballistic missiles. Since the \nconclusion of the nuclear deal last summer, Iran has test-fired new \nclasses of missiles whenever it wanted to; as I just mentioned, as late \nas last Monday. In October, they tested new missiles that are precision \nguided and more sophisticated than the current missiles they have. They \nhave now tested missiles that could reach Israel.\n  Despite the U.N. Security Council explicitly calling for Iran to halt \nits ballistic missile activity, Iran's leaders have consistently \nrebuffed anything that is coming from the international community that \nit says is out of bounds of the resolution, and apparently everything \nis out of bounds of the resolution. In August of 2015, the deputy \nforeign minister of Iran and chief nuclear negotiator told the Tehran \nTimes: ``The restrictions on weapons posed through Resolution 2231 . . \n. are not mandatory and we can disregard them.''\n  That statement directly contradicts Secretary of State Kerry's \nstatement when he talked about the resolution. When he testified before \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee last July, on July 23, Secretary \nKerry said:\n\n       They are restrained from any sharing of missile technology, \n     purchase of missile technology, exchange of missile \n     technology work on missiles. They cannot do that under \n     Article 41, which is Chapter 7 and manda-\n     tory. . . .\n\n  Obviously the administration has a much different interpretation of \nthe current U.N. resolutions than Iran, but they also appear to have a \ncompletely flexible interpretation of what the agreement actually says.\n  In March of this year--just a few weeks ago--the Department of \nJustice unsealed an indictment of Iranians who carried out cyber \nattacks against critical infrastructure and the financial sector of the \nUnited States with the knowledge of the Iranian Government. What does \ncritical infrastructure mean? Critical infrastructure means the \nutilities, the transportation network, the things we have to rely on \nevery day to provide the infrastructure the country needs to function.\n  The indictment notes that one of the hackers ``received credit for \nhis computer intrusion work from the Iranian government toward \ncompletion of his mandatory military service in Iran.''\n  I don't know any other way to interpret that than to say that if \nsomeone is in the Iranian military and if they want to cyber attack the \nUnited States, they will give someone credit for military service time \nto do that.\n  I would think the administration would consider applying sanctions to \nput more pressure on Iran and not worry quite so much about Iran's \nfuture business opportunities. Curiously, yet predictably, the \nadministration has\n\n[[Page S2722]]\n\ntaken the opposite approach and continues to reward bad behavior. That \nreward can come and has come in the administration's basically easing \nfinancial restrictions that prohibit U.S. dollars from being used in \ntransactions with Iran.\n  The dollar continues to be the principal economic currency of the \nworld. Why we would want Iran to have more access to that currency, I \ndon't know. Yet the Secretary of the Treasury, Jack Lew, said that \ngiving Iran access to U.S. currency would ease the blockade. He said, \n``Since Iran has kept its end of the deal, it is our responsibility to \nuphold ours, in both letter and spirit.''\n  There may be only five people in the world--and they are all in the \nObama administration--who believe that Iran has kept up its end of the \ndeal.\n  On April 2, 2016, Eli Lake wrote about how the President has to keep \non giving to save his Iran deal. In other words, Mr. Lake wrote:\n\n       I was under the impression that the nuclear negotiations \n     with Iran ended in July. There was the press conference in \n     Vienna, the U.N. resolution that lifted the sanctions on Iran \n     and the fight in Congress that followed. That turns out to \n     have been wrong.\n\n  He goes on further to say:\n\n       It wasn't part of the ``deal'' in July, which only lifted \n     nuclear-related sanctions on Iran but kept other sanctions to \n     punish the country's support for terrorism, human rights \n     abuses, and its ballistic missile program.\n\n  We don't seem nearly as committed to those sanctions.\n  On April 3, 2016, the Ambassador of the UAE to the United States \nwrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal highlighting concerns about \nIranian actions in the year since the nuclear deal. The Ambassador \npointed out that behind the talk of change, the Iran we have long known \nis still around. He then goes on to list the concerning actions Iran \nhas taken in the last year, such as firing rockets near the USS Truman \naircraft carrier in December 2015 while the Truman was peacefully \ntransitioning the Strait of Hormuz; No. 2, detaining 10 American Navy \nsailors in January of 2016; No. 3, Iranian visits to Russia to purchase \nmilitary fighter jets and equipment, presumably with the billions they \nreceived as part of the nuclear deal. According to the Ambassador, the \nlist can go on and on, with Iranian influence continuing to cause \ninstability in Yemen, Syria, as well as Iran's support for Hezbollah.\n  There can be no doubt that the Obama administration's nuclear \nagreement with Iran has left regional allies nervous. The Ambassador \nfrom the UAE in the editorial I referenced has made that point very \nclearly, and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 3, 2016]\n\n                  One Year After the Iran Nuclear Deal\n\n                         (By Yousef Al Otaiba)\n\n       Saturday marked one year since the framework agreement for \n     the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action--the nuclear deal with \n     Iran--was announced. At the time, President Obama said this \n     agreement would make ``the world safer.'' And perhaps it has, \n     but only in the short term and only when it comes to Iran's \n     nuclear-weapons proliferation.\n       Sadly, behind all the talk of change, the Iran we have long \n     known--hostile, expansionist, violent--is alive and well, and \n     as dangerous as ever. We wish it were otherwise. In the \n     United Arab Emirates, we are seeking ways to coexist with \n     Iran. Perhaps no country has more to gain from normalized \n     relations with Tehran. Reducing tensions across the less than \n     100-mile-wide Arabian Gulf could help restore full trade \n     ties, energy cooperation and cultural exchanges, and start a \n     process to resolve a 45-year territorial dispute.\n       Since the nuclear deal, however, Iran has only doubled down \n     on its posturing and provocations. In October, November and \n     again in early March, Iran conducted ballistic-missile tests \n     in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       In December, Iran fired rockets dangerously close to a U.S. \n     aircraft carrier in the Strait of Hormuz, just weeks before \n     it detained a group of American sailors. In February, Iranian \n     Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan visited Moscow for talks to \n     purchase more than $8 billion in Russian fighter jets, planes \n     and helicopters.\n       In Yemen, where peace talks now hold some real promise, \n     Iran's disruptive interference only grows worse. Last week, \n     the French navy seized a large cache of weapons on its way \n     from Iran to support the Houthis in their rebellion against \n     the UN-backed legitimate Yemeni government. In late February, \n     the Australian navy intercepted a ship off the coast of Oman \n     with thousands of AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades. And \n     last month, a senior Iranian military official said Tehran \n     was ready to send military ``advisers'' to assist the \n     Houthis.\n       The interference doesn't stop there. Since the beginning of \n     the year, Tehran and its proxies have increased their efforts \n     to provide armor-piercing explosive devices to Shiite cells \n     in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. A former Iranian general and \n     close adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called \n     for Iran to annex all of Bahrain. And in Syria, Iran \n     continues to deploy Hezbollah militias and its own Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard to prop up Syria's Bashar Assad.\n       These are all clear reminders that Iran remains the world's \n     leading state sponsor of terrorism--a persistent threat not \n     only to the region but to the U.S. as well. ``Death to \n     America'' has always been more than an ugly catchphrase; it \n     has been Iranian policy. Iran has orchestrated countless \n     terrorist attacks against Americans: from the Marine barracks \n     in Beirut to Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia. During the \n     Afghanistan war, Iran paid Taliban fighters $1,000 for each \n     American they killed.\n       In Iraq, Iran supplied the improvised explosive devices \n     (IEDs) that killed or maimed thousands of U.S. soldiers. And \n     in recent weeks seven Iranian hackers were indicted in a U.S. \n     federal court for a cyberattack against U.S. banks and \n     critical infrastructure.\n       As Henry Kissinger once said, Iran can be either a country \n     or a cause. Today ``Iran the cause'' is showing little of the \n     same kind of pragmatism and moderation in its regional \n     policies and behavior as it did in the nuclear talks. Last \n     week, Mr. Khamenei insisted ballistic missiles were key to \n     the Islamic Republic's future. ``Those who say the future is \n     in negotiations, not in missiles, are either ignorant or \n     traitors,'' he said.\n       It is now clear that one year since the framework for the \n     deal was agreed upon, Iran sees it as an opportunity to \n     increase hostilities in the region. But instead of accepting \n     this as an unfortunate reality, the international community \n     must intensify its actions to check Iran's strategic \n     ambitions.\n       It is time to shine a bright light on Iran's hostile acts \n     across the region. At the Gulf Cooperation Council summit in \n     Riyadh later this month, the U.S., the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, \n     Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman should reach an agreement on \n     a common mechanism to monitor, expose and curb Iran's \n     aggression. This should include specific measures to block \n     its support for the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah units \n     in Syria and Lebanon, and Iranian-linked terrorist cells in \n     Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.\n       If the carrots of engagement aren't working, we must not be \n     afraid to bring back the sticks. Recent half measures against \n     Iran's violations of the ballistic-missile ban are not \n     enough. If the aggression continues, the U.S. and the global \n     community should make clear that Iran will face the full \n     range of sanctions and other steps still available under U.N. \n     resolutions and in the nuclear deal itself.\n       Iran's destabilizing behavior in the region must stop. \n     Until it does, our hope for a new Iran should not cloud the \n     reality that the old Iran is very much still with us--as \n     dangerous and as disruptive as ever.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, the administration's nuclear agreement has \nleft the region nervous, has left the world less stable, and has left \nour colleagues in the Senate who voted for it unwilling to vote on \nanything else about Iran. I think we are finding that the people we \nwork for don't believe this was a good agreement, and we will be \ntalking about this agreement and the aftermath the agreement has \ncreated for a long time.\n  We need to restore a world where America's friends trust us and our \nenemies are afraid of us. It is a dangerous world if we have exactly \nthe opposite of that happening, when our friends don't trust us and our \nenemies aren't afraid of us, and this Iranian agreement is one of the \nreasons that is the case.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 70, I voted yea. It \nwas my intention to vote nay. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate will \npass the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 2017. By rejecting the poison pill riders that sidelined the \nappropriations process for much of last year, the Senate has taken a \nresponsible step forward to meet the needs of the American people, \nkeeping our government functioning, and investing in critical programs \nto support energy research, production, and management.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate rejected efforts to \neliminate Federal support for key regional commissions, including the \nNorthern Border Regional Commission. The Northern Border Regional \nCommission, like others across the country, is a joint\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nFederal-State economic development effort that includes some of the \nmost severely and persistently economically distressed and \nunderdeveloped counties in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and northern \nNew York. Every Federal dollar invested through the commission \nleverages on average $2.6 in matching funds in return for vital \neconomic development and infrastructure projects. The $10 million this \nenergy and water bill provides for the NBRC will help create new jobs \nand retain thousands more.\n  This bill also makes important investments in the Army Corps of \nEngineers, in energy efficiency and renewable energy programs, in \nscientific research, for weatherization programs, and in environmental \ncleanup. I want to thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member \nFeinstein for working with me, too, on important report language to \nencourage the Department of Energy to facilitate the sharing of \ninformation and resources among host communities with nuclear power \nplants that face decommissioning. Communities impacted by the \ndecommissioning of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant would benefit \ngreatly from the experiences and best practices of other host \ncommunities in which plants have recently been decommissioned. I look \nforward to working with the Department of Energy to further advance \nthese goals. The bill also includes report language that directs the \nDepartment of Energy to fund activities that support the development \nand testing of new low-emission, highly efficient wood stoves, an \nimportant heat source for many Vermont homes because of the affordable \nand renewable thermal energy they provide.\n  Senator Alexander and Senator Feinstein have worked in a bipartisan \nway to produce a responsible, rider-free appropriations bill, and I \nhope this process will serve as a model for the Senate as we continue \nthe appropriations process this year.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Free Trade\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, spring has sprung, April showers are giving \nway to May flowers, and soon we will be in the dog days of summer. \nEvery bit as much as a tired cliche, we have again heard sabers rattle \nin opposition to free trade, which tends to happen at this point every \neven year. 'Tis the season for anti-free trade rhetoric.\n  Opponents of free trade are vehemently arguing that the country needs \nto ``get tough'' and hide behind protectionist barriers. \nUnfortunately--and this is what is most troubling--a lot of these \narguments are coming from the Republican side of the aisle. When \nCongress turned its attention to renewing trade promotion authority a \ncouple of years ago, I commented that some Republicans had to do some \npretty impressive verbal gymnastics to put themselves in opposition to \nfree trade. If that was the case then, we have to be witnessing mental \ntriple gainers here with calls to end NAFTA, to reject the Trans-\nPacific Partnership outright, and to hike tariffs to ridiculous levels. \nIt is unfortunate, indeed, when this time of year brings out strawman \narguments scapegoating free trade for everything that ails the U.S. \neconomy.\n  The truth is, free trade expands economic freedom, spurs competition, \nraises productivity, facilitates job creation, and increases the \nstandard of living for all countries if we choose to embrace it. To put \nit simply, free trade provides the U.S. economy with access to global \nmarkets. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 80 percent of the \npurchasing power and more than 95 percent of the world's consumers live \noutside of our borders. In addition, 92 percent of the world's economic \ngrowth is also outside of U.S. borders. In an increasingly global \neconomy, it is incredible to think of the financial opportunities that \nfree trade opens up for a variety of sectors of our economy.\n  According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, U.S. \nexports supported more than 11 million jobs in goods and services in \n2013, a quarter of U.S. manufacturing jobs, and more than 900,000 jobs \nin the agriculture sector just since 2012. And it is not just jobs \ndirectly related to exports. In 2013, the United States spent more than \n$450 billion in research and development--more than any other country \non the planet. Do we really think U.S. companies are going to pour \ntheir hard-earned dollars into developing products and technology if \nthey are able to sell only to the U.S. market alone? Not a chance.\n  Lowering trade barriers and allowing reciprocal access to U.S. \nmarkets also provide U.S. consumers access to lower cost goods, \nboosting their purchasing power. By some reports, U.S. middle-class \nAmericans gain more than a quarter of their purchasing power from \ntrade, allowing individuals and families coast to coast to purchase a \nwider variety of goods at lower cost. This is the part that some people \ndon't appreciate. Imports not only stretch dollars for consumers at the \ncash register, but free trade also allows for access to cheaper inputs \nthat make U.S. industries more globally competitive around the world. \nIn fact, it is estimated that half of U.S. imports are actually inputs \nfor U.S. production for U.S. manufacturing. Lower price imports also \nhelp reduce production costs and can lead to expanded production, \nemployment, and wages in the United States.\n  I bring up these issues today because in the midst of somewhat \npredictable politically heated comments, albeit from somewhat \nunpredictable sources on the Republican side of the aisle, it is \nimportant to remember that trade is a critical component of the U.S. \neconomy. We should be working to expand trade, not impede it.\n  Beyond barring the direct benefits I have noted, a protectionist \nagenda can only result in a chilling effect on foreign investment. In \nthe long run, U.S. workers, industry, and consumers will all lose out \nif foreigners perceive the U.S. as a hostile place of doing business.\n  I understand it is difficult for politicians to point to the benefits \nof free trade. It is tougher to look out there and find individuals who \ndirectly benefit from buying cheaper goods or having cheaper inputs for \ntheir own production. It is easy to find individuals whose companies \nhave closed down because of global competition, but in the aggregate, \non the whole, the country is far better off, and we should understand \nthat here. We have access to the information and the modeling, to \neverything that tells us that trade is extremely beneficial to the \neconomy, and it is good for the U.S. worker as well.\n  We are often told to everything there is a season. Unfortunately, \nthis is the season where empty protectionist rhetoric is allowed to \nbloom.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this carefully the next time they \nare tempted to talk about protectionist benefits rather than the \nbenefits of free trade.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I wish to spend a couple of moments to \ntalk about the Zika virus and our response from Congress to it. There \nhas been a lot of conversation about the Zika virus, both in the media \nand in a multiple of our committees for months, actually. This is not a \nnew issue that has been brought up. This is an existing issue. The \nspread of the Zika virus is moving across our hemisphere. It is rapidly \nspreading in multiple countries to the south of us, and it is moving \ntoward the United States.\n  As most people know, the Zika virus is carried by a mosquito--a \nparticular type of mosquito. Not all mosquitoes can transmit the Zika \nvirus. This particular type of mosquito can carry the virus from one \nperson when the Zika virus is in their blood. It gets in the mosquito. \nThe mosquito bites someone else and transfers it. The interesting\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nthing that most people don't realize is that the Zika virus for most \nindividuals is not all that difficult or painful to be able to work \nthrough.\n  In their own materials that they have now put out in their response \nto the Zika virus, the CDC tries to list the symptoms of Zika and what \nit really means for most individuals. For most individuals, it is \nsomething they will have for a few days. They said that for many \nindividuals, they don't even know they have it. It is something similar \nto having a cold, where they may have some muscle pain and a headache. \nThey may have a fever or a rash, but it goes away after a few days. \nThey are then immune to it for the rest of their life.\n  In fact, the CDC says that if you have it, the treatment they list \nfor the Zika virus--obviously, they always suggest that you check in \nwith your doctor. But the common treatment from CDC is to get plenty of \nrest, drink fluids, and take Tylenol. It is not something that most \npeople should be afraid of unless you are pregnant, but the risk of \nbirth defects is astronomical.\n  Now, not everyone who is pregnant and gets the Zika virus also has \nbirth defects, but for those that have, it can be very, very serious. \nThis is to be taken seriously, but it is not a new issue as well.\n  The Zika virus has been known to be around since the 1950s. It has \nmoved through multiple different countries in multiple different \nregions. In the United States, though, we have yet to have a single \ncase in the continental United States that originated in the United \nStates. These are individuals who traveled to countries south of us in \nCentral America or South America and picked up the virus there or in \nPuerto Rico or in some of the other areas in the Caribbean and then \nhave come back to the United States. But it is yet to have a transfer, \nthat we know of, from any individual within the United States to \nanother person in the United States.\n  Again, that doesn't belittle the issue, but I want to put it in the \ncontext of where we are. We are at the early stages of dealing with \nthis as U.S. citizens. In Puerto Rico and other areas, it is very \nadvanced and there are hundreds of cases there. Now the determination \nis this: What do we do?\n  The CDC has already stepped up, trying to intervene and trying to \nfind ways to be able to develop a vaccine for it, which they feel \nconfident they can do. I met with the Director of the CDC not long ago. \nHe feels very confident they will be able to have a vaccine within a \ncouple of years. But then we have a couple of years that we are dealing \nwith in the process just for the development of the vaccine and then \nthe distribution of that vaccine.\n  The main thing that can be done right now is actually putting down \nmosquito populations. It is getting into areas where there is rapid \nadvancement of mosquitoes and actually putting pesticides in those \nareas to greatly diminish the population of mosquitoes. It is \ndeveloping better testing for Zika. It is getting out the opportunity \nin different health departments around the country to say: How are we \ngoing to evaluate this and how do we know if someone just has a fever \nand a rash, if that is something else related to heat, or if that \nsomething related to Zika? The CDC is engaging in all of those things.\n  In the middle of this, the White House has requested almost $2 \nbillion in what they are calling an emergency request for Zika. I do \nbelieve there should be a response to Zika, and we should aggressively \nlean in. The last thing we should do is sit around and wait until the \nZika virus spreads across the United States and affects many of these \npregnant moms who are out there. Then we have birth defects because of \nour inactivity in the days ahead. But almost $2 billion in an emergency \nrequest is interesting to me because for a lot of it they haven't given \nus great detail on it of really what all of that will engage. But they \nhave said they need this large amount of money.\n  I have to tell you that I am a little bit skeptical when anyone comes \nand says: It is an emergency. I need $2 billion, and I will tell you \nwhat it is for later.\n  We went through this with the Ebola funding, where there was a $5 \nbillion request for Ebola funding. Two years later, they spent about \n$2.5 billion of that. Recently, the administration transferred half a \nbillion dollars of that funding for Ebola into treatment and discovery \nfor Zika. So they have already reprogrammed some of that money and have \nstarted to be able to move it over.\n  I would ask just a couple of things of this body as we consider how \nwe are going to handle Zika. One is to treat it seriously. Though for \nmost people it is not a serious issue, if you are pregnant, it is \nserious. We should treat it seriously.\n  The second thing is that we should do this appropriations in the \nnormal appropriations process. I do not think we need to have \nadditional debt spending. We can reprogram existing funds to be able to \ndeal with this. We also need real detail of how this money is going to \nbe spent so that we don't allocate dollars and then find out later how \nthey were going to be spent. We have a responsibility as Congress to \nknow how American tax dollars are being spent, and I think my \nskepticism is justified.\n  Let me give you just a quick idea. Right now, if we are going to deal \nwith actually funding this area--which I believe we should--then we \nshould begin with allowing the Department of State, HHS, and USAID to \nhave transfer authority within their existing accounts to be able to \naddress this. These three agencies currently have $86 billion in what \nthey call unobligated balances from previous years that they already \nhave right now--$86 billion. With this much money lying around, there \nis absolutely no need to ask the American people to pay an additional \n$1 billion on top of the originally already obligated--overobligated--\nand bloated budget.\n  The transfer authority I would ask for would be accompanied by a \ncomprehensive spending plan that requires the administration to detail \nexactly how it plans to use these funds and then report out any \nobligations to match up with the original spending plan. Before we \nwrite a blank check to the administration, I believe the American \npeople should actually know how this is being spent.\n  Now, there are some individuals who would say this is an emergency. \nWe just need to add $1 billion more in debt and figure out how to pay \nfor it later.\n  I would disagree. We have transfer authority. This is not new. In \nfact, if you go back to 2009, President Obama requested transfer \nauthority to HHS to deal with the H1N1 panic. Remember when the big \npanic was about swine flu and about H1N1 in 2009? As a nation, we stood \nup and addressed some of these issues.\n  At that time the President made a very specific request for transfer \nauthority to deal with this. That is not any different than what I am \nsaying right now. I don't understand how this is different than how we \nwere dealing with H1N1. Right now we have to have additional spending \non top of everything else, but in 2009 it was entirely appropriate to \nbe able to reprogram funds.\n  Again, this is not new. As I have mentioned before about for the \nEbola emergency supplementals, the President has already taken about \n$600 million from Ebola and transferred that over to Zika.\n  It is interesting to note that in March President Obama reprogrammed \n$500 million from the Economic Support Fund, which is designated by \nCongress to combat infectious diseases. He took $500 million from the \nfund to combat infectious diseases and instead reprogrammed it over for \nthe Green Climate Fund. So he took half a billion dollars from the \ninfectious diseases account and used it instead for the Green Climate \nFund--internationally.\n  He has done this before. In fact, it was just days ago that the \nPresident took $8 million out of a different account and reprogrammed \nit to purchase almost $9 million of heavy water from Iran.\n  This body, of all bodies, has the responsibility to be able to not \nonly deal with the health emergencies that are happening around the \nworld but also the fiscal issues that we have in our Nation. We can do \nboth. There is no reason to do debt spending when the money is there \nright now to be reprogrammed. We do not have to break the budget caps, \nand we do not have to accelerate other areas of spending just to do \nwhat is our responsibility. We\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nshould do the responsible thing in dealing with Zika. We should also \nassume the responsibility we have to take care of the American taxpayer \nat the same time.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Prescription Opioid Abuse\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am honored to represent the State of \nIllinois. It is a big State. From Chicago to Carroll at the southern \ntip of our State is 400 miles, and, of course, there is more State \nnorth of Chicago. I traveled the State over the last several months, \nand last week I went to the southern tip of the State, worked my way \nthrough, came back through central Illinois, and was in the city of \nChicago. There is one recurring challenge I find all across the State: \nNo matter what community I visit, I have learned that there is no town \ntoo small, no suburb too wealthy, no city that has escaped the opioid \nand heroin epidemic we are now facing. America is losing more people to \nheroin overdose than we are to traffic accidents. It has become that \ncommon.\n  I try to have roundtables around the State--rural areas, suburban \ntowns--and really try to get the picture of what is happening. I think \nI have come to understand it a little better because of this effort, \nand I would like to discuss it today.\n  The opioid/heroin crisis demands our immediate attention. It demands \na comprehensive response involving local, State, and Federal \nGovernment, law enforcement agencies, and the private sector. For too \nlong we have focused our efforts almost exclusively on responding to \nand treating addiction. That is a critical element, and I am not going \nto diminish it, but we need to look beyond that.\n  Yes, we need to make sure substance abuse treatment is available. \nRight now there are some archaic laws in the Medicaid Program that \nrestrict the number of beds one can have in a treatment facility. I see \nSenator Alexander from Tennessee has come to the floor, and he is chair \nof the committee that may consider this issue. He may be aware of the \nfact that many years ago we restricted the number of treatment beds in \nsubstance abuse treatment facilities to 16 beds. If we can imagine, for \nfacilities treating the city of Chicago, 16 beds doesn't even touch the \nproblem we are facing with addictions today, so I hope we can increase \nthat number. I talked to Senator Collins of Maine, and she has run into \nthe same thing in her home State, and I bet others have as well.\n  When it comes to treatment, there are things we must do, and this is \none when it comes to Medicaid. But we have to do more than that. Simply \ndealing with substance abuse treatment, as important and critical as it \nis, is not enough. We need to look at the root causes of the issue.\n  Each year in America, the pharmaceutical industry produces 14 billion \nopioid pills--14 billion. That is enough to provide every adult in \nAmerica a 1-month prescription of opioid painkillers. There is a \ndefinite need for these painkillers and pain management. The Centers \nfor Disease Control estimates that 14 to 16 percent of Americans face \nchronic and acute pain. I want to be sensitive to their needs and make \ncertain they have the kind of pain relief and pain management they \ndesperately need every single day, but what we have now is a market in \nAmerica flooded with these opioid pills. The number of opioid \nprescriptions has risen dramatically, from 76 million prescriptions in \n1991 to 245 million in 2014--more than triple the amount. The United \nStates is the largest consumer of opioid pain pills, accounting for \nalmost 100 percent of the world's total consumption of hydrocodone and \n81 percent of OxyContin.\n  There are a number of reasons we have seen the sharp rise in the \nnumber of opioids being prescribed over the last two decades: There is \nincreased attention on identifying and treating pain; there is \nperceived financial incentive in some cases to overtreat pain; and \nthere is a lack of insurance coverage for alternative pain treatment \nmodalities. However, the single largest reason behind the dramatic \nincrease is the production on the pharmaceutical side.\n  The dramatic increase in prescriptions for these addictive pain \nkillers can be directly linked to Purdue Pharma introducing OxyContin \nin the late 1990s. Between 1996 and 2002, Purdue Pharma funded more \nthan 20,000 pain-related educational programs for doctors through \ndirect sponsorship or financial grant and launched a multifaceted \ncampaign to encourage long-term use of OxyContin for chronic, noncancer \npain. They, of course, promoted their pills to doctors and patients on \nthe false promise that these powerful painkillers could relieve pain \nfor up to 12 hours in many patients. When clinical trials and \nphysicians' and patients' feedback showed that OxyContin didn't last \nfor that full period, Perdue Pharma refused to explore other dosing \nintervals. Instead, they urged doctors to increase the dosage, leading \nto highs and lows of crippling addiction and overdose.\n  The recent guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention recommended against using opioids for chronic, noncancer \npain management, but by this point Perdue Pharma had opened the door \nfor others to follow. From 1972 to 2015, the Food and Drug \nAdministration has approved more than 400 different opioid products--\n100 brand-name drugs and more than 300 generic versions. The \npharmaceutical industry is flooding our communities with greater and \ngreater quantities of these drugs. Between 1993 and 2015, the \nproduction of hydrocodone increased twelvefold, the production of \nhydromorphone increased twenty-three-fold, and the production of \nfentanyl increased twenty-five-fold. As I mentioned earlier, there are \napproximately 14 billion prescription opioid pills on the market in \nAmerica every year.\n  What has been the result of this overproduction and overprescribing? \nNearly 2 million people in the United States are currently addicted to \nopioids. We have seen alarming increases in opioid-related emergency \nroom visits and treatment admissions for abuse. In 2014 opioids were \ninvolved in 28,647 deaths in America. In 2014 Illinois had 1,652 \nopioid-related drug overdose deaths--a nearly 30 percent increase over \n2010. Each week in Illinois, we average eight deaths due to \nprescription drug overdose.\n  And it doesn't stop there. In so many cases, prescription opioid \nabuse leads to heroin addiction. Four out of five current heroin users \nsay their addiction began with prescription opioids. It is \nheartbreaking to have these roundtables in communities and to sit \nacross the table from recent graduates from high school who tell the \nstory of having been addicted in high school for years, and then when \nthey couldn't afford the expensive pills, they switched to heroin, \nwhich was cheaper and in many cases for their friends, deadly.\n  The United States currently has 467,000 heroin addicts. Between 2002 \nand 2013, the rate of heroin-related overdose deaths nearly quadrupled, \nwith more than 8,200 people dying from heroin in 2013.\n  It is time to change. We need a comprehensive solution. We need it \nnow. We have to prevent these drug companies from flooding the market \nwith excessive amounts of addictive pills. We can't sit idly by while \nthey tell us these powerful painkillers are safe. We know better. We \nmust encourage the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FDA to use their \nauthority to keep unnecessary, unsafe drugs off the market, and we must \ncrack down on doctors and providers who are overprescribing.\n  Let me repeat. People suffering chronic and acute pain need help. \nThey need pain relief, and they need pain management. I will never \nstand in their way. But we know from the volume of painkillers that are \nbeing prescribed that there are many people who are abusing.\n  I shared with four major medical societies a recent letter asking \nthem to help us help our Nation combat this\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nepidemic. I want them to endorse mandatory continuing medical education \nprograms for those who prescribe opioids--doctors and dentists. They \nshould support proposals to require that physicians and dentists check \nprescription drug monitoring databases before they prescribe opioids to \npatients, ensuring that these patients aren't just doctor shopping, and \nthey should increase awareness and transparency in physician-\nprescribing practices, as well as proper accountability and \nintervention.\n  Every stakeholder in this complex opioid epidemic has played a role \nin reaching this dreadful point, and now every stakeholder has a \nresponsibility to help us address this crisis.\n  The Senate passed a bill earlier this year that has some good \nprovisions and authorizes new programs, but it did not go far enough. \nIt didn't provide additional funding for the crisis. Simply passing an \nauthorizing bill and giving stirring speeches on the floor of the \nSenate is not going to solve the problem. It didn't address the \noverprescription of opioids, and it is time for us to be honest about \nthis. I recently heard one of our leaders on this subject tell us: \nWell, we are going to start teaching the new doctors in medical school \nnot to make the same mistakes. I am sorry, but that is not good enough. \nThose who currently have the legal authority to prescribe have to \nchange their ways to stop this epidemic. And the bills we considered \ndidn't address the overproduction of these addictive drugs.\n  We can't solve this massive American problem with half measures. We \nneed to come together--Congress, local government, law enforcement, \nhealth care providers, drug companies, doctors--to help solve this \nproblem, and we need to do it as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 \np.m. on Thursday, today, May 12, all postcloture time be considered \nexpired and that following the disposition of the Alexander substitute \namendment, the cloture motion on H.R. 2028 be withdrawn, the bill be \nread a third time, and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as \namended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2577\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing disposition of H.R. 2028, the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2577, the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill; \nfurther, that the pending amendments be withdrawn and that Senator \nCochran or his designee be recognized to offer a substitute amendment \nthat contains the text of S. 2844 and S. 2806 as reported by the \nAppropriations Committee with a technical citation correction in \nsection 237 of S. 2844; further, that the substitute amendment be \nconsidered an Appropriations Committee amendment for the purpose of \nrule XVI and that H.R. 2577 serve as the basis for defense of \ngermaneness under rule XVI for the division of the substitute that \ncontains S. 2844 and that H.R. 4974, as reported by the House \nAppropriations Committee, serve as the basis for defense of germaneness \nunder rule XVI for the division of the substitute that contains S. \n2806; finally, that floor amendments be drafted to one of the two \ndivisions and use the corresponding House text for defense of \ngermaneness and that rule XVI discipline apply during consideration of \nthis measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                    Energy Policy and Climate Change\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, today I rise to talk about a movement--\na vision--called ``Keep It in the Ground'' and why it is so important \nto the future of our energy policy here in the United States and our \nenergy strategy around the world.\n  The core challenge we face as citizens of this planet and as \npolicymakers in the United States is that the impact of global warming \nis having devastating effects across our country and the world. We can \nsimply look at my home State of Oregon and see that because the winters \nare warmer, and the pine beetles are thriving and killing a lot more \ntrees. There is such a broad swath of dead trees that it is referred to \nas the red zone. You can fly above the red zone, as I have, in a plane \nand see--it feels like it is from horizon to horizon--this swath of \nred. It is causing extraordinary damage to the forests, and it impacts \nthe natural ecosystem and timber industry, which is a key part of the \neconomy of Oregon.\n  We could go across the State to the Oregon coast where the oyster \nindustry started having severe problems about the time I was elected to \nthe Senate. The problem was rooted in the fact that baby oysters were \ndying, and they couldn't figure out why. They thought that perhaps it \nwas due to a bacteria or virus. They had help from research scientists \nwho stepped in to study the situation. It turned out to be the \nincreasing acidity of the Pacific Ocean, and that acidity was making it \nvery hard for the baby oysters to form a shell. As a result, they were \ndying.\n  So they artificially manipulated the acidity of the water that the \nbaby oysters were bred in, and that is helping quite a bit. What other \nchallenges are there for the food chain in the oceans if our oceans \nhave absorbed so much carbon and produced so much carbonic acid that it \nis affecting the formation of shells on our oysters?\n  What else will start going wrong? We can turn to the changing weather \npatterns that are producing drought and floods with greater intensity \nand understand the impact on agriculture. We can look to the Klamath \nBasin in my State, which has had the three worst droughts within a 15-\nyear period. We can look at the impact of the snowpack in the Cascades \nand realize and see the decline of the winter snow entertainment \nindustry.\n  We can look around the country and see all kinds of other impacts. We \nsee that the moose are dying in the northeastern part of the United \nStates because the winters are not cold enough to kill the ticks. The \nticks are killing the moose and the moose are disappearing.\n  We can look at Louisiana. Recent reports say that they are losing a \nfootball field's worth of coastline every 48 minutes due to global \nwarming. That is less than an hour. That is a substantial amount of \nland that is disappearing hour after hour, day after day, week after \nweek, month after month, and, of course, year after year. It is having \na huge impact.\n  We have come to understand that as the weather warms, certain insects \nthat provide hosts to various diseases gain a greater terrain. As the \ntemperature changes, mosquitoes from the southern part of the United \nStates are moving north, and two of those mosquitoes carry the Zika \nvirus. That is just one example of the concerns that are presented by \nchanging insect populations.\n  We can look at the impact on the lobsters in Maine. The lobsters are \nmoving north as the water warms in Maine. They are also dealing with \nthe loss of their cod fishery because of the changing water \ntemperatures.\n  The impact is everywhere. For anyone who looks across the United \nStates and does not recognize that we are in an extraordinary time of \nmultiple changes in the weather patterns, temperatures, and the impacts \non animals, insects, agriculture, and timber--if you can't see that, \nyou are really choosing not to look, and we cannot afford not to look. \nIt is our responsibility to be aware of what is happening, why it is \nhappening, and how we need to respond. That is why I am on the floor \ntoday.\n  I am here to talk about ``Keep It in the Ground.'' I will be doing a \nseries of speeches about different components of the challenge we have \nin responding to global warming. A part of those conversations will \ninvolve looking at these various effects in more detail, such as what I \nhave already mentioned, and other speeches will talk about the promise \nof new policy strategies, new technologies, new investments, mission \ninnovations, et cetera, that provide a\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nglimmer of hope of what is happening here in the United States and \nacross the globe.\n  Here is the challenge. What this all boils down to is that these \nproblems are created by the massive burning of fossil fuels. I think \npeople are generally aware that fossil fuels are created by hundreds of \nmillions of years in which plant life has settled to the bottom of the \nocean, then is trapped and submerged. Over time, it is converted into \ncoal, oil, and natural gas. We are pulling out that carbon that has \ndeveloped over these hundreds of millions of years in a very short span \nof a few generations on this planet--just over the last 150 years. It \nhas been just over the last 150 years. We have been burning it so it is \nputting this massive infusion of carbon dioxide back into the air and \nchanging the chemistry of our air. Therefore, it is changing the heat \nretention of our thin layer of atmosphere that covers our planet and \nthereby warming our planet--the greenhouse effect as it is referred to.\n\n  So our core challenge is to pivot from burning fossil fuels for \nenergy to other forms of energy that do not put carbon dioxide into the \nair and to do so in a very short period of time.\n  Naturally, this leads to the question: How much of these fossil fuels \ncan we continue to burn without devastating consequences? That is \nsomething that is referred to as the climate math, and that is what I \nam going to turn to now.\n  The basic situation is, we have proven reserves that equate to about \n2,800 gigatons of carbon dioxide. Those are fossil fuels in the ground \nequating to about 2,800 gigatons of carbon dioxide. If we were to burn \nall of those proven reserves that we have in the ground currently, we \nwould massively accelerate global warming, and with the feedback \nmechanisms, that is disastrous for our planet.\n  The international community has gotten together and said: What do we \nneed to aim at in order to avoid these catastrophic consequences? There \nwill be serious consequences. We already have serious consequences and \nwe can't avoid them. How do we avoid catastrophic consequences? The \ngeneral position they have put forward is that we need to limit the \nwarming of the planet to no more than 2 degrees centigrade. In the \nUnited States, we primarily operate in terms of Fahrenheit, so we \ntranslate 2 degrees centigrade to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  Since the time we started burning coal until now, we have already \nraised the temperature of the planet about half that amount--1 degree \ncentigrade or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. So we are already halfway toward \nthe limit beyond which the effects become more and more catastrophic. \nAs scientists have evaluated that 2,800 gigatons of carbon dioxide \ntrapped in fossil fuels and asked how much more can we burn, they \nessentially have come to the conclusion that we can burn about one-\nfifth of it--one-fifth of the proven reserves.\n  Let's translate what that means. That means, to avoid catastrophe, we \nhave to leave 80 percent of the proven reserves in the ground. This is \nan enormous challenge for human society--for governments and \npolicymakers and individuals across the planet--to undertake because \nevery owner of those proven reserves has the knowledge that their coal, \ntheir oil, their natural gas has substantial value on the market. They \nwant to preserve the ability to extract it out of the ground and sell \nit for combustion. For example, some oil is used in making plastics, \nbut the great majority is utilized in combustion--the creation of \nenergy. That is where this challenge is coming from.\n  So how do we go about creating policies that keep 80 percent of the \nproven reserves in the ground, when they have so much value to their \nowners and the owners want to retain the ability to extract them? That \nis the challenge we face. It is an extraordinarily difficult challenge.\n  The reason I particularly want to emphasize this ``Keep It in the \nGround'' movement is it shines a bright light on this carbon math, this \nglobal warming math.\n  When we talk about, well, the planet is getting warmer, and we have \nto burn less so we need to make our buildings more energy efficient, \nthat is absolutely true, and we should do everything to make our \nbuildings more energy efficient, but it doesn't convey the fundamental \nunderstanding of the size of the challenge we face, which is to keep 80 \npercent of the proven reserves in the ground.\n  When we talk about the need to make our cars more fuel efficient in \norder to burn less gasoline, which means burn less oil to produce less \ncarbon dioxide, that is true. We absolutely need to make our cars more \nenergy efficient, but talking about that doesn't convey the enormity of \nthe challenge, which is to keep 80 percent of the proven reserves in \nthe ground. When we talk about the need to move more freight on trucks \nthat are more efficient and shift more freight to trains because they \nare more fuel efficient, that also is absolutely true, but again it \ndoesn't convey the key challenge.\n  As we look at each of these areas of strategy and conservation, all \nof them are tools we are going to need to use to keep our reserves in \nthe ground. We are also going to need to use other tools. Those tools \ncertainly involve a quick pivot to produce more renewable energy to \nsubstitute for the electricity that is generated by the burning of coal \nand the burning of natural gas. We have to pivot quickly, but again, \nwhen we talk about pivoting quickly, it doesn't convey the size of the \nchallenge.\n  What is that challenge? We must leave 80 percent of the proven \nreserves in the world in the ground. That is the challenge. So we must \ndo energy conservation. We must proceed to pivot quickly to renewable \nenergy, but we need to understand the urgency, the speed with which we \ndo so because we have a limited carbon budget.\n  On this chart, the layout in the orange bar is the size of the proven \nreserves that are in the ground. Here, with this yellow bar, is the \namount of fossil fuels we can burn and not exceed 2 degrees centigrade \nor a 3.6-degree Fahrenheit temperature change.\n  As we can see, the vast bulk of the reserves that are in the ground \nhave to be left in the ground. That is the 80 percent that has to be \nleft in the ground. This ``Keep It in the Ground'' movement is all \nabout understanding this core carbon math and crafting policies in \nwhich we emphasize that we are on a pathway to achieving success; that \nis, to leave this 80 percent in the ground.\n  This also leads to a conversation about the U.S. ownership of a vast \namount of fossil fuels. You and I, as citizens of the United States, we \nare owners of a huge amount of coal, a huge amount of natural gas, a \nhuge amount of oil. We don't think of ourselves as energy barons, but \neach and every one of us as citizens collectively own a vast amount of \nfossil fuels because on Federal land there is a tremendous amount of \noil, a tremendous amount of coal, and a tremendous amount of natural \ngas. We have the responsibility in the Senate and in the House and in \nthe executive branch to manage what we own as citizens of the United \nStates for the public good.\n  In the past, managing for the public good meant let's do leases and \nraise some revenue for the Federal Government, and we have leased out \nabout 10 percent of the carbon reserves that we own as citizens--our \ncitizen-owned carbon, fossil fuel reserves--but 90 percent of it has \nnot been leased out. When we do a lease, it creates a legal contract in \nwhich the individual company that has purchased the lease now has the \nright to extract that oil, to extract that natural gas, to extract that \ncoal for years to come, and to renew the lease. There are many leases \nthat result in extraction going on for decades--for 10 years, for 20 \nyears but even three decades, four decades, five decades into the \nfuture. We cannot afford, as Americans or as citizens of this planet, \nto be facilitating the extraction of fossil fuels to be burned three, \nfour, or five decades into the future. There is no way that the world \nis going to meet this challenge of keeping 80 percent of the carbon in \nthe ground, 80 percent of their fossil fuels in the ground if the \npublic entities can't even exercise discipline not to extract and burn \nthese fossil fuels.\n  So how much do we own? How big of oil barons are the citizens of the \nUnited States? How much oil and natural gas and coal do we have? Well, \nthe total amount measured in terms of carbon dioxide is about 300 to \n450 gigatons. That is this green bar. If we think about the 80 percent \nwe leave in the ground, that substantial amount,\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\nwhich is over 2,000 gigatons, this amount we own as citizens is a \nsubstantial percentage. It has been estimated to be in the range of \nabout 14 to 20 percent of the amount the world needs to leave in the \nground.\n  So if we make the decision as Americans to leave what we own in the \nground to save our planet, we have helped set the world on a course in \nwhich we reach this 80 percent target of what is left in the ground, \nbut if we can't exercise discipline and quit leasing out our fossil \nfuel reserves, often at $1 or $2 per acre--if we can't stop that, how \ncan we anticipate adopting the policies necessary to help lead the \nworld in this enormous challenge?\n  So this has led to the keep-it-in-the-ground bill I introduced last \nyear. The keep-it-in-the-ground bill says the fossil fuel reserves that \nyou and I own best serve the public good by not burning them, by not \ndoing new leases for extraction--extraction that will continue 30, 40, \n50 years into the future; that we cannot afford to do that without \ndevastating consequences to our planet. The existing leases--we have \nalready leased out 10 percent of the fossil fuel reserves, which means \nthere isn't a complete shutdown of the fossil fuel enterprise on public \nlands, but it does mean we are not going to go any further or, as it \nhas been put, if you are in a hole, quit digging. In this case, we are \nin a carbon hole and we absolutely need to quit digging.\n  There have been a number of Senators sign on to the keep-it-in-the-\nground bill, recognizing the best, highest use of our citizen-owned \nfossil fuels is to keep them in the ground, and I appreciate their \nsupport a great deal.\n  There has also been a series of conversations around the country \nsince the time the bill was introduced that have been very relevant or \nrelated to these issues. The first conversation was about the Keystone \nPipeline. Should we build a pipeline that turns the tap on to some of \nthe dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet, the Canadian tar sands? The \nanswer is no. Those tar sands need to be left in the ground. We need a \nCanadian keep-it-in-the-ground movement to say that Canada, too, is \ngoing to utilize its citizen-owned fossil fuels at the highest purpose, \nwhich is to leave them in the ground, to keep them in the ground. \nCertainly, the United States shouldn't be facilitating the extraction \nby building a convenient, cheap way to move those fossil fuels out of \nthe ground. So I applaud all of those who stood with humanity in this \nkey mission and said no to the Keystone Pipeline.\n  Another aspect has been offshore drilling. There was a big \nconversation about drilling in the Arctic. The Arctic, because it is so \ncold and frozen and full of ice, has been a terrain, particularly \noffshore, where drilling is extraordinarily difficult, with extreme \nrisk of oilspill. Should an oilspill occur in very cold water, that \nmeans the damage will be enormous because the oil will break down so \nslowly. So I put forward a keep-it-in-the-ground bill for no offshore \ndrilling in the Arctic. And that is not the bill we have had action on \nhere in the Senate, but, as it turns out, we have moved forward. Shell, \nwhich was the leading company to explore offshore in the Arctic, sent \nships up for several years. They had one calamity after another, one \ndisaster after another because of the harsh and challenging \ncircumstances. Citizens in the United States, in a grassroots movement, \nsaid: Shell, no. Shell, no. This is wrong. This is the height of \nirresponsibility to our environment and to have the U.S. leading \nextraction in a whole new area. We should be leading the Arctic nations \nand leaving the Arctic off limits as part of this ``Keep It in the \nGround'' movement, not leading the front edge of extraction.\n\n  Well, Shell abandoned its leases, both because of the difficulty of \ndrilling and because of citizen reaction here at home saying what they \nwere doing is wrong. I thank Shell for ending its Arctic drilling \nprogram, and I thank the administration for saying that they are not \ngoing to issue any more leases for drilling in the Arctic waters.\n  Let's go further. The United States is the chair of the Arctic \nCouncil. Let's use that chairmanship to lead nations in putting the \nArctic off-limits. That would be a tremendous collaborative effort \namong a small group of nations to move forward this ``Keep It in the \nGround'' movement and to save our planet.\n  Another big piece of this conversation has been about coal leases. As \nI mentioned, we often lease acres of coal for just a few dollars. It is \nno substantial revenue in the large scheme of things to the United \nStates. It is hugely beneficial to the cheap extraction of coal, \nthough, which is the opposite of the direction we need to go. So we \nneed to quit doing new coal leases. That is part of the keep-it-in-the \nground bill I introduced. No more leases of citizen-owned fossil fuels. \nAnd the Obama administration has now suspended its leases on coal, new \ncoal leases. That is a tremendous event. Part of what the \nadministration said was that we need to pause and evaluate the impact \non global warming in doing these leases.\n  We need to also evaluate the impact on American leadership in the \nworld on this major issue facing humanity. If we are telling other \nnations ``Please don't burn coal. Please expand your use of renewable \nenergy and do it quickly,'' how is that consistent? How is our plea for \npartnership--because we must do this as a collection of nations--how is \nour request for partnership in this great and important mission of our \ngeneration consistent with us continuing new leases of coal? It \ncertainly is not consistent. We need to put an end to these coal \nleases, and I applaud the administration. And in the next \nadministration, whether it is Democratic or Republican, we need to work \ntogether to do no new coal leases. So that was a tremendous step \nforward in this effort.\n  Back in December, nearly 200 nations came together to work together \nto create an international accord with the singular goal of reducing \nthe burning of fossil fuels and converting to renewable energy or \nreducing the burning of fossil fuels because of energy conservation. \nThe countries made a variety of pledges. One of those countries that \nmade those pledges was India. I had a chance to lead a bilateral \nmeeting between legislators from the United States and members of the \nGovernment of India. They said: We have 300 million citizens in India \nwho do not have access to electricity. As a national government, we \nhave to expand our electric infrastructure to provide electricity for a \nbasic standard of living and basic economic development.\n  We can certainly understand that mission. We went through rural \nelectrification. Our goal was to make sure there was wiring in every \nhouse in America to improve the standard of living for Americans. So \nAmericans we are certainly understanding of the goal of the Indian \nGovernment.\n  They proceeded to say this: Right now we plan to provide electricity \nto 100 million individuals through renewable energy and 200 million \ncitizens of India through coal-burning power.\n  It almost causes your heart to sink, this plan for massive increases \nin coal-burning in India.\n  So here is an opportunity. How can we in the United States work with \nIndia so they can meet that demand of 300 million citizens with \nconservation and renewable energy rather than new coal plants? How can \nwe work in partnership with China as they work to provide electricity \nto their hundreds of millions of individuals and to do so with \nrenewable energy and conservation, not new coal-burning plants? This is \na challenge for us, and an important challenge, but we certainly have \nno credibility talking to India about trying to make sure they do no \nnew coal-burning plants if we are signing new leases to extract coal \noff of our public lands. Credibility is very important in this \ninternational conversation.\n  It has been said that we are the first generation to feel the impacts \nof global warming and we are the last generation to be able to do \nsomething about it. That is profoundly true. That is the moral \nchallenge to American leaders in our generation. That is the moral \nchallenge to international leaders in our generation. Our children and \nour children's children, our children's grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren are going to say: You were the generation that saw the \nimpact of global warming on our Nation and on our planet, and you knew \nfrom the science that we had to move quickly to pivot off of fossil \nfuels, and yet you did too little and you damaged the quality of life \nfor billions of children and children of children for generations to \ncome because of your short-term failure to act.\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\n  Let that not be the story told by our children and our grandchildren \nand our great-grandchildren. Let them instead say: That generation was \nthe first to see the impact of global warming and know they had to act \nquickly to reverse the steady climb of temperature on our planet. Let's \nthank them because they saw the challenge and they acted, and we are \nforever indebted to them for doing so.\n  Let that be the story that is told. Let this be the moment that we \nact.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in about 15 minutes, the Senate will \nvote on final passage of the Energy and Water appropriations bill that \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and I have been working on \nwith Members of the Senate for the last few weeks. The Senate began \nconsideration of this bill on Wednesday, April 20.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, this is the earliest \ndate the Senate has begun debating an appropriations bill in the last \n40 years. When we finish today, this will be the earliest the Senate \nhas passed an appropriations bill in the last 40 years.\n  Eighty Senators either submitted requests or offered amendments to \nthe bill. Senator Feinstein and I have worked hard to accommodate most \nof those. The last time this bill, the Energy and Water appropriations \nbill, was considered by the Senate and passed in regular order was in \nthe year 2009. By ``regular order,'' I mean it came to the floor, it \nhad an open amendment process, all 100 Senators had a chance to \nparticipate in it, instead of just the 30 on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and it was eventually voted on and approved.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted to end debate on the substitute amendment \nby a vote of 97 to 2. As I mentioned, today we are ready for final \npassage in about 15 minutes. By the end of this process, we will have \nconsidered 21 amendments and adopted 14.\n  I appreciate my colleagues supporting the regular appropriations \nprocess. I thank Senators who offered germane and relevant amendments, \nand I hope we can now overwhelmingly pass the bill.\n  I begin by pointing something out. It is appropriate that we have in \nthe chair the Senator from Georgia, who has devoted so much of his time \nthis year to reforming our budget process.\n  This is the part of the budget that we are working on. It is a little \nmore than a trillion dollars, and it is not the Federal spending \nproblem that we have. This is 2008 through about today, and you can see \nthat spending levels are pretty flat. This is the projection by the \nCongressional Budget Office about where spending for this part of the \nbudget will go over the next several years.\n  What is in this blue line? It is all of our national defense; all of \nthe work we need, such as in this bill, to deepen the harbors in \nSavannah and in Charleston; all the money for our national \nlaboratories; all the money for our Pell grants for college students; \nand the money for the National Institutes of Health for treatments and \ncancer cures. In this part of the budget--in this trillion dollars that \nwe work on--there are very important matters that virtually everyone \nwho votes for us would like to see us address. I believe those of us on \nthe Appropriations Committee have done a good job of oversight of this \ntrillion dollars in spending.\n  Here is where the problem is--this red line. This is the entitlement \nspending. It gets to be three times as much as this blue line. It is up \ntoward $4 trillion. This is $1 trillion.\n  This is where we need to go to work. Sometimes Senators of each party \nwill come to the floor and beat their chests, bragging about cutting \nthis blue line as if they were doing something about the red line. I \nhope we will stop that. I hope we will go to work and figure out what \nwe are going to do to responsibly keep this line under control as we go \nforward.\n  What we have done--with the cooperation of the Senate in the last \ncouple of weeks--is to pass the first of the Senate appropriations \nbills and to do it earlier than it has been done in the last 4 years.\n  I see the Senator from California has arrived. I wish to acknowledge \nher leadership and thank her for it. In her words, we give and we take. \nWe have a process whereby we stick to our principles, but we do our \nbest to come to a result, which we have done. It is a great pleasure to \nwork with her.\n  I am going to cease my remarks 5 minutes or 6 minutes before the vote \nso that Senator Feinstein will have a chance to speak if she would like \nto speak.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I also wish to thank the staffs for their work on this \nbill. They have been remarkably good. In Senator Feinstein's staff are \nDoug Clapp, Chris Hanson, Samantha Nelson, and Tim Dykstra.\n  The staff on my side includes Tyler Owens, Adam DeMella, Meyer \nSeligman, Jen Armstrong, Haley Alexander, David Cleary, Allison Martin, \nMackenzie Burt, Lucas DaPieve, Kayla McMurray, and John Rivard.\n  Then I thank the Republican floor staff, who have had to put up with \nus as we have had tried to work through the amendments: Laura Dove, \nRobert Duncan, Megan Mercer, Chris Tuck, Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Tony \nHanagan, Mike Smith, and Katherine Kilroy.\n  I thank the Democratic floor staff as well for working with us and \nmaking this possible.\n  I will make a few remarks about this bill. This bill is almost half \nand half defense and nondefense, about $37.5 billion. It supports \nseveral Federal agencies that do important work, including the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Army Corps of \nEngineers, Bureau of Reclamation, National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, which has to do with our nuclear weapons, and the \nAppalachian Regional Commission.\n  It invests in our waterways. It repairs our locks. It deepens our \nharbors. It puts us one step closer to doubling basic energy research. \nIt helps to resolve the nuclear waste stalemate that our country has \nbeen in for 25 years, finding appropriate places to put used nuclear \nfuel so we can continue to have a strong nuclear power program--which \nproduces 60 percent of all the carbon-free electricity we have in this \ncountry--and it cleans up hazardous materials at Cold War sites.\n  I mentioned earlier that I thought we had done a good job of being \nstewards of the taxpayers' dollars. That is this blue line here. We \nhave kept this under control.\n  For example, Senator Feinstein and I have again recommended--and the \nSenate has agreed--to eliminate funding for a fusion project in France. \nThat saves us $125 million.\n  We worked together to help keep big projects such as the uranium \nfacility at Oak Ridge on time and on budget. We are working with \nSenator Graham, Senator Scott, and Senator McCain to try to take the \nbig MOX facility in South Carolina and see what we can do about the \nhuge expense of what we are doing there. We are being good stewards.\n  The President cut $1.4 billion from the Corps of Engineers. Well, we \nput it back. We set a new record level of funding for the Corps. There \nis no funding line in this budget that more Senators are concerned \nwith.\n  It includes $1.3 billion for the Harbor Maintenance Fund. It is the \nthird consecutive year that we have done that, consistent with the \nrecommendations of our authorizing committees. That deepens harbors in \nGulfport, Charleston, Mobile, Texas harbors, Louisiana harbors, \nAnchorage Harbor, and Savannah Harbor. There is money for the west \ncoast harbors as well.\n  We take a step toward doubling basic energy research. Our top \npriority was the Office of Science, which for the second consecutive \nyear has a record level of funding for an appropriations bill.\n  There is $325 million for ARPA-E, an agency we value because of the \ngood work it does.\n  We support the administration's request to keep the United States at \nthe forefront of supercomputing in the world.\n  As I mentioned, we support nuclear power, especially efforts to find \nplaces to put used nuclear fuel.\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\n  We have again included the pilot program Senator Feinstein authored, \nand which I support, and support for private waste facilities that \ncould also serve that same function.\n  We have money for advanced reactors and for safely extending the \nlength of time nuclear plants can operate, which is the easiest way to \nkeep the largest amount of reliable carbon-free electricity available \nover the next several years.\n  In terms of the National Nuclear Security Administration, we support \nthe warhead life extension programs and the Ohio-class replacement \nsubmarine. We have $575 million for the uranium facility, and $5.4 \nbillion for cleaning up hazardous wastesites left over from the Cold \nWar.\n  I am proud of the bill, but I am even more proud of the process which \nwe have gone through. This has almost been a learning process for the \nSenate. More than half of the Senators have never been through a \nprocess where we take more than one appropriations bill, take it \nthrough committee, consult with every Member of the Senate, bring it on \nthe floor, and give all 100 Members a chance to offer amendments and \nconsider their amendments.\n  We have processed 21 amendments and have adopted 14. Almost any \nSenator who had a contribution to make that they wanted to make to this \nbill has had a chance to do that. There is a great deal included in \nhere that every Senator can be proud of. I suspect that is why on the \nlast vote that we had to cut off debate and move toward final passage, \nthe vote was 97 to 2.\n  I hope we have that same enthusiasm when it comes time in a few \nmoments to have a vote on final passage of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to begin by extending my \ncongratulations to our chairman.\n  You are a distinguished chairman, and it really has been a great \npleasure for me to work with you. I think we have accomplished a task \nwhich hopefully sets an example for other bills that will be shortly \nforthcoming. But, more importantly than anything, it is really the \nintegrity, sincerity, and earnestness with which you go about this job \nof chairing this subcommittee. I am very pleased to be Tonto to your \nLone Ranger. So thank you very much for that.\n  The chairman has been very distinct in his remarks about pointing out \nsome of the major features, but we have one major infrastructure \nprogram in our bill, and that, of course, is the Army Corps of \nEngineers--other than, I should say, the highway bill.\n  That is $1.4 billion over the budget request. I think that is a very \ngood number that should enable more projects that are vital all across \nthis great land to move forward.\n  The second is the Bureau of Reclamation, and that is $163 million \nover the budget request. It includes $100 million for western drought.\n  We have 17 States within the Bureau of Reclamation's jurisdiction. \nWhat is happening with dryness in the western part of the United States \nis really a very serious threat to the economic and social well-being \nof our country. I am very pleased at that mark.\n  All applied energy accounts are funded at levels equal to current-\nyear levels. We have increased funding for cleaning up nuclear sites, \nincluding the WIPP site in New Mexico and the Hanford site in the State \nof Washington. We matched the budget request for nuclear \nnonproliferation. Actually, this includes MOX funding of $270 million.\n  The chairman spent some time on the floor, and I did as well, in \nterms of making the point that what appropriations bills really concern \nis but 15 percent for what is called domestic discretionary and 15 \npercent for military discretionary. Together, they are but 30 percent \nof what the Federal Government expends and outlays each year. The fact \nof the matter is that 63 percent of the money that is spent in a given \nfiscal year--2016--goes for entitlements and mandates: Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, and all the other mandatory \nprograms. They are not actually in the budget.\n  This is the huge spending, and interest on the debt is 6.3 percent. \nThat brings the mandatory spending up to nearly 70 percent of what we \nspend in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal year 2017, it will go up slightly \nfrom there so that the relative amount of spending that these bills \ncontain is very small in comparison to the amount the Federal \nGovernment actually spends.\n  There are a lot of people who think we should do more with \nentitlements and increase that 63 percent of total spending to even \nmore. That is a question that remains to be seen, but how you pay for \nall of that is a totally different and more difficult story.\n  I extend my congratulations to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee on passing this bill. We have not passed a free-standing \nEnergy and Water bill on this floor for 7 years, since 2009, when \nSenators Dorgan and Bob Bennett were chair and ranking member. Not only \nare we passing the bill, but we are passing a good bill.\n  I thank the subcommittee staff for their work. Interestingly enough, \nthe staff had only 12 days from receiving a notional allocation, which \nis how much we can spend, to help us produce a bill and report it for \nsubcommittee consideration.\n  So let me thank Tyler Owens, Meyer Seligman, Adam DeMella, Jennifer \nArmstrong, and on our minority side, Doug Clapp, Chris Hanson, Samantha \nNelson, and Tim Dykstra for their hard work.\n  I would also like to recognize the work done by Senator Alexander's \npersonal office and my own in helping get this bill passed.\n  Frankly, I want to thank the floor staff on both sides of the aisle. \nThey were really helpful and, in addition to that, they were patient \nand willing to provide some guidance. So I thank them as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nhas expired.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3876\n\n  The question is on agreeing to Flake amendment No. 3876.\n  The amendment (No. 3876) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3801, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to reiterate something I \nam sure Senator Feinstein would agree with. First, I thank the majority \nleader for scheduling our bill early. He scheduled it earlier than any \nappropriations bill has been scheduled in the last 40 years. The reason \nI am sure she agrees with that is because she told me that and because \nnot only did the majority leader make this a priority but so did the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid, and all of the Democratic Senators.\n  We worked hard to try to set an example for the Senate for the next \n11 appropriations bills. According to the Congressional Research \nService, this is the earliest the Senate has passed an appropriations \nbill in the last 40 years. More than that, the vote was 90 to 8, which \nis an unusually large bipartisan vote for such a large and complex \nbill. I think that reflects on the fact that more than 80 Senators made \ncontributions to this bill. We processed more than 21 amendments. Our \nexperience is, when Senators have a lot of input into a bill, they are \nmore comfortable with it and more likely to support it.\n  I especially thank not just the leaders but the Republican and the \nDemocratic floor staffs for helping us with this. Passing a bill like \nthis is more of an exercise in human nature sometimes than it is an \nexercise in policy, and they are the essential grease in making that \nhappen. I thank them very much for it.\n  This is the basic constitutional work of the U.S. Senate. Both the \nRepublican and Democratic leaders have gotten us back on track in doing \nthis. I appreciate having the chance to be a part of it. I thank the \nSenators for their cooperation with Senator Feinstein and me as we set \nout to get what I believe is an excellent result for the people of this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2731-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORK OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the American people have been \nfrustrated in recent years with the dysfunction they see in Washington. \nTheir assessment of us has been correct. The biggest symbol of \ndysfunction has been the inability, as the chairman of our Energy and \nWater Development Subcommittee just pointed out, to do the basic work \nof government.\n  There are 12 bills that fund the government, the basic work of \ngovernment. We haven't passed each of those 12 bills since 1994. So \nunder majorities of both parties, we have had at least some degree of \ndysfunction, and in recent years they all get balled up into one great \nbig bill. It looks awful, and that is no way to conduct the affairs of \nthe government.\n  I said that we were going to devote the floor time, which is always \nat a premium in the Senate, to give us a chance to do the work of what \nwe were sent to do, regardless of party. Fortunately, we had Chairman \nAlexander, who is arguably the best--or maybe the second best only to \nthe Senator from Maine--bill manager on our side, take up the first \nbill, and there were some snags along the way. It took a little bit \nlonger than we had hoped, but we have completed it. We have completed \nit at a record early time. We are going to keep on doing this right up \nuntil we break on July 15 to go to the conventions.\n  We are going to give the Senate every opportunity to do the basic \nwork of government this year. Some have said that because it is an \nelection year, we can't do much. I would like to remind everyone that \nwe have had a regularly scheduled election in this country every 2 \nyears since 1788 right on time. I heard some people say we can't do it \nbecause we have an election next year, and others have said we can't do \nwhatever it is because we have an election this year. We have elections \nin this country right on time, and that is not an excuse not to do our \nwork.\n  We will turn to transportation, which is chaired by the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, and military construction, chaired by Senator Kirk. \nWe are going to bind those two together and move them across the floor, \nand then we are going to turn to the National Defense Authorization Act \nand pass that before the Memorial Day break, and then we are going to \nturn to the Defense appropriations bill right after authorization, and \nhopefully we can do that in a record short period of time because all \nof the amendments should have been offered on the authorization bill \nwhich will come right before it.\n  I thank Senator Alexander for his good work and look forward to \nhaving Senator Collins pick up the baton and continuing the great \nprogress we are making.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before the Senator from Tennessee leaves \nthe floor, I, too, wish to commend him for his excellent stewardship of \nthis highly complex appropriations bill and for the cooperative way in \nwhich he worked with the ranking member, Senator Feinstein, and indeed \nall of the Members, not only those on the Appropriations Committee but \nthe entire Senate. Senator Alexander deserves a great deal of credit.\n  I also commend our leader for making it a priority for us to get the \nappropriations work done. Never before in recent years have we started \nthe process so early. The Appropriations Committee has completed its \nhearings, we have marked up several bills, and we are proceeding with \nfloor consideration. This will avoid a situation that I believe all of \nus really abhor, and that is being faced with voting for repeated \ncontinuing resolutions at the end of the fiscal year which lock in last \nyear's priorities and do not reflect this year's priorities, or the \nbills are bundled together into an omnibus bill that is many thousands \nof pages long and does not receive the kind of in-depth debate and \namendments it deserves. I commend the leader of the Senate for making \nthis a priority and for ensuring that we are all doing our job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Arizona be permitted to speak in morning business for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the fall of 2014, an outbreak had the \nworld on edge in West Africa. The Ebola virus had come about, and three \ncountries were being decimated. It was at this time that the director \nof the National Institutes of Health gave an interview where he argued \nthat a vaccine would likely be available if the Congress had enough \nfunding for the agency. He added that the Ebola virus had forced NIH to \ndivert money from other critical research.\n  These are striking charges, especially for an agency that has a \nbudget of $30 billion. So it stands to reason that if underfunding NIH \nwas allowing a crisis such as this, we ought to be appropriating more \nmoney to the agency.\n  We cannot ignore the fact, obviously, that at that time the Nation \nwas $18 trillion in debt and running nearly a half-trillion-dollar \ndeficit. So I began to look into NIH funding and some of the research \nprojects that were being\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nfunded. Here are some of the questions I found researchers were trying \nto find answers to.\n  One of the questions they were trying to find answers to at the NIH, \nand this was part of a taxpayer-funded study or grant, is: Why do some \npeople see Jesus's face on toast? That is right, a taxpayer-funded \nstudy to determine why people see the face of Jesus on toast.\n  Another study that was funded by NIH is: Do drunk birds slur when \nthey sing? That was part of a $5 million NIH grant that found not only \nis the answer yes, but according to NIH standards, there is a binge-\ndrinking bird out there now.\n  They also wanted to answer the question of: What type of music do \nmonkeys and chimpanzees prefer to listen to? I am not sure what is more \nsurprising, the fact that the NIH wanted to study this or that the \nanswer is Metallica.\n  Another thing they wanted to study: Is yawning contagious? I would \nsay anyone who has ever listened to a Senator give a speech knows the \nanswer is yes, but the NIH decided to spend taxpayer money to study it \nanyway.\n  So I began seeing projects being funded by other research arms within \nthe Federal Government, including the National Science Foundation and \nDARPA in the Defense Department. Here are some of the questions those \nagencies are using their multibillion-dollar budgets to try to answer: \nWhere does it hurt to be stung most by a bee? One researcher used part \nof a $1 million NSF grant to sting each part of his body. He came to \nthe conclusion it is most painful on the nostrils or on the lips or on \nother, shall we say, more sensitive areas, although he admitted his \nadviser would not allow him to be stung on the eyeball so we really \ndon't know which body part holds the title of being the most painful.\n  Another thing that was studied by NSF and DARPA is: Who will be \nAmerica's next top model? That is right. Taxpayer money was spent to \ntry to find out who would be America's next top model. Researchers used \ntaxpayer money to scour Twitter and Instagram to develop scientific \nmodels that could forecast success for models in the fashion industry. \nIt turns out that having a strong social media presence helps more than \nmeeting the industry's ``aesthetic standards.'' This is a phenomenon \nthe researchers dubbed the ``Kendall Jenner effect.'' Not surprising \nthere.\n  Another study was: Are chimpanzees better gamers than humans? At \nleast one chimpanzee that was sometimes bribed with candy to keep \nworking was better than humans at gaming. Unfortunately, that \nchimpanzee has since died from complications from diabetes. That study \nwhich found that humans are not above trying to cheat in order to beat \na chimp at a video game was part of a $340,000 grant awarded by NSF and \nNIH.\n  I am not going around here trying to say that NIH, NSF, DARPA, and \nother federally funded research is a waste of money. It is not. To the \ncontrary, I believe federally funded research can do wonderful and \namazing things.\n  In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, the United States faced the \nSoviet Union in a heated space race. President John F. Kennedy stood \nbefore Congress and aimed for the Moon. He said:\n\n       I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the \n     goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon \n     and returning him safely to the earth. No single space \n     project in this period would be more impressive to mankind, \n     or more important for the long-range exploration of space.\n\n  Armed with a clearly defined goal and backed by concentrated research \nfrom the Federal Government, America's best scientists, researchers, \nand engineers got to work. Eight years later, Neil Armstrong and Buzz \nAldrin were walking on the Moon. That is a towering feat that no \ncountry has ever been able to repeat. More than a half century later, \nthat moonshot stands in stark contrast to a massive and disorderly \nconstellation of federally funded science projects floating aimlessly \nin the Federal budget.\n  Projects that ask, for example: Are Republicans or Democrats more \ndisgusted by eating worms? This researcher whom you will see in this \npicture found that the answer is that Republicans are more disgusted. \nThat said, once folks hear that this study was funded with taxpayer \nmoney----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. When folks hear that this study was funded by taxpayer \ndollars, I am sure there will be equal disgust by both Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  Another study was funded to see if one can outrun a dinosaur. The NSF \nand NIH gave taxpayer dollars to enterprising researchers who are not \ndeterred by the fact that dinosaurs are now extinct. They found an \nalligator was close enough. They had to put him on a treadmill to find \nout how fast he could run. They found out what nobody--certainly not \neven the Presiding Officer from Louisiana--would discover; that \nalligators don't like treadmills very much. He wasn't very cooperative, \nbut they went ahead with the study, and found that humans could \nprobably outrun a dinosaur. It is a good thing.\n  ``Are cheerleaders more attractive when they are a part of a squad?'' \nwas another study we funded. This was a NSF taxpayer-funded grant that \nwas actually inspired by the sitcom ``How I met Your Mother.'' They had \nsomething on that show called the cheerleader theory. Researchers found \nthat the answer is, yes, cheerleaders are more attractive as part of a \nsquad than individually. Their tongue-in-cheek research paper \npostulates that ``having a few wingmen or wingwomen may indeed be good \ndating strategy, particularly if their facial features complement, and \naverage out, one's unattractive idiosyncrasies.''\n  That brings us full circle, as the White House has asked Congress to \nappropriate $1.5 billion for emergency spending to tackle the latest \ncrisis, Zika. I believe we do need to find a solution and a vaccine for \nthe Zika virus, but we ought to look hard at the other things that \nthese agencies are spending money on as we talk about more money for \nthese research projects.\n  To that end, I have released ``Twenty Questions: Government Studies \nthat will Leave You Scratching Your Head.'' This is a study--you can \nsee the cover here--the report not only profiles many of the \nquestionable projects I have highlighted today, it seeks to set a path \nto ensure that our money is spent wisely.\n  The report recommends that these agencies set clearly defined \nnational goals and objectives for federally funded research. Following \nthe example set by President Kennedy's moonshot more than a half \ncentury ago, we ought to give the agencies a clear mission.\n  The report also recommends that agencies prioritize billions of \ndollars in existing Federal research funding to best meet the national \ngoals in a manner that strengthens America's scientific leadership. We \nalso need to ensure that these research projects are transparent. So \nwhen funding goes to these research projects, we ought to know how much \nis spent on each individual project, not just the broader grant. We \ndon't know exactly how much money was spent on the cheerleader effect \nbecause we can't--they will not tell us.\n  I have introduced legislation in concert with this report which will \nrequire that the Federal agencies actually tell us how much money is \nspent on these individual projects.\n  It is time Washington sets clear goals for federally funded research \nand we improve transparency measures. I hope we can do so.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2732-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to begin the Senate debate \non the fiscal year 2017 appropriations bill for Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development, and Related Agencies.\n  This bill funds many programs that are essential to the American \npeople. Let me begin by thanking the committee chairman, Senator \nCochran, and the vice chairwoman, Senator Mikulski, for their \nleadership in advancing this bill.\n  I also want to pay a special thank-you and acknowledge the hard work \nand commitment of Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. The two of us have worked together so closely in drafting \nthis bill, and we have worked to incorporate the recommendations of \nmore than 70 Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n  This bill targets limited resources to programs that meet our most \nessential transportation and housing needs. It makes vital investments \nin our Nation's transportation infrastructure, providing $16.9 billion \nfor the Department of Transportation to support much needed upgrades to \nour roads, bridges, seaports, railroads, transit systems, and airports.\n  The bill will also provide $39.2 billion for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development to meet the housing needs of low-income, \ndisabled, and older Americans, to shelter the homeless, and to create \njobs in our communities through economic development programs.\n  I want to underscore for our colleagues that we have met these \nessential needs in a fiscally responsible manner. Our bill is $827 \nmillion below\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\nthe current enacted funding levels, and $2.9 billion below the \nPresident's budget request. We have also ignored gimmicks in the \nPresident's budget request that would shift more than $7 billion in \ntransportation programs from discretionary to mandatory spending.\n  The bill before us is critical to meeting the vast needs of our \nNation's crumbling infrastructure. The TIGER Program is an example of a \nvaluable program that helps do just that. We provide $525 million for \nthis oversubscribed program, which supports not only much needed \ninfrastructure projects but also helps to create jobs and boost \neconomic development in every one of our home States.\n  The need for the TIGER Program is demonstrated by the statistics. \nLast year, 625 applicants from all 50 States and territories requested \nnearly $10 billion in assistance illustrating the need for and the \npopularity of this vital program. To maintain our Nation's airspace and \nensure that it remains the safest in the world, $16.4 billion is \nprovided to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  Funding is increased to continue to modernize the Nation's air \ntraffic control system, support the research and safe integration of \nunmanned aircraft systems into the airspace, and to help improve our \nNation's airport infrastructure.\n  Consistent with the FAST Act, which we passed at the end of last \nyear, $44 billion is made available for the Federal-Aid Highway \nPrograms, including the new freight program and the FASTLANE grant for \ncritical freight and highway projects. I also want to highlight several \nsafety-related provisions included in our bill that will enhance the \nsafety of commercial motor carrier vehicles.\n  Regrettably, the Department of Transportation has continued to delay \nits proposed rule on speed governors which will improve safety on our \nNation's roadways by preventing commercial trucks and busdrivers from \nspeeding. Once again, our bill requires the Department to issue the \nproposed rule expeditiously since the Department has already missed the \ndeadline established in last year's omnibus funding bill by Congress.\n  The growth of autonomous vehicle technologies, or driverless cars, \nhas led the Department to reexamine existing regulations and policies \nthat could affect the safe deployment of these vehicles. Our bill \nprovides additional funding to ensure the safe deployment of autonomous \nvehicles onto our Nation's roadways and to reduce the cyber security \nvulnerabilities in their electronics.\n  The bill also builds on the critical infrastructure investments for \nrail, providing $50 million for railway safety grants to address the \nserious and troubling problem of rail accidents. Additional funding is \nprovided to help address the substantial backlog of rail infrastructure \nneeding repair.\n  For housing programs, this bill provides sufficient funding to renew \nall existing rental assistance for section 8, for public housing, \nelderly, and disabled housing programs. The Appropriations Committee \ncontinues to face constraints that required us to make difficult \ndecisions regarding funding at a time when resources are limited under \nthe 2015 budget agreement.\n  Our priority is to ensure that our Nation's most vulnerable \nindividuals and families do not lose assistance that prevents many of \nthem from being at risk of homelessness. Therefore, the bill provides \nnecessary funding to keep pace with the rising cost of housing to these \nfamilies who might otherwise become homeless.\n  It is important that rental assistance supports those who truly need \nit. However, we are aware of a recent HUD inspector general report that \nfound that more than 25,000 households had incomes in excess of \nqualifying limits. We don't have extra money available to pour into \nhouseholds where the individuals don't meet the eligibility \nrequirements. In response to this finding by the IG, we have included \nlanguage prompting HUD to update its regulations that ensure there is a \nprocess in place to identify and transition such households out of \npublic housing when it is appropriate.\n  The transportation-housing appropriations bill faces challenges \nstemming from these unavoidable increases for rental assistance for \nlow-income families and disabled and elderly individuals. In fact, \nrental assistance alone consumes more than half of our subcommittee's \nallocation and is a shocking 84 percent of HUD's budget. That makes \nfunding other important needs difficult.\n  Nevertheless, Senator Reed and I share a passion about reducing and \nending homelessness. Therefore, we have included $2.33 billion for \nhomeless assistance grants, and we have also managed to make critical \ninvestments to reduce homelessness among our veterans and our youth.\n  To further help homeless young people, we provided $40 million in \ngrants that are targeting this underserved population. Additionally, to \nbetter support youth who are exiting the Foster Care Program, the \nsystem includes $20 million for family unification vouchers and makes \nchanges to this program to improve its effectiveness. I know many \nMembers share our concern that young people who age out of the Foster \nCare Program should have--must have--somewhere safe to go.\n  For our Nation's homeless veterans, the bill provides $57 million, \nincluding $7 million to serve our Native American veterans living on \ntribal lands. Despite the administration once again this year proposing \nto eliminate this program, the subcommittee continues to provide \nfunding, recognizing that while we are making progress--veterans \nhomelessness has decreased by 36 percent since the year 2010--we have \nyet to reach the goal of ending homelessness among our veterans. As the \npercentage of homeless veterans continues to decrease, less funding \nwill be needed.\n  Senator Reed played an absolutely essential role in another important \nissue that we address in this bill; that is, the presence of lead paint \nin homes, which is of particular concern to families with children \nunder the age of 6. Our bill requires HUD to expeditiously complete its \nrulemaking to update its lead standards based on the most current CDC \nguidelines, an action Senator Reed and I requested in a February letter \nto the HUD Secretary.\n  While this bill helps families in need, it also recognizes the \nhardships local communities are facing. Boosting local economies is \ncritical to job creation and helping families obtain financial \nsecurity. Thus, our bill supports local development efforts by \nproviding $3 billion through the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram and $950 million through the HOME Program.\n  These programs support the development of affordable housing and \nother infrastructure projects, which again promote economic development \nand lead to job creation in ways that allow local communities to tailor \nthe programs to meet their specific needs.\n  The bill before us does not solve every problem facing our \ntransportation system or our housing program. We simply don't have the \nmoney to do that, even if we had a higher allocation in this era of \nvery high debt. This is a fiscally responsible bill, and it is a bill \nthat sets and reflects important priorities. I very much appreciate the \nopportunity to present this legislation to the Chamber as we begin the \ndebate on the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the careful balance struck by the \ncompromises and the negotiations our committee worked so hard to \nachieve. Again, I thank the ranking member for being such an \nextraordinary partner as we sought to write this very important bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Collins in support of \nthe fiscal year 2017 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nAppropriations bill. I want to join her in commending Chairman Cochran \nand Vice Chairwoman Mikulski for their great work, but I particularly \nwant to commend Chairman Collins for her extraordinary work, her \nthoughtfulness, and her diligence. All those aspects are evidenced in \nthis bill.\n  She has, once again, developed a balanced and thoughtful bill that \nincludes priorities for Members on both sides of the aisle. This bill \nallows for our Nation to continue moving forward by investing in \ncritical transportation and housing initiatives, and, suffice it to \nsay, without her leadership, we would not be here today with a bill \nthat not\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\nonly merits our attention, but also merits our support.\n  This bill includes policies and funding that will grow our economy, \nimprove the safety of our national transportation system, create jobs, \nand preserve affordable housing for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  Working within a tight allocation, this bill makes important \ncontributions to the development and safety of our national \ntransportation system. For example, the bill provides $16.4 billion to \nfully fund the needs of the Federal Aviation Administration, including \n$1 billion for NextGen modernization activities, which will bring our \naviation system to a new level of performance and safety.\n  This funding level also fully accommodates the needs of contract \ntowers and Essential Air Service, and provides for new safety staff and \npay for air traffic controllers.\n  The very popular TIGER Program, which the Chairman mentioned, is \nfunded at $525 million. That is a $25 million increase from last year. \nTIGER grants allow State and local governments to make transformative \ninvestments in their transportation infrastructure that traditional \nformula grant programs are not able to address.\n  The fiscal year 2016 grant competition just ended 2 weeks ago for \nTIGER grants, and the Department of Transportation reports that they \nhave received over 600 grant applications, totaling nearly $100 billion \nin requests. This money is extraordinarily important to localities, and \nwe have just barely increased it. Without the Chairman's leadership, \nhowever, I don't think that we would have made that increase. Again, I \nthank her.\n  There is high demand for this program that is evidenced by these \napplications. That goes to underscore a point that the Chairman has \nmade about the need for even more significant investment in \ninfrastructure.\n  This legislation also provides a boost to essential transit programs \nthroughout the country, in order to sustain and expand their services.\n  This bill provides $2.3 billion for the Federal Transit \nAdministration's Capital Investment Grant program to help meet growing \ndemand across the country.\n  This bill also continues investment in the Washington Metrorail \nsystem, while holding the system accountable for improved financial \nmanagement and ensuring that the FTA has the needed resources for \nstrong safety oversight.\n  Indeed, the bill before us maintains a key focus on safety across all \nmodes of transportation. For example, the bill fulfills the promises of \nthe FAST Act through a $199 million investment in Positive Train \nControl grants in order to protect passengers and workers on commuter \nand interstate rail lines with the next generation of railroad safety \ntechnology.\n  The bill funds new research at the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration on the safety and cybersecurity of autonomous vehicles. \nAs autonomous vehicles are integrated into the general driving \npopulation, there is the potential to save thousands of lives with this \ninnovative technology. However, an appropriate safety framework must be \nin place to realize the benefits of this promising transportation \nrevolution.\n  In addition, the bill continues ongoing crude-by-rail safety \ninitiatives at both the Federal Railroad Administration and the \nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. These \ninitiatives will work to ensure the safe transportation of crude oil \nand crude products across the country.\n  The bill also provides $85 million for rail grant programs that were \nrecently-authorized by the FAST Act. These grants can be used for rail \nsafety and state-of-good-repair projects, such as Positive Train \nControl implementation and grade-crossing improvements.\n  For Amtrak, the bill provides $1.4 billion. In response to the FAST \nAct, the THUD appropriations bill now allows the revenue generated on \nthe Northeast Corridor to remain there. Again, this is consistent with \nthe FAST Act.\n  This investment will fully fund the Northeast Corridor and the \nNational Network, while putting Amtrak in a better position to address \nthe $28 billion state-of-good-repair backlog.\n  I am also proud of what we were able to accomplish together for our \nNation's housing programs. The bill preserves HUD's rental assistance \nprograms, expands housing for youth and families experiencing \nhomelessness, and increases lead-based paint remediation programs. \nThese programs are vital to our Nation's safety net and also to the \nprosperity of local economies.\n  I wish to speak briefly about how this bill increases protections for \nchildren against lead-based paint hazards. The bill--and the Chairman \nhas discussed this--directs HUD to align its blood lead level \nregulations with the level recommended by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention. This is a significant change that will help \nyoung children.\n  If you just look at my home State of Rhode Island, 935 children will \nenter kindergarten this year exceeding the CDC standard for lead \npoisoning, but under the HUD standard, only 32 of those children would \nexceed the blood lead level standard. Now, when this regulation is \nimplemented, there will be 900 children who not only are properly \nidentified, but also, we hope, will have access to remediation in their \nhomes, so that they will not be further affected by lead exposure.\n  To help mitigate the threat of lead in the home, the bill provides \n$25 million in new resources for public housing agencies to address \nlead-based paint hazards in public housing units in response to this \nnew health standard. We are really trying to synchronize best practices \nwith practical systems that will make a huge difference in the lives of \nchildren.\n  There is also $135 million for lead-hazard reduction grants, $25 \nmillion more than in 2016. This increased spending will support lead-\nbased paint reductions in over 1,750 additional units.\n  The bill increases support for the training of maintenance staff at \npublic housing agencies to ensure that lead-based paint hazards are \nidentified and properly managed.\n  Finally, it encourages HUD to increase tenant awareness of lead-based \npaint hazards in the home to help ensure that families are able to \naddress hazards before damage is done. These are immediate, cost-\neffective changes that will improve the lives of children living in \nlow-income housing.\n  Preventing lead poisoning is an issue that I have long worked on. I \nam so pleased to see the steps and strides that we are taking in this \nbill.\n  The bill also provides funding for other critical HUD programs, \nincluding $40 million for new interventions targeting homeless youth, \n6,000 new vouchers for homeless veterans through the HUD-VASH Program, \nhousing and supportive care for 2,500 young people aging out of the \nfoster care system, and services to help families and young people get \njobs and increase their earnings.\n  Again, I thank Senator Collins for her tremendous work, her \nleadership, and her unstinting commitment to making sure that these \nresources are directed appropriately and properly.\n  We always wish that we could do more, but this bill provides a \nworkable balance of resources for transportation and housing programs. \nThe bill responds to the priorities of the Members of this Chamber. It \nmakes wise investments that will benefit our Nation, not only in the \npresent, but also in the future.\n  In that regard, I must once again return to the issue of lead \nexposure to children in their homes. This is something that has a \nlifetime effect on children. I do not have the expertise of the \nPresiding Officer when it comes to these issues, but childhood exposure \ncan have incredible lifetime cognitive impacts on a child and can have \nhuge costs to society. The steps that we are taking are going to help \nthose lifetime costs be reduced.\n  I again thank the Chairman, Senator Collins. I appreciate her \nleadership, her willingness, and her extraordinary effort.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, we are bringing up the MILCON-VA \nappropriations bill today, and I urge its adoption.\n  This year the MILCON-VA bill was the first appropriations bill. We \nmarked up 5 weeks earlier than last year, and the bill is on the floor \n6 months earlier than before. We are in a very advantageous position of \ntelling the House to do their work, which\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nnever happens with regard to the Senate. We are very proud of that.\n  We are so proud that we have crafted this bill in an open and \ncollegial way with the full support of my ranking Democratic member, \nSenator Jon Tester of Montana. This bipartisan bill was adopted \nunanimously by a vote of 30 to 0 in the full Appropriations Committee.\n  In MILCON, the bill provides $7.9 billion for over 200 critical \ndefense construction projects. It adds $515 million to MILCON to ensure \nthat our military is ready to fight and win. There are no OCO gimmicks \nin the bill. My top priority in this legislation is missile defense in \nEurope.\n  Last year, the bill funded the Aegis Ashore BMD site in Poland. We \nhave built on that in this year's bill. This bill funds the Long Range \nDiscrimination Radar, or LRDR, in Clear, AK, at $155 million.\n  For Veterans Affairs and related agencies, our bill provides $75.1 \nbillion to protect our veterans. This is record-high funding in this \nlegislation, this bipartisan bill. The budget is up $3.4 billion, or \n4.8 percent, over this year, reflecting the higher medical costs in the \neconomy.\n  The VA must now be reformed. We must work much better for veterans \nnow. This bill includes strong oversight provisions for the VA to \nprotect the protectors of our veterans. By that, I mean the \nwhistleblowers. In this legislation is my VA Patient Protection Act of \n2016, which protects whistleblowers and makes sure that doctors, \nnurses, and other medical care professionals are able to have the full \nwhistleblower protections they deserve. This bill provides strong \nwhistleblower protections and punishment for those who retaliate \nagainst whistleblowers.\n  A number of opioid safety provisions are included, such as no \ncopayments for opioid antagonists, like Narcan, which can save a life \nrapidly.\n  The bill includes a provision that will screen medical providers to \nmake sure the VA refrains from transferring bad doctors from one \nhospital in one State to another. The bill adds 100 staff to the VA \nOffice of Inspector General, which is very important.\n  We continue to insist that the VA develop a fully interoperable \nelectronic medical health record with DOD, using open source code. My \nvision here is to make sure we use open source code for VA medical \nrecords and DOD, to make sure that core of 25 million patients is \nprotected, with no net burden on the soldiers when they are leaving \nactive duty. The entire record goes over, so we have complete \ncontinuity of care.\n  By having open source coding, we repeat the success of the Motorola \nAndroid system, which happened in my State, where 70,000 apps were \nwritten just with that code. I want to make sure the electronic medical \nrecord industry is always located in the United States, based on this \nstandard.\n  The bill adds $8.7 million to fix the Veterans Crisis Line that we \nfund. Now the veterans suicide hotline will never go unanswered. It \nalso adds $20 million for gender-specific health care for female \nveterans. The bill adds $30 million to combat veteran homelessness; we \nhave received a request on this issue from over 25 Senators. The bill \nadds $12 million for important medical receipts for vets--like genomic \nresearch. In committee, we adopted an amendment that I supported by a \nvote of 23 to 7 to allow the VA to treat veterans and their spouses \nwith in vitro fertilization for service-connected problems.\n  This is a strong bill. It is a very strong bill, and it does right by \nour troops and especially our veterans.\n  My Senate colleagues should pass this measure quite quickly, just as \nthey did in the full committee.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, over two decades ago, Congress passed a law \non an overwhelming bipartisan basis to provide a standard way of doing \nbusiness for motor carriers nationwide. This preemption provision \nresulted in increased efficiencies that led to lower transportation \ncosts and improved services, which have benefitted shippers and \nconsumers throughout the country.\n  For two decades, this intent of Congress was adhered to for those \ninvolved in interstate commerce, and even upheld by the Supreme Court. \nUnfortunately, a recent Ninth Circuit Court decision has brought \nconfusion to what had been the clear intent of Congress, and in my home \nState of Kansas, numerous trucking companies and drivers have become \nvictims of these unintended consequences.\n  As the Senate begins consideration of the Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development, THUD, Appropriations bill, the issue of trucking \npreemption laws may be debated once again. Due to escalating rhetoric \nand increasingly pointed statements regarding this issue, I sought the \nobjective, authoritative policy expertise of the Congressional Research \nService, CRS, to answer one-by-one many of the claims being made.\n  As the debate on THUD appropriations moves forward, I would encourage \nany of my colleagues interested in the trucking preemption debate to \nconsult this CRS analysis and judge for themselves the merits of this \nimportant issue. I think they will find many of the claims made in \nopposition are exaggerations, if not outright falsehoods, and that the \noriginal intent of Congress on this matter was and continues to be \ncritical for preventing unnecessary burdens on an industry that hauls \nour Nation's freight and is vital to our economic well-being.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the CRS memo \nprovided to me with its thoughtful and informative answers.\n  Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                                    April 6, 2016.\n\n                               MEMORANDUM\n\n     To: Hon. Jerry Moran.\n     From: Rodney Perry.\n     Subject: Implications of Section 611 of the Proposed Aviation \n         Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization Act of 2016.\n\n       This memorandum provides responses to your questions \n     concerning California law and the implications of Section 611 \n     of the proposed Aviation Innovation, Reform, and \n     Reauthorization Act of 2016 (Section 611).\n       Section 611 contains two primary provisions. The first \n     provision would expressly preempt state laws that prohibit \n     employees whose hours of service are subject to regulation by \n     the Department of Transportation (DOT) under 49 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 31502 from working ``to the full extent permitted or at \n     such times as permitted under [49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502].'' It \n     would also preempt any state laws that ``impos[e] any \n     additional obligations on motor carriers if such employees \n     work to the full extent or at such times as permitted'' by \n     DOT regulations issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502, \n     which permits DOT to prescribe requirements for the \n     qualifications and maximum hours of service of motor carrier \n     employees.\n       The second provision of Section 611 would expressly preempt \n     any state laws that require payment of ``separate or \n     additional compensation'' by a motor carrier that compensates \n     employees on a piece-rate basis, so long as the total sums \n     paid to an employee, when divided by the employee's total \n     number of hours worked during the corresponding work period, \n     equals or exceeds the applicable minimum wage for that state.\n       You specifically asked for responses to the following \n     questions:\n       1. Although the meal period must be paid if the employee is \n     on-duty or required to remain on the premises, doesn't \n     California law permit an on-duty meal period only if there is \n     a written agreement between the parties that can be revoked \n     at any time? Absent such agreement, isn't the default \n     obligation to provide an off-duty meal period? Does the \n     employer have to pay for an off-duty meal period?\n       Under California law, unless an employee is relieved of all \n     duty during a meal period, the meal period is considered an \n     ``on duty'' meal period that counts toward hours worked, and \n     is thus compensable. On duty meal periods are only permitted \n     when: (1) the nature of the work prevents an employee from \n     being relieved of all duty; and (2) there is a written \n     agreement between the employer and employee for on duty meal \n     periods. Such a written agreement must state that the \n     employee can, in writing, revoke the agreement at any time. \n     Absent such an agreement, any meal periods provided as \n     required by law are off duty. Off duty meal periods do not \n     count toward time worked (i.e., they are unpaid).\n       2. Does anything in Sec. 611 mandate that motor carriers \n     utilize piece-rate pay systems?\n       Under Section 611, if a motor carrier compensates an \n     employee on a piece-rate basis, it is not required to provide \n     any additional compensation so long as the sum of the piece-\n     rate compensation, when divided by the total number of hours \n     worked during the corresponding pay period, equals or exceeds \n     the applicable minimum wage. This does not appear to require \n     motor carriers to pay their employees on piece-rate bases. \n     Rather, it seemingly prevents an employer that chooses to pay \n     its employees on a piece-rate basis from having to provide \n     additional compensation in specified circumstances.\n       3. Is an employer, paying an employee on a piece-rate \n     basis, in compliance with federal\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\n     minimum wage laws if the sum paid to the employee, when \n     divided by the total number of hours worked, meets or exceeds \n     the applicable minimum hourly wage rate?\n       This appears to be correct. Courts have generally held that \n     an employer meets federal minimum wage requirements if the \n     total weekly wage paid is equal to or greater than the number \n     of hours worked in the week multiplied by the statutory \n     minimum rate.\n       4. Would a motor carrier employee loading a truck have to \n     be compensated for that time as hours worked under federal \n     law? Does anything in Sec. 611 alter the conclusion?\n       Pursuant to the federal minimum wage requirements, covered \n     employers must pay employees the applicable minimum wage for \n     all compensable hours worked. The Supreme Court has held that \n     activities that are an ``integral and indispensable part of \n     the principal activities for which covered workmen are \n     employed'' are compensable. At least one federal appellate \n     court has found that loading a truck is an integral and \n     indispensable part of the principal activity for which a \n     truck driver is employed (driving a truck), and thus is \n     compensable. Section 611, by its terms, specifies \n     circumstances wherein state laws, regulations, or ``other \n     provision[s] having the force and effect of law'' are \n     preempted by federal law. As such, it does not appear that \n     section 611 would alter the determination of whether time \n     spent loading a truck is compensable under federal law.\n       5. Under California law, would a motor carrier have to pay \n     a driver for the mandated 10-minute rest break? If a driver \n     were to take a rest break or any other type of break of 10 \n     minutes, would a motor carrier have to pay the driver for \n     that time under federal law? If Sec. 611 were enacted, would \n     the requirement under federal law still apply?\n       Under California law, motor carriers are required to \n     provide employees with paid 10-minute rest breaks for every \n     four hours worked. Under federal law, employer-provided \n     breaks that are between 5 and 20 minutes in duration are \n     generally compensable. Section 611, by its terms, specifies \n     circumstances wherein state laws, regulations, or ``other \n     provision[s] having the force and effect of law'' are \n     preempted by federal law. As such, it does not appear as \n     though section 611 would alter the determination of whether a \n     10-minute break is compensable under federal law.\n       6. Does California Labor Code Sec. 226.2 apply to \n     independent contractors or only to employees?\n       By its terms, California Labor Code Sec. 226.2 (Section \n     226.2) applies to ``employees.'' Given the time constraints \n     required to respond to your request, and the methodology used \n     to search for relevant cases, CRS could find no case law \n     interpreting Section 226.2 that discusses its potential \n     applicability to independent contractors.\n       7. Would Section 611 preempt state meal and rest break \n     laws, like California's, as applied to motor carriers?\n       Section 611 would preempt any state laws that prohibit \n     employees whose hours of service are regulated by the \n     Department of Transportation (DOT) under 49 U.S.C. 31502 \n     ``from working to the full extent permitted or at such times \n     as permitted under [49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502].'' Section 611 \n     would also preempt any state laws that ``impos[e] any \n     additional obligations on motor carriers if such employees \n     work to the full extent or at such times as permitted'' by \n     DOT regulations issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502, \n     which permits DOT to prescribe requirements for the \n     qualifications and maximum hours of service of motor carrier \n     employees. Thus, any state meal or break laws that impose \n     more stringent requirements on motor carriers than DOT's meal \n     or break regulations for motor carriers, found at 49 C.F.R. \n     Part 395, would seem to be preempted by Section 611. This \n     interpretation of the legislative language would appear to be \n     consistent with the legislative intent behind Section 611.\n\n  Mr. KIRK.

Mr. President, I am here to talk about two separate topics \ntoday. The first is the Zika virus. I am encouraged that in the last 24 \nhours, we finally seem to have found some action here in Congress in \ndealing with the Zika virus. We not only have one, we have three \nseparate proposals that will be introduced to deal with Zika. We will \ncontinue to work on and debate these proposals next week.\n  About 5 weeks ago, I met with Federal, State, and local health \nofficials in Miami and came out in support of the President's emergency \nfunding request to deal with Zika. Since then, I have come before the \nSenate on numerous occasions to call for action. I have stated my \nbelief that there shouldn't be anything divisive with this. Zika is a \npublic health emergency that sooner or later will impact the vast \nmajority of the United States because this is a virus transmitted by \nmosquitoes that are only going to become more prevalent as the weather \nheats up and because our people routinely travel to and from the island \nof Puerto Rico, the most impacted community in the entire United \nStates.\n  When I spoke here yesterday, the count of people infected in Florida \nstood at 109. Since then, just 24 hours later, it has become 112. One-\nhundred and twelve Zika cases is the most of any State in the Union. Of \nthe three new cases in Florida, two were in Volusia County and one was \nin Orange County.\n  I have said repeatedly that Congress should not allow politics to \ndelay action on Zika. One issue we have been encountering is the desire \nto offset the spending. I made it clear that if we can offset the \nspending and find the money somewhere else in the budget to pay for \nwhat it is going to cost to deal with Zika, we should do it, but that \nin times of public health emergencies, just like natural disasters, we \nshouldn't delay acting while we figure out and try to agree on what we \nare going to cut from other parts of the budget.\n  Another issue we have encountered is whether we do this through the \nnormal process that is going on or fund it as an emergency spending \nbill. Again, I am open to either one of those approaches. But back in \nthe real world, people infected by this and their families, who have \nalready been impacted by this, don't have the time for us to figure all \nof this out; they just believe, as I do, that we need to get going here \nand get something done.\n  I have said that we should deal with this issue fully and that the \n$1.9 billion requested so far may not even be enough when it is all \nsaid and done. But I believe there is no one here who wants to get \ncaught in a situation where it is August and people are back in their \nStates, maybe even campaigning for reelection, and have to scramble \nback here in the middle of the summer to come up with solutions when it \ngets hotter and there are more mosquitos and when the conditions are \nripe for more people to be impacted by Zika.\n  I commend Senator Nelson, my colleague from Florida. I especially \ncommend Senators Murray from Washington and Blunt from Missouri and \nothers who are taking this seriously and trying to come up with a \nsolution and a way forward.\n  This is indeed a devastating disease. It has taken lives throughout \nour hemisphere, and the way it impacts unborn children alone should \ncall us to action. Let's deal with this now, and let's protect our \npeople. There is no reason that every proposal to address Zika cannot \nbe bipartisan and earn broad support.\n  I am hopeful that we can reach a final outcome that fully addresses \nthe problem. I am hopeful we will see some meaningful action on the \nZika public health emergency very soon, including the American citizens \nin Puerto Rico who have been most impacted so far, and that is one of \nthe reasons I plan to introduce--along with my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Nelson--an amendment to provide the full $1.9 billion request \nto fight the Zika virus. The strain on Puerto Rico's health system from \nZika must be addressed, and this is the only proposal so far that tries \nto fully deal with the unique challenges Puerto Rico faces with the \nZika virus.\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\n  I think it is important to remind people who are asking themselves \n``Why should we care about Puerto Rico?''--I will remind them that 4 \nmillion U.S. citizens live there, that the first American to lose their \nlife to Zika lived in Puerto Rico, and that Puerto Ricans routinely \ntravel to the continental United States--to Florida and New York \nespecially. These 4 million Puerto Rican citizens have no voice here in \nthe Senate, so I will make sure they are not forgotten as we work on \nsolutions to this virus that has disproportionately impacted these \nAmericans.\n  When we return next week to continue debating appropriations bills, I \nhope we can come together on this issue. I hope we can find a way \nforward that deals with these issues fully and that helps to stop this \ndisease in its tracks and that saves lives.\n  I urge my colleagues here in the Senate, and the House as well, to \nlook at the proposal Senator Nelson and I will introduce and offer \ntheir input and ultimately sign on and get this passed. As we know, it \nis not going to be enough to see progress here in the Senate; we need \nthe House to act as well, and I hope we can start doing that next week. \nWe need to act. Zika is taking lives, it is hurting unborn children, \nand this problem is only going to get worse as we move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2738-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EUREKA GARDENS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, tomorrow I will be visiting the Eureka \nGarden Apartments in Jacksonville, FL, which is a Section 8 apartment \ncomplex that is supposed to provide affordable and safe living \nconditions for low-income members of the Jacksonville community, but it \ndoesn't. Instead, its tenants have been subjected to dangerous, often \ndownright disgusting living conditions for years. They raised their \nconcerns repeatedly with the managers of the facility and local \nofficials, only to be met for the most part with bureaucratic \nindifference.\n  My staff and I have been working on this since it first came to light \nlast fall, but there has been a frustrating, disturbing lack of \nprogress from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and, more \nimportantly, from the owner of the complex.\n  Frankly, I have had enough. I am heading down there tomorrow to see \nwhat we have to do and whom we need to put pressure on to get things \nmoving. I will be touring the facility and meeting with Tracy Grant, \nwho is the president of the tenants association. I will be joined by \nCouncilman Garrett Dennis, Jacksonville Mayor Len Curry, and Pastor \nMark Griffin of Wayman Ministries, who will be meeting with residents. \nI intend to commend the residents tomorrow for how united and resilient \nthey have been throughout this ordeal, even while the Federal \nGovernment failed them.\n  For years the Department of Housing and Urban Development has \ncertified this facility and as a result has put hundreds of families at \nrisk. When HUD inspected the property last summer, they passed the \ncomplex with a score of 85 out of 100. Less than a month later, \nresidents were complaining about how bad their living conditions were.\n  When my staff visited the complex, it was nearly unlivable. They saw \ncrumbling stairs, black mold, and exposed electrical wiring that had \nbeen covered up by a trash bag. They smelled the natural gas that would \nsoon hospitalize residents days later. This was and is unacceptable.\n  For months, my office, along with Mayor Curry, the city council, and \nthe tenants association, pushed to have improvements and repairs done \nto this complex. In February, HUD finally had a date by which all \nrepairs must be completed. When the time came to reinspect Eureka \nGardens, it passed inspection, and they eventually renewed their \ncontract with the property's owner, but the residents continued to say \nwhat they had said all along: HUD's inspections aren't working.\n  Just recently, HUD revealed that Eureka Gardens passed with a score \nof 62. The passing score is a 60. However, a senior HUD official \nadmitted that HUD officials do not believe the property would currently \npass another inspection. HUD essentially admitted that it had certified \na failing facility. Something is clearly wrong with the inspection \nprocess, and Floridians are being hurt because of it.\n  I will be down there tomorrow to find out how we can put an end to \nthis problem once and for all. The residents of Eureka Gardens cannot \nbe forced to suffer under mismanagement and apathy any longer. Children \ncannot continue to be put at risk due to gas leaks and other hazardous \nconditions. HUD cannot be allowed to continue to rubberstamp approval \nof failing housing complexes, only to further slum-like conditions for \nthe most vulnerable tenants.\n  I will continue to look for solutions to help make sure the \nconditions in Eureka Gardens are fixed and aren't repeated anywhere \nelse. If we determine that congressional action is necessary, then I am \nprepared to take it.

Mr. President, I wish to open my remarks with a \ncongratulations to the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery \nInitiative based in Gloucester, MA.\n  Since it began less than 11 months ago, this program is now \npartnering with more than 100 police departments in 24 States around \nthe country to help people with opioid addiction to get the treatment \nthey need. The program's approach is simple, but it is also \nrevolutionary: having law enforcement work with those suffering from \nthe disease of addiction by removing the stigma surrounding it and \nplacing them into treatment instead of behind bars.\n  I thank the founders of this program--Gloucester police chief Leonard \nCampanello and John Rosenthal--for their leadership and compassion, and \nI urge everyone to learn more about this national model for combating \nthe opioid crisis.\n  It is that crisis that I am here to talk about this afternoon. Today, \nI wish to call attention to a serious issue facing Massachusetts and \nsoon to face every single community in the United States of America. \nIllicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times stronger than \nheroin. Let me say that again. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than \nheroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. It is responsible for \nthe largest increase in drug overdose deaths in recent years.\n  More than 700 deaths in the United States were attributable to \nfentanyl and its components between 2013 and 2014. In Massachusetts \nalone, 336 people died from fentanyl-related overdoses between 2014 and \n2015. More recently, among the 1,319 opioid-related deaths in the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts in 2015 for which a blood test was \navailable, more than half--754--tested positive for fentanyl. That is \nan astounding number for one State. That is an astounding increase in \nthe impact that fentanyl is having in deaths in the State of \nMassachusetts.\n  But it is not just isolated to Massachusetts, because fentanyl is the \nGodzilla of opioids, and it will overrun communities and lay them to \nwaste unless we take action now to stop it.\n  For those who may not know about this new scourge, Mexico and China \nare the primary foreign sources for illicit fentanyl, for the chemicals \nand building blocks from which it is made, and for other illicit \nsubstances very similar to fentanyl--called fentanyl analogs--and which \nare trafficked into the United States from outside of our borders. \nFentanyl powder is often mixed with other illicit drugs like heroin or \nis disguised in pill form to resemble an opioid painkiller like \nOxyContin.\n  Many drug users overdose on fentanyl because they have no idea that \nit is mixed into whatever substance they are injecting or whatever \npills they are swallowing, and they do not realize just how deadly it \nis until it is too late.\n  But capturing a total and accurate number of drug overdoses caused by \nfentanyl has been very challenging.\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\nCoroners and medical examiners do not usually test for the drug unless \nthey are asked to, and they are often unaware that an overdose has a \nfentanyl link when an individual tests positive for a different \nsubstance such as heroin.\n  Even more troubling, the men and the women who first respond to the \nscene of an overdose may not know how to identify fentanyl or how to \nhandle the drug. This makes local and State first responders very \nvulnerable to the drug's harmful effects, because if the fentanyl \npowder is absorbed into the skin or accidentally inhaled, it can be \ndeadly. In fact, a dose of just three salt-sized grains of fentanyl can \nbe lethal.\n  So think about that. You are a first responder. You are going into a \nhome or a business thinking that you are responding to an opioid \noverdose situation when, in fact, you might be exposing yourself to the \nfentanyl in the air or to something which gets on your skin. That is \nhow deadly this new substance is that is creating this epidemic across \nour country.\n  Recently, DEA agents in Seattle raided a suspected fentanyl lab \nwearing HAZMAT suits and protective gear to make sure they did not \ninadvertently breathe in or touch the fentanyl. The DEA has told me \nthat they sometimes cannot use dogs to sniff packages coming in from \noverseas suspected of containing fentanyl because these drug-detection \ndogs may die if they even inhale it.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration is so concerned about this \nsynthetic opioid that in March of 2015 it issued a nationwide alert \nhighlighting fentanyl as a threat to health and public safety.\n  Fentanyl is a very real problem in my home State of Massachusetts. \nLawrence, MA, which is about half an hour north of Boston, is a hotspot \nfor fentanyl trafficking. From Lawrence, the drug ends up being \nprocessed and sold all over New England.\n  There are efforts already in place to address the spread of fentanyl. \nMexico and China are its primary foreign sources and have been the \nfocus of diplomatic efforts to curb fentanyl trafficking. We need to \nmake sure that those countries are living up to their promises to \ncombat the flow of this deadly drug and other synthetic opioids into \nthe United States.\n  We know naloxone, sometimes called Narcan, is an effective antidote \nagainst an opioid overdose. But a single dose of naloxone is typically \nnot enough to combat an overdose that includes fentanyl.\n  That is why earlier today I called on the Department of Health and \nHuman Services and the Department of State to outline our domestic and \ninternational strategy against the trafficking of illicit fentanyl into \nAmerica. As we await their responses, I know there are several critical \nsteps that we must take in order to save lives.\n  We must educate the public about the existence of illicit fentanyl \nand the harm it can do.\n  We must educate first responders--our firefighters, our EMTs, our \nsheriffs, our health care workers--so that they can protect against \ninjury to themselves as they are trying to identify a fentanyl overdose \nand so that they can protect themselves from the harmful effects of \nthat drug.\n  Identifying a fentanyl overdose could mean the difference between \nadministering multiple lifesaving doses of naloxone or death.\n  We should invest in programs that ensure that naloxone--Narcan--is \nreadily available and accessible to those most likely to witness an \noverdose. We need to make sure that there are no shortages or \nunnecessary price increases for this lifesaving treatment.\n  We should issue guidance to States regarding the protocol for \nfentanyl testing in order to obtain a more accurate picture of \nfentanyl's deadly impact.\n  Illicit fentanyl is different from other opioids. It is difficult to \ndetect and has deadly consequences for those who unknowingly come \nwithin its path. We cannot let another day pass without taking the \nnecessary steps to educate our communities about fentanyl, to develop a \nnational strategy, and to collaborate with our international partners--\nthe Mexicans and the Chinese, especially--so that we can keep this \nillicit drug out of the cities and towns all over our country.\n  American lives depend on a solution to the latest opioid crisis. It \nis going to be something that people look back at and say: How can \nsomething have been worse than the heroin epidemic? How can something \nhave caused more deaths than the heroin epidemic? That is where \nfentanyl is already in the State of Massachusetts. It is something that \nis going to come to each and every State in our country.\n  We have to take action now. We have to ensure that we protect our \nborders from it entering, but then we have to make sure that we give \nthe proper training and protections and put them in place for every \nState and every city and town to be able to protect against this \ninfecting our communities.\n  So I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to address the \nChamber today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the epidemic of gun \nviolence that continues to plague our Nation.\n  Every year, around 32,000 Americans are killed by guns. According to \nrecent Centers for Disease Control statistics, every day, on average, \n297 Americans are shot, and 91 of those shootings are fatal. \nCommunities across the Nation are affected by this violence, and no \ncommunity has suffered more than the city of Chicago in my home State \nof Illinois.\n  From the start of the year through May 10, at least 1,242 people were \nshot in Chicago. During the same period, there were at least 215 \nmurders in Chicago, the vast majority committed with guns. The level of \nviolence in Chicago is significantly higher than in recent years. And \nmore people have been shot in Chicago this year than in New York City \nand Los Angeles combined. It is devastating.\n  I met 2 weeks ago with the top Federal law enforcement officials in \nChicago: U.S. Attorney Zach Fardon, U.S. Marshal Ed Gilmore, and \nleaders from the FBI, ATF, and DEA. They reaffirmed their commitment to \ndo all they can at the Federal level to bring down this high level of \ngun violence in the city. They are committed to working with the \nChicago Police Department and its new superintendent, Eddie Johnson, to \nensure that Chicago's residents are both protected and respected by law \nenforcement.\n  There is much work that needs to be done to improve community \npolicing in Chicago to better safeguard the public's safety. I am \nconfident that the Justice Department's ongoing review of the CPD will \nlead to important reforms that will build trust between officers and \nthe communities they serve. We have seen Justice Department reviews in \nother cities produce dramatic improvements. When communities and cops \nare working together with a relationship of trust and respect, it makes \nit harder for criminals to operate.\n  I also want to commend the many community leaders, faith leaders, \nteachers, volunteers, and family members who are working to provide \nChicago's children with a better path, away from the violence. I met \nrecently with students at John Hope College Prep in Englewood on the \nSouth Side of Chicago, along with City Year volunteers who worked with \nthem. It was inspiring to hear how these high school freshmen and \nsophomores talked about their work with their City Year mentors. One \nstudent told me ``the thing I love most about City Year is that they \nnever let you give up.'' With the help of their mentors, these students \nare doing well in school, steering clear of the gangs, and planning for \na bright future.\n  It is so important that we nurture these kinds of efforts throughout \nChicago. We have to give the younger generation the opportunities and \nhope that will lead them away from the path of gangs and violence.\n  We also have a responsibility to help these efforts by stemming the \nflood of\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\nillicit guns that comes into Chicago. When it is easy for gang members \nto get their hands on guns, it is hard for children and communities to \navoid violence. We must all do our part to stop the gun trafficking \nthat supplies Chicago's criminal gangs.\n  I want to commend President Obama for taking an important step last \nweek to help combat gun trafficking. This step has to do with smart gun \ntechnology.\n  Right now we have security features on our phones and computers that \ncan prevent thieves and unauthorized people from using them. You can \nsecure these devices so they can only be unlocked with a password, \nfingerprint, or some other security feature. We can develop similar \ntechnology so that an unauthorized user cannot fire a gun. This would \nmake it far harder for a prohibited gun buyer to get his hands on a gun \nhe can use.\n  Smart gun technology would also prevent thieves from stealing guns to \nresell them, and it would help prevent kids from playing with guns and \ngetting hurt.\n  For years there has been resistance to smart gun technology. Part of \nthis resistance has come from the gun lobby, which always fights \nagainst proposals that might reduce gun sales. But resistance has also \ncome from law enforcement, which had concerns about whether smart gun \ntechnology would work effectively.\n  Last week, the administration announced that it would partner with \nlaw enforcement to develop voluntary standards for what law enforcement \nwould need in order to consider using smart gun technology. Within 6 \nmonths, this effort will produce baseline specifications for the \nreliability, durability and accuracy of this technology.\n  Once there is agreement on a set of standards for smart gun \ntechnology, then innovators can get to work on developing products that \nmeet those standards and bringing those products to market. The \nadministration will help this effort with its research dollars and \npurchasing power. They will help make this technology a reality.\n  This could be a game changer when it comes to deterring illegal gun \ntrafficking. It is exactly the kind of effort that the city of Chicago \nneeds. I commend the administration for undertaking this effort, and I \nwill do everything in my power to support it.\n  As we work to prevent future gun violence, it is also important that \nwe remember and pay tribute to those we have lost to this epidemic of \nviolence.\n  June 2, 2016, will mark what should be the 19th birthday of Hadiya \nPendleton. Hadiya was 15 years old when she was gunned down while \nstanding in a park on Chicago's South Side on January 29, 2013. She had \njust performed with her King College Prep school band at the \nPresident's inauguration ceremony one week before.\n  I have come to know Hadiya's family--her mother Cleo and her father \nNate--and I have met many people who have been deeply affected by \nHadiya's senseless murder.\n  After her death, Hadiya's friends started a campaign to urge people \nto wear orange on June 2, Hadiya's birthday, to honor victims of gun \nviolence. Orange is the color that hunters wear in the woods so that \nnobody shoots them.\n  This campaign became a national phenomenon. June 2 has now become Gun \nViolence Awareness Day. Last year I was proud to join with students, \nfaith leaders, community leaders, media figures, lawmakers, and many \nmore across the Nation who wore orange to honor Hadiya and the 32,000 \nvictims lost each year to gun violence.\n  I will be wearing orange again on June 2 this year, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  We must never forget our solemn obligation to do all we can to keep \nthe American people safe, and that includes keeping Americans safe from \npreventable gun violence.\n  Thousands of Americans are shot and killed each year in shootings \nthat could have been prevented. There are steps we can take, consistent \nwith our Constitution and with our traditions of hunting and sport \nshooting, to avoid these tragic deaths. We should not be afraid to take \nthose steps.\n  This June 2, Hadiya Pendleton should be celebrating her 19th \nbirthday. Instead, a nation will mourn her loss and the loss of so many \nothers due to gun violence. We owe it to Hadiya and to the victims to \ndo our best to spare others from this violence in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2740-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2740-S2741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING WALLY HENDERSON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago I lost a dear friend and my \nhometown of Springfield, IL, lost one of its best. His name was Earl \nWallace Henderson, but everyone knew him as Wally. He was an acclaimed \narchitect who helped design Springfield's future while, at the same \ntime, preserving its priceless past as the hometown of President \nAbraham Lincoln.\n  In the 1960s, Ferry & Henderson, the architectural firm he co-\nfounded, took on one of its most important projects: expanding \nIllinois' historic old State capitol building to include underground \nparking, room for the State historical library, and other modern \namenities.\n  The concept of architectural preservation was relatively at that \ntime, and Wally became one of its pioneering leaders. Expanding the old \nState capitol involved taking the building apart piece by piece, \ncataloguing and moving more than 3,300 stones to the Illinois \nfairground, and then painstakingly rebuilding the structure over the \nnew parking garage and library.\n  Wally's decades of innovative work in architectural preservation \nearned him admission in 2011 to the American Institute of Architects \nCollege of Fellows, one of the highest honors in his field.\n  Interestingly, Wally became an architect almost by accident. What he \nwanted to be all through high school was an astronaut. More to the \npoint, he wanted to be the first man to walk on the moon. This was back \nin the late 1940s, which gives you an idea of Wally's ability to \nimagine a future that few others could see.\n  Wally left Springfield in 1949 to study aeronautical engineering at \nthe University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign. He was his parent's only \nchild, and the first person in his extended family ever to go to \ncollege. When he came home for spring break during his freshman year, \nhis parents were so proud of their son, the college student, that they \ninvited a bunch of friends over.\n  One of the neighbors asked Wally, ``What are you studying?''\n  Wally told them, ``Aeronautical engineering.''\n  Another neighbor asked, ``So you want to build airplanes, do you?''\n  Wally replied, ``No, I want to be the first man on the moon.''\n  Years later in an interview, he recalled what followed.\n  ``As those folks departed my mother said, `Here, sit down, your dad \nand I want to talk to you for a moment.' ''\n  Wally sat down between his dad and his mom, whom he respected \ngreatly. His mother said, ``You know, it's alright to say that to your \ndad and me about `wanting to go to the moon.' But everybody else thinks \nyou're crazy.''\n  That was the end of Wally's dreams of being an astronaut. He went \nback to the university and asked a counselor what other school on \ncampus would accept the credits he had earned.\n  Fortunately for Springfield, Wally's counselor suggested \narchitectural engineering. That was the start of his long and \ndistinguished career.\n  Wally graduated from the University of Illinois in 1954, moved to \nIndianapolis, and went to work for an engineering firm. Six months \nlater, he was drafted into the Army and sent to Korea. This was several \nmonths after the ceasefire that ended the conflict. Wally was assigned \nto an engineering battalion.\n  One day, a young Korean boy about 11 years old was polishing Wally's \nboots to earn money for his family. The boy was telling Wally about his \nhometown, a little village. He said it was the best village in the \nworld.\n  Wally said he started bragging about his own hometown, reached into \nhis pocket and pulled out the only coin he had, a penny with Lincoln's \nimage on it, and said, ``I'm from his hometown.''\n  The little boy had probably never traveled farther than 10 miles from \nhis own village, but when he saw that penny, his face lit up. To this \nyoung boy, Wally said, ``Abraham Lincoln was everything.'' Right there, \n3,000 miles from home, Wally listened as this Korean child told him the \nstory of the Great Emancipator.\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n  Wally was stunned. He thought, ``Here I am, from Abraham Lincoln's \nhometown. I lived nine or ten blocks from Lincoln's home, and this \nchild knows as much about Abraham Lincoln as I do.''\n  Over the next several decades, that would change. As an architect and \narchitectural preservationist, Wally would play a crucial role in \nhelping to preserve what is now called the Lincoln Home National \nHistoric Site and the Capital Complex. As I mentioned, he also helped \npreserve and rebuild the old State capitol in Springfield, where \nAbraham Lincoln delivered his famous ``House Divided'' speech, warning \nthat the Nation could not endure half slave and half free. \nCoincidentally, it was also at the old State capitol that another lanky \nlawyer from Illinois, Barack Obama, announced his candidacy for \nPresident of the United States in 2007.\n  I was honored to serve with Wally Henderson on the commission that \nhelped create the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in \nSpringfield. We also served together on the Abraham Lincoln \nBicentennial Committee, which helped lead the Nation in remembering \nAbraham Lincoln during 2009, the bicentennial of his birth.\n  Wally was a past president and longtime board member of the Abraham \nLincoln Association, a distinguished group of Lincoln scholars. In \n2009, the Lincoln Association awarded him its Logan Hay Medal, for his \nwork in preserving and making more accessible buildings and landmarks \nassociated with President Lincoln's life.\n\n  In 2013, the Springfield Journal Register named Wally Henderson \nSpringfield's ``First Citizen.'' The ceremony took place, fittingly, at \nthe old State capitol State historic site, which Wally's firm had \nhelped to restore.\n  That Wally became such an important and cherished part of Springfield \nis a bit of an irony. You see, when Wally Henderson left Springfield to \ngo to college, he vowed to himself that he would never move back.\n  After serving in Korea, Wally used the G.I. Bill to earn his master's \ndegree in architecture at the University of Illinois. He met his first \nwife, Sally; they got married, and Wally landed a great job working as \nan architect in Denver.\n  Then came the fateful phone call: Wally was contacted by a young \narchitect in Springfield, the brother-in-law of Wally's best friend in \nhigh school. The brother-in-law's name was Don Ferry. He was working \nfor a Springfield firm that was designing hospitals, and they needed \nanother architect. Was Wally interested?\n  Wally came home, talked with Don Ferry, and left unimpressed. He went \nback to Denver and finished work on a church that his firm was building \nin the Rocky Mountains. The completed church was spectacular. At its \ngrand opening, Sally nudged Wally and said, ``You're leaving.'' She \nknew that Wally needed another professional challenge. So, at the age \nof 28, after 4 years as an architect in Denver, Wally packed up his \nwife and baby and moved home.\n  He told Don Ferry that he would work with him, but he had conditions. \nHe told Don, ``You quit your job, I'll quit my job and we'll open an \noffice in Springfield because, by God, Springfield needs higher \neducation and a whole bunch of other things.''\n  His other condition: Wally said, ``We're not competing with anybody. \nWe're going to bring contemporary architecture to Springfield, \nIllinois'' There were about a dozen architectural firms in town at that \ntime, but no one was doing much of anything new.\n  Wally Henderson and Don Ferry formed their own firm, Ferry & \nHenderson Architects, in 1961. They started out in a one-room office \nthat contained two stools, a drafting table, and a telephone. They \nworked together for decades and literally transformed Springfield.\n  They spearheaded projects including the Springfield Municipal Plaza, \nthe Willard Ice Building, and the building that houses the Springfield \nJournal-Register.\n  One reason Wally had vowed never to return to Springfield was because \nthe town lacked a university. Ferry & Henderson helped rectify that \nomission when their firm designed the Public Affairs Building, the \nfirst permanent building at Sangamon State University, now the \nUniversity of Illinois at Springfield. Wally remained a strong \nsupporter of the university until the end of his life.\n  When Wally moved back to Springfield, the area surrounding the \nLincoln Home was run-down and nondescript. Wally helped stir \nSpringfield's civic pride and its resolve to take care of its priceless \nlegacy as Abraham Lincoln's hometown. I have been proud to have my \ncongressional and Senate offices in this restored area.\n  Just as that little Korean boy had enabled Wally to see Springfield \nthrough new eyes, Wally helped others in Springfield to envision a \nfuture in which the Lincoln Home, the old State capitol, and other \nplaces that Lincoln loved would become the crown jewels of America's \nLincoln historic sites.\n  Last year, more than 233,000 people visited the Lincoln Home National \nHistoric Site in Springfield, up nearly 20 percent from the year \nbefore. Those visitors spent more than $13.8 million at local \nbusinesses.\n  My wife, Loretta, and I were fortunate to count Wally Henderson as a \ndear friend and neighbor. We both extend our condolences to Wally's \nwife, Brynn, and to their children and grandchildren, all of whom Wally \nloved deeply.\n  When Abraham Lincoln left Springfield to start his inaugural journey \nto Washington, friends from all over town came to see him off at the \nGreat Western Railway station. In what is now known as his Farewell \nAddress, the new President said: ``My friends, no one, not in my \nsituation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To \nthis place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything.'' He \nclosed by saying, ``I bid you an affectionate farewell.''\n  Likewise, to my old friend Wally Henderson, who did so much to \npreserve the legacy of President Lincoln and to enrich our hometown in \nso many other ways, I bid you an affectionate farewell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2741-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2741-S2742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every year in May we commemorate National \nPolice Week, a time to reflect upon the sacrifices made by the men and \nwomen who serve in law enforcement. In particular we honor those who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice and died in the line of duty. Our law \nenforcement officers risk their lives every day to protect and serve \nour communities in Vermont and across the country. This year I am proud \nto say that Congress has come together to deliver more than just \nrhetoric in honor of this service. This year we are providing something \nmuch more important--tangible, lifesaving protection for hundreds of \nthousands of law enforcement officers. On Tuesday, the House of \nRepresentatives joined the Senate and passed my bipartisan \nreauthorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program.\n  I originally worked with former Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell to \nestablish the Bulletproof Vest Partnership program in the wake of the \nCarl Drega shootings on the Vermont-New Hampshire border. While the \nFederal officers engaged in a shootout with Drega were equipped with \nbody armor, many of their State law enforcement counterparts were not, \nwhich resulted in the death of two State troopers. Now, nearly 20 years \nlater, this program has provided more than 1.2 million protective vests \nto more than 13,000 law enforcement agencies around the country, \nincluding more than 4,400 vests for Vermont officers; yet the program's \ncharter expired in 2012, and I have been working to reauthorize it ever \nsince. The Senate passed the bipartisan measure coauthored by Senator \nLindsey Graham last year. I am proud that the House has now done the \nsame, and the legislation is headed to the President's desk for \nsignature. This program saves lives and proves that Congress can work \ntogether to protect those who protect us.\n  While the Bulletproof Vest Partnership will continue to protect \nofficers, we must never forget the more than 20,000 fallen officers \nenshrined on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial. These walls stand as a testament to the dedication and \ncommitment of our brave law enforcement officers. Officers like \nSergeant Gary A. Gaboury, a patrol commander in Shaftsbury and member \nof the State police dive team, who tragically died 24\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\nyears ago today, on May 12, 1992, as he was attempting to recover a \ndrowning victim. No matter how old these wounds are, our communities \nmust not forget the sacrifice of Sergeant Gaboury and others in \nuniform.\n  Tomorrow the names of 252 fallen officers will be added to the walls \nof the memorial. Among those who will be added to the wall is Vermont \nState Trooper Kyle Young, who tragically died last September. Trooper \nYoung, who suffered heat stroke during a training exercise, was the \nfirst line-of-duty death in Vermont in 12 years. Like so many of his \nfallen colleagues, Trooper Young died while working to be a better \npublic servant. He hoped to be promoted to the agency's tactical team, \nand he died showing the same grit and determination that he showed \nthroughout his life, always trying to achieve the next goal. Trooper \nYoung was only 28 years old and the father of two young girls. He was \nan outstanding high school athlete who went on to serve in the U.S. Air \nForce, with tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. His colleagues described him \nas an active trooper who, with less than 2 years on the job, quickly \nfound his calling.\n  The tragedy of Trooper Young's death will not be forgotten, nor will \nthe lives of 23 other Vermont law enforcement officers who have died in \nthe line of duty. Vermont is fortunate to be served by so many \nprofessional and dedicated public servants in law enforcement. That is \nwhy I have worked so long to provide law enforcement officers with what \nthey need to keep both themselves and their communities safe. It is my \nhope that the reauthorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nprogram will do just that--and will help keep names off that wall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2742-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2742-S2743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROSS BAKER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have often likened the counsel that \nSenators receive from their staff to the confidential advice a lawyer \nprovides to a client. That is why it is so rare that, over the last 40 \nor so years, Ross Baker, a Distinguished professor at Rutgers \nUniversity, has taken several sabbaticals to research the inner \nworkings of Capitol Hill. Most recently, as a scholar in residence in \nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid's office, Professor Baker has been \ngiven the unusual access to the inner workings of one of the Senate's \nleading offices. The result? Professor Baker is considered the go-to \nacademic expert on the Senate, one of the preeminent scholars of \ncongressional history, the author of six books about Congress and \ngovernment, and an insightful resource for the news media about the \noften inscrutable goings-on in Congress.\n  I came to know Professor Baker when he joined my staff as an adviser \nin 2000, when he returned to Capitol Hill to gain a better \nunderstanding of Senate seniority. When he returned to my staff in \n2004, during a period of fierce debate in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee over the direction of our courts and our national security \npolicy, Professor Baker saw firsthand how lawmakers, including myself, \nbalance meaningful, large-scale policy debates with the day-to-day \nresponsibility of representing and advocating for our constituents. It \ngoes without saying that my relationship with Professor Baker was a \ntwo-way street. It was not uncommon for me to respond to his questions \nwith some of my own.\n  In 2008, Ross Baker joined then-Majority Leader Reid's staff at a \npivotal time in both Congress and in the political arena. Long and \ndiverse primary campaigns, coupled with the winding down of the \ntumultuous Bush administration, provided Professor Baker with even more \nfodder for his courses at Rutgers. As he concludes his final stint with \nSenator Reid's office, one can only wonder how today's political \ndialogue both on the campaign trail and on the floor of the Senate will \ninform Professor Baker's American Government course when he resumes \nteaching this fall.\n  Vermonters have entrusted me to represent them in Washington several \ntimes. Like Professor Baker, I have spent time studying what works, and \nwhat doesn't. His insights are as important to the chronicle of Senate \nhistory as they are to the students he teaches today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a May 5 article in the Washington Post \nentitled ``History Professor Landed a Privileged Perch to See How Harry \nReid Works'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 5, 2016]\n\nHistory Professor Landed a Privileged Perch To See How Harry Reid Works\n\n                             (By Paul Kane)\n\n       Harry Reid almost never says no.\n       When he gets a new piece of information or a request or \n     anything, he says--he uses this phrase all the time--he says: \n     `I'll look at it,' '' says Ross K. Baker, a distinguished \n     congressional scholar at Rutgers University.\n       That approach gives the Senate minority leader wiggle room \n     to make decisions in private, a style of leadership that is \n     decidedly different from the ``master of the Senate,'' \n     bulldozing approach that Lyndon B. Johnson honed as leader in \n     the 1950s.\n       That's just one of the countless insights that Baker, 77, \n     has drawn in three separate stints as ``scholar in \n     residence'' on Reid's staff Last week, he finished his final \n     tour with the retiring Senate leader as an unpaid adviser and \n     observer, a one-of-a-kind sabbatical for the professor. Over \n     the past 41 years, Baker has done seven stints on Capitol \n     Hill, working in the House and Senate.\n       Rather than teaching undergraduate students his ``American \n     Government'' course, the professor embedded himself in real \n     American government at an irregular pace in the past, but \n     over the past 16 years he's been here every four years. \n     Nothing can compete with the access he has been given in \n     Reid's leadership office in the Capitol. He watched the early \n     stages of the 2008 presidential primary play out on the \n     Senate floor between then-Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary \n     Clinton. He has seen Senate battles over treaties, and, \n     without fail, has seen countless legislative battles end in \n     gridlock.\n       Baker's time on Capitol Hill has provided history the \n     chance to have an academic get an up-close view of one of \n     this era's most influential political figures, but also one \n     of the most difficult to understand.\n       ``The panorama is breathtaking,'' Baker said. ``Here is \n     somebody who has his [finger on the] pulse [of] all the major \n     policy areas, has to, and has a staff that is equipped to do \n     that. So the feelers are out, the sensors are everywhere, the \n     neurons are firing constantly.''\n       Reid said he wanted Baker to ``focus on the Senate as an \n     institution'' for history's sake, and the professor wrote a \n     2014 book, ``Is Bipartisanship Dead?,'' based largely on his \n     2012 experience with Reid.\n       ``We all trust him,'' Reid said in a telephone interview \n     this week from Nevada.\n       He allowed Baker into every senior staff meeting and let \n     him watch Reid's senior aides prep the senator every Tuesday \n     morning for his weekly news conference. ``He doesn't speak up \n     very often, but when he does, we all listen,'' Reid added.\n       The low-light came when Republicans filibustered the \n     ratification of a treaty to elevate global standards for the \n     disabled, opening Baker's eyes to the ability of conservative \n     groups to block legislation.\n       Now, Baker thinks the calls on both sides for ``regular \n     order''--legislation beginning in committee, involving junior \n     members, emerging to full and open debates on the House and \n     Senate floor--are hollow.\n       ``There are just too many forces arrayed against it for it \n     to work,'' he said. ``I think it's a function of \n     polarization, that leaders have to get control of the process \n     and have to use exotic procedures that are basically \n     incomprehensible.''\n       Yet Reid was never the dictator in Johnson's 1950s style, \n     according to Baker. Those senators whom Reid rebuffed after \n     his initial ``I'll take a look at it'' would soon find him \n     doing a quick favor. ``He will double back and do something \n     for that person to make them feel important,'' Baker said.\n       Baker has long been known as a leading congressional \n     expert, a go-to resource for news media in need of \n     translating Washington. These stints on Capitol Hill have \n     given him a first-hand experience, spanning decades, that few \n     scholars can match.\n       Baker's political interests started randomly. In the mid-\n     1970s, when he was fashioning himself as an Africa expert and \n     writing occasional op-eds in The Washington Post, Baker \n     decided to refocus his career on U.S. politics, and on \n     Congress in particular.\n       So the 36-year-old professor persuaded Sen. Walter \n     Mondale's chief of staff, Richard Moe, to give him a break. \n     Baker read the academic version of Washington in journals on \n     his bus commute, then lived the real-life version by day, \n     spending a full academic year among the offices of Mondale \n     (D-Minn ) and Sens. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.) and Frank Church (D-\n     Idaho).\n       Back then, Baker was more like a regular staffer, writing \n     speeches for Bayh and helping Church in his late-breaking bid \n     for the 1976 presidential nomination. He almost accepted \n     Church's offer of a full-time job but returned to Rutgers for \n     the fall of 1976.\n       ``But I got a serious, you know, a chronic case of Potomac \n     Fever,'' Baker said.\n       By 1983, the time of his next full-year sabbatical, he had \n     landed a gig with the House Democratic Caucus, when the \n     massive majority included dozens of ``Boll Weevil'' Democrats \n     who backed Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and strong military \n     posture.\n       Baker went another 17 years before he got back to the \n     Capitol, returning to the Senate\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\n     and to his only Republican boss, then-Sen. Chuck Hagel \n     (Neb.).\n       He bounced from there into the office of Sen. Patrick J. \n     Leahy (Vt.), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, \n     spending several months there in 2000 and again in 2004. \n     There, he saw up close how senior senators have to focus on \n     one significant policy arena at the expense of others.\n       ``There's this sort of policy triage that senators have to \n     engage in, which is: They can't possibly devote themselves \n     equally to three major committee assignments,'' Baker said.\n       Several years later, Baker's Rutgers connection paid off.\n       Reid's longtime senior aide Susan McCue was a Rutgers \n     alumna, connecting Baker with Reid, which led to tours with \n     the majority leader in 2008 and 2012, as well as a brief \n     stint during the 2014 lame-duck session. These past four \n     months were Baker's first stint with Reid in the minority.\n       With his Reid partnership ending, Baker is returning to \n     another semester of ``American Government'' this fall at \n     Rutgers.\n       ``I at least come out of it with fresh anecdotes for my \n     undergraduates,'' Baker said. ``I mean, I just don't want to \n     ever be in a position of mentioning a name and they look at \n     me blankly.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2743-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BUDGET COMMITTEE COST ESTIMATE--S. 2844\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I offer for the Record the Budget \nCommittee's cost estimate of S. 2844, the Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2017.\n  The reported measure provides $56.5 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2017, which will result in new outlays of \n$46.3 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, nonemergency discretionary outlays for the bill will \ntotal $120.5 billion.\n  The reported bill matches its section 302(b) allocation set forth in \nS. Rept. 114-238 for budget authority for both the security and \nnonsecurity categories and is below the 302(b) allocation for outlays \nby $10 million.\n  The bill contains emergency-designated appropriations, which are \neffectively exempt from budget enforcement. The Budget Act provides a \nmechanism to prevent abuse of the emergency designation in the form of \nthe 314(e) point of order, which allows any Senator to challenge \nwhether the appropriation is actually needed for an emergency. \nSpecifically, the bill transfers to the community planning and \ndevelopment account previously appropriated emergency-designated \nHousing and Urban Development spending for administrative costs related \nto disaster relief efforts. This transfer does not change budget \nauthority, but increases outlays by $1 million. I will adjust the \nallocations by this amount unless a challenge to the use of the \nemergency designation is successful, which would occur if fewer than 60 \nSenators agree that the appropriation is needed for an emergency \npurpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the table \ndisplaying the Budget Committee scoring of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    S. 2844, 2017 TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS--SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-\n                                                  REPORTED BILL\n                                         (Fiscal Year 2017, $ millions)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Budget Authority                       Outlays\n                                             -------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Security       Nonsecurity         Total            Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill........................             275-           56,199           56,474          120,461\nSenate 302(b) allocation....................              275           56,199           56,474          120,471\n2016 Enacted................................              210           57,391           57,601          120,469\nPresident's request.........................              211           51,781           51,992          118,800\nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation-----...........                0                0                0              -10\n    2016 Enacted............................             65--           -1,192           -1,127            -8---\n    President's request.....................            64---           4,418-           4,482-   1,661---------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 establishes statutory limits on \ndiscretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to those \nlimits, while sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and \nmake revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with \nthose adjustments. The Senate will soon consider Senate amendment No. \n3896, filed by Senator Collins. This amendment includes the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2017, as reported by the Committee on \nAppropriations.

SCHWARTZ\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service of Col. Douglas J. Schwartz, 434th Air Refueling \nWing commander, and to wish him well upon his retirement. A dedicated \nand loyal public servant, Colonel Schwartz has served the people of \nIndiana and the United States in the U.S. Air Force for approximately \n35 years. A command pilot, Colonel Schwartz has more than 4,200 flying \nhours, and his service includes deployments in support of U.S. military \nefforts in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan.\n  A native of Fort Wayne, IN, Colonel Schwartz graduated from Purdue \nUniversity and received his commission through the Air Force Officer \nTraining School in 1981. Shortly thereafter, he entered pilot training \nat Williams Air Force Base, AZ, and was assigned to the 325th Bomb \nSquadron at Fairchild Air Force Base, WA. He transferred to the Air \nForce Reserve in 1992 and flew KC-135R Stratotankers with the 72nd Air \nRefueling Squadron at Grissom. From October 1992 until March 2007, he \nheld numerous command and leadership assignments at Grissom, including \nassistant chief pilot, chief of standardization and evaluation, \noperations officer, flight commander, and detachment commander. Colonel \nSchwartz has also served as detachment commander and operations group \ncommander of the 927th Air Refueling Wing at MacDill Air Force Base, \nFL; vice commander of the 932nd Airlift Wing at Scott Air Force Base, \nIL; director of staff for the 4th Air Force; and wing commander of the \n927th Air Refueling Wing at McDill Airforce Base, FL, before returning \nto Grissom to assume command of the 434th Air Refueling Wing in June \n2014.\n  Under the leadership of Colonel Schwartz, Grissom is home to one of \nour Nation's finest Air Force units with the dedicated men and women of \nthe 434th Air Refueling Wing and the largest KC-135R Stratotanker unit \nin the Air Force Reserve Command. Colonel Schwartz has helped Grissom \nplay a large and growing role in our national defense, and he has \nworked to ensure the Air Force recognizes the tremendous asset we have \nin Indiana.\n  We thank Colonel Schwartz for his service, dedication, and commitment \nto protecting Hoosiers and our Nation. Indiana has a long and proud \ntradition of serving our country, and Colonel Schwartz's leadership has \nplayed a critical role in ensuring that our brave men and women at the \n434th Refueling Wing have the training and support they need. On behalf \nof all Hoosiers, I wish Colonel Schwartz and his wife, Ann, the best in \nthe years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2744-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2744-S2745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID C.

Senator Manchin and Senator Rounds both join me in \nhonoring David, who concluded his tenure with NGA after 13 years of \nservice to the Nation's Governors on April 29.\n  As he begins a new chapter in his distinguished professional career, \nI would like to highlight the important work David led at NGA, the \nbipartisan organization of the Governors of the 55 States, territories, \nand Commonwealths. David has been a strong voice for the Nation's \nGovernors in the areas of State taxation, telecommunications and \ntechnology, budget and appropriations, national security, veterans \naffairs, the National Guard, and the critical role of States in \nresponding to the great recession and natural disasters. He testified \nbefore Congress 15 times, principally on State taxation matters. David \nalso helped launch NGA's international program, leading a series of \nsubnational trade conferences in Salt Lake City and Beijing between \nU.S. and Chinese Governors under a bilateral agreement between the \nUnited States and the People's Republic of China.\n  Since 2003, David has helped frame and convey the bipartisan views of \nU.S. Governors to Members of Congress, Presidential administrations and \nFederal executive branch officials, private sector executives, and \ninternational leaders. He has represented the consensus positions of \nGovernors through numerous television appearances and print interviews \nwith publications, including: the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, \nUSA Today, Washington Post, CNN, National Public Radio, Congressional \nQuarterly, Bureau of National Affairs, Politico, Boston Globe, Los \nAngeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution, Denver Post, and the Bond Buyer.\n  David relished his role as chief advocate presenting the collective \nvoice of the Nation's Governors, often describing it as the ``best job \nin Washington, D.C.'' He executed it well.\n  Through David's leadership of the Office of Federal Relations, NGA \nholds a respected record in developing policy solutions and effectively \nadvocating the Governors' collective policy priorities before Congress \nand the administration. David and his team of professionals have helped \nto maintain a seat at the table for the Nation's Governors on many \ncritical national issues.\n  On behalf of all of my Senate colleagues who are former Governors, \nespecially Senator Manchin and Senator Rounds, many of whom have worked \ndirectly with David Quam for years, I wish to express our thanks for \nhis zealous bipartisan advocacy on behalf of the Nation's Governors, \nsound counsel,\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\ngood humor, and tireless defense of the Tenth Amendment on behalf of \nthe States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2745-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM GRANT\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \nsignificant contributions that Peterborough native Jim Grant has made \nto New Hampshire throughout his life. I am proud to recognize Jim's \nservice in the Granite State and dedication to his fellow New Hampshire \nresidents.\n  Jim has lived his entire life in Peterborough and is proud of his \nroots, which are represented on his vanity license plate with the \nphrase ``LUVPBRO.'' In addition to being well-known and beloved by his \nneighbors, Jim epitomizes the spirit of generosity in New Hampshire. \nSpanning decades, Jim's dedication to volunteerism is outstanding, and \nhe has served as a volunteer firefighter for 53 years. His record of \nservice also includes volunteering for the Salvation Army, founding the \nMonadnock Workspace--an organization that employs and empowers those \nwith developmental challenges--and co-founding the Peterborough \nSunshine Fund, which assists individuals with emergency and travel \nneeds.\n  It is only fitting that Jim's own profession would be as a teacher \nwho educated and inspired generations of students. His passion for \nteaching compelled him to found the organization where he works today, \nStaff Development for Educators. By ensuring and enriching the \nprofessional development needs of educators, Jim is helping to spread \neducation across the globe.\n  Jim has contributed greatly to the Greater Monadnock region, \ninjecting positivity into the lives of people he may never know. It is \nan honor to highlight Jim's life of service and commitment to a cause \ngreater than himself. His selflessness and generosity is a testament to \nall that is great in New Hampshire.\n  I extend my sincerest thanks to Jim for all that he has done and \ncontinues to do for the people of New Hampshire. I am extraordinarily \nproud to join his friends and neighbors in commending Jim for a life \nwell lived and his lifetime of giving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2745-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DELANEY BIEL\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \nHinsdale High School senior, Delaney Biel. Delaney is described by her \nEMT instructor, Dorothy Jensen, as ``a determined team player, who is \ncommitted to her community. She consistently exceeds expectations . . . \nI'd trust her with my life.'' Delaney is already a nationally certified \nemergency medical technician and will soon be receiving her State \ncertification any moment now.\n  The loss of three classmates in recent years inspired Delaney to \nenroll in an EMT course offered at her own high school. Initially, an \naspiring businesswoman, she has said, ``the class absolutely changed \nwhat I wanted to do as a career. As a kid I was afraid of hospitals, \nbut with the ambulance I get to make decisions in a fast-paced \nenvironment and I can get down to business without getting flustered.'' \nSo far she has responded to women in labor and individuals with cardiac \nand diabetic emergencies. Last year, Delaney gave up basketball, \nvolleyball, and most of her free time in the service of her community.\n  As a fifth generation Montana rancher, making the switch from farming \nequipment to an ambulance was simple. Both working her family's ranch \nand participating in Hinsdale athletics prepared her for the \ncollaboration essential to high quality urgent care. Delaney has said, \n``This is a team sport; it's not about you, it's about everyone using \ntheir strengths to make the team work.''\n  Delaney likes to keep a full schedule. Since April of last year, she \nhas completed 500 hours of community service, administering bimonthly \nblood pressure screenings at the local senior center. She is also a \nmember of FFA, president of student council, a member of the music \ndepartment, and a member of the National Honor Society.\n  This fall, at Montana State University-Northern, Delaney will \ncontinue on her path to becoming a medical professional by pursuing a \nbachelor's degree in nursing. After college, she intends to gain hands-\non experience in the emergency rooms of Billings and Great Falls before \napplying to medical school. Her long term goal is to raise a family in \nHinsdale and spend a few days each week where she got started, with the \nvolunteer ambulance.\n  This young woman's dedication is inspiring. It is our small-town \nfamily values that makes Montana so special. Her example encourages \neach of us to reach beyond expectations we have set for ourselves and \ndo our part to strengthen our communities.\n  Delaney, I wish you the best in college, and thank you for your \nservice to our great State. Keep making us proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2745-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING JOHN TIERNEY\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate John \nTierney on being named Nevada's 2016 Michael Landsberry Teacher of the \nYear. This accolade is truly prestigious, attained by only the most \ninfluential of Nevada's educators. Without a doubt, Mr. Tierney's work \nat Adobe High School in the Elko County School District warrants \nrecognition with this incredible award.\n  Mr. Tierney started his career in teaching three decades ago at the \nFremont Unified School District. In 1989, he moved to Nevada and began \nteaching English and social studies at Adobe Middle School and has \nremained a valued member of the Red-Tailed Hawks' faculty department \never since. In addition to time spent in the classroom, Mr. Tierney \nleads the social studies department and serves on the School \nImprovement Team at Adobe High School. He is also a national \nfacilitator for PBS TeacherLine, which provides online professional \ndevelopment courses for Pre-K through 12th grade teachers. Mr. \nTierney's unwavering dedication to his students at Adobe High School \nover the last 25 years goes without question. He is truly a role model, \nproviding an innovative and interactive teaching style for those in his \nclassroom, and he encourages students with open discourse and debate. \nHis commitment to his students is invaluable to the Elko community.\n  As the father of four children and as the husband of a teacher, I \nunderstand the important role educators play in enriching the lives of \nNevadans. Ensuring students throughout the Silver State are prepared to \ncompete in the 21st century is critical for the future of our country. \nThe State of Nevada is fortunate to be home to educators like Mr. \nTierney.\n  I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in thanking Mr. \nTierney for his dedication to enriching the lives of Nevada's students \nand congratulating him on receiving this award.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Carole \nVilardo on her retirement after three decades of service to the Great \nState of Nevada. Ms. Vilardo has gone above and beyond in her role with \nthe Nevada Taxpayers Association, NTA, embodying Nevada's values of \nstrength and steadfast dedication to improving the Silver State's tax \nlaws.\n  Ms. Vilardo began her career with the NTA in 1986 when she was \nassigned to work on issues including taxes, spending, and business \nregulation. Prior to this, she owned a retail shop and teamed up with \nformer Nevada State Senator Ann O'Connell in spearheading work to \ncreate tougher shoplifting laws in Nevada. These laws were later \nadopted and became a model to other States. From 1972 to 1986, the two \nworked as a team to better the State of Nevada by advocating for \ngreater accountability for the Clark County Commission in its actions \nand decisions.\n  After joining the NTA, Ms. Vilardo worked for 30 years to maintain \nunbiased and fair tax laws for the Silver State. Throughout her tenure, \nMs. Vilardo was recognized as a tax expert with an unparalleled ability \nto explain complex issues to those around her. Even with the slightest \nchange in legislation, Ms. Vilardo could explain the direct effects \nthese decisions would have on Nevada's economy. She was one-of-a-kind, \nearning the trust of anyone she made contact with. In addition,\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\nshe served as a true watchdog of Nevada's spending. Her public service \nwill be sorely missed by our Great State.\n  After three decades of providing insightful testimony on tax policy \nand instrumental counsel to those helping shape Nevada's laws, Ms. \nVilardo recently retired. Her legacy throughout the Silver State and at \nthe NTA will continue on for years to come. Ms. Vilardo will continue \nto be respected for her in-depth knowledge, years of unwavering \ndedication to our State, and for her ability to create long-lasting and \npositive relationships throughout Nevada. Her vigilance and \ndetermination in creating effective tax policy for our State will not \nbe forgotten.\n  Ms. Vilardo has demonstrated true commitment to Nevada, exemplifying \nwhat it means to fight for the greater good of our Great State. We are \nlucky to have had someone of such dedication working on behalf of the \nSilver State. I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in \nthanking Ms. Vilardo for her years of service, and I wish her well in \nall of her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2746-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JOHN F. CAMPBELL\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a strategic \nleader and exceptional warrior of tremendous talent. After a lifetime \nof distinguished service to our Nation, GEN John F. Campbell is \nretiring from the U.S. Army. On this occasion, I believe it is fitting \nto recognize General Campbell's decades of dedicated service to our \nNation.\n  General Campbell graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1979 and \ncommissioned in the U.S. Army infantry. During his more than 37 years \nof service, he has commanded units at every echelon from platoon \nleader, to four-star command, and in places such as Haiti, Afghanistan, \nand Iraq.\n  Upon promotion to brigadier general in 2005, he was assigned as the \ndeputy commanding general for Maneuver, 1st Calvary Division, deployed \nto Baghdad, and is widely credited with holding together the force \nduring a very violent period leading up to the surge. His following \nassignment was the deputy director for regional operations at the Joint \nStaff. After being promoted to major general, he was named commander of \nthe Screaming Eagles, 101st Airborne Division, and deployed to \nAfghanistan as commander, Regional Command East, International Security \nAssistance Force, ISAF, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, and \ncommander, Combined Joint Task Force-101. He commanded of over 30,000 \ncoalition servicemembers and 65,000 Afghan National Defense and \nSecurity Forces. The scope of his responsibility included the \nprotection of 13 million people and the security of a 450-mile border \nwith Pakistan.\n  At Fort Campbell, KY, General Campbell cultivated lasting \nrelationships within the community to support soldiers, civilians, and \nfamilies. He installed programs to facilitate a comprehensive fitness \nprogram, develop soldier and family resiliency, and significantly \ndecrease the suicide rate. As lieutenant general, he became the Army \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Operations, Plans and Training. He was \npromoted to general and, in 2014, confirmed as the 34th U.S. Army Vice \nChief of Staff, where he promoted the physical, moral, and mental \nfitness required for improved readiness and resilience. He was an \nadvocate for stopping sexual harassment and assault and supported \nWounded Warrior programs. He was vital in updating Congress on the \nArmy's path ahead for these and other key issues. In addition, he \ncoordinated a restructure of posts and stations that helped decrease \n17,500 personnel by fiscal year 2017 to meet mandated end strength \ngoals.\n  In 2014, General Campbell deployed to Afghanistan and took command of \nthe NATO ISAF mission and United States Forces--Afghanistan. During his \nfirst 6 months, Afghanistan held an extended electoral process and \ninstalled a new President and Chief Executive as part of the National \nUnity Government. After this, General Campbell managed an over 90 \npercent drawdown of U.S. forces and installations; he transitioned the \nforce from regional commands to train, advise, and assist commands. He \nhelped transition ISAF to a functionally based security force \nassistance mission designated Resolute Support and became commander of \nboth Resolute Support and United States Forces--Afghanistan for the \nnext 14 months. He served as adviser to the President of Afghanistan, \nthe Ministers of Defense and Interior, and the National Director of \nSecurity. His influence during the era of the National Unity Government \nwill have long lasting strategic impacts in Afghanistan and the region.\n  General Campbell is well known for his strategic brilliance and calm \nfortitude. He is the embodiment of all the values we expect in our most \nrevered leaders: the rare tenacity to accomplish impossible missions; \nthe selfless commitment to country, soldier, and family; and the \ncomposition of character that demonstrates only the highest moral and \nethical values. He is known for telling his soldiers, ``Leadership \nmakes a difference,'' yet it is his exemplary leadership that had made \na difference to countless thousands both abroad and at home.\n  I thank his wife, Ann; his daughter, Jennifer; and his son, John, \nJr., who is also serving in the Army, for their years of dedication and \nsupport. As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and on \nbehalf of those who serve beside me, let me express the deepest respect \nand gratitude to General Campbell for his remarkable service to our \nNation. I wish you and your family all the best in beginning your new \nchapter of life together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2746-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2746-S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             100TH ANNIVERSARY OF BETH ISRAEL CONGREGATION\n\n Mr. PETERS.

Initially, families met informally in the \nhome of Osias Zwerdling to celebrate the Jewish High Holidays and \ncommunity milestones. Mr. Zwerdling, a furrier by trade, would serve as \nthe diverse congregation's president for the next 40 years. His \nleadership was particularly valuable given the fact that the \ncongregation, as in many small American towns in the early twentieth \ncentury, operated without a rabbi. Instead, members of the congregation \nvolunteered in a variety of roles, including teaching in Hebrew school, \nleading the congregation in prayer as cantor, or serving as its \nschochet to ensure the kosher slaughter of animals.\n  Early on, Beth Israel hired Reverend Pincus Gropstein, who was paid \n$18 a week to serve the congregation's 30 families. In 1932, Rabbi \nJoshua Sperka became the congregation's first ordained rabbi and served \nin the role until 1934. After his departure, the congregation continued \nto rely on the devoted efforts of its members, who provided a steady \nbackdrop to the contributions of Rabbi Julius Weinberg, who served from \n1952 to 1961; Rabbi Allan Kensky, who served from 1971 to 1988; and \nRabbi Robert Dobrusin, who has guided Beth Israel since 1988 with \nwisdom, humor, and warmth.\n  Beth Israel Congregation was the first conservative congregation in \nsoutheast Michigan to become egalitarian, encouraging men and women to \nparticipate equally in the ritual and spiritual life of the \ncongregation, and was the first conservative congregation in the United \nStates to choose a female president. The community's welcoming spirit \nis exemplified in its longstanding support of the LGBT community, where \nit is an active leader in promoting inclusion in the conservative \nJewish movement, which is highlighted by its advocacy for the \nordination of LGBT rabbis. Moreover, Beth Israel has taken steps to \nensure people with disabilities have full access to the synagogue and \nits services.\n  In addition to nurturing an inclusive environment at Beth Israel, the \ncongregation is committed to supporting the Jewish community at home \nand abroad. Members take steps to ensure that everyone has a place to \ncelebrate\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\nthe Passover Seder, volunteer in the congregation's extensive Hebrew \nlanguage program, and send care packages throughout the world, \nincluding a care package that gave a soldier in Manila and Jewish \ncommunities in Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Uganda the chance to celebrate \nPurim. The synagogue is also proud of its sponsorship of trips to \nIsrael, as well as serious dialogue it fosters on issues related to \nIsrael and the Middle East. Beyond its service to the Jewish community, \nBeth Israel is committed to the larger Ann Arbor community; playing an \nactive role in city's Interfaith Hospitality Network, Interfaith Round \nTable, and the Ann Arbor Shelter Association.\n  Once again, I applaud Beth Israel Congregation in Ann Arbor, MI, on \nits 100th anniversary. The congregation's generosity and commitment to \ndiversity exemplify the values of the people of Ann Arbor and the State \nof Michigan, who I am proud to represent in the Senate. I thank Beth \nIsrael for its decades of service to the Jewish community and everyone \nin Ann Arbor. I wish the congregation and leadership of Beth Israel \nmany more decades of success and may they always go from strength to \nstrength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2747-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NEAL ACKER\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Mr. \nNeal Acker, who at the end of this year will be retiring from a \ndistinguished 12-year career as the general counsel of the Alabama \nHousing Finance Authority, AHFA. Neal graduated from the University of \nAlabama School of Law and was formerly associated with the law firm of \nCapell and Howard in Montgomery. Neal and his wife, Beth, have been \nclose and valued friends of mine for many years and have been wonderful \npublic spirited citizens.\n  The Alabama Housing Finance Authority was established by the Alabama \nState Legislature in 1980 to provide financing options for low and \nmoderate-income families. In its first year, AHFA issued $150 million \nin low-interest loans, but since then, that number has grown by over $2 \nbillion. The last 35 years, the organization has expanded from \nproviding financing to individual homeowners, to capitalizing \nsubstantial housing investment projects across the State.\n  Neal served AHFA through some of the worst natural disasters in \nAlabama's history. Through his leadership and dedication, the \norganization was able to provide temporary lodging to those affected by \nHurricane Katrina and the 2011 tornado outbreak. Throughout his service \nto the people of Alabama, Neal also worked closely with the Tuscaloosa \nVA to develop housing options for homeless veterans.\n  Neal is a brilliant lawyer with great judgment. These qualities have \nplayed a key role in the success of the AHFA. AHFA has been governed \nmost effectively during its dramatic growth. It is certainly one of the \nfinest Housing Finance Authorities in America. Neal has been a right \nhand to this success and helped my office assist the authority in its \ngood work. I am honored to have been able to work with Neal and am \nproud to call him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2747-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING BUENO FOODS\n\n Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a longstanding \nNew Mexico institution: Bueno Foods. New Mexicans pride ourselves for \nour creative and delicious food, especially our homegrown chile. It is \nour official State vegetable and even the reason for our official state \nquestion, ``Red or Green?'' While generations of New Mexicans have \nloved chile in all sorts of forms, even dessert, our famous cuisine has \nmore recently been adopted by food lovers across the world. And that is \nlargely thanks to Bueno Foods.\n  On May 18, 2016, Bueno Foods of Albuquerque, NM, will celebrate its \n65th anniversary. That is a cause to celebrate Bueno Foods can trace \nits heritage to Hispanic farmers and businessowners going back to the \nSpanish explorers who came to New Mexico in the 1500s. The company was \nformed in 1946 when several brothers from an old New Mexico family, the \nBacas, returned from serving in World War II and scraped together \nenough money to start a grocery business. Their grocery was very \nsuccessful at the beginning, but it faced a strong challenge when \nlarger chains started opening up branches in the State. So the Baca \nbrothers set out to benefit from New Mexico's unique heritage, \ndifferentiate their business from out-of-state grocers, preserve our \ntraditions, and of course, expand their sales.\n  Bueno Foods was born, founded in 1951, manufacturing corn and flour \ntortillas, tamales and posole at a time when household appliances were \njust entering many homes around the country. The brothers had another \nidea, too: to take chile, roast it over an open flame as the New Mexico \nautumn tradition dictates, and freeze it so that people could enjoy \ngreen chile year-round. It was a success, and history was made.\n  Over half a century later, you can find Bueno Foods in nearly every \ngrocery store in the State and many others outside New Mexico. From \nHawaii to Washington, DC, Bueno Foods has served as a proud ambassador \nof New Mexico cuisine, exposing new markets to delicious, fiery chile \nand the critical question, ``red or green?''\n  For 65 years, Bueno Foods has made an old dicho the reality for all \nof us. ``Panza llena, corazon contento; Full belly, happy heart.'' \nToday, I recognize the Baca brothers, Jacqueline, Gene, Catherine, Ana, \nand the rest of the Bueno Foods family for the business they started \nand the tradition they still are helping to preserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2747-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2747-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13611 OF MAY 16, 2012, WITH \n                        RESPECT TO YEMEN--PM 47\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Max Cleland Congressional \n     Gold Medal Act of 2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Joseph Maxwell ``Max'' Cleland has demonstrated the \n     highest degree of professionalism and has served as an \n     inspiration to friends, family, veterans, and many others \n     while dedicating his life to the public service of the United \n     States.\n       (2) Max Cleland began his career in public service when he \n     joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps as a young \n     college student, went on active duty in the United States \n     Army (in this section referred to as the ``Army'') in 1965 as \n     a Second Lieutenant, and volunteered for service in Vietnam, \n     rising to the rank of Captain.\n       (3) The Army recognized Max Cleland with a Silver Star for \n     his gallantry in action during the Battle of Khe Sanh in \n     April of 1968. According to the letter of commendation from \n     the Army, ``The President of the United States of America, \n     authorized by Act of Congress, July 8, 1918 (amended by act \n     of July 25, 1963), takes pleasure in presenting the Silver \n     Star to Captain (Signal Corps) Joseph Maxwell Cleland, United \n     States Army, for gallantry in action while engaged in \n     military operations involving conflict with an armed hostile \n     force in the Republic of Vietnam.''.\n       (4) Max Cleland, a Battalion Signal Officer dispatched to \n     set up a radio relay antenna, was severely wounded on the \n     battlefield and, as a result, lost both of his legs and his \n     right arm. Cleland would endure 18 months of extremely \n     difficult rehabilitation and recovery at Walter Reed Army \n     Medical Center and hospitals of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (in this section referred to as ``VA hospitals'') in \n     Washington, DC. In 1969, Cleland testified before the Senate \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs on the hardships faced by \n     veterans returning home from war.\n       (5) Upon returning to Georgia, Max Cleland was determined \n     to continue his public service and, in 1970, at the age of \n     28, was elected as the youngest Georgia State senator and \n     helped pass legislation to make public facilities accessible \n     for veterans, older people, and individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (6) Max Cleland later came to Washington, DC and joined the \n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs as a professional staff \n     member, investigating VA hospitals across the country and the \n     treatment of service members returning from Vietnam.\n       (7) In 1977, President Jimmy Carter named Max Cleland, then \n     just 34 years old, the youngest ever individual, and first \n     Vietnam veteran, to serve as Administrator of the Veterans \n     Administration. As Administrator, Cleland helped create the \n     ``Vet Center'' counseling program, which later expanded to \n     300 facilities nationwide helping veterans and their families \n     receive psychological care for post-traumatic stress \n     disorders and other problems associated with warfare.\n       (8) Following his term as Administrator of the Veterans \n     Administration, Max Cleland returned to elective office in \n     1982 when he was elected as Secretary of State of the\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\n     State of Georgia. As Secretary of State, Cleland implemented \n     the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20501 \n     et seq.) in Georgia and added almost 1,000,000 new voters to \n     the rolls.\n       (9) Max Cleland was elected to the United States Senate in \n     1996 and would go on to chair the Subcommittee on Personnel \n     of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate. In the \n     Senate, Cleland was known for his work in expanding benefits \n     for service members and in improving veterans' health care, \n     education, and the environment.\n       (10) After his service in the Senate, Max Cleland continued \n     his distinguished career in public service by becoming a \n     commissioner on the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks \n     Upon the United States (commonly referred to as the ``9/11 \n     Commission'') and later as a member of the Board of Directors \n     of the Export-Import Bank of the United States.\n       (11) In 2009, President Barack Obama named Max Cleland \n     Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission. As \n     Secretary of the Commission, Cleland is charged with \n     commemorating both the permanent cemeteries of the United \n     States located in foreign countries and the military \n     memorials, monuments, and markers demonstrating where members \n     of the United States Armed Forces have served overseas since \n     World War I.\n       (12) In 2010, President Obama again called on Max Cleland \n     to serve his country and Cleland again accepted. This time, \n     Cleland agreed to serve as co-chair, and eventually the \n     inaugural chair, of the Advisory Committee on Arlington \n     National Cemetery, which was established to help fix the \n     problems facing the final resting place for many of the \n     heroes of the United States. After his tenure as chair, \n     Cleland was awarded the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian \n     Service of the Army, the highest honorary award that the \n     Secretary of the Army can confer on a civilian.\n       (13) After overcoming some of the most difficult challenges \n     imaginable, Max Cleland has spent almost five decades of his \n     life in service to the United States and the country is \n     forever indebted to his service.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 461\n\n       Whereas the Office of Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) was created in 2008 ``to \n     provide independent and objective analysis and supervision of \n     audits and investigations,'' ``to promote economy, \n     efficiency, and effectiveness,'' and to ``prevent and detect \n     waste, fraud, and abuse'' with regards to ``amounts \n     appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan'';\n       Whereas the Office of Special Inspector General for \n     Afghanistan Reconstruction has, under the leadership of SIGAR \n     John Sopko, been a strong voice for the good stewardship of \n     taxpayer dollars;\n       Whereas Special Inspector General Sopko has provided \n     testimony 11 times before Congress;\n       Whereas the recommendations of SIGAR have resulted in more \n     than $1,000,000,000 in potential savings;\n       Whereas one investigation revealed contract bid-rigging and \n     price-fixing that led to the termination of a $1,000,000,000 \n     Afghan Ministry of Defense fuel contract, resulting in \n     $214,000,000 in contract savings to the United States \n     Government;\n       Whereas SIGAR investigations into waste, fraud, and abuse \n     have led to nearly 700 contractors being prohibited from \n     future United States Government contracts;\n       Whereas SIGAR exposed mismanagement and fraud within the \n     United Nations-administered Law and Order Trust Fund for \n     Afghanistan, which provides billions of dollars in payments \n     to the Afghan National Police;\n       Whereas SIGAR has further exposed poor attendance and \n     accounting procedures that allow the existence of non-\n     existent Afghan ``ghost'' soldiers and police, whose salaries \n     are pocketed by corrupt officials;\n       Whereas SIGAR discovered the expenditure of $6,000,000 on 9 \n     goats meant to start a cashmere industry in Afghanistan, the \n     whereabouts of which are now unknown;\n       Whereas SIGAR has attempted to provide accountability to \n     $210,000,000 spent on the construction of health care \n     facilities in Afghanistan, discovering that nearly 80 percent \n     of facilities have incorrect location data, where 13 \n     facilities were built outside of Afghanistan, including one \n     in the Mediterranean Sea;\n       Whereas SIGAR also investigated the circumstances that led \n     to the construction of a $36,000,000 United States military \n     command and control facility at Camp Leatherneck that the \n     commanders on the ground stated they neither wanted nor \n     needed, and which was never occupied;\n       Whereas SIGAR brought to national attention that the \n     Department of Defense lost $29,000,000 worth of heavy \n     equipment, such as tractor trucks and cranes, which impeded \n     efforts to constitute an independent Afghan equivalent to the \n     Army Corp of Engineers; and\n       Whereas SIGAR exposed the Department of Defense had spent \n     $43,000,000 on a Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) filling \n     station, costing nearly 86 times more than a similar project, \n     and that further almost no vehicles in Afghanistan run on CNG \n     and the cost to convert a vehicle is more than the average \n     annual Afghan salary: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Office of the Special Inspector General \n     for Afghanistan Reconstruction for its ongoing role in \n     identifying and reducing waste, fraud, and abuse; and\n       (2) urges all inspectors general to look to the Office of \n     the Special Inspector General for Afghan Reconstruction as an \n     example of the vigor and independence with which the Senate \n     expects inspectors general across government to pursue their \n     duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2751-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2751-S2752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 462--URGING THE UNITED STATES SOCCER FEDERATION TO \n IMMEDIATELY ELIMINATE GENDER PAY INEQUITY AND TREAT ALL ATHLETES WITH \n                      THE SAME RESPECT AND DIGNITY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Casey, Mr. Blumenthal, \nMrs. Shaheen, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Warren, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Brown, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Markey, Ms. \nHirono, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Carper) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 462\n\n       Whereas title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as ``title \n     IX'') requires schools and institutions of higher education \n     to provide the same opportunities for girls that the schools \n     and institutions of higher education provide for boys;\n       Whereas 6 years after the date of enactment of title IX, \n     the approximate percentage of girls playing team sports \n     increased from 4 percent to 25 percent, a sixfold increase;\n       Whereas the participation of girls in club soccer in the \n     United States increased by approximately 37 percent between \n     1995 and 2015;\n       Whereas the participation of girls in high school soccer \n     programs increased by approximately 45 percent between 1999 \n     and 2014;\n       Whereas the participation of girls in team sports results \n     in lifelong improvements to the educational, work, and health \n     prospects of the girls;\n       Whereas the United States Soccer Federation is the \n     governing body of soccer in all forms in the United States \n     and endeavors to make soccer a preeminent sport in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the United States Women's National Team has won 3 \n     Federation Internationale de Football Association (commonly \n     referred to as ``FIFA'') Women's World Cups, 4 Olympic Gold \n     Medals, and 7 Confederation of North, Central America, and \n     Caribbean Association Football (commonly referred to as \n     ``CONCACAF'') Gold Cups;\n       Whereas the United States Women's National Team is ranked \n     first in the world as of the date of adoption of this \n     resolution;\n       Whereas the 2015 final Women's World Cup match generated an \n     audience of approximately 750,000,000 viewers worldwide and \n     more than 25,000,000 viewers in the United States, the \n     largest audience of any soccer game shown in the United \n     States on English language television;\n       Whereas the members of the United States Women's National \n     Team are some of the\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\n     most visible athletes in the world and serve as an \n     inspiration and as role models to young athletes across the \n     United States and worldwide;\n       Whereas the members of the United States Women's National \n     Team, despite the international success of the members, are \n     consistently paid less than similarly situated members of the \n     United States Men's National Team for doing the same job, \n     regardless of the performance of the teams;\n       Whereas a woman in 1963 was paid on average only 59 cents \n     for each dollar paid to a male counterpart;\n       Whereas, in 1963, Congress passed and President Kennedy \n     signed the landmark Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 201 \n     note; Public Law 88-38) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Equal Pay Act''), unequivocally affirming that women \n     deserve equal pay for equal work;\n       Whereas the enactment of the Equal Pay Act laid the \n     groundwork for title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) and title IX, which together vastly \n     expanded opportunities for girls and women at school and \n     work;\n       Whereas the pay disparities suffered by the members of the \n     United States Women's National Team are reflective of the \n     reality of many women in the United States who, more than 50 \n     years after the enactment of the Equal Pay Act, still make on \n     average only 79 cents for each dollar made by a male \n     counterpart;\n       Whereas those pay disparities exist in both the private and \n     the public sectors and, in many instances, the pay \n     disparities can only be due to continued intentional \n     discrimination or the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination;\n       Whereas unequal pay on the basis of gender tells women and \n     girls that, whether on the soccer field or in the office, the \n     hard work of the women or girls is not valued equally to that \n     of male counterparts;\n       Whereas unequal pay on the basis of gender violates \n     generally held beliefs regarding equality and fundamental \n     fairness;\n       Whereas the wage gap equals approximately $10,762 less per \n     year in median earnings for women and their families compared \n     to men;\n       Whereas, compared to the earnings of white, non-Hispanic \n     men, women on average face a lifetime wage gap of $430,480, \n     African-American women on average face a lifetime wage gap of \n     $877,480, and Latinas on average face a lifetime wage gap of \n     $1,007,080; and\n       Whereas unequal pay on the basis of gender threatens the \n     economic security of women and their families while the women \n     are in the workforce and the retirement security of women \n     after the women have left the workforce: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the United States Soccer Federation to \n     immediately end gender pay inequity and to treat all athletes \n     with the respect and dignity those athletes deserve;\n       (2) supports an end to pay discrimination based on gender \n     and the strengthening of equal pay protections; and\n       (3) instructs the Secretary of the Senate to submit a copy \n     of this resolution to the United States Soccer Federation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/senate-section/article/S2752-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 463--HONORING THE MEMORY AND SERVICE OF OMAHA POLICE \n                         OFFICER KERRIE OROZCO\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Sasse, and Mrs. Ernst) \nsubmitted the following resolution;

\n     assistance under this section may be done in phases to \n     accommodate the financing and other requirements related to \n     rehabilitating or constructing the project or projects to \n     which the assistance is transferred, to ensure that such \n     project or projects meet the standards under subsection (c).\n       (c) The transfer authorized in subsection (a) is subject to \n     the following conditions:\n       (1) Number and bedroom size of units.--\n       (A) For occupied units in the transferring project: The \n     number of low-income and very low-income units and the \n     configuration (i.e., bedroom size) provided by the \n     transferring project shall be no less than when transferred \n     to the receiving project or projects and the net dollar \n     amount of Federal assistance provided to the transferring \n     project shall remain the same in the receiving project or \n     projects.\n       (B) For unoccupied units in the transferring project: The \n     Secretary may authorize a reduction in the number of dwelling \n     units in the receiving project or projects to allow for a \n     reconfiguration of bedroom sizes to meet current market \n     demands, as determined by the Secretary and provided there is \n     no increase in the project-based assistance budget authority.\n       (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the \n     Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically \n     nonviable.\n       (3) The receiving project or projects shall meet or exceed \n     applicable physical standards established by the Secretary.\n       (4) The owner or mortgagor of the transferring project \n     shall notify and consult with the tenants residing in the \n     transferring project and provide a certification of approval \n     by all appropriate local governmental officials.\n       (5) The tenants of the transferring project who remain \n     eligible for assistance to be provided by the receiving \n     project or projects shall not be required to vacate their \n     units in the transferring project or projects until new units \n     in the receiving project are available for occupancy.\n       (6) The Secretary determines that this transfer is in the \n     best interest of the tenants.\n       (7) If either the transferring project or the receiving \n     project or projects meets the condition specified in \n     subsection (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project \n     resulting from additional financing obtained by the owner \n     shall be subordinate to any FHA-insured mortgage lien \n     transferred to, or placed on, such project by the Secretary, \n     except that the Secretary may waive this requirement upon \n     determination that such a waiver is necessary to facilitate \n     the financing of acquisition, construction, and/or \n     rehabilitation of the receiving project or projects.\n       (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of \n     subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving \n     project or projects shall execute and record either a \n     continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use \n     agreement for the project where, in either case, any use \n     restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than \n     the existing use restrictions.\n       (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in \n     section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \n     amended) of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent \n     that appropriations are provided in advance for the amount of \n     any such increased cost.\n       (d) For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the terms ``low-income'' and ``very low-income'' shall

The funds made available for Native Alaskans \n     under the heading ``Indian Block Grants'' in title II of this \n     Act shall be allocated to the same Native Alaskan housing \n     block grant recipients that received funds in fiscal year \n     2005.\n       Sec. 215.  Notwithstanding the limitation in the first \n     sentence of section 255(g) of the National Housing Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1715z-20(g)), the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development may, until September 30, 2017, insure and enter \n     into commitments to insure mortgages under such section 255.\n       Sec. 216.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in \n     fiscal year 2017, in managing and disposing of any \n     multifamily property that is owned or has a mortgage held by \n     the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and during \n     the process of foreclosure on any property with a contract \n     for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937 or other Federal programs, the \n     Secretary shall maintain any rental assistance payments under \n     section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other \n     programs that are attached to any dwelling units in the \n     property. To the extent the Secretary determines, in \n     consultation with the tenants and the local government, that \n     such a multifamily property owned or held by the Secretary is \n     not feasible for continued rental assistance payments under \n     such section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of \n     (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property \n     and all available Federal, State, and local resources, \n     including rent adjustments under section 524 of the \n     Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of \n     1997 (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that \n     cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary \n     may, in consultation with the tenants of that property, \n     contract for project-based rental assistance payments with an \n     owner or owners of other existing housing properties, or \n     provide other rental assistance. The Secretary shall also \n     take appropriate steps to ensure that project-based contracts \n     remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the \n     exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist \n     relocation of tenants for imminent major threats to health \n     and safety after written notice to and informed consent of \n     the affected tenants and use of other available remedies, \n     such as partial abatements or receivership. After disposition \n     of any multifamily property described under this section, the \n     contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall \n     be subject to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.\n       Sec. 217.  The commitment authority funded by fees as \n     provided under the heading ``Community Development Loan \n     Guarantees Program Account'' may be used to guarantee, or \n     make commitments to guarantee, notes, or other obligations \n     issued by any State on behalf of non-entitlement communities \n     in the State in accordance with the requirements of section \n     108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974:  \n     Provided, That any State receiving such a guarantee or \n     commitment shall distribute all funds subject to such \n     guarantee to the units of general local government in non-\n     entitlement areas that received the commitment.\n       Sec. 218.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400 \n     or fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any \n     asset management requirement imposed by the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development in connection with the \n     operating fund rule:  Provided, That an agency seeking a \n     discontinuance of a reduction of subsidy under the operating \n     fund formula shall not be exempt from asset management \n     requirements.\n       Sec. 219.  With respect to the use of amounts provided in \n     this Act and in future Acts for the operation, capital \n     improvement and management of public housing as authorized by \n     sections 9(d) and 9(e) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d) and (e)), the Secretary shall not \n     impose any requirement or guideline relating to asset \n     management that restricts or limits in any way the use of \n     capital funds for central office costs pursuant to section \n     9(g)(1) or 9(g)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437g(g)(1), (2)):  Provided, That a public \n     housing agency may not use capital funds authorized under \n     section 9(d) for activities that are eligible under section \n     9(e) for assistance with amounts from the operating fund in \n     excess of the amounts permitted under section 9(g)(1) or \n     9(g)(2).\n       Sec. 220.  No official or employee of the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development shall be designated as an \n     allotment holder unless the Office of the Chief Financial \n     Officer has determined that such allotment holder has \n     implemented an adequate system of funds control and has \n     received training in funds control procedures and directives. \n     The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a \n     trained allotment holder for each HUD sub-office under the \n     accounts ``Executive Offices'' and ``Administrative Support \n     Offices,'' as well as each account receiving appropriations \n     for ``Program Office Salaries and Expenses'', ``Government \n     National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of Mortgage-Backed \n     Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and ``Office of \n     Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development.\n       Sec. 221.  The Secretary of the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development shall, for fiscal year 2017 and hereafter, \n     notify the public through the Federal Register and other \n     means, as determined appropriate, of the issuance of a notice \n     of the availability of assistance or notice of funding \n     availability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary fund \n     administered by the Secretary that is to be competitively \n     awarded. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for \n     fiscal year 2017 and hereafter, the Secretary may make the \n     NOFA available only on the Internet at the appropriate \n     Government web site or through other electronic media, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       Sec. 222.  Payment of attorney fees in program-related \n     litigation shall be paid from the individual program office \n     and Office of General Counsel salaries and expenses \n     appropriations. The annual budget submission for the program \n     offices and the Office of General Counsel shall include any \n     such projected litigation costs for attorney fees as a \n     separate line item request. No funds provided in this title \n     may be used to pay any such litigation costs for attorney \n     fees until the Department submits for review a spending plan \n     for such costs to the House and Senate Committees on \n     Appropriations.\n       Sec. 223.  The Secretary is authorized to transfer up to 10 \n     percent or $4,000,000, whichever is less, of funds \n     appropriated for any office under the heading \n     ``Administrative Support Offices'' or for any account under \n     the general heading ``Program Office Salaries and Expenses'' \n     to any other such office or account:  Provided, That no \n     appropriation for any such office or account shall be \n     increased or decreased by more than 10 percent or $4,000,000, \n     whichever is less, without prior written approval of the \n     House and Senate\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\n     Committees on Appropriations:  Provided further, That the \n     Secretary shall provide notification to such Committees three \n     business days in advance of any such transfers under this \n     section up to 10 percent or $4,000,000, whichever is less.\n       Sec. 224.  For fiscal year 2017 and hereafter the Disaster \n     Housing Assistance Programs, administered by the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development, shall be considered a \n     ``program of the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development'' under section 904 of the McKinney Act for the \n     purpose of income verifications and matching.\n       Sec. 225.

If the violations \n     remain, the Secretary shall develop a Compliance, Disposition \n     and Enforcement Plan within 60 days and must provide the \n     owner with a Notice of Default with a specified timetable, \n     determined by the Secretary, for correcting all deficiencies. \n     The Secretary must also provide a copy of the Notice of \n     Default to the tenants, the local government, any mortgagees, \n     and any contract administrator. If the owner's appeal results \n     in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Secretary may withdraw \n     the Notice of Default.\n       (2) At the end of the time period for correcting all \n     deficiencies specified in the Notice of Default, if the owner \n     fails to fully correct such deficiencies, the Secretary may--\n       (A) require immediate replacement of project management \n     with a management agent approved by the Secretary;\n       (B) impose civil money penalties;\n       (C) abate the section 8 contract, including partial \n     abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all \n     deficiencies have been corrected;\n       (D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, approved by \n     the Secretary under established procedures, which will be \n     obligated to promptly make all required repairs and to accept \n     renewal of the assistance contract as long as such renewal is \n     offered;\n       (E) transfer the existing section 8 contract to another \n     project or projects and owner or owners;\n       (F) pursue exclusionary sanctions, including suspensions or \n     debarments from Federal programs;\n       (G) seek judicial appointment of a receiver to manage the \n     property and cure all project deficiencies or seek a judicial \n     order of specific performance requiring the owner to cure all \n     project deficiencies;\n       (H) work with the owner, lender, or other related party to \n     stabilize the property in an attempt to preserve the property \n     through compliance, transfer of ownership, or an infusion of \n     capital provided by a third-party that requires time to \n     effectuate; or\n       (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies \n     available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the \n     Secretary.\n       (c) The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to \n     ensure that project-based contracts remain in effect, subject \n     to the exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist \n     relocation of tenants for major threats to health and safety \n     after written notice to and informed consent of the affected \n     tenants and use of other remedies set forth above. To the \n     extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with the \n     tenants and the local government, that the property is not \n     feasible for continued rental assistance payments under such \n     section 8 or other programs, based on consideration of (1) \n     the costs of rehabilitating and operating the property and \n     all available Federal, State, and local resources, including \n     rent adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily \n     Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 \n     (``MAHRAA'') and (2) environmental conditions that cannot be \n     remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, in \n     consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for \n     project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or \n     owners of other existing housing properties, or provide other \n     rental assistance.\n       (d) The Secretary shall report quarterly on all properties \n     covered by this section that are assessed through the Real \n     Estate Assessment Center and have UPCS physical inspection \n     scores of less than 60 or have received an unsatisfactory \n     management and occupancy review within the past 36 months. \n     The report shall include:\n       (1) The enforcement actions being taken to address such \n     conditions, including imposition of civil money penalties and \n     termination of subsidies, and identify properties that have \n     such conditions multiple times; and\n       (2) Actions that the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development is taking to protect tenants of such identified \n     properties.\n       Sec. 226.

Section 24 of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437v) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (m)(1), by striking ``fiscal year'' and \n     all that follows through the period at the end and inserting \n     ``fiscal year 2017.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (o), by striking ``September'' and all \n     that follows through the period at the end and inserting \n     ``September 30, 2017.''.\n       Sec. 228.  None of the funds in this Act provided to the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development may be used to \n     make a grant award unless the Secretary notifies the House \n     and Senate Committees on Appropriations not less than 3 full \n     business days before any project, State, locality, housing \n     authority, tribe, nonprofit organization, or other entity \n     selected to receive a grant award is announced by the \n     Department or its offices.\n       Sec. 229.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to require or enforce the Physical Needs Assessment \n     (PNA).\n       Sec. 230.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 463) honoring the memory and service \n     of Omaha Police Officer Kerrie Orozco.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of \nOfficer Kerrie Orozco of the Omaha Police Department. This month will \nmark the 1-year anniversary of the officer's death. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to remember her life and celebrate the legacy of \nthis brave young woman who died in the line of duty.\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\n  Officer Kerrie Orozco was born on September 19, 1985, in Walnut, IA. \nWalnut is a small town about an hour east of Omaha and the place where \nKerrie's devotion to community and public service began at an early \nage. Her mother, Ellen Holtz, remembers Kerrie as a leader from the \nstart, recalling that ``she was my oldest, but had the best sense of \nhumor and kind of took care of her brothers and sisters.'' She was also \nactive in sports, music, and volunteer groups. Her high school alumni \nvolleyball team called themselves the Wolf Pack.\n  Leadership and service were in her blood. Kerrie's aunt, Laurie \nMcNeil, said Kerrie always wanted to be a cop. ``She was just a doer,'' \nLaurie remembered in an interview with Omaha's WOWT last year. \n``Whether it was church, 4-H, everything she was involved in, she gave \n100 percent.''\n  Faith was also deeply ingrained in Kerrie, whom Aunt Laurie called a \n``very strong Catholic girl'' who was always smiling. Putting it \nsimply, Kerrie ``was a saint,'' her aunt said.\n  Kerrie's natural instinct for leadership and service led her to join \nthe police force in 2007. This decision had a special place in Kerrie's \nheart because of a promise she made to her father. Earlier that year \nher father fell gravely ill, and by the fall it became clear that he \nwould not recover. Kerrie made a promise to him in those final moments \nof his life that she would make him proud. Two months later, in \nDecember of 2007, she joined the academy.\n  During the next 7 years, as an officer with the Omaha Police \nDepartment, Kerrie became active in the community she protected. She \nvolunteered with the Special Olympics and helped raise funds as \npresident of the Police Officers Ball. She led a Girl Scout troop and \ntook part in area events like Shop With a Cop. For years, Officer \nOrozco was also known as ``Coach K'' to the baseball team she led \nthrough the North Omaha Boys and Girls Club. This devotion to so many \npeople in the Omaha community earned Kerrie the police department's \nOutstanding Volunteer Service Award last year.\n  Her love of these children was outmatched by the love of her own \nfamily, particularly her husband Hector and his two children. In \nFebruary of 2015, they welcomed the birth of their first child \ntogether, a daughter named Olivia. Their daughter was born premature, \nand Kerrie postponed her maternity leave while Olivia remained in the \nprenatal care unit.\n  Three months later, on May 20, 2015, Officer Orozco was preparing to \nserve an arrest warrant as a member of the department's Metro Area \nFugitive Task Force. When her team arrived, the suspect opened fire and \nKerrie was hit. She was rushed to Creighton University Medical Center, \nwhere she died shortly thereafter. Officer Kerrie Orozco was 29 years \nold and was 1 day away from going on maternity leave to care for her \nnew daughter, who had just been released from the hospital after 3 \nmonths of prenatal care.\n  She was the first female officer of the Omaha Police Department to \ndie in the line of duty. Thousands of people from Nebraska, Iowa, and \nbeyond braved the rain to line the streets for her funeral procession \nand honor the officer who gave her life for her fellow citizens.\n  This month marks the first anniversary of her death, but her memory \nand service to Omaha live on in all our hearts. Her mother Ellen said \nshe often comes home to find gifts in honor of Kerrie, sometimes \nwithout any idea of whom they are from.\n  The Omaha Police Department considers itself a united family, and in \nthe year since Kerrie's death, the common refrain of ``Kerrie On'' has \nbeen referenced time and time again to honor her spirit, legacy, and \nmemory.\n  Several of her family members, as well as her colleagues and members \nof the Omaha First Responders Foundation, are here this week to honor \nOfficer Orozco in our Nation's Capital. I join them and all Nebraskans \nto celebrate the life and legacy of a truly great person, a proud \npolice officer, and a beloved wife and mother. Officer Kerrie Orozco \nrepresents the best of Nebraska and our Nation, and she will ever \ninspire us to ``Kerrie On.''\n  Mr. SASSE.
