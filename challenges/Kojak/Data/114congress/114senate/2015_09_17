Mr. President, the Democrats have chosen to deny the \nSenate a final vote on the President's deal with Iran. They made their \nchoice, but that doesn't mean the discussion is over.\n  Today we will have another opportunity to address the lifting of \ncongressionally mandated sanctions as called for in the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action. Today we will have an opportunity to vote \non a question of policy: Should Iran be left with a threshold nuclear \nprogram, one now recognized by the P5+1, and receive billions of \ndollars in sanctions relief without any linkage whatsoever to other \naspects of its foreign policy adventurism. That is the question before \nus.\n  I will discuss that vote in greater detail in just a moment but first \na reminder of how we got to this point.\n  Here is what we know about the nuclear deal with Iran. It is \nPresident Obama's deal with Iran, not America's deal with Iran, because \nthe President did everything possible to cut the American people out \nand to block their elected representatives from having a say.\n  He refused a treaty, because as Secretary Kerry noted quite candidly, \nhe wasn't interested in negotiating something an elected Congress could \nsupport. He then had to be persuaded that resisting legislation to \nallow Congress an up-or-down vote on it--just as he had to be persuaded \nwhen Congress passed sanctions legislation that helped bring Iran to \nthe table in the first place--would be futile. In other words, he \ndidn't want the legislation that gave us an opportunity to respond to \nthe President's deal with Iran. It had so many supporters, he knew the \nveto would be overridden. Then he finally convinced his party, which \nhad voted unanimously for the legislation that gave Congress an \nopportunity to weigh in on the President's deal, to then deny the \nAmerican people the up-or-down congressional vote Democrats had \npromised. Our Democratic friends went to extreme lengths to protect the \nPresident politically. Because they did, Democrats ensured that this \nwould be not just Obama's deal with Iran but the Democratic Party's \ndeal with Iran too.\n  It is a deal that allows Iran to grow stronger in any number of ways: \ndiplomatically, militarily, in terms of trade, and in terms of its \nenrichment program. It is also a deal that achieves hardly any of the \nObama administration's primary goals. Secretary Kerry once declared \nthat an accounting of Iran's military-related nuclear activities ``will \nbe part of a final'' deal. ``If there is going to be a deal,'' he \npromised, ``it will be done.'' But it isn't.\n  Secretary Moniz once declared that he expected we would have anytime, \nanywhere access to Iranian nuclear facilities. We will not.\n  President Obama once declared that ``the deal we'll accept is they \nend their nuclear program--it's very straightforward''--or perhaps not \nquite so\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\nstraightforward because this deal will not end Iran's nuclear program.\n  Because the President made clear his desire to secure an agreement at \nany cost, it became easy for the Iranians to exploit concession after \nconcession after concession. It became possible for the world's leading \nstate sponsor of terrorism to secure a deal that allows it to enrich \nuranium, to maintain thousands of centrifuges, and to become a \nrecognized nuclear-threshold state, forever on the edge of developing a \nweapon. Iran was even able to secure a multibillion-dollar cash \nwindfall that will allow it to strengthen terrorist groups such as \nHezbollah and Hamas, along with Assad's bloody regime in Damascus--even \nthe President basically admits as much.\n  The administration is now so invested in this deal that it is likely \nto veto any additional sanctions passed by Congress, even those against \nterrorism.\n  Presidents are able to secure stronger, better, and more durable \noutcomes when they seek constructive cooperation on matters beyond the \nwater's edge.\n  Republicans stood proudly for more international trade jobs just a \nfew months ago. The President agreed with us on the policy. We all \nfought in the same corner as a result. It was disappointing to then \nhear the same President dismiss honest intellectual disagreements on \nthe Iran deal as reflexive opposition to him personally. What nonsense.\n  The President made a choice to turn this into a partisan campaign \ninstead of a serious debate. He tried to cut out the American people \nand Congress at every single opportunity. Because he did, he has left \nhis country and his party with an Executive deal that has hardly any \ndurability or popular backing. Because he handled it this way, he has \nleft his country and his party with an Executive deal that has hardly \nany durability or any public support. The American people aren't sold \non it. A strong bipartisan majority of the House has rejected it. A \nstrong bipartisan majority of the Senate rejects it too.\n  The deal can and likely will be revisited by the next Commander in \nChief, but its negative consequences promise to live on regardless and \nfar beyond one President's last few months in office.\n  Those who follow in the White House and in Congress will have to deal \nwith an Iran enriched by billions of dollars to invest in conventional \nweapons upgrades and further support to terrorist groups. Many of us \nwill be here in the future, when we have the need to work with the next \nPresident to decide how best to deal with Iran's ambitions and the \nfuture of this nuclear program.\n  One reason Iran was able to negotiate so successfully was because of \nRussian support for a deal that would be antithetical to America's \ninterests. No surprise then that just days after the deal was \naccounted, the commander of Iran's Quds Force reportedly flew to Moscow \nto secure Russian support for their mutual ally in Syria. No surprise \nthen that as soon as the President had seemingly succeeded in securing \nthe votes for a veto override, we heard that Russia was constructing a \nforward operating base to help prop up Assad. Iran's negotiating \npartner, Russia, will undoubtedly use its presence in Syria to attempt \nto leverage the Western powers to weaken sanctions crafted in response \nto the invasion of Crimea. That, my colleagues, is diplomatic linkage. \nRussia pursued it successfully; the Obama administration did not.\n  The administration attempted to negotiate this deal with a singular \nfocus on ending Iran's nuclear program. Now we already know it failed \nin that regard, but that myopia also has other consequences as well, \nleading the administration to ignore many issues that should have been \nlinked to the negotiations in the first place--everything from Iran's \nsupport for terrorism to its aggressive behavior across the Middle \nEast, to its harassment of shipping vessels in the Persian Gulf--but \nnot just those issues. The administration failed to negotiate to ensure \nthe release of American citizens being held in Iranian custody. The \nadministration failed to negotiate to ensure Iran's recognition of \nIsrael's right to exist. But we can do something to link the freedom of \nAmerican citizens being held in Iranian custody and the recognition of \nIsrael to sanctions relief--something the administration should have \ndone. We can say it has to be corrected before sanctions are lifted and \nbillions more flow into Iranian coffers to be used for terrorism. That \nis what today's vote is about.\n  When it comes to American citizens being held in Iranian custody, the \nSenate voted unanimously just a few months ago to call for Iranian \nleaders to release our American citizens. One is a journalist in prison \nfor spreading ``propaganda against the state.'' Another is a pastor who \ndared to attend a Christian gathering.\n  When it comes to Israel, Iran employs invective against Israel at \nevery turn. It has already demonstrated both the will and the \ncapability to strike out against the West and through proxies and cyber \nattacks at allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia.\n  What this deal will not do is alter Iran's behavior. What it will do \nis give Iran an even greater ability to follow through on these \nthreats. So we cannot allow Iran to be empowered as a nuclear threshold \nstate armed with billions in sanctions relief without at least \nproviding some protection--some protection to Israel first, without at \nleast demanding the release of Americans who have languished in Iranian \ncustody for years first.\n  Let's at least agree on that. I understand there is strong division \nin the Senate--a bipartisan majority opposed, partisan minority in \nfavor--over the broader Iranian deal. But at the very least, at the \nvery least, we should be able to come together over the vote we will \ntake today. So I would urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6774-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate has already spoken and made it \nabsolutely clear that the agreement with Iran will stand. Remember, an \nagreement to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon is what it is all \nabout. The issue has been decided. Instead of focusing on the critical \nissue of funding our government, Senator McConnell has decided to waste \nan entire week on something that has already been decided, twice.\n  First, we are voting on the McConnell amendment, which would keep the \nPresident from being able to suspend or waive sanctions on Iran unless \nIran frees all Americans and formally recognizes the State of Israel. \nAll Senators, Democrats and Republicans, want all the Americans held by \nIran or who have disappeared in Iran to come back home to their \nfamilies as quickly as possible. We believe that Iran should recognize \nthe State of Israel. We believe the other countries in that area should \njoin along. We are very happy with the arrangement between Egypt and \nIsrael which has been going on for many, many years and has been very \ngood for some degree of stability in the area.\n  What Republican colleagues are doing now is very, very cynical. They \nare taking serious issues and turning them into pawns on a political \nchess board. Here is what Senator Stabenow said yesterday. Remember, \nshe is the Senator from Michigan. She has a person from Michigan who \nhas been held in Iran for some time now. Here is what she said \nyesterday:\n\n       The Senate Republican leader is . . . playing politics with \n     Amir's life. The imprisonment of this veteran--this American \n     hero--is being used by the Senate majority leader in a \n     transparent attempt to score some cheap political points . . \n     . and it's appalling. No American should ever be used in this \n     way.\n\n  Elaborating, she told me that his family wants us to stay out of it, \nprogress is being made. Please stay out of it. That is what his sister \nsaid. This cynical tactic is a waste of the Senate's time. We should be \nfocused on preventing a government shutdown. Senator McConnell has \ndecided that the Senate should vote not once, not twice, but a third \ntime on the resolution of disapproval, which has already failed, as I \nmentioned before, on two separate occasions.\n  The results will be the same today. Yet Senate Republicans appear to \nbe\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nstuck and unable to move forward even in the face of a looming \ngovernment shutdown. There are just a few legislative days until the \ngovernment runs out of funding. Democrats have seen this coming for \nmonths and Republicans should have seen it also. Maybe they did but \njust ignored it.\n  That is why we have called for bipartisan budget negotiations. We are \nrunning out of time. That is an understatement. Last week, the \nRepublican leader told this body:\n\n       We only have so much floor time in the Senate. We are going \n     to try to use it on serious proposals that have a chance of \n     becoming law.\n\n  I am sure he should read that to himself again today, yesterday, and \nmaybe tomorrow. But after having made the statement, instead of voting \non this key priority--that is, funding the government--we are spending \ntime on cynical show votes even though everyone knows the result. \nDespite the fact that a shutdown looms in a matter of days, the \nRepublican leader is turning the world's greatest deliberative body \ninto the ``show-vote'' Senate.\n  Ensuring that the government has the funds it needs to operate is the \nbasic responsibility of the Senate. That Republicans have let this \ncrisis build instead of joining Democrats at the bargaining table is an \nembarrassment to this institution. The Republican leader and I don't \nsee eye to eye on all political issues, but we both support a clean \nbill to stop a government shutdown. That is what he wants. A clean bill \nis the only way to prevent a government shutdown, no riders, no tricky \nthings in it at all.\n  Just yesterday, the Republican Leader said, the sequester-level \nspending caps should be lifted. Thank goodness he said that. I agree \nwith him. I agree with Senator McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham, who \nhave talked about this on the Republican side. We all know how this \nends. The Senate will pass a clean continuing resolution. I hope that \nis the ending we all see because that is what we should see.\n  When I say a clean bill, I mean no policy riders, no procedural \nloopholes, just a clean funding bill devoid of tricks. So what are we \nwaiting for? Why are we dragging the country to the brink of another \nshutdown when the solution is staring us in the face? There is nothing \nto gain from delaying the inevitable and much to lose. The reality of \nthe Senate is that the longer we wait, the more difficult the path \nforward will be. In the past, Republicans' inability to govern \nresponsibly has amplified the voice of government shutdown advocates \nlike the junior Senator from Texas. Every moment the Republican leader \nwastes increases the likelihood that one Senator's objection can raise \nenough procedural problems to force the entire government to shut down. \nI am not making this up, it happened 2 years ago.\n  Captains of chaos want nothing more than for the Republican leader to \ntwiddle his thumbs. Every day we wait increases the leverage of those \nwho want to shut down the government. We have seen this drama before. \nIt happened 2 years ago. The Republican leader will need to file \ncloture at least twice if any single member of the caucus objects.\n  So if the Republican leader wants to avoid a government shutdown, he \nshould start the process of bringing a bill to the floor by Thursday at \nthe absolute latest. Time really is running out. Next week, Pope \nFrancis will address Congress. We expect half a million people to come \nfor the Pope's visit to Capitol Hill. The President of China will make \nhis visit the very next day to the Nation's capital. It will be his \nfirst visit.\n  So there will be 3 or 4 days in session next week at the most. We are \nready to move forward. There is no reason to wait any longer. It is \ntime for Republicans to skip the manufactured drama, pass a clean \nfunding bill today, and get something done around here for the American \npeople. For months, Democrats have been clear about our priorities: \nFirst, any appropriations measure cannot be hijacked for ideological or \nspecial-interest riders. Second, any funding increase for the Pentagon \nmust be matched by at least a dollar-for-dollar increase for domestic \nprograms, including domestic anti-terror programs.\n  These are commonsense principles that should form the basis of any \nbudget agreement, but Republicans have refused to negotiate. They are \nnow focused on scoring political points at the expense of the American \npeople. We voted twice. Why waste this time again on another vote? \nThere will only be a few days of session next week.\n  When we return the following Monday, we will have just 3 days before \nthe government funding expires. That is October 1. We should act now, \npass a clean continuing resolution preventing a government shutdown, \nand then responsibly negotiate a compromise. It should be a short-term \nCR. Any other decision is a waste of precious time that we do not have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6775-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE\n\n  Mr. REID. Finally, the number of Americans without health insurance \ndropped dramatically last year. All the press yesterday and this \nmorning are reporting this, but this comes as no surprise. The good \nnews happened as the Affordable Care Act's major coverage provisions \ntook effect. This is further evidence the Affordable Care Act is \nworking. The share of people without coverage dropped in every State in \nthe Union in 2014. That is the first time in the history of the Census \nreports that every State has improved.\n  States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act did \nbetter than those that did not. States that adopted the new law's \nMedicaid expansion had a 3.5-percentage-point drop in their uninsured \nrate. That is about 1\\1/2\\ times the 2.3-percentage-point decline in \nStates that did not expand the program. Overall, the national uninsured \nrate dropped by 2.9 percentage points.\n  Now, all these numbers mean that the uninsured rate is now at the \nlowest in the history of our country--the lowest ever. Once again, the \nAffordable Care Act, ObamaCare, is working.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6775-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Would the Senator please restate those.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, 3 minutes for myself, 5 minutes for Senator Cardin \nof\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\nMaryland, 5 minutes for Senator Menendez of New Jersey, 3 minutes for \nSenator Carper, 2 minutes for Senator Kaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we listened to the comments of Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader. He has given us a ``litany of \nhorribles'' when it comes to the conduct of the nation of Iran. He has \ngiven us fair warning that this is a country that we cannot trust \nbecause of past conduct. I think the point that needs to be made at \nthis moment is I don't disagree with his premise or his conclusion. But \nI ask him and all others in his similar political position: How can \nIran with a nuclear weapon be a better thing for this world, for the \nMiddle East, or for Israel?\n  I think the answer is obvious. That is why the President, in league \nwith our major allies and some not so frequent allies, has brokered an \nagreement to send in international inspectors to destroy the \ncentrifuges which are building these nuclear weapons, to put a concrete \ncore in the reactor that produces the plutonium, and to continue the \ninspection of Iran nonstop so that they do not develop a nuclear \nweapon.\n  That to me is an ultimate positive outcome. Does it cure all of the \nhorribles that have been listed by the Senator from Kentucky? Of course \nnot. But how can he imagine that Iran with its record would be in a \nbetter position--or that we would be in a better position--if Iran had \na nuclear weapon? I do not think so. That, I think, is the issue before \nus. I have to harken back to the statement made yesterday by my \ncolleague from Michigan. She is in contact with the family of one of \nthe prisoners being held there. They are concerned, I am concerned, \nthat dramatizing these four prisoners as part of our political debate \non the floor, which is what the Republicans have done with their \namendment is a risky process. We want these prisoners to come home \nsafely. We voted that way overwhelmingly.\n  Playing them as part of a floor strategy by the Republicans is risky. \nI wish we would not take the risk at their possible expense. So I would \nurge my colleagues to join me in voting against the cloture motion that \nis going to come before us at 11 o'clock to move forward on this \nparticular amendment.\n  I will close by saying, the press reports last night explained why we \nare here wasting a week in the Senate: Because of the Republican \npresidential debate and because of the fact that even some of the \nRepublican presidential candidates reserved a vial of venom to be used \nagainst the leader here, the majority leader of the Senate and the \nSpeaker of the House.\n  It is clear they are under immense pressure to show their Republican \nmanhood. That is what this exercise is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the next vote we are going to take on the \nIran agreement will fundamentally change the resolution before us. It \nis out of compliance with the review act. The Iran review act gives \nCongress three options: approve the agreement, disapprove the agreement \nor take no action. This amendment would provide conditional approval of \nthe Iran agreement.\n  Let me make clear to our colleagues that the framework of the \nagreement is to provide Iran sanctions relief in exchange for stopping \nIran from becoming a nuclear weapons state. That is the yardstick. It \nprovides for inspections and enforcement, preserving our options if \nIran participates in terrorism, human rights, and ballistic missile \nviolations, and the bottom line is whether Iran is in better or worse \nshape to acquire a nuclear weapon under this agreement.\n  I reached my judgment on it, as did 100 Senators. I opposed the \nagreement, but this amendment takes us in a different direction. This \namendment says that if Iran recognizes Israel and releases four \nhostages, that sanctions relief will be granted to Iran. I hope Iran \ndoes recognize Israel, but I must tell you I would have no confidence \nin their statement or trust in their statement if they issued a \nstatement recognizing Israel.\n  Senator Stabenow has already talked about whether this is the most \neffective way to bring back our hostages. One can challenge that. So \nthis conditional approval gives up any of the disapproval resolution on \nthe nuclear part of the agreement. That makes absolutely no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  Let me remind our colleagues that this is September 17. This is the \n60th day of the congressional review, the last day of the congressional \nreview. Quite frankly, this vote is a political exercise, and this \nissue is way too important for us to be engaged in a political issue on \nthe review.\n  We have worked very hard over 60 days to get information. The \ncommittee has worked very hard. We are very proud of the record of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee in this regard. We shouldn't be \nparticipating in this political battle. It is clear this Iran agreement \nwill be implemented.\n  Now it is time for this body to stop taking show votes and instead \npivot to the serious work of addressing the problems with the deal. \nThis means making sure we are working with the Government of Israel on \na security package that will now enable Israel to defend against \nconventional and terrorist threats from Iran; it means making sure we \nare working with our partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council to make \nsure we are collectively prepared to counter destabilizing any Iranian \nactivities; it means making sure we are prepared to counter Iranian \nterrorism, ballistic missile proliferation, and human rights abuses; it \nmeans making sure we are working effectively with our European allies \nto prepare for Iran potentially cheating on the deal.\n  Let's turn to the serious work we have in front of us and recognize \nthat we all need to be together to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear \nweapons State. We stand for Israel's security, we stand for the return \nof our hostages, but let's also make sure we have the strongest \npossible decision to make sure we prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear \nweapons State. Let's work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise as an opponent of the Iran \nnuclear agreement, and I have set forth at length--both on the Senate \nfloor and in a speech at Seton Hall University School of Diplomacy and \nInternational Relations--my reasons why, but I am also an opponent to \nthe McConnell amendment that would support the deal if Iran recognizes \nIsrael and releases American hostages.\n  I have said on this floor--and will say again--that I have a problem \nwith the underlying nuclear agreement. As much as I wish to see the \nhostages released--and have voted in a resolution that the Senate \npassed calling for Iran to do so--and have them come home to their \nfamilies, and as much as I would like Israel to be recognized by Iran \nas a sovereign, independent nation, I am not certain I would want to \ngive my imprimatur to the agreement even under those conditions, which \nthis amendment would do. This, in essence, makes--if adopted--a \nconditional agreement. We in the Senate would be voting to say the \nagreement can move forward if the hostages are released and if Iran \nrecognizes the State of Israel as a sovereign and independent state.\n  I must say I want the hostages back, as does everyone in this \nChamber. I want Israel to be recognized as a sovereign and independent \nstate, although I believe that any such recognition by Iran at this \npoint in time would be temporal, at best, and can only be meaningful by \nactions, not just simply by such a declaration.\n  So at the end of the day, for all the reasons I have heard my \ncolleagues on this floor talk about the consequences of the nuclear \ndeal, surely you cannot be of the thought that as desirous as the \nreleasing of the hostages is or the desire to have Israel recognized by \nIran as a sovereign state, that that would then give you a clear \nsailing for the underlying nuclear agreement. That, in essence, is what \nthis amendment would provide for.\n  We have many concerns as we move forward with Iran. We already see \nthat. Even as this agreement is being moved forward, Iran has given its \nOK to Russia to overfly Iran and then Iraq, where we have spent so many \nlives and national treasure, to send military hardware into Syria to \nprop up the Assad\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\nregime--which Iran has also been a patron of--and at same time to maybe \nvery well establish a military base for Russia. So there are going to \nbe a lot of concerns, notwithstanding this agreement that we have with \nIran, but I, for one, do not want to give any idea that we would \nsupport this agreement--as someone who opposes it--simply because the \nhostages would be released and Iran would recognize Israel.\n  Some might believe that will never happen, so therefore the agreement \nwouldn't move forward, but if the agreement is as good as so many of my \ncolleagues have said it is for Iran, then it might not be a price they \nwould find too high to pay in order to have the agreement move forward.\n  In any event, whether Iran thinks it is a good agreement for them and \nwould do so, I simply do not want to support the underlying agreement \nby virtue of a sleight of hand on something that is desirable and, \nindependently, this body would be united on--getting all of the \nhostages back and doing everything necessary to achieve that and at the \nsame time making sure Israel is truly, truly recognized, not only in \nwords but in deed. That is why I will be voting against the amendment.\n  There are far more serious things, such as renewing the Iran \nSanctions Act, in the days ahead that I think are critical. Many of the \nthings Senator Cardin has been talking about in his proposed \nlegislation will be critical to having the type of response we want in \nIran against its hegemonic interests in the region as well as its \nnuclear ambitions. For that, I will be voting against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, going back to the elections of last \nNovember, there are three takeaways--enduring takeaways--for me from \nthat election: No. 1, people want us to work together; No. 2, they want \nus to get things done; No. 3, they want us to find ways to further \nstrengthen the economic recovery of our country.\n  Today the Department of Labor released the most recent weekly \ninformation on filers of unemployment insurance in this country. They \ndo it every Thursday. They have been doing this for years. Today the \nnumber is 264,000 people. It sounds like a lot--well, compared to what?\n  The week that Barack Obama and Joe Biden were inaugurated as \nPresident and Vice President, that number was not 264,000, it was \n628,000. Anytime that number is over 400,000 we are losing jobs. \nAnytime the number is under 400,000 per week, we are adding jobs. That \nnumber has been under 300,000 for the last 28 straight weeks. I don't \nknow that there has ever been a time when we have seen a number that \nlow for that long.\n  We are strengthening the economic recovery. We ought to continue to \ndo that. There are a number of things we ought to do on this floor to \nfurther strengthen the economic recovery. We need to avoid a budget \nshutdown. We need to put in place a responsible spending plan for the \nnext year. Our country is under cyber attack 24/7--companies, \nbusinesses of all kinds and shapes. We need to have tax certainty. We \nneed to put in place a tax plan for our country rather than stop and \ngo. We need to fully fund a 6-year transportation plan. Those are just \nsome of the things we can do to further strengthen the economic \nrecovery.\n  Are we dealing with those? No, we are not. We are coming back again \nto vote--really--on the same thing we voted on before.\n  Let me just say, with all due respect, do I want the hostages \nreleased? You bet. Have I let the Iranian officials, senior officials \nwhom I know, know that? You bet, every time I talk to them and meet \nwith them.\n  The best way to make sure the hostages are released, the best way to \nhasten the day that Israel has a kind of relationship with Iran that \nthey had not all that many years ago is to put in place and to fully \nimplement the plan that is before us, one that will make it very \ndifficult for the Iranians to develop a nuclear weapons program and \nensure that if they do, we know about it.\n  My message to Zarif--the Foreign Minister of Iran who has been the \nlead point person on their negotiations for the last 2 years--this is \nmy message to him and to the Iranian officials: No. 1, you could have a \nstronger economy; No. 2, you could have a nuclear weapons program. You \ncannot have both. There is a whole new generation of people who have \ngrown up in that country, 78 million people. The average age is 25. \nDoes the Revolutionary Guard like the agreement? No, they don't. They \nwant to kill it.\n  How about the young people who have grown up in that country who like \nAmericans, who want to have a better relationship with us, what do they \nwant?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CARPER. They want us to take yes for an answer, and I would take \nno for an answer with the measure that is before us today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just wish to say a few words about the \nvote we are about to take and about this process.\n  I do not favor this agreement. I have indicated I would vote against \nit. I would like to get to a final vote on the subject and not just \nhave endless cloture votes. It has been offered on the Democratic side \nthat we would go to a final vote if the margin was set at 60. We have a \n60-vote threshold. I say take it. Let's get to a final vote. We have \nseen the end of this movie already. The President has the sufficient \nvotes to sustain the veto. Therefore, this would simply be an exercise \nto send something to the President that he would veto and then have \nthat veto sustained. I see no value in doing that. There is no value to \nour allies to see that there is a split in Congress or between Congress \nand the Executive on this issue.\n  The President is in his last term, he is not hurt politically by \nthis, and there is no reason to do that. So I don't know why in the \nworld we want to go through that exercise or insist on going through \nthat exercise simply to force cloture.\n  I would like to send the disapproval motion to the President--that \nwould be fine--but to not get to a final vote because we are insisting \non doing that seems to me misguided. Let's agree and go to a final vote \nand set it at a 60-vote threshold. That would be fine. We know the end \nof this movie already.\n  With regard to the amendment itself, the text of it, we are talking \nabout our desire to have the hostages who are in Iran released. \nEveryone would like that. Everyone would like to see Iran recognize \nIsrael. But should a whole agreement be based on those two items? No. \nThere are a lot of other things that need to be done as well.\n  As I said, I don't believe this was negotiated well. I think it could \nhave been better. That is why I will vote against it if I have a \nchance.\n  But let's give the Members of this body that chance. Let's have a \nvote on the final product, the process that we set up with the Corker-\nCardin legislation, and not insist on sending something to the \nPresident that would be sent back and that we know the result.\n  I want to register my support of having a final vote, regardless of \nwhere that vote threshold is.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a moment?\n  Mr. FLAKE. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CARPER. First, let me thank Senator Flake for a very thoughtful \nstatement. It reminds me a little bit of what Senator Reid has been \nasking for by unanimous consent for a week or two; that is, to actually \nforgo cloture votes and that sort of thing. Let's just go to a final \nvote, but we want a 60-vote threshold. I think the expectation has been \nfor months that there would be a 60-vote threshold.\n  If the Senator from Arizona is comfortable with forgoing all of this \nparliamentary procedure and to going to an up-or-down vote with a 60-\nvote threshold, I think that is the way to do it. That is the way we \nought to do this. I applaud the Senator for what he said.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Thank you. I do think that this is a serious matter. This \nis an agreement that is important, that is going to last beyond this \nadministration and beyond the next one. Congress should be on record on \nthis issue with more than just a procedural vote. I understand the \ndesire to have a vote by simple majority--that would be the \npreference--but if we cannot get there,\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\nand this is a body of compromise, then let's have a vote, a final vote \non the subject.\n  As to the matter of--let me just say, with these amendments, I will \nvote with my colleagues on this side of the aisle on a cloture vote to \nget to a final vote on these amendments, but if it comes to it, I will \nvote against those amendments, not that I don't want the hostages \nreleased or Israel recognized, but the entire agreement should not be \nbased on those two items. There are other important aspects of the \nagreement, and to pick two as a way to go forward doesn't make sense to \nme. So I will vote with my party on cloture to move ahead to vote on \nthe amendment, but if it comes to that, I will vote against those \namendments.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about President \nObama's nuclear deal with Iran.\n  I have now cast multiple votes to proceed to an up-or-down vote on \nthis nuclear deal. However, according to President Obama and his \nadministration, Congress's review period ends today, even though there \nis still controversy about that.\n  I want to applaud the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the chairman--the ranking member, Senator Cardin, who is \nhere today, and Senator Corker--for getting us to this point. In a \nunanimous vote in our committee, we got this bill, brought it to the \nSenate, and we had a 98-to-1 vote in a bipartisan effort to bring this \nbefore the American people. Today, we are here with a very small \nminority of Americans who actually support this deal.\n  This administration chose not to consider this as a treaty but as a \nnonbinding political agreement. That means in a little over a year, our \nnext President can determine whether he or she will abide by this deal \nwith Iran.\n  My question is this: What can we do now--right now--in the Senate, \nover the next 14 months, to continue to fight this President's nuclear \ndeal with Iran? I speak today to confirm that I will continue this \nfight, individually, if necessary. In the next 14 months I am committed \nto finding ways we can mitigate the effects of this dangerous deal with \nIran.\n  We need to ratchet up sanctions on Iran for terrorism and human \nrights violations and continue to be vigilant in both of those areas. \nWe need to be prepared with sanctions that can be snapped back swiftly \nwhen, not if, Iran cheats, even if that cheating is only incremental. \nWe need a strategy to deal with the increase in terrorism and \naggression we will see from Iran after they get over a $60 billion \npayday from this deal. We need a plan to reassure our allies in the \nregion and to counter the nuclear and conventional arms race this deal \nis sure to trigger.\n  I have been saying this for months, which is why I ensured the \npassage of an amendment in the State Department authorization bill that \ncalls on the administration to produce such a strategy. I refuse to \naccept the world's deadliest weapons getting into the hands of this \nrogue regime.\n  Hearing this administration sell the Iran deal, I am so often \nreminded of President Clinton's deal in 1994. In 1994 President Clinton \npromised our country this nonbinding agreement with North Korea would \nmake America and the world safer. Look at where we are today. Just 12 \nshort years after Clinton's deal, North Korea completed its first \nnuclear detonation test. Today North Korea has a nuclear bomb, and it \nis cooperating with Iran on Iran's program. Just this week North Korea \nannounced it is bolstering its nuclear arsenal and is prepared to use \nnuclear weapons against the United States of America.\n  I fear President Obama's deal with Iran will yield similar results. \nWe cannot allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon--not now, not in 10 \nyears, not ever. For the security of our children and our children's \nchildren, our country, our world, and our future, we absolutely have to \nmake sure that Iran never becomes a nuclear weapons state.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today we have a series of votes that I \nknow may be difficult for the American people, who may be looking on, \nto understand. In the Senate we have a procedure called cloture, which \nsignifies whether Members are ready to end debate and move on to the \nvote on the substance of the bill we are now discussing.\n  We have been on this now for 2 weeks. We have had 12 hearings in the \nForeign Relations Committee, with my distinguished friend Senator \nCardin as the ranking member, and we have had all kinds of debate on \nthe floor. Almost every Senator in the Senate has spoken. Yet we find \nourselves in this place where a bipartisan majority of Senators wish to \nsend a vote of disapproval to the President and 42 Senators are keeping \nus from doing so.\n  If I could just walk through this, first of all, in a strong \nbipartisan, almost overwhelming manner--almost four times since 2010--\nthis body has put sanctions in place against Iran to bring them to the \nnegotiating table. I want to commend people on both sides of the aisle \nfor making that happen. My friend, Bob Menendez, and Mark Kirk on our \nside, together with all the rest of us helped to make those things \nhappen.\n  When this body saw that the President, after we helped to bring Iran \nto the table, was going to negotiate a deal that cut us out--that, in \nessence, caused him to be able to go straight to the U.N. Security \nCouncil and cause a deal to be implemented--I worked with my friend \nSenator Cardin, and others, and we put in place something called the \nIran review act, which gave us this ability to have 60 days to look at \nthe proposal, to go through it, and to voice our approval or \ndisapproval. We have had that debate.\n  Unfortunately, because the President did not achieve what he said he \nwas going to achieve--and by the way, if he had, there would be 100 \nSenators today voicing their approval. The President, when he began the \nnegotiations, said he was going to end Iran's nuclear program. \nUnfortunately, from my perspective, he squandered--squandered--that \nopportunity.\n  We had a boot on the neck of Iran, a rogue nation. We had some of the \ngreatest countries in the world involved in the negotiations to end \ntheir program. Instead, we capitulated and have agreed to the \nindustrialization of their nuclear program. We have agreed to let them \ncontinue their research and development so they can do what they are \ndoing in an even quicker manner. We have allowed them to continue their \nability to deliver intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  We all know they have no need for their program other than to develop \na nuclear weapon. We know that. They have no practical need. So a \nstrong bipartisan majority of this body wants to send to the President \na resolution of disapproval. Yet today what is happening, I fear--for \nthe third time--is that a minority--a partisan minority, I will say--of \n42 Senators are going to block that from occurring.\n  Now, look, I understand procedures around here. I do. I understand \nthe cloture vote. I knew that when we agreed to this bill. We agreed to \nit being dealt with under what is called ``normal procedures.'' We \nagreed to that. I just want to remind people, though, that back in the \ngulf war, this body decided it was going to support President Bush--the \nfirst President Bush, Bush 41--when he really didn't need to come to \nCongress. But he came to us for the authorization of the use of \nmilitary force and that was passed on a 52-48 vote--52-48.\n  What we have happening today, though, is that we have 58 Senators \nhere who disapprove of what the President has negotiated. They feel he \nsquandered the opportunity given to him with our support. Instead of \nending their program, he has allowed it to be industrialized. And so we \nhave 58 Senators here who want to express themselves and to send to the \nPresident this resolution of disapproval. We have 42 Senators on a \nprocedural vote who are keeping us from doing so--42 Senators.\n  In essence, they are saying, I guess, we haven't debated this enough. \nAlmost every Senator has expressed\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\nthemselves. We have had 12 hearings in the Committee on Foreign \nRelations, with all kinds of classified briefings. The Committee on \nArmed Services had hearings, and the Select Committee on Intelligence \nhad hearings.\n  I just want to say that I know many people spent a lot of time. I \nknow the ranking member looked at this backwards and forwards before he \ncame to his own conclusion. This, to me, really is taking on a tone of \nMembers of this body protecting the President--protecting the \nPresident--from having to veto something this body would send to him, \nwhich is a resolution of disapproval.\n  So I am disappointed we are where we are. I am disappointed the \nSenate functions in the way it does today, where a majority of Senators \nwho wish for something to happen cannot make it happen. In this \nparticular case it is happening in a manner, in my belief, to really \nkeep the President from having to veto this, which is what a majority \nof Senators in the Senate would like to see happen.\n  With that, I hope that at least a couple of Senators here will decide \nthat we have discussed this long enough and that we will allow this \nbody to vote on the actual underlying substance. That is, by the way, \nwhat the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act was about. On a 98-to-1 \nbasis Senators in this body said they wanted the ability--98 of us; 1 \nSenator was missing or we would have had 99--to weigh in on this topic, \nand now that is not going to occur.\n  I believe my time is over. I understand the minority may have about 2 \nminutes left and then we will proceed to a vote. But I want to thank my \ngood friend Senator Cardin, who I think serves in a very distinguished \nway. I could not have a better partner. So I thank him for his comments \nas they are about to come and also for his cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Senator Corker and I have been in \nagreement for 53 days of the 60-day review. And he is absolutely \ncorrect that 58 Senators disapprove of this agreement and don't think \nit should go forward. He and I are in agreement on that. We both \nbelieve we could have done better and we should reject the agreement, \nbut 42 Senators believe we should go forward.\n  I thought the colloquy that took place just a few moments ago on the \nfloor between Senator Carper and Senator Flake was the way we should \nhave completed this issue, then have a final vote with a 60-vote \nthreshold. That is where I thought we were headed when we went into the \nAugust work period.\n  We have understood the process, and Americans know where every Member \nof the Senate stands on this agreement. Americans also understand the \n60-vote threshold in the Senate. And they certainly understand the 67 \nvotes necessary to override a veto. This agreement is moving forward. \nWe all know that. We should all be talking about how to move forward on \nthe agreement.\n  What I don't understand is the next vote. I don't understand why the \nmajority leader decided to bring forward an amendment to change a \nresolution of disapproval into a resolution of conditional approval. To \nme, that is totally inconsistent with the review act, and it is \ncounterproductive for those who either support or disapprove of the \nagreement. It is not fitting and not consistent with the work done \nduring the first 53 days of the review, where we worked very hard in \ncommittee so that every Member of the Senate could get as much \ninformation available to make their individual judgments whether to \nvote for or against the agreement. And 58 voted for, 42 against.\n  This vote I don't understand, and I would urge my colleagues--\nbefitting the Iran review and the Senate's responsibilities here, we \nshould be voting no on the amendment that is offered by the majority \nleader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I think I understand the frustration \nexpressed by the ranking member. The ranking member knows I worked with \nhim to ensure that when we had this debate, we stayed away from those \nissues that divide us. He knows I took multiple tough votes, as did \nothers, to keep things in balance.\n  There are Members of this body who feel as if this amendment the \nSenator is talking about is one on which they would have liked to have \nexpressed themselves. Since we are in a place where it appears that 42 \nSenators are going to keep us from actually being able to go forward \nwith the vote on whether we agree or disagree--the Senator and I are in \nthe same place on this. But since that has occurred, I think out of \nfrustration and knowing there were a number of Members who wanted to \nexpress themselves on the way this next amendment is--I think that is \nthe reason that has occurred.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nhave an additional minute so he can yield to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the Senator will yield, do the people who are \nsuggesting that this amendment be voted on recognize that they are \nmaking this a conditional approval vote and therefore that if Iran were \nto recognize Israel, if this were to become law and if Iran were to \nrecognize Israel and release the four hostages, that the agreement \nwould go forward? Do they understand this is not one of the options \nprovided under the Iran review act and it is inconsistent with the \ndiscussions I think we have always had as to what the votes would be on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate?\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I could respond through the Chair, I \nthink what people understand is that 42 Senators are causing a \nfilibuster to take place and that we are not ever going to be able to \nget to that vote of conscience all of us have wanted to make. And since \nthey know that, they understand this deal is going to go forward, and \ntherefore, in order--since these people really never had the \nopportunity to express themselves in this manner--there never was an \namendment during the debate relative to the amendment we now have \nbefore us. I think since they know it is going to go forward, since in \nessence the filibuster is underway that keeps this final vote from \noccurring and a motion of disapproval from going to the President, \nthere is a divergence off of that to express themselves in a different \nway.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute for the chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If the chairman will yield, I understand the frustration. \nThere is a lot of frustration on not getting votes when we want to get \nvotes. But I remind the chairman that every request for a vote on the \nIran review act came from the Republican side of the aisle. There were \nnone from the Democratic side of the aisle. We had votes on Republican \namendments. If you recall correctly, it was a Republican effort that \nultimately led to no option other than to cut off further amendments by \nthe majority leader.\n  Let me also suggest that on two occasions we have attempted to allow \nfor a final vote with a 60-vote threshold so that we wouldn't have to \nuse any filibuster. The Democratic leader consented to a motion to \nproceed without the necessary cloture vote because we don't want this \nto be procedure, and I think everyone wants to vote and has voted their \nconscience.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could, and I very much appreciate--first of all, I \ncould not work with a more thoughtful, diligent Member of the U.S. \nSenate than the ranking member.\n  I think what the Senator's side needs to understand--and I have tried \nto articulate this--is that during these negotiations, we tried to set \nup a privileged motion where it was set up not unlike one, two, three \nagreements that we have. We understood that the minority leader--and I \nrespect this--does not like privileged amendments, that the leaders \nlike to control the floor, and in this case he wanted to be able to \ncontrol his side. So we were not able to set this up as a privileged \nvote. As the Senator knows, we then agreed to do it under regular \norder--regular order--and the Senator and I agreed to those \nnegotiations.\n  What the Senator would be asking our side to do to move to a 60-vote \ndebate is actually raise the threshold from a simple majority, which is \nthe\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nway regular order works. The Senator would ask us to raise the \nthreshold to a 60-vote threshold, which is above and beyond regular \norder. So the Senator can understand how people don't understand why we \nwould agree to raising that threshold.\n  So, look, we understand what is getting ready to happen. The Senator \nand I have a lot of business to do relative to Syria, relative to Iraq, \nrelative to refugees and others.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate functions in the way it does. As I \nmentioned, back under the gulf war, back in 1991, instead of a \nfilibuster, Members allowed us to vote on a--I wasn't here then, and I \ndon't think the Senator was here then--on a 52-to-48 basis, people \nmoved beyond the filibuster and allowed the majority to express \nthemselves.\n  I hope at some point in time the Senate will move to a place where we \nallow the majority to express themselves. This is not happening on a \nsignificant vote of conscience. I am disappointed in that, but I \nunderstand what the outcome is going to be, and I look forward to \nworking with the Senator on other issues.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \nthe cloture motion on H.J. Res. 61.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Senator Collins' 6,000th Vote\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Colleagues, before the next vote, Senator Angus King \nand I wish to make a couple of observations for a few moments.\n  Former Maine Senator Margaret Chase Smith was once known for a nearly \nunbeatable attendance record. She hadn't missed a single rollcall vote \nin more than 13 years of service, but that came to an end one day in \n1968 when Senator Smith narrowly missed casting her 2,942d consecutive \nvote. She had been recovering from surgery hundreds of miles away from \nhere. So it was understandable. Yet I am not sure if surgery, a Tsunami \nor the most wicked Maine nor'easter could stop a woman who occupies \nMargaret Chase Smith's seat today because not only is the senior \nSenator from Maine a fierce admirer of her pioneering predecessor, she \nis also nearly unstoppable once she puts her mind to something, and we \nhave all experienced that.\n  Since assuming her seat in 1997, one of those somethings that she is \nso fixated on has been to never miss a single vote. She blew past her \nidol's record nearly a decade ago. The senior Senator then marched on \nto 3,000 consecutive votes, 4,000, 5,000, and the next vote will be her \n6,000th vote in a row. Only two other Senators have ever achieved a \nlonger unbroken streak. Former Senator Proxmire took 10,252 consecutive \nvotes, and our colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, has voted more \nthan 7,440 times in a row. This means our colleague from Maine hasn't \nmissed a single vote during her entire Senate tenure. She has not had \none sick day in more than 18 years. It is really remarkable, and so are \nthe tales of what it took to get here. One time she twisted her ankle \nas she tore down a corridor, sprinting back to the Capitol from a \nready-to-depart plane. Just ask her about the logistics of planning a \nwedding and honeymoon around the recess calendar.\n  Our colleague is willing to do just about anything to ensure that she \nis here in this Chamber representing the people of Maine.\n  I ask the entire Senate to join me in congratulating her as she \ncelebrates this notable milestone.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is no surprise to me that Susan Collins \nis such a hard worker. She started as a young woman, digging potatoes \nfor 30 cents a barrel at a neighbor's farm in Caribou, ME.\n  I have learned a lot about her over these years. I have served with \nher now for almost two full decades. Hard work and diligence is her \nbyword. We have worked on some things together that have been extremely \nimportant for the country. Some of the things I won't bring up because \nthey might not sit well with some of my Republican friends, but she is \na person who is truly an independent Senator. I admire the work she has \ndone. She, of course, has a good education.\n  I started out really thinking the world of her when she was first \nelected because I learned where she was trained. One of my favorite \nSenators whom I have served with here in the Senate has been Bill Cohen \nfrom Maine. He was a terrific Senator and a fine man. I am convinced \nthat one of the reasons she is as good as she is is because of what she \nlearned in Senator Cohen's office.\n  I served under him. He was chairman of the Aging Committee. I served \nwith him on other matters. He and I were both in the House of \nRepresentatives. We shared lockers, in that little room that they give \nus back there, for many years. I so admired him. I knew when she came \nhere, her having worked there, that she would be good, and she has been \nreally good.\n  I am also impressed with her ability to work with our Independent \nSenator, Angus King. They have worked so well together. They don't \nalways agree on issues, but they are always agreeable on every issue. I \nadmire both of them, and I am so proud to join in lending my voice to \ncongratulate this good woman, the senior Senator from the State of \nMaine.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I know it is not the usual protocol to \nfollow the two leaders who have spoken,\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\nbut I wish to exercise a personal privilege of being the senior woman \nin the Senate and say that on behalf of all the women in the Senate, we \ncongratulate Senator Collins on this enormous and significant \nmilestone. She is certainly in the tradition of a very esteemed \npredecessor from the State of Maine, Margaret Chase Smith, who was, \nherself, a historic figure.\n  Senator Smith was known for her devotion to Maine, her advocacy for \nher constituents, her fierce independence, and for always being at the \nforefront of being an advocate for what is right. Senator Collins \ncontinues to do that.\n  We want to congratulate her because she is a fierce fighter for \nMaine. She is absolutely independent. For her, it is not about the \nother side of the aisle; for her, it is not about aisles, it is about \nbuilding bridges.\n  I believe that if Margaret Chase Smith were alive today, she would \nwalk over and give Senator Collins a great big hug and say: Keep at it. \nKeep at it. We say to Senator Collins: Keep at it for many more votes \nand for many more good years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to congratulate my colleague, my \nesteemed colleague, my esteemed senior colleague for this \naccomplishment. I think it is important to realize--we all know the \nlogistical challenges of making every single vote. What she has done is \nsymbolic of her service to this country and to the State of Maine. It \nis not just making every vote. It is symbolic of an intense, fierce \ncommitment to this body and to this institution and to the country. I \nam delighted that the majority leader and the minority leader have \nrecognized her today.\n  I had the occasion to sit next to her at a function in Maine when the \nvote record came out. It comes out about quarterly or every 6 months. I \nlooked at mine. I had it in my hand. I leaned over to her and I said: \nLook, I have a 98.6-percent attendance record of voting in the Senate. \nShe leaned back and said: You will never catch me. It is true.\n  Of course, as has been mentioned, she sits in the seat of Margaret \nChase Smith, one of Maine's important leaders of the mid-20th century, \none of the most important Members of this body. Every day that Margaret \nChase Smith appeared on the Senate floor, she had in her lapel a red \nrose. So in order to recognize Senator Collins today, I wish to present \nher with a rose symbolic of her kinship to Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith.\n  Senator Collins, what an accomplishment. Thank you on behalf of the \npeople of Maine and the people of this country.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, quickly, before the next vote, there \nwill be no more votes this week.\n  The next vote will be on cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 36, \nthe Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, on Tuesday morning. The \nSenate will be in session on Monday to debate the pain-capable bill, \nand I hope all Members will be here to join in that discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 2640.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Roy Blunt, John Thune, Deb \n           Fischer, John Barrasso, Roger F.

On this vote, the yeas are 56, the nays are \n42.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, by twice denying this Chamber the \nopportunity for a simple up-or-down vote on the President's nuclear \ndeal with Iran, our Democratic colleagues have all but assured that a \nbad deal--an executive agreement that many of them have also \ncriticized--will go into effect without the American people having \ntheir say on this deal.\n  It is clear from public opinion polls and actually from counting \nnoses here and in the House that a bipartisan majority of both Houses \nopposes this bad deal, but by using procedural blockades, our \nDemocratic friends have prevented that up-or-down vote and the \naccountability that should go along with it. For what? For what? To \nprotect the President.\n  As the majority leader has pointed out, the President is proud of \nthis deal. This is about his legacy. He thinks this deal is perfect. So \nwhy are our friends on the other side of the aisle trying to protect \nthe President from vetoing a piece of legislation he is proud of?\n  Well, during the debate, these very same colleagues who have \nfilibustered this bill have stressed that although they support the \nPresident's deal, they remain deeply devoted supporters of the State of \nIsrael. They say they remain deeply concerned about the plight of \nAmerican citizens held hostage by an Iranian regime. But just a moment \nago, these very same colleagues, when they had an opportunity to prove \nit, well, let's just say their actions speak louder than their words.\n  The vote we just had should have been a straightforward vote. The \nlegislation the Democrats have filibustered would have prohibited the \nPresident from providing any sanctions relief to the Iranian regime \nuntil two things happen: No. 1, the Iranian regime acknowledges Israel \nas a sovereign state, and No. 2, the regime releases U.S. prisoners it \ncurrently holds. But with only one exception, every Senator on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle voted against both of those provisions. \nWell, to be sure, they are consistent about one thing: shielding the \nPresident, who is desperate to protect his legacy, from having to make \ntough decisions.\n  I don't see the President particularly shy about making a decision, \neven when it is not authorized by the law, when it exceeds his \nauthority under the Constitution. This President has been the most \nreckless of any President I have read about or seen in my lifetime when \nit comes to observing the limitations and constraints based on the law \nand the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\n  To say the blockade of these important bills is a disappointment is \nan understatement.\n  I know that many of us will continue to work to promote the bilateral \nrelationship with Israel--between the United States and Israel--over \nany sort of association with the world's foremost state sponsor of \nterrorism. Many of us--myself included--will continue to call on the \nadministration to bring our citizens home safely from Iran. We are not \ngiving up. We are not going to quit.\n\n\n                Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\n\n  This Chamber does have a lot of important work ahead of us. For the \nremainder of my time, I would like to discuss how we can come together \nto protect the most vulnerable among us; that is, our unborn.\n  Earlier this summer, horrific videos were released depicting Planned \nParenthood executives discussing the harvesting of organs from unborn \nbabies. The most recent video was released just a few days ago. In \nthese videos, the blatant disregard for human life was underscored by a \ncavalier attitude on full display by Planned Parenthood executives. \nThey flippantly and callously discussed the selling of body parts from \nbabies who never had a chance for life.\n  Without a doubt, these videos show a dark, ugly side to our humanity. \nHow people could become so desensitized that they do not recoil in \nshock at these videos and what they depict is beyond me. All I can \nconclude is that people somehow have ignored the right to life and the \npotential for life these babies represent, under handy catch phrases \nlike ``choice.'' These videos rightly shock the conscience of many in \nour country, stirring even supporters of Planned Parenthood to publicly \ndenounce them as ``disturbing.'' And yes they are, but they are more \nthan that.\n  As our Nation unites behind this very basic understanding of our \nmoral mandate to defend those who cannot defend themselves, we will \nhave a unique opportunity to make an important stride to support an \nagenda that promotes life over death. Next week the Senate will \nconsider a piece of legislation called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act--legislation I cosponsored along with I believe 45 \ncosponsors in the Senate--that would prohibit nationwide nearly all \nabortions after a pregnancy has reached 5 months.\n  Many States, including my State, have a ban on abortions once the \nbaby becomes viable outside the womb. A friend of mine who is a \nneonatologist has told me privately what anybody can find on the \nInternet or anywhere else, which is that roughly at about 20 weeks, the \nbaby becomes viable outside of the womb. So this legislation will \nprohibit abortions after that baby becomes viable, which under this \nlegislation is 5 months. At 5 months, an unborn child's fingerprints \nand taste buds are developing. It is at this stage that many doctors \nand experts believe an unborn child can experience pain. Banning nearly \nall abortions after 5 months--at the point unborn children can feel \npain--should be an obvious moral imperative for all of us.\n  I understand that the issue of abortion divides our country and that \nsome believe abortion should be available on demand at all points \nduring a pregnancy. Well, we took an important step here in the \nCongress just a few years ago in banning the barbaric practice of \npartial-birth abortion--the actual delivery of a child alive and then \nliterally killing the child as part of an abortion once they are born \nalive. Regardless of whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, hopefully \nwe can come together and draw a line--a very clear line--at viability \nof that baby.\n  I would like to point out how vital this legislation is for those \nwho, like me, believe we ought to be advancing a culture of life in \nthis country. Very simply, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act \nwould save the lives of thousands of unborn children a year. That is \nwhy this legislation has garnered the support of groups such as \nNational Right to Life and the Susan B. Anthony List.\n  This Chamber is long overdue in taking a hard look at the practices \ndepicted by Planned Parenthood in these videos and examining our own \nconscience and our Nation's policies that affect the unborn.\n  It is important to point out that, contrary to what some in our \ncountry would believe, the United States has been one of the most \nliberal and most permissive countries in the world with regard to \nabortion. As a matter of fact, the commonsense consensus of most \ndemocracies, most civilized countries around the world, is that \nabortion after 5 months is unequivocally wrong. There are actually only \nseven countries in the world that allow abortions after 5 months, after \nviability of the fetus. Sadly, the United States is one of those seven. \nWe should not be proud of the fact that we are right there alongside of \nChina, North Korea, and Vietnam. Virtually almost all other civilized \ncountries in the world--even if they allow elective access to abortion, \nthey draw an important line at viability, at 5 months. America can and \nmust do better than this. Every life is a precious gift of God, and we \nmust protect those who cannot protect themselves.\n  At the same time the Senate will be considering this legislation, the \nPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act--which, by the way, the House \nhas already passed--the House will be voting on two additional pieces \nof legislation, I believe perhaps as early as tomorrow, one that would \nprovide that children born alive during the process of abortion be \nprotected--this is the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, \nand I believe that will pass the House of Representatives and be \navailable for the Senate to take up later--and also a defund Planned \nParenthood bill introduced by Representative Black, which would put a \n1-year moratorium on funding to Planned Parenthood while the \ninvestigation of their practices depicted on those videos is completed.\n  Right now there are four congressional investigations underway--the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \nthe House Judiciary Committee, and the House Oversight and Government \nAffairs Reform Committee. Those investigations are meticulous, they \nwill be thorough, and we will be able to find out, No. 1, whether \nPlanned Parenthood and their affiliates are complying with existing \nlaw, which prohibits profiteering from the sale of baby body parts, and \nwhether the mothers, who presumably grant consent, actually know \nexactly what is happening to their unborn babies; that is, being sold \nfor research and other purposes.\n  Just this year in the 114th Congress, we have also passed other \nimportant pro-life legislation: the Justice for Victims of Trafficking \nAct, where we preserved the Hyde amendment, which prohibits and has \nprohibited since 1976 the use of tax dollars to fund abortions, with \nsome exceptions, and then the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization \nAct of 2015, which reiterated the law of the land since 1976, the Hyde \namendment--named for Henry Hyde, former Congressman from Illinois--that \napplies these types of protections to funding for community health \ncenters.\n  These videos have perhaps reawakened the conscience of many of us and \nmade some of us who were not aware of these barbaric practices depicted \nin these videos--made it crystal clear to us that there are things we \nneed to do in response, particularly for those who believe every human \nlife ought to be treated with dignity and respect.\n  There should be no hesitation from either side of the aisle to ensure \nwe are doing our very best to protect precious human life, so in \naddition to the ongoing investigations I mentioned, in addition to the \nlegislation we have already passed to make sure tax dollars are not \nused to fund abortions, we must also respond with legislation like that \nwhich the House will pass either later this week or next week that I \nmentioned a moment ago and legislation like the Pain-Capable Unborn \nChild Protection Act which would fundamentally protect the rights of \nunborn children. Next week this Chamber will have the opportunity to \nmake this the law of the land.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today marks the last day of the 60-day \nCongressional review period that was established in the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act of 2015, which the President signed into law. As \nhas been noted numerous times, by supporting that legislation the \nSenate voted to consider three possible outcomes: no action at all, a \nresolution of approval,\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nor a resolution of disapproval. Republicans brought a resolution of \ndisapproval before the Senate and it failed. In fact, it failed on \nthree separate occasions. Thus, the agreement will go into force. This \nissue has been decided.\n  However, numerous Republicans have claimed on the Senate floor that \nbecause this historic international nuclear agreement with Iran is not \na treaty, and because Congress did not expressly approve the agreement, \nthe deal will not carry into the next presidential administration. That \ncould not be further from the truth.\n  Let's set the record straight: history has proven that international \nagreements are an essential element of diplomacy and have longevity far \nbeyond a single administration.\n  Examples of recent nonproliferation agreements in place through more \nthan one administration include: the Helsinki Final Act, the Vienna \nDocument, the Proliferation Security Initiative, and the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime.\n  It is absolutely clear that the Iran agreement can remain in force \nbeyond the Obama administration, as have many other important executive \nagreements. The Senate has spoken on this issue and the Iran agreement \nwill stand.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I concur with the statement of \nDemocratic Leader Reid.\n  The P5+1 agreement is an executive agreement that can remain in \neffect beyond this administration. In fact, portions of the agreement \nlast 20 and 25 years, and others are forever binding on Iran.\n  The United States has concluded other international agreements, such \nas the Helsinki Final Act and the Missile Technology Control Regime, \nthat have endured. The Comprehensive Joint Plan of Action between the \nP5+1 and Iran is no different.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on July 14, President Obama announced a \nlandmark agreement between key world powers and Iran, the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, that removes Iran's path towards a \nnuclear weapon. This is a truly historic agreement that rolls back \nIran's nuclear infrastructure, places severe limits and inspection on \nany such future work, and commits Iran to never build a nuclear weapon.\n  And while Iran's behavior in the region remains deeply troubling, \nparticularly in terms of threats to Israel, this agreement ensures that \nsuch belligerence will not occur with a nuclear threat.\n  Per the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, the announcement of the \nagreement set in motion a congressional review period which ended \ntoday.\n  In the past week, the majority leader has tried three times to pass a \nresolution of disapproval and three times it failed. During these \ndebates, I have listened to many of my Republican colleagues make some \noutlandish claims with regard to the Iran deal. And now, instead of \naccepting this fact, some in this body have taken their displeasure a \nstep further by claiming that because the JCPOA is not a treaty, it \nwill no longer be in force in a new administration.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Throughout our history, the United States has entered into executive \nagreements, like the JCPOA, without congressional approval on a wide \nrange of subjects, including nonproliferation, international security, \nand bilateral cooperation.\n  When President Nixon negotiated the Shanghai Communique in 1972 with \nChina, which led to the normalization of relations with a country that \nwas as mistrusted then as Iran is now, did anyone try and claim that it \nwould no longer be valid once Nixon left office?\n  I also do not recall this argument being made just a couple of years \nago when President Obama negotiated the Framework for Elimination of \nSyrian Chemical Weapons, another example of an executive agreement. And \nof course there are many other examples, including the Algiers Accords, \nnumerous status of forces agreements, and the establishment of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n  Claiming now that the JCPOA ends when President Obama leaves office \nis a terrible break from congressional tradition and threatens to \nundermine American international credibility. Who would negotiate with \nthe United States if they believed such agreements would be abrogated \nwith a new President?\n  These statements are truly reckless. Let it be clear once and for all \nthat this agreement can and will extend beyond the current \nadministration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today is the final day of the 60-day \ncongressional review period that was established in the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act of 2015. By supporting that legislation the Senate \nvoted to consider three possible outcomes: no action, a resolution of \napproval, or a resolution of disapproval. Republicans brought a \nresolution of disapproval before the Senate and it failed not once, not \ntwice, but three times. The agreement memorializes the commitments of \nthe countries whose governments signed it. It will now go into force, \nand it is the solemn responsibility of each of the signatories to the \nagreement to fulfill their commitments.\n  However, many Republicans, as if singing from the same sheet of \nmusic, have suggested that because this nuclear agreement with Iran is \nnot a formal treaty, and because Congress did not expressly approve the \nagreement as opposed to defeating successive attempts to disapprove it, \nthe deal will not continue into the next presidential administration. \nThat is false.\n  There is a long history of international agreements signed by \nRepublican and Democratic presidents that have longevity far beyond a \nsingle administration. If that were not the case, if the only way to \nnegotiate commitments between countries was through the formal treaty \nprocess, our diplomacy would be in dire straits today. In fact, most \ninternational agreements are not treaties, yet they govern \ninternational relations on a wide range of critically important issues, \nfrom trade to public health to taxation to navigation, the list goes on \nand on.\n  If those who are now suggesting otherwise were correct, agreements \nsigned one year, often after protracted negotiations to resolve matters \nof great complexity, would automatically become null and void soon \nthereafter. What would be the point? I doubt there is a Republican or \nDemocratic administration in the history of this country that would \nsubscribe to such an unworkable and illogical notion.\n  We asked the Department of State for examples of recent non-\nproliferation agreements that have carried on through more than one \nadministration. It did not take long to get an answer. They include: \nthe Helsinki Final Act, the Vienna Document, the Proliferation Security \nInitiative, and the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n  There are countless other examples of international agreements \nnegotiated throughout our history, by Presidents of both parties that \nhave never received formal congressional approval. They continue in \neffect unless explicitly repudiated. To suggest that they automatically \nexpire, or are no longer in effect, after the end of the administration \nthat negotiated the agreement, would cause incalculable disruption to \nour international relations and global security.\n  In this case, that would mean that on January 21, 2017, Iran could \nimmediately restart its nuclear weapons program and refuse \ninternational inspections. It is absolutely clear that the Iran \nagreement can and is designed to remain in force beyond the Obama \nadministration. The Senate has also spoken on this issue. For these \nreasons, and historical precedent, it will continue in effect.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, Congress has been reviewing the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action for the last 60 days. This was the process \nset up by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, which the \nPresident signed into law and 98 Senators supported. We have now come \nto the end of that process. A resolution of disapproval, to stop the \ndeal from going forward, failed three times here in the Senate. I know \nmy colleagues and our constituents have very strong feelings on this \nissue. This was a very tough vote for me and one that I took very, very \nseriously. But now this issue has been decided.\n  But that is not enough. Now Republicans are saying that since the \nIran agreement isn't technically a treaty, and because the Senate did \nnot explicitly approve it, the deal doesn't carry\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\nforward into the next Administration. If history is any indication, we \nknow international agreements are a critical part of diplomacy and many \nhave lived on well after the President who signed them leaves office. \nThis is how America conducts its foreign policy with its allies--and \nits adversaries.\n  Many other agreements have lived on through more than one \nAdministration. These includes the Helsinki Final Act, the Vienna \nDocument, the Proliferation Security Initiative, and the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime.\n  It is clear that the Iran agreement can and should remain in force \nbeyond the Obama administration, just like other important agreements \nthat have come before it. The Senate has spoken on this issue. The Iran \ndeal blocks the paths for Iran to get a nuclear bomb and is the best \navailable option on the table. It can and should remain in force \nthrough the next Administration.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I would like to echo the comments of the \nDemocratic leader. As of today, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \ngoes into effect. As the leader said, it is also my assessment that \nthis agreement is an enduring agreement that will extend beyond the end \nof the Obama administration. The leader cites a number of critical \nnonproliferation agreements that both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations have agreed to over the decade and they have endured \nthe test of time and change of administrations.\n  Let's also remember that while this agreement's congressional review \nperiod is complete, there is much that needs to be done by Iran before \nany sanctions relief is provided to them. Iran must, as verified by the \nIAEA, demonstrate that it has implemented the necessary steps with \nrespect to No. 1, the Arak heavy water research reactor; No. 2, its \noverall enrichment capacity; No. 3, its centrifuge research and \ndevelopment; No. 4, the Fordow fuel enrichment plant; No. 5, its \nuranium stocks and fuel; No. 6, its centrifuge manufacturing; No. 7, \ncompleting the modalities and facilities-specific arrangements to allow \nthe IAEA to implement all transparency measures and the Additional \nProtocol and Modified Code 3.1; No. 8, its centrifuge component \nmanufacturing transparency; and No. 9, addressing the past and present \nissues of concern relating to PMD.\n  I also want to reiterate one point that I have made previously: while \nrejecting the resolution of disapproval and other similar efforts was \nimportant for the future of this deal, it is effective, unrelenting \nimplementation of the JCPOA that will be the real test, and it is where \nI hope the critics of this agreement will focus their attention. \nHolding Iran's feet to the fire under this agreement is the critical \npiece at this point, and it is critical that both the President and the \nCongress ensure that efforts to monitor and sustain the provisions of \nthe agreement are unstinting. This will demand constant attention and \nample funding for an extended period. In this vein, I would note that \nthe State Department has appointed Ambassador Stephen Mull as Lead \nCoordinator for Iran Nuclear Implementation. Ambassador Mull is a \nprofessional with a long resume. I look forward to working with him \nmoving forward.\n  I thank the Democratic leader for his comments and I appreciate \nworking with him and my colleagues as we look toward the implementation \nphase of this agreement--both in the near term and beyond January 2017.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I want to concur with the statement of \nthe distinguished Democratic Leader on the long-term durability of the \nIran agreement.\n  Assuming Iran complies with the agreement and takes the key steps \nnecessary to substantially reduce its stockpiles of enriched uranium, \nscale back its centrifuges, make changes to the Arak reactor to render \nit inoperable and unable to produce weapons-grade plutonium, and takes \nthe many other steps necessary to qualify eventually for sanctions \nrelief next year--and then continues thereafter to comply with their \nobligations--this agreement can and should last for many years.\n  Today is the last day of the 60-day congressional review period \nestablished in the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which the \nPresident signed into law. As the leader noted, by supporting that \nlegislation the Senate voted to consider three possible outcomes: no \naction at all, a resolution of approval, or a resolution of \ndisapproval. Republicans brought a resolution of disapproval before the \nSenate and it failed. In fact, it has now failed on three separate \noccasions.\n  In recent days, many of my Republican colleagues have claimed on this \nfloor that because this historic international nuclear agreement with \nIran is not a treaty and because Congress did not expressly approve the \nagreement, it will not carry into the next Presidential administration. \nThat is not true. While it is true that the next President could \ndecide--even in the face of continued compliance by Iran and strong \nobjections from our allies in the P5+1--explicitly to withdraw from the \nagreement, I don't expect that to happen. And unless and until that \nhappens, the terms of the agreement and the obligations of the U.S. \nGovernment--and all other governments that are party to the agreement, \nincluding Iran's--to comply do not end when this administration ends in \nJanuary 2017. Leader Reid has outlined in his statement numerous \nsimilar agreements that have stood the test of time, from \nadministration to administration, over the years. I commend Leader Reid \nfor his statement, and agree wholeheartedly with him.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to express my dismay \nover the votes that took place earlier today on the Senate floor. The \nresolution of disapproval of the Iran nuclear agreement has now been \nvoted on three times in the Senate, and it has failed to advance three \ntimes.\n  Likewise, the House has failed in its own efforts to move a \nresolution of disapproval. The fact of the matter is that the nuclear \nagreement with Iran is a done deal, and the President now has every \nright to move ahead with its implementation, period.\n  Yet we were on the Senate floor this morning, voting on a highly \ncharged Iran amendment that the majority leader introduced. \nUnfortunately, the amendment was yet another political attempt to \nundermine the agreement. This amendment would prevent the President \nfrom providing sanctions relief to Iran-thereby scuttling the entire \nagreement--unless Iran does two things: recognize the State of Israel \nand release four Americans wrongfully imprisoned in Iran.\n  I voted no on cloture on this amendment, and I want to take a moment \nto explain why. To be clear, my vote does not mean that I endorse \nIran's position on Israel nor does it mean that I don't care about the \nAmerican prisoners in Iran. Just because I support this diplomatic \nagreement does not mean I support Iran's reprehensible policies.\n  In fact, I want nothing more than for Iran to recognize Israel as a \nsovereign state. I have always stood by Israel, and its security and \nfuture well-being are foremost in my mind. For those of us who are \npersonally connected to Israel and care for her deeply, this vote is \nnothing more than an attempt to embarrass us and score political \npoints.\n  It should be obvious to the American people that, of course, we all \nstand with Israel--Democrats and Republicans. Since 2008, we have \nprovided more than $25 billion to support Israel's defense. At $3.1 \nbillion per year, Israel is the largest annual recipient of U.S. \nmilitary assistance, which can be used to purchase U.S. defense \nequipment and services. We've also provided $3 billion specifically for \nmissile defense systems, such as the Iron Dome, David's Sling, and \nArrow. In fiscal year 2015 alone the Congress provided $351 million for \nIron Dome--twice the president's budget request.\n  We all want Iran to recognize Israel and stop threatening its \nexistence. We all want Iran's support for terrorist proxies on Israel's \ndoorstep to cease. We all are disturbed by the Ayatollah's calls for \nIsrael's destruction. But the way to truly have Israel's back is not \nthrough this amendment.\n  On the prisoners currently held in Iran, it must be said and \nreiterated: No American, let alone any member of Congress, wants any of \nour citizens wrongfully imprisoned in Iran. These detainees deserve to \nbe brought home, safe and sound, to their loved ones. But, again, a \npartisan amendment does not make that happen.\n  The vote today was nothing more than an attempt to extract a \npolitical\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\nprice for our previous vote in support of the nuclear agreement. \nPlaying politics with one of the most important national security votes \nof our time does nothing to actually support Israel, nor does it do \nanything to free the prisoners. If my counterparts truly wanted to \nenhance Israel's security and free the Americans, they would stop \ntrying to undermine the nuclear agreement with Iran-which I believe is \nour best opportunity to begin to turn a new page with Iran.\n  I stand ready and eager to work with my Republican counterparts to \nachieve our shared goals of supporting Israel and getting our prisoners \nout of Iran. But we have a far better chance of achieving that through \nbipartisan cooperation and working together to make sure the nuclear \nagreement is fully implemented.\n  It is time to move past the repeated attempts to overturn the nuclear \nagreement. It is extremely unfortunate we had to take the vote today, \nespecially given all the other pressing matters before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Gold King Mine Spill\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I want to speak today about a tragedy \nthat hit the American people, the American West last month, and it is \nsomething that didn't get nearly as much attention as it should have. I \nam talking about what has been called the Gold King Mine spill. It \nhappened on August 5. That was when the Environmental Protection Agency \nspilled 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater into a tributary of the \nAnimas River in Colorado--3 million gallons.\n  This is water that contained toxic substances, such as arsenic and \nlead. The agency was doing some work on an old mine when water under \nhigh pressure started rushing out. This disturbing incident raises \nserious questions about how the EPA, the so-called Environmental \nProtection Agency, does business.\n  First of all, it raises significant questions about this agency's \nresponsiveness. After the EPA had this accident, apparently it never \noccurred to them to immediately call the towns downstream and to let \nanyone know this toxic plume was headed their way. The Animas River \nconnects to the San Juan River, which connects to the Colorado River \nand to Lake Powell. These are some of the most beautiful natural \nresources in all of America. It is the source of water for communities \nall along the way. They provide recreation, water for irrigation for \ncrops and for homes.\n  This water that was polluted by the Environmental Protection Agency \nflows from Colorado to New Mexico and into Utah. It flows through the \nland of the Navajo Nation and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe. These \nwaterways are a sacred part of the culture for Native Americans who \nlive near them. So why didn't the EPA get on the phone? The Navajo \nNation was not informed until a full day after the spill. It got the \nnews from the State of New Mexico, not from the agency that caused the \ndisaster--the EPA.\n  At first, EPA didn't even want to admit how bad the spill was. They \nsaid: Oh, it was a million gallons of wastewater. Days later they \nadmitted they had actually spilled three times the amount they said at \nfirst. Four days after the spill, the EPA still hadn't reported to \nNavajo leaders the presence of arsenic in the water--arsenic. It still \nhasn't reported it. It took 5 days for the agency to set up a unified \ncommand center in Durango, CO.\n  Yesterday, I chaired a hearing of the Indian Affairs Committee that \nlooked at how this disaster affected tribes along the route. The \nagency's explanation was disappointing--very disappointing. The \ndisaster happened over 6 weeks ago. The EPA is still not giving out \ndetailed answers about what went wrong.\n  This tragedy also raises questions about the EPA's basic competence. \nAccording to a preliminary review by the agency, the EPA failed to take \nbasic precautions--failed to take basic precautions. The agency never \neven checked how high the water pressure was in the mine, but the \nreport did say the EPA knew about this risk--the risk of a blowout--14 \nmonths earlier, before it actually happened. They knew about it. They \nknew the risk and never bothered to figure out what the worst-case \nscenario would be and what they would do if water actually started \nrushing out. But that is what happened, and they knew it could.\n  The people who live along these rivers are frustrated by this \nagency's incompetence, but they are also frightened. People are afraid \nof what the long-term health effects might be for them and for their \nchildren. Farmers and ranchers are being devastated by the disaster. \nThey are uncertain about whether the agency will be compensating them \nfor their losses--losses that are the result of the EPA's own \nincompetence.\n  At our hearing yesterday we heard from Gilbert Harrison. He is a \nMarine Corps veteran, and he has a 20-acre farm on the Navajo \nreservation. He grows corn, alfalfa, watermelons, and other crops. He \nestimates he is going to lose 40 to 50 percent of some of his crops \nbecause he couldn't use the water to irrigate. The farmer told our \ncommittee yesterday:\n\n       This spill caused by the U.S. EPA created a lot of chaos, \n     confrontation, confusion, and losses among the farming \n     community.\n\n  This was a man-made disaster, and the Obama administration's EPA \ninflicted it upon Americans in these communities. I have spoken with \ntribal leaders who say the EPA has mishandled the spill, and the EPA's \nmishandling of the spill has seriously damaged their trust--the tribe's \ntrust--of this agency. And I don't blame them.\n  Finally, the EPA's failure in this incident raises lots of questions \nabout the agency's priorities. After all, the Obama Environmental \nProtection Agency has expanded its authority--expanded and seized \ncontrol over one area after another. Look at its destructive new rules \non waters of the United States. This agency has declared that only \nWashington can be trusted to protect America's rivers and streams.\n  That is what the Environmental Protection Agency says: Only they can \nbe trusted to protect America's rivers and streams. How then do they \njustify grabbing all of this new power when they can't even protect \nrivers from themselves? They caused this problem. Look at this photo I \nhave in the Chamber. Does this look like the work of a bureaucracy that \nshould be in charge of protecting America's precious waterways? Look at \nthat before-and-after: beautiful blue water running through, then \nthis--sludge, dirty, polluted, and toxic. The EPA caused this. Does \nthis look like the work of a bureaucracy that should be in charge of \nprotecting our national precious water?\n  The Obama administration has focused on its radical climate change \nagenda and has neglected its most basic responsibilities. This photo \nshould not give anyone confidence that the Obama administration is up \nto the job. They are not.\n  Do we really think that Washington should have more control over \nrivers like this when they caused something like this? Does anybody in \nAmerica believe that? Washington did this. The EPA did this. Washington \npoisoned this river this way. The Environmental Protection Agency--the \nso-called Environmental Protection Agency--must be held accountable.\n  When any private company is accused of violating the Clean Water Act, \nthe EPA aggressively pursues civil fines against that company and any \nof the individuals involved as well. Even criminal prosecution occurs. \nIf this were a 3-million-gallon toxic spill caused by private citizens, \nthe EPA would act aggressively against those people. The EPA would \nnever accept the kind of feeble, half apologies and explanations we \nhave heard so far from this administration and from the Director of the \nEPA who testified yesterday. There is clearly a double standard between \nthe way the EPA treats itself and the way it treats everyone else.\n  The EPA failed--it failed--to do the proper planning before it caused \nthis disaster. I believe it has also failed to do the proper work \nbefore writing regulations, such as its waters of the United States \nrule and its so-called Clean Power Plan.\n  With this spill, the agency's careless approach has done terrible \ndamage to\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\nAmericans living along the Animas River and other waterways. Its \nreckless and irresponsible regulations will have a devastating effect \non the jobs and the lives of millions of Americans all across the \ncountry.\n  At our hearing yesterday the EPA administrator continued to try to \ndownplay the impact of its actions--downplay the impact of its actions. \nThe agency needs to step back and rethink its priorities. This disaster \nhappened because the EPA is inept at its job. There should be no more \ntrying to deflect attention from the failure of the EPA--no more trying \nto grab additional power that it can use to do more damage.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has been out of control for far \ntoo long. It is time for Congress and President Obama to hold the EPA \naccountable for its failures, and it is time to rein in this runaway \nbureaucracy before it does more damage to our communities, to our \neconomy, and to our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Strategy Against ISIL\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss our strategy \nagainst ISIL.\n  Yesterday at our Armed Services Committee, we held a hearing on this \ntopic. Instead of reassuring me that our mission was on the right path, \nthe testimony provided further evidence that the administration must \nchange their approach. I agree with the President's stated goal of \ndegrading and destroying ISIL, but the steps we have taken thus far \nwill not achieve ISIL's defeat. Indeed, the root of the problem seems \nto be that our strategy does not connect with events on the ground. \nThere is no better example of this than our plan to train and equip the \nso-called moderate Syrian troops.\n  At the end of last year, Congress approved the President's request of \n$500 million for the purpose of building a force of moderate Syrian \nfighters. Testifying in September of last year, then-Secretary of \nDefense Hagel laid out the administration's plan to build a force of \nabout 5,000 fighters in 1 year. General Dempsey, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, added his assessment that about 12,000 fighters \nwould need to be trained for the force to have an effect on the \nbattlefield.\n  Initial results were expected within 8 to 12 months. At that time, \nmany Members, including myself, questioned whether those goals were \nattainable and whether this assumption--that we could fight a war \nwithout taking on significant risk because local partners would provide \nground forces--was even realistic.\n  Let's consider where we are today, about 10 months later. According \nto public reports, the program produced about 60 fighters, and, upon \ntheir return to Syria, they were attacked by Al Qaeda-affiliated \nforces.\n  General Austin testified yesterday before our committee. In response \nto my questioning, he said that only four or five of those fighters \nremain. Again, we expected 5,000, and 4 or 5 remain. I wish I could say \nthe complete failure of this strategy comes as a surprise. \nUnfortunately, I cannot. While ISIL has lost some territory in \nnortheastern Syria, it has expanded its control in the western half of \nthat country.\n  Iraq is a similar story. Recruits for U.S. training programs remain \nbelow expectations, with U.S. forces training just over half the number \nof Iraqis expected, and progress on the battlefield is uneven. It is \nplain to see why General Dempsey, our most senior uniformed military \nofficer, has recently characterized the fight as ``tactically \nstalemated.''\n  The question is, What are we going to do? How will our approach \nchange? What can we do to break that stalemate? What can we do to begin \nrolling back this tremendous threat?\n  I attended yesterday's hearing with those questions in mind, and I \nwas extremely disappointed to hear that no real change was in order. To \nbe fair, press reports indicate that changes are being considered, such \nas deploying graduates of our training program in groups larger than 50 \nor in safer areas of the country.\n  But even if such minor adjustments are made, they will not alter the \nbasic fact that the idea of a new Syrian force is a complete fantasy \nunder our current approach.\n  Perhaps in recognition of this, another report has surfaced that \nsuggests the administration is no longer attempting to build a moderate \nground force in Syria. Instead, they will simply train Syrians to \ndirect U.S. air strikes and then embed them within existing rebel \nbrigades.\n  If our experience thus far indicates that very few moderate groups \nremain on the battlefield, we will either be providing air support to a \ncontingent too small to make a difference or we will be providing it to \ngroups that are too extreme to currently warrant any support from us.\n  Again, I support the President's goal to destroy ISIL, but I don't \nsee how anyone can believe this program is going to accomplish it. \nInstead of providing a new direction, the message this administration \nis sending is that they will stay the course. I admit I share the \ncomplete confusion expressed by some of my colleagues yesterday when we \nlearned of this situation.\n  This White House acknowledges that the training programs in Syria and \nIraq--the linchpins of our strategy--have vastly underperformed. They \nexpress moral outrage at ISIL's barbarity, as well as grave concern for \nthe plight of the 4 million refugees that have fled the country and \nsorrow for the 250,000 that have lost their lives. Our military \ncharacterizes the conflict as a stalemate. But, apparently, the \nadministration feels no change is necessary. We are told the long-term \ntrajectory is favorable, and ISIL's future, as General Dempsey put it, \nis ``increasingly dim.'' I appreciate the fact that patience is \nrequired when it comes to military operations, but at the same time, \npatience doesn't fill the fundamental gaps in this administration's \nstrategy. And the idea that we can wait ISIL out seems to overlook the \ndeath, destruction, and collateral damage its continued presence \ninflicts on the neighboring countries or to at least suggest that it is \ntolerable.\n  I have visited the region several times. Our allies there cannot \nsustain the strain of this conflict for years on end. I have visited a \nSyrian refugee camp in Turkey. Those people cannot wait there forever. \nLest we forget, colleagues, this conflict has been raging for 4 years. \nSadly, the flood of refugees reaching Europe was entirely predictable.\n  And how long before a divided Iraq becomes irreparable? As long as \nISIL exists and continues to exercise initiative on the battlefield, it \nwill draw recruits, expand its global network, and inspire those ``lone \nwolf'' attacks. Its ability to execute attacks against Europe and the \nUnited States will improve as more foreign fighters pass through its \nranks and then return to their home countries. These are the very \nreasons Congress supported taking military action against ISIL in the \nfirst place, but I certainly did not support the deployment of forces \nto establish a stalemate.\n  When our soldiers are put in harm's way, we shouldn't be content to \njust ``patiently'' leave them there, with no strategy to achieve our \ngoals. As my colleague Senator McCain--who has been a tireless advocate \non this issue--has pointed out, there are a variety of options \navailable to the President between the current approach and deploying \nlarge amounts of troops on the ground. With only a stalemate to show \nfor the thousands of soldiers we have deployed, the 5,000 air strikes \nthat we have conducted, and the past year we have spent training \nSyrians and Iraqis, I think these options deserve reconsideration.\n  The President has stated that ``all wars must end'' and that our \ncountry ``must move off a permanent war footing.'' I believe the best \nway to do so is by crafting a strategy that plans for victory.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to note my appreciation of Secretary \nCarter and General Austin for their frank testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. Both men have come before our panel and they \nhave\n\n[[Page S6787]]\n\nprovided honest assessments and also specific figures about the results \nof the Syria training program, for which they have received significant \nmedia scrutiny.\n  The point of a public hearing is to provide the American people and \ntheir representatives in Congress with the information they need to \nknow so we can make informed policy decisions. I sincerely hope more \nwitnesses follow their example and justly uphold the valuable tradition \nof congressional oversight by not shying away from discussing these \nvery difficult topics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 20 minutes as in morning business and to share the time with the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Remembering Congressman Louis Stokes\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I am joined by my colleague on the floor \ntoday, both of us longtime friends of the now late Congressman Louis \nStokes. Senator Portman and I sat together at Congressman Stokes' \nfuneral at Olivette Church in Cleveland just a couple of weeks ago. We \nboth called Lou a friend. I wish to speak about him, and then I know \nSenator Portman would like to speak about his friendship and his \nalliances and allegiances and work with Congressman Stokes.\n  He grew up in a Federal housing project in Cleveland. His father \nworked in a laundromat. His father passed away when Lou was 3, leaving \nhis mother with two young sons to raise. A former sharecropper and \ndescendant of slaves, she cleaned houses to support her sons and \nencouraged them to get an education.\n  Lou shined shoes to earn money for the family. He served in the Army \nduring World War II--probably a pretty segregated Army. He served and \nwent to college at Case Western at night on the GI bill.\n  From public housing, to public education, to public investment in our \nservicemembers, Congressman Stokes' life accomplishments show how \ngovernment makes a difference in people's lives--something he \npassionately believed in--the partnership between government and \ncommunities, between the Federal Government and what we can do together \nas a country. In the 20th century, our country made great strides in \nthat public investment and in expanding opportunity, paving the way for \npeople like Congressman Stokes to become national and community \nleaders. What this country gave to Lou Stokes he gave back many times \nover.\n  The seeds for his career of service were sowed in many places, in \nmany fields, but particularly, he used to say, in the Army when he was \nstationed in the Deep South during the days of segregation. He was \nappalled by the inequalities he witnessed, even for those wearing the \nuniform and serving our country. He said once:\n\n       I remember being moved from Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis \n     to Camp Stewart, Georgia, through Memphis. They stopped the \n     train there to eat lunch. The first dining room was all white \n     soldiers; the next dining room was German POWs. A black \n     curtain separated the black soldiers from the German POWs. It \n     was one of the first times it really hit me.\n\n  He would go on to dedicate his life to fighting those inequalities.\n  He and his brother Carl opened a law firm in Cleveland. The first \ncases were civil rights cases. Congressman Stokes took on cases both \nbig and small, including the landmark stop-and-frisk Supreme Court case \nTerry v. Ohio. Again and again throughout his legal career, he fought \nfor the interests of the powerless against the powerful--the same as he \ndid in Congress.\n  In 1965 Louis and Carl Stokes represented the local NAACP in \nchallenging Ohio's congressional map.\n  Around that time, Congressman Stokes' brother Carl was elected mayor \nof the city of Cleveland in a second attempt, and Cleveland then became \nthe largest city in America which had elected a Black mayor.\n  The new district map created from the lawsuit I mentioned brought \nOhio's first African-American majority district in 1968. Lou Stokes won \nthat seat and became the first African American to represent Ohio in \nCongress. In only his second term in the House, he became the first \nAfrican American in the Nation's history to serve on the House \nAppropriations Committee. He didn't use his success to seek glory for \nhimself; he used his commanding position to expand opportunities not \njust in his own district in Cleveland--so important to those of us who \nlive in Cleveland and those of us who represent Ohio--but he used his \nposition to help African-American communities all over the country. He \nwas immediately--and he earned it--more and more beloved in the Black \ncommunities in every city in Ohio, including from Mansfield, where I \ngrew up, to Akron, to Columbus and Cincinnati, to Dayton and Toledo and \nthe smaller cities.\n  He gave those who were too often ignored a voice in Washington, where \nit could make the most difference. He secured money for housing, urban \ndevelopment, health care, jobs programs, education, and for colleges \nprimarily serving people of color.\n  He was a strong advocate for unions. He cared greatly about the trade \nunion movement. He knew the trade union movement gave great opportunity \nto African Americans, especially in cities like Cleveland. He stood up \nfor collective bargaining. He stood up for the rights of workers \neverywhere. And to give a permanent and powerful voice to people of \ncolor, he helped to form the Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Congressman Stokes' accomplishments are many. We honor him today with \nour words and with this resolution Senator Portman and I are \nintroducing. We should strive to honor and continue to honor him each \nday.\n  Here is how we do it, and I will close with this. On a Sunday night, \n2 days before the 2008 elections, Senator Obama--a colleague of mine at \nthe time in the Senate--was campaigning in Cleveland for President. It \nwas two nights before the election.\n  As Senator Portman and I remind our colleagues, Ohio is perhaps the \nNation's No. 1 swing State. I know the Presiding Officer thinks they \nelect Presidents in her State, but we really do elect Presidents in the \nState of Ohio.\n  So then-Senator Obama came to Ohio the Sunday night before the \nelection to a rally estimated at between 70,000 and 80,000 people. As \nPresidential candidates almost inevitably and invariably are at the end \nof campaigns, he was about an hour late. Bruce Springsteen took the \nstage. A number of us spoke at the rally.\n  Before Senator Obama arrived, I had the honor--and it became one of \nmy greatest memories ever of public service--I stood beside and behind \nthe grandstand and had a conversation of about 45 minutes to an hour \nwith Congressman Stokes, who was retired at that point; Rev. Otis Moss, \nwho delivered his eulogy a couple of weeks ago; and Mrs. Edwina Moss. I \njust listened to them for 45 minutes talk about what it meant to them \nthat we were this close to electing an African-American President. \nThey, frankly, didn't think it would happen in their lifetimes. They \nweren't even sure, the polls notwithstanding, that it was going to \nhappen in 2008. The excitement and the sense of history and the awe and \nthe depth of feeling Congressman Stokes and Edwina Moss and Reverend \nMoss exhibited during that 45 minutes--talking, reminiscing about \nmemories, thinking of the future--to my wife Connie and me was \nsomething I will never forget.\n  Since then, Citizen Stokes--former Congressman--who cared so deeply \nabout this, was so happy we passed the Affordable Care Act. He was so \nhappy we did things such as the auto rescue to get our State's economy \nback and going again. He cared so much about voting rights. He was so \ntroubled by the Supreme Court decisions. He was so hopeful that our \ncountry could get back on track in a bipartisan way to build this \neconomy, to pass voting rights, to do all of the things he devoted his \nlife to first as a young lawyer, then as a Congressman, and then as one \nof Ohio's most prominent citizens, to continue to speak out on these \nissues that matter to all of us.\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\n  We should honor his life and legacy by continuing Congressman Stokes' \nwork for equality and justice in the lives of others. We honor him. We \nconsidered him a friend, and I know Senator Portman did too.\n  I am thrilled to be able to stand on the floor and speak for a few \nmoments about my friend, the late Congressman Stokes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his \nremarks and for joining me here on the floor to talk about our former \ncolleague and friend, Congressman Louis Stokes. He was an amazing guy. \nHe was a true American success story and a true son of Ohio who \ndedicated his entire life to public service, whether he was in elected \noffice or not.\n  I think my colleague Senator Brown has done a really nice job \nspeaking about his humble beginnings.\n  Lou Stokes grew up without the benefit of having a dad around. He \ngrew up in a poor household but with a lot of pride. His mom pushed him \nto get an education and to be the best he could, as clearly she did \nwith her other son, Louis's brother Carl.\n  After growing up in Cleveland, he spent a few years in the Army, \nwhich had a big impression on him. He then went to Cleveland-Marshall \nCollege of Law. He was a successful attorney and actually argued three \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court. So he had a career in law that was \ndistinguished even before getting into politics.\n  Senator Brown talked about his brother Carl and the fact that when he \nwas elected the mayor of Cleveland, it then became the largest city in \nAmerica which had elected a Black mayor. Louis Stokes told me he saw \nthat and that is what inspired him to think maybe he should get \ninvolved in public service in that way as well. So he ran for office. \nHe got elected to the House of Representatives. He was the first \nAfrican-American Congressperson from Ohio; that was in 1968. He would \nlater become the first African American to sit on the Appropriations \nCommittee. So a lot of firsts.\n  As Congressman, he served for 30 years. He became a very influential \nMember. Senator Brown and I had a chance to serve with him there. He \nrepresented his district faithfully, but he also played a pivotal role \nin broader issues well beyond his district. His involvement in civil \nrights was mentioned, as well as certainly education and justice \nissues.\n  I was a proud cosponsor of a number of bills with him. We \ncollaborated on one project in particular called the National \nUnderground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, where he helped me \ntremendously. This was in my hometown, not in his town. As a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee, he was critical to getting that freedom \ncenter up and going, which is a national center that resides today on \nthe banks of the Ohio River.\n  We also wrote legislation to connect all the Underground Railroad \nsites around the country, many of which were in disrepair and in danger \nof being lost, and that is the Network to Freedom Act that continues \ntoday to get the Park Service involved in protecting these sites.\n  It was always a pleasure to work with him, and he was a loyal and \ntrusted legislative partner.\n  He then went to the Squire Sanders law firm, and I was honored again \nto call him a colleague when I worked there after leaving government \nand before running for the Senate. So we had a chance to get to know \neach other better outside of the legislative branch. He had a great \ncareer, as Senator Brown just said.\n\n  What I admired about him most was his interest and ability in getting \nto a result. He was not about giving fancy speeches or rhetoric. He was \nabout coming up with solutions to help the people he represented in \nCleveland, and I think in his heart well beyond Cleveland, and that is \nwhy he was so effective.\n  He didn't get sidetracked by the partisanship and political attacks. \nHe kept focused, and he made a big difference. He had a meaningful \nimpact on lives in his district and well beyond.\n  All you have to do is go through Cleveland to see his impact. It is \nhard not to see a landmark named after him or his brother Carl. Among \nthose is the Louis Stokes Public Annex to the Cleveland Public Library, \nas well as the Louis Stokes Health Sciences Center at Case Western \nReserve University.\n  I remember going to his retirement party from the Squires Sanders law \nfirm. I had rushed there from another meeting and had gone through \ntown, and as I arrived I said: Let's just name the town after Lou \nStokes, because I was on Stokes Street and went by the Stokes library \nand the Stokes Health Center. So those were all assessments of the \nimpact he had on his community.\n  He was a very strong family man, a loving husband to his beautiful \nwife Jay of more than 50 years, and he was very proud of his kids. Each \nof them in their own right has gone on to distinguished careers. His \ngrandchildren spoke at the funeral where Senator Brown and I were, and, \nboy, were they articulate. They were just really impressive. He had so \nmuch to be proud of.\n  I had the opportunity to visit him just before he passed, and the \nlast thing he said to me is: I am so lucky, Rob. I am so lucky to have \nhad a great family. That is what he talked about to me in our final \nmoments together.\n  He was determined and he was successful, no question about it, but he \ndid it in a gentlemanly way. He had a great smile, a good sense of \nhumor. His laughter could light up a room, and it did. I was just very \ngrateful to call him a friend and to have him as a respected colleague, \nto watch him as an effective leader. He has made an impression on me, \nand he has made an indelible impact on the State of Ohio. He will be \nmissed as an effective leader, a great leader for Ohio, and a loyal \nfriend.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                            Budget Deadline\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, right now we are on a course for yet another \nRepublican government shutdown in just 13 days. We know what this looks \nlike and how damaging it is because we saw it 2 years ago when tea \nparty Republicans dug in their heels and tried to use shutdown threats \nto repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n  We know that during the 16-day shutdown that followed the tea party \ntantrum, workers across our country didn't know when they would get \ntheir next paycheck, businesses felt the sting of fewer customers, and \nfamilies across our country lost even more trust that elected officials \nin our country could even get anything done. After all that--after all \nthe damage families and communities felt--we also know that the 2013 \ngovernment shutdown actually did nothing to stop the Affordable Care \nAct.\n  Once that shutdown ended, I was proud to work with the Republican \nBudget chairman, Paul Ryan, to do what we shouldn't have needed a \nshutdown to get done, and that was negotiate a 2-year bipartisan budget \ndeal that prevented another government shutdown. It restored critical \ninvestments in priorities like education, research, and defense jobs, \nand it showed families their government can get something done when \nboth sides are willing to come to the table and compromise.\n  I was hopeful that after the economy-rattling exercise in futility \nand the bipartisan deal that came out of it, Republican leaders would \nhave learned a few lessons. Well, 2 years later, as our bipartisan deal \nis set to expire, here we are with another Republican government \nshutdown around the corner.\n  What are the leaders doing about this? What is their plan to avoid a \nrepeat of 2013? Are they working with Democrats to keep government open \nand negotiate a budget deal as we have been pushing them to do for \nmonths? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Instead, just days away from a \nlooming fiscal deadline, Republicans are back as far into their \npartisan corner as they can get and are focused on their political \npastime--attacking women's health.\n  Instead of spending the coming weeks working to avoid a budget \ncrisis, which is what we should be doing, Republicans are unbelievably \nplanning to vote on yet another restriction on women's health and \nrights. This is transparent pandering that is bad for\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\nwomen, bad for our economy, and bad for our country.\n  People across the country are watching this, and they are appalled. \nThis particular bill that is coming to the floor next week is an \nextreme, unconstitutional abortion ban, which would restrict a woman's \nconstitutionally protected right to make her own choices about her own \nhealth and her own body. That bill would mean that if a young woman \nendures rape or incest, she would have to go to the police before \ngetting the care she needs, and it would take away the right to choose \nfrom adult victims of incest entirely. Finally, that bill would allow \npoliticians in Washington, DC, to get between a woman and her doctor by \nmaking it a crime for doctors to provide health care their patients \nneed.\n  This kind of dangerous, extreme legislation might appeal to the tea \nparty, but it is going nowhere. Voting on it certainly will not keep \nthe government open and, just like the Republican attacks on the \nAffordable Care Act 2 years ago, this latest GOP effort to turn back \nthe clock on women's health is a dead end.\n  A new report from the CBO shows that if Republicans get their way and \nPlanned Parenthood loses funding, as many as 630,000 women will not be \nable to get birth control. Hundreds of thousands of women, many of whom \ndo not have convenient access to health care clinics or providers \nbesides Planned Parenthood, would experience reduced access to their \nhealth care.\n  It is appalling that in the 21st century, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are pushing to take health care away from women who \nneed it.\n  Let me be very clear. Democrats are not going to allow Republican \npolitical pandering come before women's health and rights--not on our \nwatch.\n  I want to be sure that families and communities across the country \nheard something that the majority leader did say yesterday. He said \nthat ``inevitably'' Democrats and Republicans will have to work \ntogether to reach a bipartisan budget agreement.\n  Well, I think the workers and businesses who struggled through the \nlast government shutdown are wondering what the holdup is. Why do we \nneed another round of drama and brinksmanship before we can work \ntogether? Why do we need to see countdown clocks--once again--counting \ndown the days until another shutdown? And why, once again, do women and \ntheir health care have to come under attack before Republicans can do \nthe right thing?\n  I am certainly wondering, and I know my Democratic colleagues are \ntoo. I think it is clear that Republican leaders have a choice. As \ntheir leader said, they inevitably will have to work with Democrats, \nnow or later. The only question is how much pain they are willing to \nput workers and businesses through before they drop the politics, stop \npandering, and come to the table.\n  Democrats are ready to get to work, and I hope that, finally, \nRepublican leaders are as well.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss my bill, S. 2035, \nthe Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. The legislation I have filed, S. 2035, the Federal \nEmployee Fair Treatment Act, will help alleviate some of the fears of \nFederal workers when the Federal Government shuts down. I am pleased to \nhave Senators Reid, Baldwin, Carper, Gillibrand, Hirono, Kaine, Leahy, \nMikulski, Shaheen, and Warner as original cosponsors.\n  The bill is simple and straightforward. It requires that all Federal \nworkers furloughed as a result of any lapse in appropriations that may \nbegin as soon as October 1 will receive their pay retroactively as soon \nas it is practicable. It is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing \nto do. Federal workers don't want government shutdowns. They don't \ncause government shutdowns. They are dedicated public servants who \nsimply want to do their jobs on behalf of the American people. They \nshouldn't suffer because some Republicans want to shut down the Federal \nGovernment in the misguided notion that it will somehow prevent Planned \nParenthood from providing health care services to low-income women and \ntheir families. Two years ago, these same individuals thought that \nshutting down the government would prevent the Affordable Care Act from \nbeing implemented. They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.\n  As the Congressional Research Service has reported, in ``historical \npractice,'' Federal workers who have been furloughed as a result of a \nshutdown have received their pay retroactively ``as a result of \nlegislation to that effect.''\n  The language in the Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act is similar to \nthe language used to provide pay retroactively to workers furloughed in \nprevious shutdowns.\n  I am pleased that it is supported by the American Federation of \nGovernment Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union, and the \nNational Active and Retired Federal Employees Association.\n  The Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act includes a new provision that \nallows exempted employees, those who are required to work during a \nshutdown, to take authorized leave. They, too, would be paid \nretroactively as soon as possible after the lapse in appropriations \nends. During previous shutdowns, exempted employees have been \nprohibited from taking leave for any reason, including planned surgery \nor major family events, such as a wedding, that may have been scheduled \nweeks or even months in advance, causing many of them to lose money on \nnonrefundable plane tickets, hotel deposits, et cetera.\n  I am using the process permissible under rule XIV of the Standing \nRules of the Senate to place S. 2035 directly on the legislative \ncalendar. I am doing that to expedite consideration of the bill so that \nthe hardworking middle-class Federal employees know they will be \ntreated fairly if there is another shutdown. They shouldn't have to \nworry about whether they will be paid when a partisan gridlock prevents \nthem from doing their jobs.\n  Since 2011, Federal workers have contributed $159 billion to deficit \nreduction. They have endured a 3-year pay freeze and two substandard \npay increases since then, for a total of $137 billion. They lost \nanother billion dollars in pay because of sequestration-related \nfurloughs. Federal employees hired in 2013 and since 2014 are paying an \nextra $21 billion for their pensions. And each and every Federal worker \nis being asked to do more with less as agency budgets are frozen or \ncut. This is happening to hardworking, patriotic public servants, \nmostly middle class and struggling to get by like so many other \nAmericans. Enough is enough.\n  Since the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. population has increased by 76 \npercent and the private sector workforce has surged to 133 percent, but \nthe size of the Federal workforce has risen just 11 percent. Relative \nto the private sector, the Federal workforce is less than one-half the \nsize that it was in the 1950s and 1960s. The picture that emerges is \none of a Federal civilian workforce, the size of which has \nsignificantly shrunk compared to the size of the U.S. population it \nserves, the private sector workforce, and the magnitude of Federal \nspending.\n  I would make the additional point that shutting down the government \nhurts veterans. Over 30 percent of the civilian Federal employees are \nveterans, as opposed to just 7.8 percent of the non-Federal workforce. \nIn Texas, veterans comprise, for example, 37.5 percent of the civilian \nFederal workforce. In Kentucky it is 33.9 percent; in Florida it is \n38.9 percent; in South Carolina it is 41.7 percent. Is this how we are \ngoing to honor the men and women who have stood in harm's way to defend \nour Nation, by telling them to stay home involuntarily and having them \nworry about whether they will be paid?\n  Preventing Federal workers from doing their jobs doesn't just harm \nthem; it harms all Americans because Federal workers patrol our borders \nand make sure our air and water are clean and our food and drugs are \nsafe. They support our men and women in uniform and care for our \nwounded warriors, they help our manufacturers compete abroad, they \ndiscover cures for life-\n\n[[Page S6790]]\n\nthreatening diseases, they prosecute criminals and terrorists, they \nmaintain and protect critical infrastructure, they explore the \nuniverse, they process passport applications, they make sure Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and other social safety net programs are \nfunctioning properly.\n\n  When Federal workers do their job, they are helping each and every \nAmerican live a safer and more prosperous life. Our tasks here in \nCongress are simple: We need to keep the government open for business \nand keep Federal workers on the job. Later this year, we will need to \nraise the debt ceiling so we can continue to pay our bills and maintain \nthe full faith and credit of the United States Government.\n  We need to return to regular order around here and negotiate a \ncomprehensive budget deal to replace the sequestration, a budget that \nmaintains critical Federal investments while spreading the burden of \ndeficit reduction in a fair way and holding Federal workers and their \nfamilies harmless after subjecting them to so much hardship over the \npast several months and years.\n  One of the great attributes of the American character is pragmatism. \nUnlike what some other Federal workers actually do, here in Congress \nbalancing the budget is not rocket science. We know the various \noptions. Former President Lyndon Johnson was fond of quoting the \nProphet Isaiah: ``Come let us reason together.'' That is what we need \nto do. We can acknowledge and respect our differences, but at the end \nof the day the American people have entrusted us with governing, with \nbeing pragmatic. Let's do our job so Federal workers can continue to do \ntheir job on behalf of all Americans.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          228th Anniversary of the Signing of the Constitution\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today marks the 228th anniversary of the \nsigning of the Constitution. Two hundred twenty-eight years ago, 39 \nbrave and wise men set their names to the document that has guided our \ngovernment and our politics ever since. With each passing year, I am \nincreasingly astounded by the genius of those who framed our \nConstitution.\n  The world was a very different place back in 1787. There was no \nelectricity, no railroads, no air conditioning. Crossing the Atlantic \nOcean took months, and news traveled slowly on horseback. Our Nation, \nwhich today covers the continent, comprised only 13 States with a \ncombined population of 4 million people. That is roughly the current \npopulation of Oklahoma today.\n  Despite these vastly different circumstances, the Framers created a \nsystem that has endured for over 200 years and has become an example to \nthe world of stability and strength. They did so by enshrining in the \nConstitution certain fundamental principles about government and the \nsource of rights, coupled with an objective, honest view of the \nfailings of human nature.\n\n  The Framers recognized that our rights come from God, not government, \nand that it is the role of government to secure, not create, rights. \nThey recognized that government unrestrained is a threat to liberty and \nthat in order to protect citizens from government's constant tendency \nto expand its sphere, ambition must be made to counteract ambition. \nParchment barriers, as Madison famously intoned, will never suffice.\n  Thus, the Framers created the separation of powers: federalism, \nchecks and balances; an independent judiciary; a bicameral legislature; \nand an executive that, while unified, lacked the power of the purse. \nEach branch of government would have to share power with the others, \njust as States and the Federal Government would have to share power as \nwell. By preventing any one branch or any one level of government from \nbeing able to act unilaterally in its affairs, the Constitution ensured \nthat no one individual or group would be able to run roughshod over any \nother. And just as important, the Constitution ensured that no major \npolicy change could occur without substantial support from large \nnumbers of Americans at all levels of government and society.\n  The genius of the Constitution lies in its insight that prosperity \nrequires stability. Temporary majorities come and go. Their favored \npolicies may or may not be wise. Some years ago there was a great \nconcern that the Earth was cooling. Now there is worry in the same \nquarters that it is warming. Policies that may have seemed wise at one \npoint in time later reveal themselves to be foolish, even dangerous. By \ndividing power among branches, States, and Washington, our Constitution \nhelps avert sudden, large mistakes even as it enables more modest \nimprovements supported by broad coalitions.\n  The Constitution's division of powers also protects against the \nnatural inclination toward self-aggrandizement. This inclination occurs \nboth at the governmentwide level and at the individual level. An \nunchecked Federal Government bent upon remedying all of society's ills \nwill tend naturally to swallow the States, each of which has far fewer \nresources than the Federal leviathan. At the individual level, \nofficeholders competing for power and prestige battle against each \nother as they try to enact their visions into law. Our constitutional \nsystem ensures that the Federal Government does not altogether consume \nthe States by limiting and enumerating the Federal Government's powers \nand by promising that all powers not delegated to the Federal \nGovernment are reserved to the States. The Constitution also forces \nrival officeholders to work together in its design to prevent any one \nperson from unilaterally making, changing or eliminating laws.\n  Madison famously said that ``if men were angels, no further \ngovernment would be necessary.'' He further posited that ``if angels \nwere to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on \ngovernment would be necessary.''\n  Well, as everybody knows, we are not angels, and we need controls on \ngovernment to keep it in its proper sphere. The Constitution provides \nthese controls by dividing and diffusing power and by forcing those who \nseek change to work with others who may not share their views.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who view the Constitution as an \nobstacle to overcome, a barrier to supposed progress. These individuals \nfind fault with the fact that the Constitution makes change difficult \nand requires broad, long-lasting consensus in order to enact major \nreform. Surely the exigencies of the day, they argue, weren't by \npassing or even ignoring the separation of powers, federalism, and \nother elements of our constitutional structure. Although some of these \nindividuals may be well-intentioned, they are fundamentally disguised.\n  The fact is that the Constitution is not an obstacle. It is a guide--\na guide for how we should approach our contemporary problems, for how \nwe should think about our roles as citizens and legislators, for how we \nshould conduct ourselves as we debate the problems of the day.\n  The Constitution limits government in order to preserve freedom. It \nmakes each branch the equal of the others and the States the equal of \nWashington, DC. It provides a check on all government action. It \ndivides power among multiple sources because no one individual or \noffice can be trusted with all authority, and it requires cooperation \nat all levels and all stages to ensure that changes in law are \nthoroughly vetted rather than rammed through by temporary majorities. \nThese are the principles that should guide us as we seek solutions to \nour Nation's challenges.\n  These principles apply in any number of situations. A law that \ncoerces States into coordinating or expanding programs against their \nwill by threatening to cut off all funding for noncompliance makes \nStates the subordinates, not equals, of the Federal Government. \nExecutive action that purports to suspend vast swathes of our Nation's \nimmigration laws does not honor Congress as a coequal branch, nor do \nstatements threatening that if Congress does not act, the President \nwill. The Constitution does not give the President a blank check. It \nrequires him to work with Congress--a coequal\n\n[[Page S6791]]\n\nbranch--to move the ball forward. Executive hubris is the antithesis of \nfidelity to the Constitution. More in line with what the Constitution \nteaches is a willingness to reach out to include fellow officeholders. \nA President who works all levers of government to find broad agreement \nunderstands the lessons of the Constitution. President Reagan did this \nwith tax reform and entitlement reform. President Bush did it with \neducation reform and financial sector reform.\n  Legislation that preserves the separation of powers, rather than \ndelegating vast lawmaking authority to an unelected bureaucracy, also \nhonors the Constitution's teachings, and so do regulations that stay \nwithin the bounds of agency authority. When agencies exceed their \nstatutory mandate, they actually do violence to the Constitution's \ncareful system of checks and balances. They assume power that is not \ntheirs to take and remove decisions from the give-and-take of the \ndemocratic process. This is particularly problematic when the obvious \npurpose of the agency action is to bypass Congress.\n  EPA's recent carbon rules are but one example. When the \nadministration found itself unable to pass cap and trade, even through \na Democratic Congress, it turned to administrative fiat. It mattered \nnot that the Clean Air Act provides no authority for the \nadministration's exceptional harsh rules--rules that will depress \neconomic growth and cause energy costs to soar, I might add. What \nmattered was the goal of reducing carbon emissions.\n  But the Constitution does not give the President power to right all \nwrongs, it requires him to work with Congress so the two bodies \ntogether can address our Nation's problems. Cooperation, the \nConstitution teaches, yields better results than imprudent unilateral \naction.\n  More generally, all laws that expand the government risk ignore the \nlesson of the Constitution. When we vote to expand government, we set \nourselves against the very purpose of the Constitution to restrain the \npowers of the Federal Government. True, the Constitution created a more \nrobust government to remedy the defects in the Articles of \nConfederation, but in creating a more robust government it placed check \nupon check upon check on that government. A government that can compel \ncitizens to purchase products they do not want or to provide products \nrepugnant to their most deeply held religious beliefs is a danger to \nliberty. Whenever we carve out new space for the Federal Government, we \nmust be exceedingly careful not to upset the careful balance of the \nConstitution.\n  The Constitution also provides more subtle lessons on how we should \nconduct ourselves as Senators and elected officials. The overarching \ngenius of the Constitution, as I have said, is its recognition that \nflourishing requires stability. Unchecked majorities are dangerous, not \nonly because they tend to invade minority rights but also because in \ntheir enthusiasm for change, they may enact policies that cooler \nreflection would reveal to be unwise.\n  The ongoing debacle of ObamaCare is an example of this inaction. \nFlush with the Presidency, a majority in the House and their first \nfilibuster-proof majority in the Senate in over 30 years, Democrats \nenacted fundamental changes to American health care that have forced \nmillions of Americans off their own plans, caused premiums to \nskyrocket, and further insinuated government into decisions that should \nbe made between doctors and patients.\n  Had my colleagues on the other side of the aisle paid greater heed to \nwhat the Constitution has to teach, they might not have rushed so \nheadlong into these problems. The Constitution teaches the virtue of \nprudence and incremental reform. Rather than seeking fundamental \nchanges, as President Obama promised during the 2008 campaign, \nDemocrats should have focused on retaining those aspects of American \nhealth care that work well, including doctor choice, innovation, and \nquicker access for treatment, even while attempting to correct \ndeficiencies.\n  A more modest package that sought to preserve what worked, rather \nthan an anonymous bill so large no one had any time to actually read \nit, could have avoided many of the problems ObamaCare is now causing. \nIt might even have retracted some Republican votes. Instead, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle chose a party-line vote using \nan obscure legislative procedure that became necessary only after the \npeople of Massachusetts--Massachusetts--elected Scott Brown, to block \nthe bill. They did so in such a rush, as Speaker Pelosi so memorably \nrevealed, that they didn't know what was in their bill. My colleagues \nacross the aisle, along with the rest of America, are now paying the \nprice for their improvements.\n  My remarks on this Constitution Day have focused on the lessons the \nConstitution has to teach, as well as the dangers we risk when we \nignore its wisdom. I wish to close by calling upon my colleagues to pay \ngreater heed to the lessons of the Constitution when writing and voting \non legislation. There is an unfortunate tendency, in my view, to think \nof the Constitution as the courts' domain, to leave it entirely up to \nthe courts to decide whether a law is constitutional. We in Congress \njust write laws; it is up to the courts to do the constitutional stuff.\n  This tendency to leave things to the courts diminishes our role in \nthe constitutional system and misses the many lessons the Constitution \nhas to teach. The judiciary's role in assessing constitutionality is a \nnarrow one. Courts have not asked whether any law is consistent with \nthe Constitution's overall spirit or the principles that animate it. \nRather, they ask whether it satisfies some legal role announced in a \nprevious case. Is the regulated activity commerce? Is the punishment \nfor noncompliance a tax or a penalty?\n  But fidelity to the Constitution is about much more than narrow, \nlegal reasoning. Honoring the Constitution involves looking to the \nprinciples that undergird it--values such as individual liberty, \nseparation of powers, federalism, respect for civil society, and \ndemocratic accountability. In determining whether a given course of \naction is wise, all of these things are important.\n  ObamaCare again provides an example. ObamaCare, in my view, is \nunconstitutional, not only because it exceeds Congress's power under \nthe Constitution but also because it violates many of the enduring \nprinciples made manifest in the Constitution. It invades liberty by \ncompelling individuals to purchase insurance against their will and \nundermines federalism by coercing State governments to expand Medicaid. \nIt dilutes the separation of powers by transferring vast legislative \nauthority to the Executive--and on and on.\n  The same is true of the President's order suspending immigration laws \nfor up to 5 million illegal immigrants. It attempts to transmute \nlegislative authority to determine who may lawfully enter our country \ninto an unbounded Executive prerogative not to enforce the law, it end \nruns democratic accountability by ignoring the wishes of the people's \nduly elected representatives, and it undermines the respect for civil \nsociety by sanctioning conduct contrary to our laws.\n\n  Whether a law meets whatever legal test the Supreme Court has set \nforth does not end the inquiry for those of us who seek the \nConstitution as our guide. We would do well to revive what James Ceaser \nand others call political constitutionalism: the notion that it falls \nmostly to political actors such as ourselves making political decisions \nto protect and promote constitutional goals.\n  For some programs, such as ObamaCare, it means repealing the program \nroot and branch and replacing it with one that is both more effective \nand more in line with our constitutional values. For other programs \nthat have become more embedded in the fabric of American society, \nadvancing the cause of constitutionalism will involve more incremental \nreform. All of our entitlement programs need improvement. We must think \nhard about how we can reform these programs to better serve those for \nwhom they were intended.\n  James Madison called the Constitution a miracle. I think he was right \non point. The Constitution is a miracle because it has endured for over \n200 years. It is a miracle because of what it teaches about prudent \ngovernment and the need to guard against human failings. It is a \nmiracle because the lessons it provides are just as relevant today as \nthey were 228 years ago. I have to say it is a miracle because well \nover 160 nations in this world have\n\n[[Page S6792]]\n\ntried to copy it and under none of those nations does it work as well \nas this country.\n  In some ways we are starting to lose the Constitution because of some \nof the actions and activities of those who want to win at any cost. May \nwe ever look to the Constitution for guidance and pay it increased \nfidelity as we discharge our duties here in Washington and across this \ngreat land.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk around here \nabout the Iran deal: It is over. We made our best effort. We have fully \nexposed exactly what is in this agreement. We had hours and hours, days \nand days, and weeks and weeks of debates over this. It has been on our \nplate ever since the beginning of the negotiations.\n  Some of us started to express alarm and concern about the direction \nof those negotiations and what was potentially being given away, but we \nweren't sure until, fortunately, thanks to the Corker bill, Congress \nhad a chance to weigh in and the administration was required to give us \nthe ability to look at every word of this agreement, the annexes and \neverything attached to it.\n  Sometime later on, we found out there were two secret side agreements \nwhich we weren't able to see, and that alone, in my opinion, should \nhave been enough to vote against this agreement. How can one enter into \nany kind of a contractual relationship with a nation or a car dealer if \nthe person you are negotiating with says: Well, there are a couple of \nsecret matters over here that you can't have access to, but don't \nworry--it really won't mess things up. No one is going to sign an \nagreement like that except the President of the United States and \napparently the Secretary of State.\n  We made a valiant effort to defeat this. Many of us poured our heart \nand soul into this not just for days, not just for weeks, not just for \nmonths, but for years. And, yes, the American people have learned a lot \nmore about this, a lot more than what has been marketed by the White \nHouse in terms of how good this is for the future of America, our \nnational security, and the future of the world.\n  In many ways, I think we have exposed--and I have listed at least \n10--major issues that we conceded. There were goals that we wanted to \nachieve going into the negotiations, and we conceded on every single \npoint.\n  In the interest of time, I will not go back over that. All I am here \nto do is to say that I guess I am not ready to give up. Earlier on the \nfloor, I quoted Yogi Berra: ``It ain't over till it's over.'' Everybody \nsaid it is over, but the consequences of this are not over and the \nresults of this are not over. We will be living this out for the \nduration of this agreement, and at the end of this agreement, Iran will \nhave completed exactly the goal that it is trying to reach--in fact, \nthey may complete it much earlier than that--and that is the \nlegitimatization of their possession of nuclear weapons and nuclear \nweapon capability.\n  This is a country that says: We only need to develop this for medical \nisotopes; to fuel a reactor that is going to produce electricity for \nour people--despite all the Sun, wind, and the unlimited amount of oil \nand gas underneath their soil which could provide that much cheaper \nthan any other form. So there is no justification for their going \nforward except to achieve that one goal which we know they have worked \non for years. We know they have lied in terms of organizations that \nhave been sanctioning this. And now we have simply given them a pathway \nto achieving this and a legitimatization of their achievement of this. \nSome say that all the consequences will be good because Iran will abide \nby every part of this agreement and throughout this process there is \ngoing to be a major change in Iran--the theocracy will be overthrown, \nand they will become a responsible neighbor and nation--and this is the \npathway to achieving that--that is the vision of the President. That is \nthe dream.\n  Frankly, I hope my assessment of this is wrong. For the sake of the \nfuture of the United States, for the sake of the future of Israel, and \nfor the sake of the future of the world, I hope I am wrong. But there \nis nothing in this agreement and there is nothing that has been said or \ndone by the Iranian regime that would give us any indication--any hint \nat all--of any kind of change in their behavior. In fact, as they \nderide our agreement, our negotiators, and embarrass our President day \nafter day after day with ``Death to America'' and ``Extinction of \nIsrael.'' What will be the consequences? As I said, I discussed at \nlength what I think is wrong with this bill. I won't go over that again \ntoday. It is already in the Record. But there will be consequences that \nI don't think we have fully discussed, and I wish to lay out some of \nthose.\n  For Iran, they will have liberation from all sanctions and will be \nback in business. They will become rich. They will become rich with the \nrelease of hundreds of billions of dollars, and they will be using that \nfor any number of purposes.\n\n  Their oil industry is dominated by the Republican Guards. This is not \nExxon Mobil, not Occidental Petroleum, it is not any of our \ninternational oil companies; this is the Republican Guards. A military \norganization that dominates that oil industry. They will be free to \nexploit one of the largest oil reserves in the world. Their national \nincome will spike. State coffers will fill. And Iran's terrorist \nadventures and proxy wars will be well funded.\n  We all know about Iran's ambitions for dominance throughout the \nMiddle East and to be recognized as a world nuclear power. They will \nhave all the more money now to be able to feed their proxies fighting \nfor them in Syria, in Yemen, in Lebanon, in Iraq, in a number of places \nthroughout the Middle East, and their terrorist threats resonate across \nthe globe.\n  After nearly a decade of international efforts to force Iran to give \nup on this dangerous and illegal nuclear activity, Iran now has a green \nlight--a pathway built for them by U.S. concessions in this agreement--\nto reach nuclear weapons capability. We have entirely conceded to Iran \nthe right to create fissile material that can only have one use: \nnuclear weapons.\n  Now let's look at the larger question: the region, and the strategic \nimpact of this on the region. We haven't really had a great deal of \ndiscussion on the strategic consequences. I discussed it briefly during \nsome of my time earlier this week and last week, but the Iranian \ncontinuing revolution and regional misbehavior will affect the Middle \nEast and will affect the world. It is dangerous and it is \nirresponsible.\n  Former Secretaries of State Kissinger and Schultz--well regarded for \ntheir experience and well recognized as global experts, international \nexperts--discussed this broader strategic point in an important joint \narticle that was released last April. Former Secretaries Kissinger and \nSchultz explained that the then-outlined deal was so weak that Iran \nwould inevitably expand its power, Sunni States will inevitably \nproliferate in their response, and the United States will get dragged \ninto Middle East wars--except, this time, the wars may be nuclear.\n  Let me quote from their statement. The Secretaries explained:\n\n       Previous thinking on nuclear strategy assumed the existence \n     of stable state actors. . . .\n\n  Iran is anything but stable.\n  These are wise words from wise people who have had a lifetime of \nexperience.\n  Unfortunately, their views seem to have been largely ignored, if not \ncompletely ignored, by this administration, because it didn't fit their \npurpose to complete a deal, no matter what. No matter what we had to \ngive up, they wanted to complete this deal. In fact, the State \nDepartment's spokesman was quoted as disparaging the two Secretaries of \nState, Kissinger and Schultz, stating that their words were just ``big \nwords and big thoughts'' and that the two were ``not living in the real \nworld.'' Not living in the real world. I think that statement applies \nmuch more to the President and the Secretary of State than it does to \nformer\n\n[[Page S6793]]\n\nSecretaries of State Kissinger and Schultz.\n  Let's look at proliferation. Some of us have discussed the obvious \nproliferation dangers flowing from an agreement that puts Iran on the \npath of nuclear weapons. Despite the reluctant words of acquiescence \nthat have been wrung out of others in the region, who can possibly \nargue that Iran now will never be permitted to develop these nuclear \nweapons technologies without a response from others.\n  If I were the King of Saudi Arabia, if I were the Prime Minister or \nthe President of any major country in the Middle East, I am not going \nto stand by and watch Iran achieve nuclear dominance. They are going to \ntake their own action.\n  We have now basically shredded the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.\n  Let's look at Syria and the impact on Syria. America's appalling lack \nof effective response to the open wound that is Syria is one example of \nthe paralysis born out of the single-minded obsession accommodating the \nIranian regime. Iran is the principal prop for the brutal Syrian \nregime. Assad could not have remained in power these past 4 years of \ncatastrophic disintegration of his country without Iran's support. I \nfear our negotiations with Iran have taken on such an overwhelming \npriority with an administration obsessed with legacy that it helped \nfreeze us into inaction on Syria. The administration claims the nuclear \nnegotiations were about Iran's nuclear misbehavior only and were never \nintended to address the rest of its regional brutality. That is true in \nsome cases, but careful reading of the annexes and careful reading of \nthe agreement--by doing so, we now know the administration went well \nbeyond just discussing the nuclear capability issue. It did not address \nthe hostages that were being held by the Iranian regime--the Americans. \nIt did not address the ballistic missile development and proliferation. \nThose are two issues which had nothing to do with the agreement itself, \naccording to the administration.\n  Negotiations between the Ayatollahs and the Great Satan--that is us, \naccording to the Ayatollah--could not happen in a vacuum. Subjects not \naddressed by the negotiations nevertheless are affected by them, and \nour stupefying passivity on Syria proves the case.\n  Let's look at Russia. Our problems with Russia have only grown and \nmultiplied as we tried to ignore Russian misbehavior during our joint \nnegotiations with Iran. But worse, our obsession with getting a deal \nhas unleashed a Russia-Iran axis. Their new cooperation creates yet \nanother threat to American interests.\n  Just days after concluding this deal, the commander of Iran's elite \nQuds Force, General Suleimani, flew to Moscow--which he was sanctioned \nby the U.N. not to do, but he did anyway--reportedly to convince the \nRussians to step in to help shore up the crumbling Assad regime in \nSyria. It worked. The Russians are now in Syria in force, building \nbarracks and bringing in trainers, tanks, and other heavy weapons. Iran \nand Russia together are Assad's best friends--maybe his savior.\n  By ignoring Syria, empowering and enriching Iran, and making Putin's \nRussia an actual negotiating partner, we have created the perfect \nstorm. This is the price of dealing with the devil.\n  Lastly, let me speak about Israel because any discussion of \nconsequences must return to what should be the core issue: the \nconsequences for our only and best friend in the Middle East, Israel--\nthe only democratic ally in the region. We cannot ignore the major \nrisks that will follow through with the often-repeated threats of \nobliterating the State of Israel--a threat repeated by the Supreme \nLeader in no uncertain terms just this week. Is this hyperbole or \nposturing as the administration claims? The Israelis don't think so, \nand I don't think so.\n  We have to assume that an extremist, violent state such as Iran, \nafter decades of creating, arming, and guiding terrorist organizations \ndevoted to Israel's destruction, will continue their assault one day, \nnow we know, with nuclear weapons. One day, others may look back \nthrough the smoke and ashes created by this Iran deal and wonder how we \ncould ever have been so blind. How could we ever have conceded to an \nagreement that violated every goal that the previous three Presidents \nand current President said we must not concede on--that is, it is \ntotally unacceptable for Iran to have possession of nuclear weapons \ncapability.\n  Two Democratic Presidents, two Republican Presidents, over three \ndecades of time, have made that statement. It was the goal of the \nUnited States to do everything in its capability to prevent Iran from \nhaving a nuclear weapon, and we just signed an agreement that gave them \nthe pathway to that nuclear weapon. Does it possibly delay their \nachievement of that? Yes. But does it reach the goal of preventing them \nfrom having it? No.\n  So after all the shouting and all the efforts and all the debate and \nall the examination of the agreements, we are told to give up. It is a \ndone deal. The President used his ``Executive authority'' to deem this \nan agreement and not a treaty, which is a fallacy in itself. But now we \nare told we have to give it up. We have to move on. We have other \nthings to do. You made your best effort. We won, you lost.\n  No, America lost. America lost, and we will be paying a price year \nafter year after year as we watch the flow of money into Iran, the flow \nof oil out of Iran and money in return, supporting proxy wars \nthroughout the Middle East, igniting a nuclear arms race in that tinder \nbox of the region. We will regret the day--we will regret the day--the \nannouncement was made that we have signed a deal with Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6793-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6793-S6798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have come to make a unanimous consent \nrequest. I was going to tell the body why I was doing that and then \nmake a unanimous consent request. But my colleague and friend from \nTexas, who is going to object to it, has a plane to catch, so I am \ngoing to make the unanimous consent request, let him object, let him \nexplain why he objects, and then I will explain why I was for it. It \nwon't change the thrust of this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 139, 140, and 141; \nthat the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on \nthe nominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that \nany related statements be printed in the Record; and that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and on \nbehalf of Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nwould just briefly point out that during President Obama's term of \noffice, the Senate has confirmed more judicial nominees than it had at \nthis point in 2007. Our pace simply follows the standard set by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle established that year. In the \nJudiciary Committee, we have had more hearings and moved more nominees \nthan we did last year.\n  In terms of the Executive Calendar, everyone knows that at the end of \nlast year, during the lameduck session, our Democratic friends rammed \nthrough 11 Federal judges. Under regular order, these judges should \nhave been considered at the beginning of this Congress. That is what \nhappened in 2006 when 13 nominations were returned to the President. \nHad we not confirmed in the lameduck 11 judicial nominees during last \nyear, we would roughly be on pace for judicial nominations this year \ncompared to 2007.\n  So we are working at the usual pace, and on behalf of Chairman \nGrassley, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I regret my colleague's objection. I hope \nthey will change their minds. But once again I must rise to address the \ngrowing crisis of judicial vacancies in our Federal and district \ncourts.\n  We all know it is the job of the Senate to responsibly keep up with \nthe\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\nneed for confirmed judges. Unfortunately, my friends on the other side \nof the aisle slowed the judicial confirmation process to a crawl. They \ndid their best to slow the pace of confirmation when the Senate was \nunder Democratic leadership and now are sluggishly moving on \nnominations even more so in the Senate they control. It has resulted in \na nearly 10 percent vacancy in judicial positions throughout the United \nStates. There are 31 districts that are considered judicial \nemergencies, meaning they don't have enough judges to hear the \ncaseload. The longer we wait to move judges through committee and to \nthe floor, the worse the numbers will get.\n  Let me take the Western District of New York as an example to talk a \nbit about these vacancies and what they mean in practice. Western New \nYork has the cities of Buffalo and Rochester and the surrounding areas. \nThere is not a single active Federal district judge in the Western \nFederal District--not one. The district has one of the busiest \ncaseloads in the country. It handles more criminal cases than \nWashington, DC, or Boston. It is on the Canadian border, making it \nparticularly busy, and yet they don't have a single active Federal \njudge. The delays for civil trials are by far the worst in the country. \nIt takes 5 years for a median case to go to trial. That is denial of \njustice, just about. It is un-American. If not for the efforts of two \njudges on senior status who are volunteering to hear cases in their \nretirement, the Western District of New York would be at a full \nstandstill.\n  The lack of judges has real legal consequences. In the Western \nDistrict of New York, Judge Skretny--on senior status--has admitted \nthat he is encouraging all cases to settle in pretrial mediation in \norder to lower caseloads. Criminal trials are prioritized while civil \ntrials languish in delay. The two retired judges, who are the only ones \nreading cases at the moment, are spending far less time on each \nindividual case than they would under normal circumstances. And \ndefendants may be inclined to settle, admit guilt, and take plea deals \nrather than wait out a lengthy trial process.\n  As many of my colleagues have said so eloquently, the harsh truth is \nthat for these petitioners, companies, and communities, justice is \nbeing delayed and thus denied. And the same story line is playing out \nin courtrooms throughout the country. This is not how our judicial \nsystem is supposed to work, and it should be an easy problem to \nrectify.\n  Right now, there are 13 noncontroversial judges on the Executive \nCalendar, and 3 more were reported out of committee today. Of those, \nthree are highly qualified judges from New York, including one from the \nWestern District. I know these nominees. They are brilliant people, \nexperienced jurists, and above all they are moderate. This Senator \nbelieves in moderation in the choosing of judges. Larry Vilardo and Ann \nDonnelly are two whom I have recommended, and LaShann DeArcy Hall was \nrecommended by a good friend, the junior Senator from New York, Senator \nGillibrand. They should all be confirmed, but we don't know when they \nwill come up for a vote. All of these nominees exceed my standards for \njudicial nominees. In his or her own way, each brings excellence, \nmoderation, and diversity to the Federal bench.\n  They are not the only outstanding nominees we have. We have judges \npending from Missouri, California, and several other States--\nrepresented by Republican Senators as much as Democrats--which are \nexperiencing the same judicial emergencies and heavy caseloads. These \nare nominees who have already moved out of committee, all with \nbipartisan support. I am not offending the traditional committee \nprocess by asking simply to move them off the floor and onto the bench \nwhere they belong.\n  I came to the floor last July to request that we move to confirm \nthese nominees. Unfortunately, my request was blocked by my good friend \nthe Senator from Iowa. In response to my request, I was basically told: \nThe nominees are moving along just fine. Be patient.\n  Well, we are several months later and still we have no indication \nthat these judicial nominees will ever be moved off the Executive \nCalendar for a vote.\n  I was told--and I am paraphrasing--that if one would only count all \nthe judges Democrats confirmed at the end of the last Congress, the \nRepublican record on judges wouldn't look so bad. With all due respect \nto my friend from Iowa, I don't believe he can take credit for our work \nlike that. One cannot slice and dice the numbers to make the Republican \nrecord on judicial confirmations any better. Listen to this. The fact \nis that the Republican leadership has scheduled votes on only six \nFederal judges this whole Congress--six--less than one a month. There \nis no reason for that.\n  Even if we did give Republicans credit for the judges the Democrats \napproved at the end of last Congress, we would still be far behind the \npace of confirmations in the past because by comparison, through the \nseventh year of President Bush's Presidency where there was a \nRepublican President but Democrats controlled the Senate, 29 judges had \nbeen approved--6 compared to 29. How is that parity?\n  When Democrats controlled the Senate during the final 2 years of \nGeorge W. Bush's Presidency, we confirmed 68 judges. When Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate during the 2 final years of President Clinton's \nPresidency, we confirmed 73 judges. How many confirmations have there \nbeen in these last 2 years when Republicans have controlled the Senate, \nhaving a Democratic President? Six. The comparison numbers are 73, 68, \n6. Is that equal? Is that the same as they are always doing, as they \nsay? Of course not.\n  The Republican majority is confirming judges at the slowest rate in \nmore than 60 years, and as a result, the number of current vacancies \nhas shot up nearly 50 percent and the number of judicial emergencies \nhas increased 158 percent. In no world is that a reasonable pace, as I \nhave been assured by my colleagues.\n  There are no values more American than the speedy application of \njustice and the right to petition the government for a redress of \ngrievances. Frankly, neither of these can be achieved without judges on \nthe bench. The equal and fair application of justice is necessarily \ntarnished by a courtroom without a judge. It is as simple as that.\n  So today I moved that we move to New York's pending judicial \nnominations, but the request was rejected. I hope my colleagues will \nthink this through. It is a blemish on this Congress. It is a blemish \non the idea that we are getting things done. It is a blemish when our \nRepublican leader says this Congress is doing things at a better pace \nthan in previous years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Federal Employees\n\n                Dr. Michelle Colby and Jonathan McEntee\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, literally every month of this year, I have \ncome to the Senate floor to do something that one of our former \ncolleagues, Ted Kaufman, who served as our Senator for 2 years after \nJoe Biden became Vice President--Ted used to come to the floor not on a \nmonthly basis but even more frequently than that to talk about what was \nbeing done by any number of Federal employees across our country, to \ndraw attention to the fact that these are not nameless, faceless \nbureaucrats, these are people who do important work for each of us in a \nvariety of ways.\n  What I have tried to do in the last several months--I think most of \nthis year--is to come to the floor to recognize the work not of the \nFederal employees at large but the work of a few of the many exemplary \nDepartment of Homeland Security employees and to thank them for their \ndedication to their mission and their service to our Nation, which is \nan important one. And the reason I have particular interest in this is \nthat I have been the senior Democrat on homeland security the last \ncouple of years, and I worked with Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. The two of \nus were privileged to lead the committee.\n  In June I spoke about several outstanding officers in the U.S. Coast\n\n[[Page S6795]]\n\nGuard, one of them a petty officer, a woman named Joscelyn Greenwell, \nwho is stationed at Coast Guard Station Indian River Inlet in southern \nDelaware, which is just a little bit north of Bethany Beach and just \nsouth of Rehoboth. In July I had the opportunity to actually visit \nPetty Officer Greenwell and 30 of her colleagues to learn more about \nhow she and her unit serve and how they protect the rest of us. It is \nnot just Delawareans who seek recreation--fish, boat, and swim--in the \ninland bays in Delaware or in the Atlantic ocean; people from all over \nthe country and actually all over the world do that, and we are \ngrateful.\n  But the devotion of Petty Officer Greenwell and her colleagues to \ntheir mission is shared by thousands of men and women serving with the \nU.S. Coast Guard and throughout the Department of Homeland Security. \nThe Coast Guard used to be part of Treasury, as I recall, but today it \nis, since the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, part of \nDHS.\n  Well, today I want to just take just a few minutes to recognize the \nservice of and say thanks to two other exemplary public servants who \nwork at the Department of Homeland Security, not in the Coast Guard, \nbut in this case, in the Science and Technology Directorate. While many \nat the Department of Homeland Security put their lives on the line \nalong our borders, at our ports of entry, and our airports or in \nresponse to disasters, some are working behind the scenes to secure our \nhomeland against new threats or better respond to those we face today.\n  This is what happens every day at the Science and Technology \nDirectorate. They give their all to provide frontline personnel the \nbest tools and tactics that are available. Essentially, the role of the \nDepartment's Science and Technology employees is to keep our homeland \nsecurity efforts a step ahead of the ever-evolving threats we face as a \nnation. They do this through state-of-the-art research and development \nissues performed by some of our Nation's top engineers, top scientists, \ntop researchers.\n  The product of their work is deployed across the Department. From \ncyber security, to biological defense, to border security, Science and \nTechnology's research, development, and science work is truly vital to \nall of us. Science and Technology employees work closely with the trade \nand travel industry and with many academic groups as well. They also \nwork closely with other research and scientific agencies across all \nlevels of government to meet the needs of first responders, to enhance \nstrategy and analysis, and to bolster operations and capability.\n  Among the threats that science and technology seeks to address are \nthe threats to our agricultural system. Agriculture is, of course, \nvital to our Nation's economic stability and our security. In Delaware, \nagriculture remains one of the key industries at the heart of the \nState's economic activity. I think of Delaware as a three- or four-\nlegged stool--at least our economy sits on a three- or four-legged \nstool.\n  One of the strong legs, in Southern Delaware especially, is \nagriculture. In Sussex Country Delaware, we produce more chickens than \nany county in America. In Sussex County, Delaware--we only have three \ncounties. The biggest--Sussex County is the third largest county in \nDelaware, but they produce more chickens in Sussex County than any \ncounty in America. We raise more soybeans in Sussex County, Delaware, \nand we feed it to the chickens, along with corn and other things. But \nbiological and manmade threats to our food, whether it is poultry, \navian influenza, and so forth, whether manmade threats to our food or \nanimal agriculture system could have devastating impacts to our economy \nand to our day-to-day lives. It certainly poses a great threat to the \nDelmarva Peninsula and other places where we raise poultry--and turkeys \nfor that matter. That is why the Department of Homeland Security has a \nnumber of employees at Science and Technology whose mission is to \nprevent and protect against threats to our agricultural infrastructure. \nIn July, I held a hearing, alongside my colleague, Homeland Security \nand Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. We \nheld the hearing to examine the threat that avian influenza poses to \npublic health and also to our poultry industry.\n  In recent months, parts of the poultry industry across our country \nhave been grappling with the devastating outbreak of avian influenza. \nAlthough the spread of this disease has slowed, and most of the areas \nthat were affected were in the central part of our country, including \nWisconsin, including Iowa, many States have lost millions of chickens \nand turkeys to this disease. As a result, the economic losses our \nfarmers and businesses are dealing with in those parts of the country \nare staggering.\n  The Presiding Officer probably does not know this--maybe he does--but \nthere are roughly 300 chickens for every person in Delaware, as I said. \nI mentioned we raise more chickens in Sussex County than any county in \nAmerica, but our poultry farmers create--ready for this--more than $2.7 \nbillion in State economic activity each year and account for about 70 \npercent of our State's agricultural exports. We have cows we milk, \ndairy cattle, we have pigs, we raise a lot of lima beans and that kind \nof thing, but poultry is the 800-pound gorilla in the room in our \neconomy.\n  Luckily for our poultry farmers in the Delmarva Peninsula and across \nthe country, public servants like Dr. Michelle Colby are working at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security on cutting-edge research to protect \nagainst potential disease outbreaks like the avian influenza, the avian \nflu.\n  Here she is right now, Dr. Michelle Colby. I will talk a little bit \nabout Michelle, if I may. She is the Branch Chief of Agriculture \nDefense at the Science and Technology Directorate. Her mission is to \ndevelop tools, including vaccines and diagnostics, to prevent livestock \nfrom natural and manmade disease threats. Michelle works closely with \nthe Department of Agriculture to help develop and support research \nprojects, track their progress, and stay ahead of existing and emerging \nthreats.\n  She has also the critically important responsibility of making sure \nresearch and development programs across our Federal Government are \nwell coordinated, not duplicated, and always ready to respond to \ndisease outbreaks. A primary part of this woman's job is to make sure \nScience and Technology, where she works within DHS, uses the lessons \nlearned from previous disease outbreaks to inform research and prevent \nor better control future outbreaks.\n\n  In fact, information gathered during the last few years as part of \nanother project at Science and Technology is currently being used by \nMichelle's team to help the Department of Agriculture in its response \nto the avian influenza outbreak I just mentioned. Michelle and her team \nwere also instrumental in helping combat another recent threat to our \nNation's agricultural industry and to us, foot-and-mouth disease.\n  In May of 2012, they secured a conditional license to a Department of \nHomeland Security foot-and-mouth disease vaccine for use in cattle. \nThis was the first foot-and-mouth disease vaccine ever licensed in the \nUnited States--ever licensed in the United States. The conditional \nlicense was renewed in May of last year and is now valid through I \nthink May of next year. Michelle and her team's important work did not \ngo unnoticed. They were finalists for the Partnership for Public \nService to America Medal for their efforts.\n  According to her colleagues, Michelle is ``one of the most respected \nscientists in the area of Veterinary Science.'' Her colleagues tell me \nshe never loses sight of her critical mission and that she is a \ndedicated public servant of the highest integrity. Michelle earned her \nbachelor of science degree in animal science from the University of \nMaryland Eastern Shore. That is on the Delmarva Peninsula. She is our \nneighbor just to the south of us. She has also a doctor of veterinary \nmedicine degree from Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary \nMedicine. She also has a master of science in epidemiology from the \nUniversity of Maryland College Park.\n  Interestingly enough, her graduate work focused on the Delmarva \npoultry industry. While some of the important work at--let me just say: \nMichelle, thank you for what you do, not just for Delmarva, not just \nfor those who are\n\n[[Page S6796]]\n\ninvolved in the poultry industry but thank you for what you do for our \ncountry and all of us who, frankly, enjoy eating poultry and for all of \nus who are involved in exporting and selling poultry around the world.\n  It used to be that 1 out of every 100 chickens we raised in America \nwe exported, then it was 5 out of 100, 10 out of 100, and now it is 20 \nout of 100. We are negotiating a new transpacific trade partnership \nwith 11 other countries that will encompass about 40 percent of the \nworld's markets. We want to make sure on Delmarva, and frankly in a lot \nof other places around this country, that we can use this trade \nagreement to sell that which we are really good at; that is, raising \nchickens.\n  While some of the important work at Science and Technology happens in \nthe lab, some scientists and engineers there team up with other \nagencies within the Department of Homeland Security to get a firsthand \nlook at how to enhance capabilities and operations on the frontlines. \nFor Jonathan McEntee--known as Jon--Jon's Science and Technology work \nhas taken him into the field of joint missions with the Coast Guard, \nwith Customs and Border Protection, and with Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement.\n  Public service is nothing new to Jon. In fact, it runs in his family. \nJon was born on a U.S. Air Force base, not in Dover, DE, but in the \nUnited Kingdom of all places, in a place called Lakenheath, United \nKingdom. He is the proud son of a retired linguist and the grandson of \na 50-year GE chemical engineer and World War II veteran. He continues \nhis family's history of service to our country today through his work \nensuring the security and economic prosperity of the United States in \nhis role at Science and Technology.\n  Since 2007, the last several years, Jon has worked at the Borders and \nMaritime Security Division at Science and Technology within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. It is called Security Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency. This component is responsible for the \nresearch, for the development, for the testing and evaluation needs for \nthe Department's land borders, ports of entry, and maritime mission \nenvironments.\n  Since becoming the division's Deputy Director in 2011, Jon has \nmanaged several projects, developing maritime, border, and cargo \nsecurity initiatives. He is responsible for managing the congressional, \nfinancial, and technical oversight of operations, along with its 30 \nemployees. On any given day, Jon is juggling 40 projects on a wide \nrange of activities all across the Department.\n  According to his colleagues, Jon believes technology is the key to \nremaining competitive and relevant in an ever-changing global \nenvironment. So it is no surprise that he helped establish the \ntechnology innovation center within the Coast Guard, to help deliver \ntechnical capabilities for the Department's operators in a faster and \nmore efficient process. Jon also helps in the efforts to build a more \ncohesive and unified Department of Homeland Security. They have a \nsaying over there, ``One DHS.'' He is part of that.\n  He regularly represents Science and Technology on Department-level \nprojects to help improve coordination and make the best use of science \nresources. Efforts like Jon's are supporting Secretary Jeh Johnson's \nUnity of Effort Initiative, an effort to help the Department operate \nmore efficiently and effectively. That is something I think we can all \nget behind.\n  Colleagues say that Jon looks at solutions to problems not only from \na security aspect but also while thinking about how they impact the \noverall economic interest of our country. He believes all solutions \nmust have a positive return on investment over existing methods and \npractices. Jon is well known for his let's-find-a-way attitude and \nalways encourages his colleagues to be a part of the solution rather \nthan add to the problem. I like to say: ``No'' means find another way.\n  The work ethic he embodies and his leadership can be credited for his \nwork building partnerships to promote our Nation's economic growth. \nSpecifically, he helped facilitate a partnership that included Customs \nand Border Protection, Mexican and Canadian Customs, General Motors, \nthe Ford Motor Company, Honda Manufacturing, Pacific Union, and \nFerromex Rail to successfully conduct a cargo security technology \ndemonstration that operates four U.S.-bound supply chain routes \noriginating from Mexico and originating from Canada.\n  That achievement earned him wide praise, including the Department of \nHomeland Security and Technology Under Secretary's Award in 2014. Jon \nearned his master's in business administration from Salisbury \nUniversity and a bachelor of science degree in finance from Frostburg \nState University. He and his wife Heather, an Air Force veteran, have \nthree children: Sage, Myra, and Jack.\n  I just want to say to Sage, Myra and Jack: Thank you for sharing not \njust your mom but your dad as well with the people of our country. \nThank you.\n  The efforts of Michelle and Jon provide just a glimpse into the \nimportant work being done by hundreds of thousands of individuals \nacross the Department of Homeland Security every single day. These men \nand women are dedicated. They are exemplary public servants. They are \nunsung heroes who walk among us every day. More often than not, their \ngood work goes unnoticed--not today. These are not nameless, faceless \nbureaucrats. These are people with great educations, a great desire to \nserve our country, and who every day make a difference for us in this \ncountry with the work they do.\n  Michelle and Jon, right here--Jon, thank you. For Michelle, whose \npicture was up here just a moment ago, we want to thank you for what \nyou do. We want to thank as well the 200,000 men and woman you work \nwith at the Department of Homeland Security. We are a safer country \nbecause of your service and I think we are a better country too. As we \nsay in the Navy when people do especially good work, we say two words: \nOne of them is ``Bravo'' and the other is ``Zulu.'' So, Michelle and \nJon, Bravo Zulu. God bless you.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  Mr. President, if you will bear with me, I wish to talk for a little \nbit about another important issue, if I could, and I don't see anybody \nelse on the floor, so I will forge ahead.\n  I actually said this earlier today when we were having a discussion \non the Iran agreement, but it bears repeating. When I go back to the \nelections of last November, I have three messages that are takeaways \nthat I continue to come back to.\n  The first takeaway for me last November was this: The American people \nare sending us a message. They said they want us to work together. The \nsecond message is they want us to get stuff done, things that we need \nto get done for the good of our country, and they especially want us to \nget things done that will help strengthen our economic recovery.\n  On the good-news side, the Department of Labor reported today that \nthe number of people who filed for unemployment insurance this past \nweek--this number comes out of the Department of Labor every Thursday \nthat is not a Federal holiday, and they have been doing this for years. \nThe week Barack Obama and Joe Biden were inaugurated as President and \nVice President--that week in January of 2009--628,000 people filed for \nunemployment insurance. Anytime that number is over 400,000 people \nfiling for unemployment insurance in a week, we are losing jobs.\n  At the beginning of 2009, we were losing a lot of jobs. We lost 2.5 \nmillion jobs in this country in the last 6 months of 2008. We lost 2.5 \nmillion more jobs in this country in the first 6 months of 2009. And as \nwe went through 2009, that number--628,000 people filing for \nunemployment insurance every week--frankly didn't come down a lot. \nAfter a year or so, it began to trend down. Finally, it went down to \n600,000, eventually to 500,000, and finally it dipped below 500,000 \nafter a couple of years. Several years ago, that number came down to \n400,000.\n  The reason 400,000 is an important number in terms of people filing \nfor unemployment insurance is when that number drops on a weekly basis \nbelow 400,000, we are starting to add jobs back--or at least our \neconomy is. For the last 28 straight weeks, the number of folks filing \nfor unemployment insurance in this country has been under 300,000. One \nof the reasons we are adding, in most months, 200,000 to 250,000 is\n\n[[Page S6797]]\n\nbecause not nearly as many people are losing their jobs, and that is a \nvery good thing.\n  Even though the economy is arguably better than it was--I think the \nunemployment rate in this country in January of 2009 was heading toward \n10 percent. The unemployment rate today is closer to 5 percent. Is that \ntoo high? Sure it is. Can we do better than that? We have to do better \nthan that.\n  So one of the things I always focus on is trying to figure out how \nwe--when I was Governor of Delaware and chairman of the National \nGovernors Association, I always was interested in how we could create a \nmore nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation. In \nthe 8 years I was privileged to be Governor of Delaware, I am told that \nmore jobs were created in those 8 years than any year maybe in Delaware \nhistory--any 8-year period in Delaware history. I didn't create a one \nof them. Governors don't create jobs. Mayors don't create jobs. \nSenators--however good we are--don't create jobs. Presidents don't \ncreate job. What we do is help create a nurturing environment for job \ncreation.\n  What does that include? Access to capital. People starting businesses \nusually have to raise money. A world-class workforce with the kinds of \nskills that will help businesses be successful. Transportation to move \npeople and business services where they need to go and when they need \nto go. Public safety. Reasonably priced energy. Reasonably priced \nhealth care. You name it. A lot of things go into creating a nurturing \nenvironment for job creation and job preservation.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Carper pertaining to the introduction of S. 2051 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Still seeing no one else on the floor, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Pope Francis's Address to Congress and Climate Change\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, last year I had the opportunity to travel \nto the Vatican. During my visit, I had the chance to overlook St. \nPeter's Square from a Vatican balcony. As I took in the view of that \nhistoric square, the Sun glinted off the future. Across the square, I \nsaw the rooftop of Pope Paul VI Audience Hall on the Vatican grounds \ncovered with solar panels. It was clear from that view that the Vatican \ntakes climate change very seriously and had long been preparing to have \na profound impact on this generational issue that touches every living \ncreature on the planet.\n  I was at the Vatican as the only U.S. representative in a group of \nhigh-level legislators from around the world who are all working to \naddress climate change in their own countries. We met with Cardinal \nPietro Parolin and Cardinal Peter Turkson, the Vatican leaders \nresponsible for writing the initial draft of Pope Francis's historical \nenvironmental encyclical, and shared the impact of climate change in \nour own home countries with the two cardinals who were going to be \nwriting that encyclical.\n  The conversation then turned to what was happening in the countries \nof the legislators who were visiting. The lawmaker from the Philippines \ndiscussed the destruction that Typhoon Haiyan brought to parts of her \ncountry. Legislators from South Africa and Mexico shared the challenges \ntheir countries and regions face from drought. The representatives from \nEurope pointed to the damage from extreme heat waves and rainfall. I \nrelayed my concern with the rising levels, temperature, and acidity of \nthe ocean and the impacts on coastal communities. Rising sea levels are \neroding our shores in Massachusetts and New England and across our \ncountry, increasing the damage in New England of nor'easters. In recent \nyears, ocean temperatures in our part of the Atlantic ocean have been \nthe hottest ever recorded. In one case, off of Cape Cod, it was 21 \ndegrees warmer than normal this January, in Massachusetts, off of our \ncoastline.\n  But all of us who had gathered at the Vatican were in agreement that \nthe world's poorest people are suffering the worst consequences of \nclimate change--extreme poverty, famine, disease, and displacement--\nwhich is why it should be no surprise that Pope Francis, a Jesuit \ntrained in chemistry who is devoted to the poor and ensuring a just and \nbetter future for all mankind, would be the only Pope to devote an \nentire encyclical to humanity's relationship with the environment. In \nreleasing his encyclical and giving us his message to protect what he \ncalls ``our common home,'' Pope Francis has also given us a common \ngoal: We must act now to stop climate change. But make no mistake--this \nPope is looking for leadership. Pope Francis is looking for results. He \nis looking for all of us to lead to solve this problem.\n  Next week, we will have the honor of hosting Pope Francis here in \nWashington, DC, and hearing him address a joint meeting of the United \nStates House of Representatives and the Senate--unprecedented--and the \nentire Nation will be watching the Pope as he speaks because we all \nneed to hear Pope Francis's message of love, of compassion, of justice \nand action. And we need to join in the conversation he is calling the \nworld to engage in about protecting people and our planet.\n  The science of climate change has been clear for decades. Global \ntemperatures are warming, glaciers are melting, and sea levels are \nrising. Extreme downpours and weather events are increasing. The ocean \nis becoming more dangerously acidic. Last year was the warmest year \never recorded. Today, NOAA announced that this summer was the hottest \nsummer since 1880. Increasing temperatures increase the risk for bad \nair days, in turn increasing the risk of asthma attacks and worse for \npeople who actually have lung disease. Global warming is also a public \nhealth crisis.\n  The economic and security costs are now dangerously evident. Climate \nchange is aggravating tensions around the world, especially where food \nand water security are at the heart of the conflicts. It is spawning \nnew crises that are displacing millions of people and creating an era \nof refugees. This will require action by our diplomats and aid \norganizations, but every nation must do its fair share.\n  Pope Francis's address to Congress next week will offer us the \nopportunity to examine our own policies, their impact on not only the \npeople of our Nation but on the entire planet, and our duty as leaders \nand as human beings to take action.\n  Pope Francis has brought this moral imperative to act on climate \nchange just as the nations of the world are working to forge an \ninternational agreement in Paris this December as the world gathers to \ndeal with this issue. The United States must lead this effort. The \nUnited States must heed the message of Pope Francis. The United States \nmust be the nation in Paris in December saying to the rest of the world \nthat we can and must do something to solve this problem.\n  We know that clean energy will be at the heart of meeting any of the \ngoals which we have to establish here and across the planet in order to \ncut pollution. We must continue to improve the fuel efficiency of the \nautomobiles and trucks we drive here in the United States. We must \ndeploy more wind and solar energy and renew tax breaks for those \nprojects.\n  By making a commitment to reduce the pollution imperiling our planet, \nwe can engage in job creation that is good for all of creation. The \nUnited States can be the leader in the technological revolution to \nreduce the pollution imperiling our planet, and then we can partner \nwith other nations to share this technology and protect the most \nvulnerable around the world.\n  Pope Francis said in his encyclical, ``Today, in the view of the \ncommon good, there is an urgent need for politics and economics to \nenter into a frank dialogue in the service of life, especially life.'' \nWe know that to agree on a course of action is no easy task in this \nChamber, but if we harness the ambition of the Moon landing, the \ntechnological power of our workers, and the moral imperative of Pope \nFrancis's message, we can leave the world a better place than we found \nit. We have done it before. We have the tools to do it again. Now we \nneed to forge the political will in order to accomplish those goals.\n\n[[Page S6798]]\n\n  We need more solar, we need more wind, and we need the batteries for \nthe vehicles we drive in order to reduce the amount of polluting fossil \nfuels we send up into the atmosphere. We need to invest. We need to be \nthe technological giants. We need to unleash the same kind of \nrevolution in the energy sector as we did in the telecommunications \nsector in the 1990s. No one on the planet except the United States had \na device like this on their person just 15 years ago. We invented \ntelecommunications. We invented the way in which people not just here \nin America but all across the planet--Africa, Asia, South America--\ncommunicate with these wireless devices. We can do the same thing on \nenergy. We can do the same thing with wind and solar. We can reinvent \nthe kinds of vehicles we drive--cars, trucks, buses. We can do it. We \nhave to have the will. We have to listen to the Pope. We have to play \nthe role that the United States is expected to lead by the rest of the \nworld in order to meet this moral imperative. And we can do it by \ncreating millions of new jobs here in the United States. So that is our \nchallenge.\n  The Pope is arriving next week. For me, as a boy who grew up going to \nthe Immaculate Conception Grammar School, Malden Catholic, Boston \nCollege, and Boston College Law School--Catholic school every day for \n19 years--this is just an incredible thrill, knowing that, in a way, \nwhen he is standing up on that podium, it is going to be a latter-day \n``Sermon on the Mount'' that he delivers to us telling us what our job \nis today: to save this beautiful planet God has created while also \navoiding the worst consequences for the poorest people on the planet if \nwe do not solve the problem.\n  Let's work together in a bipartisan fashion in order to heed the \nmessage of Pope Francis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

House and their 25 years of pastoral service with \nMountaintop Faith Ministries.\n  Pastor Clinton House and Dr. Mary House began their ministry work at \na small church in North Las Vegas with 13 members. Over the years, \nMountaintop Faith Ministries outgrew its humble beginnings. In 1993, \nthe church's congregation grew so much they had to open the doors of \nthe church and put chairs in the lobby and out to the street. The \nchurch continued to grow, and eventually, they began holding services \nin the auditorium of Durango High School to accommodate churchgoers. \nToday, Mountaintop Faith Ministries has a church complex and upwards of \n3,500 members.\n  Mountaintop Faith Ministries has continuously given back to the Las \nVegas community. The Sunday services have provided spiritual guidance \nfor thousands, and the church also offers midweek Bible classes and \nbusiness fairs, where owners can share their businesses with church \nmembers following services. One Resurrection Sunday, they held a \n``dress down'' Sunday on the football field at Durango High School. \nThis community event brought buses of homeless to worship\n\n[[Page S6799]]\n\nwith them. After the service, church members provided food for the \nhomeless, as well.\n  For the past 25 years, Pastor Clinton House and Dr. Mary House have \ntouched the Las Vegas community through their dedicated work. I \ncongratulate them on their many successes and wish them the best in \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6799-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 228TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, we celebrate the 228th anniversary \nof the signing of the Constitution of the United States. Some elected \nofficials talk about their love of ``the Constitution and the Bill of \nRights''. That specific phrasing is interesting in that it somehow \nimplies that the Constitution does not itself include the Bill of \nRights, which of course it does. But it contains much more than those \noriginal 10 amendments. Each year, I remind Americans that we must \ncelebrate not just the original Constitution of Washington, Hamilton, \nMadison, and the Founding generation but the whole Constitution, \nincluding its 27 amendments. This includes the 13th, 14th, and 15th \nAmendments, which many scholars have rightly described as our Nation's \nSecond Founding.\n  The Senate commemorated the Sesquicentennial or the 150th anniversary \nof the Second Founding earlier this year when the Senate passed a \nresolution raising awareness about this series of amendments, which \nprovided the country with a new birth of freedom. Ratified by President \nLincoln and his generation after the Civil War, these Second Founding \namendments transformed our original charter--most fundamentally--by \nelevating the principle of equality to a central place in our \nconstitutional order.\n  This year, the Supreme Court once again upheld the Constitution's \npromise of equality when it ruled that the 14th Amendment of the \nConstitution protects the right of each American to marry the person \nthey love, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nBecause of that ruling, LGBT children all across America will grow up \nknowing that they can love without fear, and that they are equal \ncitizens of this great Nation.\n  Although the Constitution provides us with the promise of equality, \nwe must never forget that it is up to all of us to advance and protect \nthat intrinsic American value of equality. Each generation must do its \npart. This is true whether it is racial equality, gender equality, or \nequality based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. We \nhave come a long way in each of those areas, but we continue to have \nwork to do.\n  On racial equality, too many of our citizens continue to face racial \ndiscrimination in voting. As a result of the Supreme Court's dreadful \nruling in Shelby County v. Holder, Americans across the country are now \nvulnerable to racially discriminatory voting laws that restrict the \nfranchise without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act. On \nthis 50th anniversary year of the March in Selma and of the Voting \nRights Act, we must do all we can to restore and enhance the \nprotections of that landmark legislation.\n  On gender equality, we continue to see women being paid less than men \nfor doing the same job. We also continue to see partisan attacks on \nwomen's health care choices. From legislation blocking these choices to \nefforts defunding critical health services for women, we clearly have a \nlong way to go to ensure gender equality.\n  And while LGBT Americans are now able to marry the person they love, \nthey continue to experience discrimination in other aspects of their \nlives. Achieving full equality means that LGBT individuals should be \nable to provide for their families without fear that they will be fired \nfrom their jobs or denied housing. It means that a restaurant should \nnot be able to refuse to serve an LGBT couple because the owner \ndisapproves of that couple's relationship. New civil rights laws are \nneeded to protect LGBT Americans so they can live their lives free from \ndiscrimination.\n  We must uphold this promise of equality for the vulnerable and the \nvoiceless as well. We are a nation of immigrants with a long, proud \nhistory of opening our doors and welcoming people from around the \nworld. After all, the Statue of Liberty has long proclaimed America's \nwelcome: ``Give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning \nto breathe free. . . . Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I \nlift my lamp beside the golden door.'' That is what America has long \nstood for and what we should continue to represent. Instead, I have \nseen ugly partisan rhetoric about changing the 14th Amendment of our \nConstitution to remove birthright citizenship specifically to target \nimmigrants. We should be a nation that embraces and lifts our most \nvulnerable, not a nation that acts out of spite or malice.\n  We must also fight for the voices of all Americans and not just \ncorporations or the wealthy few. Our country has flourished because we \nhave worked hard to ensure that more, not fewer, Americans can take \npart in the democratic process. Instead, our campaign finance laws have \nbeen eviscerated by a Supreme Court that views money as speech and \nrefuses to place any limits on the ability of the wealthy and special \ninterests to drown out hard-working Americans. The Court has also \nirrationally limited the definition of ``corruption'' in our campaign \nfinance laws to just bribery. But unlike a narrow majority of the \nCourt, the public understands that corruption is not just bribery; \nrather, corruption is the idea that money buys access and influences \nour democracy for a wealthy few. This cannot be allowed in our \ndemocracy. The size of your bank account cannot and should not \ndetermine whether and how the government responds to your needs. We \nmust act to restore the First Amendment and to preserve those \nprotections to ensure that all voices can be heard in the democratic \nprocess.\n  Constitution Day is an occasion to celebrate our founding charter and \nthe historic democracy it has caused and fostered. It is also a time to \nreflect on what we are doing as citizens to uphold the promises that \nthe Constitution has provided. I encourage all Americans to mark this \nday by reading the whole Constitution and celebrating how it reflects \nthe great progress we have made to become a more inclusive and stronger \ndemocracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6799-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6799-S6801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING EDWARD W. BROOKE III\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, on March 11, 2015, at Washington National \nCathedral, a memorial service was held for former Massachusetts Senator \nEdward W. Brooke III. Ed was one of the first African Americans to \nserve in combat during World War II. He was the first African American \nto be elected a State attorney general, and the first elected to the \nU.S. Senate by popular vote. In 2004, he was awarded the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom by President George W. Bush. In honor of his \nextraordinary life and service to our Nation, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record the remarks made at Senator Edward W. \nBrooke III's memorial service by Secretary of State John F. Kerry; \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton; Milton C. Davis and Edward W. \nBrooke IV.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Remarks of Secretary of State\n\n                             John F. Kerry\n\n       Good morning. It's a privilege to share some thoughts about \n     Ed Brooke.\n       I want you to think back half a century. Imagine a room in \n     the 1960s where all the leading Massachusetts politicians are \n     gathered--Kennedy, McCormack, O'Neill, Volpe, Brooke. Among \n     them, one figure stands out as the courageous representative \n     of an embattled minority; Ed Brooke; alone; undaunted; the \n     only Episcopalian.\n       Imagine another room, the chamber of the U.S. Senate. \n     Shortly after noon on January 10, 1967, a man of consummate \n     dignity strides down the center aisle; Legislators rise and \n     applaud; the gallery cheers. The first African-American \n     popularly-elected to the Senate takes his seat. In that \n     moment, Ed Brooke was not just a pioneer; he was an advance \n     scout probing the soul of our country. Twenty-six years would \n     pass before a second African-American would be elected.\n       Imagine a young man raised in Washington, joining the army \n     immediately after Pearl Harbor, later deploying to Italy as \n     part of a segregated infantry battalion. There, Lieutenant \n     Brooke watched in anguish as his buddies were sent each \n     morning to attack a heavily-fortified German position in the \n     Apennines.\n       The young soldier soon became convinced that his men were \n     being used as cannon fodder by racist commanders. He proposed \n     a\n\n[[Page S6800]]\n\n     shift in tactics, an operation staged later in the day, when \n     the enemy would be sleeping. The answer came back: ``The \n     colonel would never send a boy to do a man's job.'' Brooke \n     persisted and the operation he organized went ahead, catching \n     the enemy by surprise and driving them from the mountain. His \n     battalion suffered 1300 casualties and won 27 medals; its \n     reward was to be dismantled and its personnel scattered to \n     places where many could neither sit at a lunch counter nor \n     vote. We must never forget that--as much as Ike, Patton and \n     Marshall--Ed Brooke and the African-Americans who joined him \n     in fighting Fascism were part of the greatest generation and \n     we owe them an incalculable debt.\n       But this was just the beginning of Ed Brooke's journey.\n       As a legislator, Senator Brooke was always on the cutting \n     edge--championing a woman's right to choose; taking on the \n     tobacco industry when smoking was still considered cool; \n     initiating a program to help minority businesspeople create \n     jobs; guaranteeing women equal access to credit; and \n     authoring an amendment that, to this day, enables tens of \n     thousands of people each year to qualify for public housing \n     and thereby escape shelters or the streets.\n       When President Nixon asked the Senate to confirm a Supreme \n     Court nominee whose supporters argued--and I'm not making \n     this up--that mediocrity deserved representation--Ed Brooke \n     looked his party's leadership in the eye and said no--and did \n     the same on two other Nixon nominees.\n       He also differed from the President by being right about \n     the Vietnam War and voting to end it--a position that \n     mattered a lot to many of his constituents, including me.\n       And when ideologues tried to gut the Civil Rights and \n     Voting Rights laws: Ed Brooke used every instrument in the \n     legislative tool box to stop them--declaring that liberties \n     that took a century or more to secure must never again be \n     denied. A vow that, as President Obama reminded us in Selma \n     on Saturday, remains as timely now as ever.\n       For all of his career, Ed Brooke was his own man. As \n     Attorney General, he was relentless in cracking down on \n     corruption--which in Massachusetts in the early 1960s \n     provided what we might call ``a target-rich environment.'' \n     His electoral triumphs were astonishing in a state that was \n     only 2 percent black, where school desegregation was an \n     explosive issue, and where the face of prejudice might appear \n     either ugly with anger or thinly masked by code words. In one \n     early race he narrowly lost, his opponent, Kevin White, \n     claimed to see no hidden message in campaign bumper stickers \n     that read simply: ``Vote White.''\n       Repeatedly, Brooke was urged by the political establishment \n     not to run for higher office--to instead bide his time until \n     Massachusetts was [quote-unquote] ``ready.'' Indeed, in 1962, \n     when he ran for Attorney General, his opponent was the \n     formidable Elliott Richardson, a man with deep connections to \n     what were--socially and financially--the upper echelons of \n     the Commonwealth. But Ed Brooke didn't back down, and because \n     he didn't, a straight line can be drawn between his electoral \n     victories and that of another African-American--this time in \n     the national arena--some four decades later.\n       I was in high school when Ed Brooke first ran for statewide \n     office, attracting so many Democratic voters to the \n     Republican primary that our party had to work for months \n     afterward reregistering them.\n       I had met Ed but didn't really know him until after I \n     arrived in Washington. In my early years in the Senate, he \n     would come by occasionally and talk about the job or the \n     events of the day. Whenever I saw him, I was struck by his \n     warmth and kindness and his interest in what I was doing. He \n     was a charismatic man with a genuine laugh and a resonant \n     voice and a ready willingness to answer my questions. One \n     topic we discussed was the parallels. After all, we had both \n     gone from college to war to law school to a prosecutor's \n     office to spend many years as the ``junior'' Senator from \n     Massachusetts. We had each won and lost elections and guess \n     what--we both agreed that winning was better.\n       Believe me, few public statements are harder to deliver \n     than a concession speech after a closely-contested--even \n     bitter--race. In 1978, I was indelibly struck by how Ed's \n     remarks set a new standard for grace amid pain. He \n     congratulated his opponent and paid tribute to allies who \n     would, he said, carry on his work. He was flanked by one \n     source of strength, his mother--and alluded to a second in \n     saying: ``When I was down in the valley, I didn't cry--I \n     cried out--and you gave me the strength to move on.''\n       Early on, this proud son introduced me to Helen Brooke who, \n     during my years in the Senate, embraced me as much as anyone \n     in the city. Mother Brooke loved her family and her church; \n     she loved to have a good time and she taught her son how to \n     be a successful politician. ``Always thank people,'' she \n     said, ``and make them feel special.'' That advice stuck. As \n     one colleague observed, ``When Ed Brooke looked at you, you \n     felt he was not only thinking about you and only you, but \n     that he probably hadn't thought about anyone else in weeks.''\n       Fifteen years ago, the state courthouse--just across from \n     my own district office in Boston--was named after Ed Brooke--\n     a tribute to the man and a regular reminder to all of his \n     love for the practice of law. In Massachusetts, three charter \n     schools are dedicated to his memory; and many of their \n     students made the journey from the land of the seven-foot \n     snowdrifts to be here with us today; there are also many \n     students from Dunbar--his high school alma mater.\n       Senator Brooke shunned the title of trailblazer, but that's \n     exactly what he was. He inspired thousands of young people--\n     of every race--to enter public service. Some criticized him \n     for not being more outspoken or for not being enough this or \n     enough that--trying to mold him to their expectations--but he \n     was always true to himself. He fought ceaselessly and with \n     determination for the poor, for minorities, for women, and \n     for what he felt was right. He was the embodiment of a style \n     of legislating that valued substance over rhetoric and public \n     needs over political agendas. Bipartisanship, to him, was \n     never a four letter word.\n       So we are privileged to be here--family, friends, \n     admirers--in celebration and thanksgiving, for this \n     remarkable man. In recent years, as Ed Brooke received the \n     highest civilian honors our nation can bestow--the \n     Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential Medal of \n     Freedom--he reminded us that the work to which he had \n     dedicated his own best efforts--remains unfinished.\n       Ed Brooke understood the ebb and flow of life. He endured \n     great loss and enjoyed exuberant triumphs, saw the valleys \n     and the mountain tops, and would be the first to tell us that \n     he lived a full and blessed life. For him and for that--we \n     will always be grateful.\n\n             Remarks of Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton\n\n       Anne, family, colleagues, public officials, friends all of \n     Senator Edward William Brooke. You do not grow up desiring to \n     be a United States Senator if you were born in the District \n     of Columbia in 1919; not if you lived in one of the \n     District's African American communities, LeDroit Park; not if \n     you went to our segregated public schools and graduated from \n     Dunbar High School, and the Senator's class of 1936 is in the \n     church today, and from Howard University; not even if you \n     became a World War II hero and won the Bronze Star, leading \n     your segregated unit in a broad daylight attack on an enemy \n     bunker; and certainly not if your hometown had no elected \n     self-government, much less senators.\n       Edward William Brooke was nurtured in a loving, closely \n     knit, aspiring African American community in the District of \n     Columbia. But it did not groom him to think of himself as a \n     public official.\n       Senator Brooke owed much to a childhood spent in our city \n     where children were raised to believe segregation did not for \n     a moment mean you were inferior. But the man that became a \n     natural politician, charismatic, charming, brilliant, and \n     utterly approachable, invented himself and went on to become \n     not only a public official, but a historic figure.\n       The Senate has always had its share of self-made men and \n     women. Edward Brooke was a self-made senator. Many had \n     thought of Barack Obama as a man ahead of his time, until the \n     President came to the Capitol in 2009 to present the \n     Congressional Gold Medal to Senator Brooke. After receiving \n     the medal, Senator Brooke regaled us with remarks that must \n     have been written in his head and his heart, because without \n     so much as a note, he accepted the medal in a voice that \n     resonated as it must have when he spoke in the Senate about \n     the Brooke Amendment to the Fair Housing Act, which limited \n     to 25% the portion of income a family must pay in rent for \n     public housing.\n       Don't ask me how a black man without guide posts became one \n     of the most popular politicians ever in Massachusetts, a \n     state where only 2% of the population was black. I cannot \n     explain the conundrum that was Edward Brooke. But I \n     experienced the warmth and the talent that made him \n     successful as a public man and dear as a friend. And I can \n     tell you this: Edward Brooke never forgot where he came from, \n     the city that nurtured his uniqueness. Without hesitation, he \n     volunteered to talk with senators in his Republican Party \n     when the Senate and the House both passed the D.C. House \n     Voting Rights Act. He succeeded. The vote for the District \n     was lost to an amendment that would have wiped out all of the \n     District's gun laws in return for a vote in the People's \n     House.\n       Senator Brooke's place in American history was sealed and \n     delivered long before he died in January. His place as the \n     first African American elected to the Senate with the popular \n     vote and his extraordinary record as a senator are even more \n     remarkable when you consider his origins here in the District \n     of Columbia, which had no local government at all. The \n     residents of his hometown continue to struggle for equal \n     rights as American citizens and for statehood. But nothing \n     could inspire our citizens more than a native son, born in a \n     city without a vote or a local public official, who rose to \n     cast votes in the Senate of the United States.\n       Thank you.\n\nRemarks of Milton C. Davis, the 29th General President of the Alpha Phi \n                            Alpha Fraternity\n\n       ``God of justice, save the people from the clash of race \n     and creed, From the strife of class and faction, make our \n     nation free indeed; Keep her faith in simple manhood strong \n     as when her life began, Till it find its full fruition in the \n     brotherhood of man!''\n       This is a stanza from a favorite hymn of Edward Brooke \n     which he often quoted in the speeches he delivered across the \n     country and the world. This stanza summarized his theme of \n     life; his mission in life. Long before I ever met him in \n     person, I came to know him\n\n[[Page S6801]]\n\n     through the pages of the history of Alpha Phi Alpha \n     Fraternity, the world's first African American collegiate \n     fraternity founded in 1906. This Alpha history book depicted \n     a plethora of role models and heroes, the likes of W. E. B. \n     Dubois, Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, Jr., Jesse \n     Owens and scores more, whose life and work inspires and \n     advances a race of people and a nation. None stood out more \n     dramatically than the life and achievements of Edward William \n     Brooke. He was my hero; dignified, a scholar, charismatic, \n     accomplished and fearless. Regular history books have yet to \n     give him the credit he has earned.\n       Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity is in its 109th year of \n     existence and for 77 of those 109 years, Edward William \n     Brooke stood in the circle of our brotherhood. When Alpha Phi \n     Alpha Fraternity undertook the awesome twenty-seven year task \n     of building the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial on the \n     National Mall here in Washington DC., Edward William Brooke \n     was first to come forward with significant resources and the \n     use of his influence to help guide that process.\n       He was an active, contributing and esteemed member until \n     his death.\n       The law served as his instrument, tool and weapon with \n     which he sought to advance the cause of justice in the face \n     of prejudice, discrimination and segregation which surrounded \n     him as he grew up in the nation's capital not far from this \n     place.\n       He fought against the tyranny of the Axis powers as a \n     commissioned officer in the U.S. Army during World War II \n     assigned to the segregated 366th all black infantry regiment \n     where he earned a Bronze Star for valor on the battle field.\n       Edward Brooke also served as an advocate for black soldiers \n     who were charged with offenses in his regiment even though he \n     was not then a trained, licensed attorney.\n       Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, using its members who were \n     lawyers in the 1940s and 1950s filed several major lawsuits \n     seeking to dismantle segregation and battle racism in \n     America. Among those cases filed and financed by the national \n     fraternity was the case of Elmer Henderson vs. The United \n     States; the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Southern \n     Railway. The case challenged the Commerce Commission \n     regulation which allowed segregation and discrimination in \n     railroad dining cars in interstate commerce. In the dining \n     car, black passengers were only allowed to occupy two tables \n     nearest the kitchen and when occupied by black travelers a \n     curtain had to be drawn to hide their presence from white \n     passengers. If white passengers needed the two tables \n     assigned to black passengers, the black passengers had to \n     wait until the white passengers vacated the tables \n     assigned to blacks.\n       Edward Brooke was recruited to join the Alpha legal team \n     headed by then General President of Alpha Belford Lawson in \n     filing briefs before the U.S. Supreme Court attacking these \n     racial barriers and on June 5, 1950, four years before Brown \n     v. the Board of Education major decision, after an eight year \n     battle through the lower courts, the \n     U.S. Supreme Court struck down the regulation which allowed \n     segregation and discrimination in railroad dining cars due in \n     part to the heroic efforts of Edward Brooke. Edward Brooke \n     was a champion for equality and fairness, his standard and \n     measure of a person was the world's standard of excellence. \n     He wanted only to be judged by the content of his character \n     and his abilities rather than his racial background.\n       Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was initiated into Alpha \n     Phi Alpha Fraternity by Edward Brooke while King was a \n     graduate student at Boston University stated the proposition \n     that--Life's most persistent and urgent question is ``What \n     are you doing for others?''\n       Edward W. Brooke became an acknowledged national treasure \n     by using his time, talent, influence, power and intellect \n     demonstrating his commitment to uplifting others and assuring \n     that in matters of fair housing, voting rights, education and \n     justice that the promise of America to equality under law \n     became more of a practical reality rather than just a lofty \n     ideal.\n       In one of his campaigns, a Boston political writer wrote \n     ``Brooke was a carpetbagger from the South, a Republican in a \n     Democratic State, a black in a white state, a Protestant in a \n     Catholic state and he is poor. Edward Brooke replied: I \n     pleaded guilty to all indictments and I continued to \n     persevere in my campaign. Brooke won; America won.\n       That's what heroes do: They look reality in the face and \n     persevere!\n       The Poet Robert Louis Stevenson aptly sums up my journey of \n     friendship and brotherhood with Senator Edward W. Brooke with \n     these words:\n\n     He has achieved success;\n     Who has lived well, laughed often, and loved much;\n     Who has enjoyed the trust and respect of intelligent men and \n           women and the love of little children;\n     Who has filled his niche and accomplished his task;\n     Who has left the world better than he found it;\n     Who has always looked for the best in others;\n     And given them the best he had;\n     Whose life was an inspiration;\n     Whose memory a benediction.\n\n                     Remarks by Edward W. Brooke IV\n\n       On behalf of my family I would like to thank the \n     distinguished speakers who preceded me for their thoughtful \n     and deeply moving tributes. As they have so eloquently \n     stated, and as most of you well know: my father lived one of \n     The Great American Lives. It was my privilege to know him and \n     to be a part of his life. It is my honor to be his son, and \n     to be here with all of you today, in appreciation of a man \n     whom I love so dearly.\n       The moments of the past are not gone from us, nor we from \n     them. The light of each moment shines on through eternity as \n     the light of distant stars travels through space and time to \n     reach our eyes and touch our minds. And so the brilliant \n     light of his great life shines on for us, that we may better \n     find our way in the dark unknown.\n       When I was but a child, not so long ago, my father would \n     always say, ``Waste not; want not.'' Usually he would do this \n     as he walked around turning off the lights in vacant rooms or \n     pointing out the unused excess ketchup on my dinner-plate. I \n     thought I understood what he meant. Though when I now \n     consider the familiar saying in the full context of his life, \n     it reveals a far more powerful truth: That if we never waste \n     the opportunity to help each other live better lives, none \n     among us would ever have to want for a life that could not be \n     attained.\n       In this generous spirit, and leading by example, my father \n     constantly strived toward the realization of a better world--\n     a world in which the apparent differences between individuals \n     would never again be mistaken as cause to deny justice, \n     humanity, or dignity, nor to justify violence, exploitation, \n     or disrespect. We must continue to work as he did, with faith \n     in the possibility of the best imaginable outcome, and the \n     assurance that fearfulness and cynicism cannot withstand the \n     immeasurable kindness of which we are capable.\n       My father was a truly tender, sweet, and lovely man. He \n     forgave my many errors and patiently helped me to learn from \n     them. He taught me to read, to speak, and to think, to love \n     and be loved. For all of this and so much more, I am forever \n     grateful--grateful to him, and to his mother Helen and father \n     Edward for raising up a man so entirely and strikingly \n     unafraid to be the best possible version of himself; grateful \n     to the ancestors who, surviving hardship and desolation, held \n     intact the sacred vitality of which my father's life is a \n     profound expression; and grateful to my mother, whose \n     inspiring and unconditional love made our lives together so \n     beautiful.\n       We know that he will always be with us, and pray for him \n     eternal peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6801-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6801-S6802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOHN F. LEHMAN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a true American \npatriot, a fellow naval aviator, and a close personal friend, former \nSecretary of Navy, the Honorable John F. Lehman.\n  Secretary Lehman served his country for over 30 years both in uniform \nin the United States Navy and as Secretary of the Navy during the \nReagan Administration, from 1981-1987. His leadership and dedication to \nour country and to the Navy set a high mark unsurpassed to this day. It \nwas Secretary Lehman who championed a ``600-ship'' Navy after the \ndevastating post-Vietnam war cutbacks. He knew how important this naval \ninvestment was to rebuilding our global military and strategic power. \nTogether with President Reagan, he offered the vision of strength that \nwould ultimately bring an end to the Soviet Union. His tenure stands as \na lesson of history that peace comes through strength and commitment, \nnot weakness and retreat.\n  Secretary Lehman's impact on the country and our national security \nhas not ended with the conclusion of his tour in the Pentagon. He \ncontinues to offer essential and trusted advice to decision makers \nthroughout our national leadership. I am proud to call Secretary Lehman \nmy friend, and I am honored to recognize him today. For these and many \nother reasons, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe citation in honor of Secretary Lehman's recently awarded National \nDefense Industrial Association Gold Medal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nGold Medal For Distinguished Service Is Presented to The Honorable John \n                               F. Lehman\n\n       For a lifetime of extraordinary leadership and dedication \n     to a strong national security of the United States of \n     America, the Honorable John F. Lehman is hereby recognized \n     for his superb service to our country, both in and out of \n     uniform, and in both the United States Air Force and the \n     United States Navy, serving with great distinction for over \n     three decades in a succession of demanding leadership \n     positions of ever-increasing authority and responsibility, \n     including serving as the 65th Secretary of the Navy for six \n     years, beginning at the age of 38. Never one to hold himself \n     apart from those he leads, Secretary Lehman continued to \n     concurrently serve as a Naval Aviator while serving\n\n[[Page S6802]]\n\n     as Secretary of the Navy. Throughout his illustrious career, \n     Secretary Lehman has excelled in numerous top level positions \n     supporting both the national security and foreign policy of \n     the United States, including as a staff member to Dr. Henry \n     Kissinger on the National Security Council, as a delegate to \n     the Force Reductions Negotiations in Vienna, as Deputy \n     Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and \n     as a member of the 9/11 Commission. A lasting hallmark of \n     Secretary Lehman's commitment to national security was his \n     out-front leadership for the ``600-ship Navy.'' This plan was \n     integral to President Reagan's goal of winning the Cold War \n     against the Soviet Union and to rebuilding the Navy's fleet \n     of ships following post-Vietnam War cutbacks. Secretary \n     Lehman also developed a critical strategic concept known as \n     the ``Lehman Doctrine.'' His plan, which called for a \n     military response to any Russian invasion in Europe by \n     invading the Soviet Far East, was an innovative strategic \n     concept essential to our conventional deterrence of the \n     Soviet Union. Even after so many accomplishments in public \n     service, Secretary Lehman has continued to offer his advice \n     and support to national security leaders to this day. In \n     addition to his national security credentials, Secretary \n     Lehman holds a B.S. degree from St. Joseph's University, B.A. \n     and M.A. degrees from Cambridge University, and a Ph.D. from \n     the University of Pennsylvania. He has enjoyed great success \n     in business as a founding partner and Chairman of J.F. Lehman \n     & Company, as the president of an aerospace consulting firm, \n     and he is currently a director on a variety of corporate \n     boards. He has authored numerous books, including `On Seas of \n     Glory', `Command of the Seas', and `Making War', and \n     continues to write for the National Review on American \n     Seapower for the 21st Century. Secretary Lehman serves as a \n     member of a number of influential American think tanks to \n     include serving as the Chair of Foreign Policy Research \n     Institute's National Security Program. His visionary \n     leadership, wise counsel and unparalleled service over the \n     last 40 years in government and business have contributed \n     immeasurably to sustaining a strong and successful U.S. \n     national security posture. Secretary Lehman's extraordinary \n     devotion to duty, clarity of purpose, and record of \n     remarkable achievements are in keeping with the highest \n     traditions of public and private service and reflect great \n     credit upon him, the men and women in uniform, and the United \n     States of America.\n       Given this day September 18, 2015 by:\n     Arnold L.

Mr. President, I wish to commemorate in the Record the \nanniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution.\n  On this day in 1787, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention \nmet for the last time to sign the U.S. Constitution. In the pursuit to \nform a more perfect union, the Framers of the Constitution created a \ndocument that not only solidified our fledgling Nation but inspired \nothers across the globe to strive for liberty, too. Organizations such \nas Lions Clubs International, the Daughters of the American Revolution, \nthe Georgia Federation of Republican Women, and others deserve a great \ndeal of gratitude for their efforts to bring attention to this \nimportant day. In recognition of this momentous occasion in American \nhistory and in honor of Constitution Day, I encourage all Georgians and \nall Americans to read, study, and learn the contents of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I appreciate the efforts of our educators, elected officials, \ncommunity leaders, and parents who teach our youth about the \nfoundations of justice, strength and equality upon which our great \nNation was built. I never cease to be amazed at how the principles of \nthe Constitution play out in our daily lives as Americans.\n  Today is an appropriate occasion for we the people of the United \nStates, as well as the people's elected representatives in Congress, to \nrenew our commitment to the principles of the U.S. Constitution. The \nConstitution's values--liberty, separation of powers, consent of the \ngoverned, and the principle that no one is above the law--are just as \ntrue and just as relevant today as they were when they were set to \nparchment more than two centuries ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6802-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH AND HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS WEEK\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced two \nbipartisan resolutions that were adopted by unanimous consent: S. Res. \n254, recognizing September 15 to October 15 as Hispanic Heritage Month, \nand S. Res. 255, designating the week of September 14, 2015 as National \nHispanic-Serving Institutions Week.\n  These resolutions celebrate the immense contributions of Hispanic \nAmericans to our great Nation and honor the critical work of more than \n400 non-profit Hispanic-Serving Institutions for their important role \nin educating and empowering Hispanic youth.\n  Latinos have a long and decorated history in the United States, full \nof extraordinary contributions to America's past, present, and future. \nLatinos have proudly served, helped build, and defended our country for \nhundreds of years, honorably serving in every action since before the \nfounding of the Nation.\n  Hispanics fought alongside patriots in the American Revolution and \nrallied in the Civil War, serving bravely in both the Union and \nConfederate armies. Latinos rode in Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders \nduring the Spanish-American War, received Congressional Medals of Honor \nin both World Wars, and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country in \nKorea and Vietnam. As of July 31, 2015, more than 164,000 Hispanic \nAmericans are actively serving with distinction in the United States \nArmed Forces.\n  Just as Latinos have defended our Nation, we have also helped shape \nand build it. That is why I also wish to recognize the exemplary \ninstitutions that are making vital investments in the next generation \nof Latino leaders.\n  Hispanic-Serving Institutions are colleges or universities where \ntotal Hispanic enrollment constitutes a minimum of 25 percent of the \nstudent body, and they serve more than half of all Latino students in \nthe United States. As a product of a Hispanic-Serving Institution in my \nhome State of New Jersey, my experience is a living testimony of the \nimportant role that HSIs play in expanding opportunities for Latino \nstudents in 21 States across the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.\n  With these resolutions, we celebrate the contributions of all Latinos \nand the institutions that serve and enrich the Latino community in the \nUnited States. I look forward to celebrating the heritage and culture \nof Hispanic Americans who have and will continue to positively \ninfluence and enrich our Nation--not only during this special month and \nweek, but throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6802-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING GROWTH DISORDER AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, on behalf of every child currently \nliving with a growth disorder I wish to recognize this week--September \n13-19, 2015--as Growth Disorder Awareness Week.\n  A child's growth is a strong indicator of that child's overall health \nstatus. According to the Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed \nMalformations, POSSUM, database, more than 600 serious diseases and \nhealth conditions can cause growth failure. These diseases range from \nnutritional disturbances and hormone imbalances to far more serious \nconditions that affect the kidneys or even lead to brain tumors. While \nthese conditions affect a child's growth progress, a stunning 48 \npercent of children with the most common growth disorders go \nundiagnosed. To make matters worse, the longer a child with growth \nfailure goes undiagnosed, the greater the potential for long-term \nhealth issues and higher costs of treatment. Early detection and \ndiagnosis are, therefore, critical to ensuring a healthy future for \nthese children.\n  This week, as we recognize Growth Awareness Week, I applaud the MAGIC \nFoundation for the tremendous work they do to further public awareness \nof growth failure and to improve the lives and health of the children \nwhom they affect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6802-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6802-S6803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING NATIONAL LOBSTER DAY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this August the Senate unanimously passed \na resolution designating September 25, 2015, as National Lobster Day. I \nwas proud to cosponsor that resolution with my fellow Mainer, Senator \nAngus King, and to be joined by our New England colleagues, Senators \nShaheen and\n\n[[Page S6803]]\n\nAyotte of New Hampshire, Reed and Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and \nMurphy and Blumenthal of Connecticut.\n  That day has arrived and will be celebrated with a special event at \nthe Maine Maritime Museum in the City of Bath. For more than a half-\ncentury, this outstanding museum has honored our State's seafaring \nheritage and the important role Maine plays today in global maritime \nactivities.\n  Lobster fishing is central to that heritage. Since colonial times, it \nhas served as an economic engine and a family tradition in New England, \nhelping to support the livelihoods of thousands of families. Throughout \nthe region, more than 120 million pounds of lobster are caught each \nyear, making it one of our most valuable commodities.\n  More than 70 percent of this harvest is hauled in by Maine's 6,000 \ncommercial license holders. Lobster is the backbone of Maine's prolific \nfishing industry, which produces more than $1 billion in economic \nactivity and supports 26,000 year-round jobs in such affiliated \nenterprises as boatbuilding and maintenance, trap-making, bait, fuel \nand other supplies. The Maine lobster industry is built upon thousands \nof owner-operated family businesses, where the generations work \ntogether, supporting themselves and sustaining their communities.\n  The hard-working men and women of the Maine lobster industry are the \noriginal conservationists. For more than 150 years, they have led the \nway in managing this precious resource through size restrictions and \ntrap limits, and they are at the forefront of efforts to protect whales \nand other marine mammals. The economic activity they generate helps to \npreserve the working waterfronts that are essential to coastal \ncommunities.\n  The lobster industry represents the very essence of Maine--a deep \nrespect for the environment and a dedication to hard work. I \ncongratulate the men and women of the Maine lobster industry for \nupholding this centuries-old heritage and thank the Maine Maritime \nMuseum for celebrating it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6803-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6803-S6804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM HUBBS REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, Thursday, September 3, was the 10th \nanniversary of the death of William Hubbs Rehnquist, the former Chief \nJustice of the United States Supreme Court. Rehnquist was an absolutely \noutstanding chief, one of the most influential Justices in the 225-year \nhistory of the Court. And the 10 years since his unfortunate passing \nhave only served to increase the level of respect and admiration many \nhave for him. This reverence is richly deserved, as Rehnquist spent \nover three decades--nearly two decades as Chief Justice--valiantly \nattempting to return the Court to this country's first principles, \nfederalism being a primary one, in order to salvage our fundamental \nliberties. This is a goal the current Court would do well to remember \nand embrace.\n  Of course, I am slightly biased in this matter. I clerked for \nRehnquist, after all, and therefore spent an entire year learning at \nhis side, while simultaneously embarrassing myself in his doubles \ntennis matches. But what is amazing about Rehnquist is how much esteem \nhe was held in by those who often disagreed with him. Indeed, the \nrespect he enjoyed from his colleagues was unparalleled. To give just \none of many examples, Walter Dellinger, a former Solicitor General in \nthe Clinton administration, wrote that ``Rehnquist was a great leader \nand effective administrator of the Supreme Court and the national \njudiciary. He ran a tight ship. . . . Every justice with whom I have \nspoken in recent years has noted that the court was functioning well \nunder his leadership.'' Rehnquist didn't just treat his fellow lawyers \nwell, either. He knew everyone's name who worked in the Court--from \nJustices, to police officers, to janitors--and he treated them all \nfairly and with dignity. Outside the Court, where he regularly strolled \nwith his clerks, he would often graciously take pictures of tourists, \nwho had no idea they had just asked our country's top judicial officer \nto assist with their family snapshot. These days, in the era of \nselfies, the tourists probably would not notice him at all. And \nRehnquist would be fine with that. Humility was one of his defining \ncharacteristics.\n  In remembrance of Chief Justice Rehnquist's passing, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a memorial article I wrote for \nthe Harvard Law Review 10 years ago. This is not nearly as much as \nRehnquist deserves, but it is more than a man like Rehnquist would ever \nrequest for himself. We miss you, Chief.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Harvard Law Review, Nov., 2005]\n\n                   In Memoriam: William H. Rehnquist\n\n                            (By R. Ted Cruz)\n\n\nThe editors of the Harvard Law Review respectfully dedicate this issue \n                 to Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist\n\n       A doll, a headdress, and a ship captain's wheel. All three \n     enjoyed prominent placement in the Chief Justice's private \n     chambers. Each was a gift from his law clerks, and each \n     symbolized a different aspect of William Hubbs Rehnquist's \n     tenure as Chief Justice of the United States.\n       Appointed to the Court in 1971, then-Justice Rehnquist \n     found himself on a Court very much out of step with the rest \n     of the nation. Five months after he arrived, in June of 1972, \n     the Court issued Furman v. Georgia, striking down the death \n     penalty across the country. Despite the fact that capital \n     punishment is referenced explicitly in the text of \n     Constitution, the Court concluded that it was nonetheless \n     unconstitutional and with the stroke of a pen threw out the \n     laws of virtually every state. Predicated upon what were \n     termed ``evolving standards of decency,'' Furman asserted \n     that five Justices were better arbiters of what was \n     ``decent'' than the hundreds of millions of voters who had \n     elected the legislatures that had widely adopted the death \n     penalty.\n       Justice Rehnquist, of course, dissented. And four years \n     later, the Court retreated from its decree that no state \n     could ``decently'' choose to impose the death penalty. But \n     Furman was emblematic. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Court \n     consistently elevated the rights of criminal defendants, and, \n     repeatedly, Justice Rehnquist dissented, often alone.\n       As in criminal law, so too across the gamut, especially \n     concerning federalism and the Religion Clauses. For his first \n     decade and beyond, Justice Rehnquist earned his ``Lone \n     Ranger'' nickname. Thus, the first gift from the clerks--a \n     twelve-inch adjustable Lone Ranger doll, which sat for some \n     three decades on the bookshelf in his back office.\n       But the fiery dissents of the 1970s were not to be Justice \n     Rehnquist's entire legacy. In 1986, President Reagan made him \n     Chief. Thus, the second gift--an elaborate Indian feather \n     headdress, which sat next to the Lone Ranger doll on the \n     bookshelf.\n       Beside both the doll and the headdress lay one of the most \n     startling graphical representations of the different role \n     Chief Justice Rehnquist was to play. Starting at the ceiling, \n     his bound opinions from each Term stretched across the \n     shelves. For the first fifteen years, each Term's bound \n     volume is consistently three to four inches wide. Then, in \n     1986, there is a sharp divide: from that point forward, each \n     Term's volume of collected opinions falls to one to two \n     inches in width. That visual break was not the result of a \n     sudden lack of verbosity. Rather, it was a physical \n     manifestation of Chief Justice Rehnquist's understanding of \n     the very different task assigned a Chief Justice. No longer \n     was his principal role to expound impassioned individual \n     views; instead, it was to lead.\n       Thus, in 1996--his twenty-fifth anniversary as a Justice \n     and his tenth as Chief--his third and most emblematic gift \n     came from the clerks: a large ship's captain's wheel, which \n     was mounted on the wall to commemorate his careful guidance \n     of the Court over the decades.\n       The Chief steered the Court, carefully, steadily, over \n     nineteen years at the helm. One result of that guidance, \n     widely appreciated by lawyers, scholars, and public \n     commentators, is that many of those 1970s-era Rehnquist \n     dissents are now the law of the land. Indeed, there are few \n     clearer legal arcs than the path from Rehnquist dissent to \n     Court majority over these three decades.\n       Hence, the so-called federalist revolution, revitalizing an \n     important structural safeguard to human liberty through the \n     preservation of the real authority of sovereign states. ``We \n     start with first principles,'' the Chief began in United \n     States v. Lopez. ``The Constitution creates a Federal \n     Government of enumerated powers,'' ``few and defined,'' in \n     James Madison's words, which ``ensure[s] [the] protection of \n     our fundamental liberties.''\n       Hence, the return to balance in the Court's Establishment \n     Clause jurisprudence, repudiating the hostility toward \n     religion manifested by earlier decisions. Thus, in 2002, the \n     Chief wrote Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, upholding the Cleveland \n     school-choice program and making clear that the Constitution \n     does not require the exclusion of religious schools from the \n     options presented to children in need.\n       Fittingly, the Chiefs last opinion, handed down as the last \n     opinion on the last day of the Term, was Van Orden v. Perry. \n     Texas defended the Ten Commandments monument outside our \n     State Capitol, and we won, 5-4. In his plurality opinion, the \n     Chief made clear that nothing in the First Amendment requires \n     chisels and bulldozers to erase any and all public references \n     to the Almighty.\n\n[[Page S6804]]\n\n      Rather, the Constitution embraces tolerance, not hostility, \n     toward religion.\n       And hence the well chronicled retreat from the 1960s- and \n     70s-era overbroad protections for criminal defendants, \n     restoring a jurisprudential approach that preserves \n     constitutional liberties without unnecessarily frustrating \n     good-faith law enforcement efforts.\n       That legacy of legal transformation has earned Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist, in the judgment of President Clinton's \n     acting Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, a place--along \n     with John Marshall and Earl Warren--among the three most \n     influential Chief Justices in history.\n       Yet even so, the Chief's skill in steering the Court, the \n     care and diligence with which he achieved that legacy, is not \n     widely understood. Indeed, many scholars, lawyers, and law \n     students have misperceived the Chief's jurisprudence--\n     incorrectly deeming him, for example, significantly less \n     conservative than Justices Scalia and Thomas--because they \n     have failed to appreciate the distinct role of the Chief \n     Justice, guiding the Court.\n       Take, for example, Dickerson v. United States, reaffirming \n     Miranda v. Arizona as the law of the land. At the time of his \n     death, eulogists pointed to Dickerson as an example of how \n     the Chief had moderated his views, growing over time away \n     from his Lone Ranger passion and toward an appreciation for \n     elements of the status quo.\n       In my judgment, that view seriously misapprehends Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist. Indeed, a careful examination of Dickerson \n     can illuminate much of how he served as Chief. At the outset, \n     Dickerson cannot be understood in isolation; instead, one \n     must consider the entire course of the Chiefs criminal-law \n     jurisprudence.\n       For decades before Dickerson, the Chief had been a vocal \n     critic of Miranda. Beginning with Michigan v. Tucker in 1974, \n     the Chief authored or joined dozens of opinions limiting \n     Miranda's reach. Viewed by many as one of the worst Warren \n     Court excesses, Miranda combined an activist approach--\n     mandating specific police warnings found nowhere in the \n     Constitution--with unsettling outcomes--ensuring, in \n     conjunction with a robust exclusionary rule, that \n     demonstrably guilty criminals could go free on the barest of \n     technicalities.\n       The predicate for all of the Chief's efforts to cabin in \n     Miranda was the notion that the specified warnings were not \n     constitutionally required; rather, they were merely a \n     ``prophylactic'' measure in aid of the broader constitutional \n     value. Because Miranda was prophylactic--because the \n     Constitution did not require its application in every \n     respect--the Chief was able gradually to do much to mitigate \n     its harmful effects.\n       Enter 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3501. Passed in the wake of Miranda \n     and signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson, \n     Sec. 3501, in effect, purported to overrule Miranda and \n     return to the underlying constitutional standard of \n     voluntariness for the admission of confessions. Yet, for \n     three decades, Sec. 3501 lay dormant on the statute books, \n     all but ignored.\n       In Dickerson, however, a federal court of appeals for the \n     first time gave force to the words of the statute, admitting \n     into evidence a voluntary confession notwithstanding the lack \n     of properly administered Miranda warnings. Thus, the validity \n     of Sec. 3501 was squarely presented.\n       If there was one thing the Chief knew, it was the minds of \n     his colleagues; he had a remarkable sense for what his \n     Brethren were and were not willing to do. As a practical \n     matter, there was no way that Justice O'Connor or Justice \n     Kennedy would possibly be willing to overrule Miranda. It was \n     too established, too much a part of the legal firmament, for \n     either of them to hazard extinguishing it.\n       If there had been four votes to overrule Miranda, it is \n     difficult to imagine that, given his decades of principled \n     opposition, the Chief would not have readily provided the \n     fifth. But the votes were not there.\n       In their place was genuine peril. Section 3501 was a \n     statute passed by Congress and signed into law by the \n     President; the only way it could be invalidated was for it to \n     be declared unconstitutional. And, if it were \n     unconstitutional, that would presumably be because Miranda \n     was not mere prophylaxis, but itself required by the \n     Constitution.\n       Had the Chief voted with the dissenters, the majority \n     opinion would have been assigned by the senior Justice in the \n     majority, in this case Justice Stevens. And Justice Stevens, \n     of course, had a very different view of Miranda than did the \n     Chief.\n       It is not difficult to imagine a Justice Stevens Dickerson \n     majority, recounting the history of Miranda and Sec. 3501 and \n     then observing something like, ``Although we have often used \n     the term `prophylactic' to describe Miranda, over time it has \n     become interwoven into the basic fabric of our criminal law; \n     thus, today, we make explicit what had been implicit in our \n     prior decisions: Miranda is required by the U.S. \n     Constitution. Accordingly, Sec. 3501 is unconstitutional.''\n       That holding, in turn, would have undermined the foundation \n     for most if not all of the previous decisions limiting \n     Miranda, quietly threatening three decades of the Chief's \n     careful efforts to cabin in that decision appropriately. \n     Therefore, in my judgment, the Chief acted decisively to \n     avoid that consequence. He voted with the majority and \n     assigned the opinion to himself.\n       With that backdrop, the majority opinion in Dickerson is, \n     in many respects, amusing to read. Its holding can be \n     characterized as threefold: First, Miranda is NOT required by \n     the Constitution; it is merely prophylactic, and its \n     exceptions remain good law. Second, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3501 is \n     not good law. Third, do not ask why, and please, never, ever, \n     ever cite this opinion for any reason.\n       Although not what one would describe as the tightest of \n     logical syllogisms, it was the best that could be gotten from \n     the current members of the Court. A majority of Justices \n     agreed with each of the first two propositions, and so \n     therefore--even though the propositions are in significant \n     tension with each other--pursuant to Justice Brennan's famed \n     ``rule of five,'' the Court declared both, and nothing more.\n       That leadership, I would suggest, is a hallmark of a great \n     Chief Justice. The role of the Chief is unique, and Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist understood his colleagues well. \n     Consistently, he achieved the best legal outcome that could \n     be reached in a given case, in aid of moving inexorably in \n     the long term toward sound and principled jurisprudential \n     doctrine.\n       For those of us who had the privilege of clerking for the \n     Chief, we came to know a man of enormous intellect, \n     principle, humor, and modesty.\n       Blessed with an eidetic memory, he seemed to know all the \n     law that ever was. He would routinely amaze his clerks by \n     quizzing them on the exact citation to some case or other; \n     the clerks would, of course, never know the cite, and--off \n     the top of his head--the Chief always would. As his son James \n     observed at the Chief's funeral, he would have said that his \n     dad had forgotten more history than most of us will ever \n     know, but he didn't think his dad had ever forgotten \n     anything.\n       A Midwesterner, born of modest means, the Chief enlisted in \n     the Army in 1943 at age eighteen. Law has too long been a \n     profession of the privileged few, and it is fitting, and \n     worth noting, that the Chief Justice was an enlisted man, \n     serving as weather observer in North Africa.\n       Once a week, the Chief played tennis with his clerks. We \n     would play on a public court, and no one ever recognized the \n     older gentlemen playing doubles with three young lawyers. He \n     would also have us over to his house to play charades. One of \n     my favorite memories is his lying on his stomach on the \n     floor, pantomiming firing a rifle and mouthing ``pow, pow,'' \n     as he acted out All Quiet on the Western Front.\n       He enjoyed simple tastes--his favorite lunch was a \n     cheeseburger, a ``Miller's Lite,'' and a single cigarette--\n     and he had little patience for putting on airs. Once, when a \n     law clerk asked him how he went about choosing law clerks, \n     the Chief replied, ``Well, I obviously wasn't looking for the \n     best and the brightest, or I wouldn't have chosen you guys.'' \n     Himself a former law clerk, he had no grand illusions about \n     the job.\n       He was a kind and decent man. He knew everybody's name in \n     the Court, every police officer and every janitor, and he \n     treated them all with fairness and dignity. For that reason, \n     the respect he enjoyed from his colleagues was unparalleled.\n       The Chief was beloved by his family, by his colleagues, by \n     the thirty-four years' worth of law clerks whom he \n     befriended, taught, and mentored. His views did not always \n     prevail, but his steady hand at the helm--his vision, \n     leadership, and unwavering principles--made this in every \n     respect the Rehnquist Court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6804-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING SUSTAINABLE LUMBER CO.\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a true \nrole model in the Nevada community, Ms. Katherine Kelley. Ms. Kelley \nwas crowned both Miss Summerlin and Miss Nevada and recently competed \nin the Miss America competition. I am truly honored to congratulate her \non these great achievements.\n  The Miss America pageant began in 1921 and is one of the world's \nlargest scholarship providers to young women. The initiative focuses on \ncreating change in the lives of others and contributes a great amount \nof charity work in communities across the country. This characteristic \nof giving exemplifies Ms. Kelley's everyday life as a teacher in the \nLas Vegas community, working to help children excel academically.\n  Ms. Kelley, a Madisonville, KY, native, moved to Las Vegas in May of \n2014 and began working with Teach for America in hopes of helping with \nthe local teacher shortage. She is currently pursuing her master's \ndegree at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in the College of \nEducation, studying secondary math education. Along with pursuing her \nmaster's degree, she is also a geometry instructor at Mojave High \nSchool. Her initial passion for teaching began when she spent time \nvolunteering in the Alabama public school system. Her experience there \ndrove her in her aspirations to create positive change. Through Miss \nAmerica, Ms. Kelley has had the opportunity to bring light to the \nimportance of school attendance in low-income communities, as well as \nencourage students of both genders in their science, technology, \nengineering, and math studies. The scholarships that Ms. Kelley has \nearned through Miss America will allow her to finish her master's \ndegree debt free.\n  I know the citizens of the Silver State are proud to see a fellow \nNevadan succeed in pursuing her dreams. Today, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in congratulating Katherine Kelley on this incredible honor.

HUGHES COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas, UNLV, Hughes College of Engineering \nfor its incredible work in creating the Flexy-Hand 2 for 5-year-old \nHailey Dawson. Hailey was born with Poland syndrome, making it \nextremely difficult to grip smaller items. The Flexy-Hand 2, a 3D-\nprinted prosthetic device created by the UNLV engineering department, \nprovides Hailey with new technology that addresses this difficulty, \ngiving her the ability to participate in her favorite sport--baseball.\n  Hailey's mom, Yong Dawson, approached Brendan O'Toole, UNLV's chair \nof medical engineering, to ask if the department would be willing to \ncreate a prosthetic hand for her daughter. O'Toole was eager to take on \nthe project, gathering students from UNLV and local high schools to \nhelp. The team has spent nearly 2 years working on the project and \ncontinues perfecting the device, including the addition of individual \nfinger movement. Hailey's current Flexy-Hand 2 is the fourth version \nfrom the university. The technology fits her palm, connecting the \nfingers to her wrist, ultimately giving her control of her hand's \ngrasping motion.\n  Hailey has now had two unique opportunities to show off her \nprosthetic hand, both throwing out the first pitch at a UNLV baseball \ngame in March and at a Baltimore Orioles game in August. Hailey's \nmother contacted the Orioles in pursuit of making her child's dreams a \nreality, asking them for a meet-up. In response, the team invited \nHailey and her family to a game and allowed Hailey to throw the opening \npitch. Before hitting the field, Hailey had the opportunity to meet \nManny Machado and have her hand autographed.\n  I would like to congratulate Hailey on her participation in these \nunforgettable experiences and on an excellent first pitch. She is truly \na shining example of positivity within the Las Vegas community.\n  I would also like to recognize UNLV's Howard R. Hughes College of \nEngineering and Brendan O'Toole for their hard work and dedication to \nimproving the lives of others. This is an inspiring story and should \nstand as an example to the Nevada family. The team continues its work \nnot only by fine tuning the Flexy-Hand 2 but also by connecting with \nother universities to raise awareness about the technology. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me and all Nevadans in congratulating this \nincredible engineering department for its selfless work in helping a \nfellow Nevadan. I wish both the university and Hailey luck in all of \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6805-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6805-S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING DR. YUICHI SHODA, DR. WALTER MISCHEL, AND DR. PHILIP PEAKE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nGolden Goose Award, which recognizes researchers whose seemingly \nobscure, federally funded research has returned significant benefits to \nsociety.\n  In particular, I rise to celebrate 2015 Golden Goose Awardees Drs. \nWalter Mischel, Philip Peake, and Yuichi Shoda for the impact of their \nMarshmallow Test research. Their work--funded by the National \nInstitutes of Health and the National Science Foundation--has had a \nsignificant impact on how we understand human behavior, how we educate \nour children, and even how we save for retirement.\n  These researchers used a simple test to measure pre-schoolers' self-\ncontrol, offering children one marshmallow now or two if they could \nwait just 15 minutes alone with their prospective treat. They never \nexpected to find that how children performed on this simple, silly-\nsounding test would be related to the children's future SAT scores, \ntheir propensity for obesity or drug addiction, and even the very \nchemistry of their brains.\n  In their followup study, Dr. Yuichi Shoda, now a professor at the \nUniversity of Washington, found, based on reporting by parents and \nteachers, that children who had been able to wait longer for their \nextra treat at age 4 tended to show better adjustment in adolescence. \nThey had more social and academic competence, were more able to handle \nstress adeptly, and persisted better in goal pursuit in the face of \nfrustration. The researchers, joined by many collaborators across an \narray of disciplines, have followed these children now for more than 30 \nyears. They have documented correlations between the ability to delay \nand life outcomes as diverse as SAT scores, body-mass index, the \nfrequency of drug abuse, and measurable differences in brain \nfunctioning, which are visible thanks to modern functional MRI \ntechniques.\n  Today, Dr. Shoda is looking at how people can benefit from an \nawareness of the kinds of situations in which they excel at self-\ncontrol and those in which they are most vulnerable to self-control \nfailure.\n  Far from a story about fixed fates, their discoveries about the \nimportance of self-control and how it can be cultivated today informs \nhow we teach\n\n[[Page S6806]]\n\nour children and helps us recognize the potential that lies in all of \nus. They have helped usher in a new age of understanding of human \ndevelopment and behavior. Our lives are the better for it. I am proud \nto stand in recognition of their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6806-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING MELANIE MASSEY PHYSICAL THERAPY\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the folks who commit their lives to \nnursing people back to health provide tremendous benefit to their \ncommunities. Whether it is physical or speech therapy, providing \ncommunity members with hope during a difficult time is a noble act, and \none that is greatly appreciated, especially when those community \nmembers are children. This week's Small Business of the Week employs \nfolks who provide therapy sessions to adults and children alike. I \nwould like to recognize Melanie Massey Physical Therapy as Small \nBusiness of the Week for their commitment to providing exceptional \nhealth and therapy services to children in Monroe, West Monroe, Ruston, \nand Shreveport, LA.\n  Louisiana native Melanie Massey began her career as a physical \ntherapist upon graduating from Louisiana State University School of \nAllied Health Sciences in 1993. Shortly after graduation, Melanie began \nworking at LSU Medical Center in 1994, spending the majority of her \ntime tending to wound and burn victims. However, she soon realized \npediatric care was her passion. In 1995 with only 2 years of physical \ntherapy experience, Melanie opened her own practice. Under the motto \n``Joyfully use your gifts to brighten the lives of others,'' Melanie \nbegan spending one-on-one time with her young patients, developing \nunique relationships with her clients and building a strong reputation \nattractive to patients and parents seeking top-notch therapy centers \nfor their children. As her clientele grew, so did her staff. Melanie \nhas hired over 20 therapists and opened three more centers across north \nLouisiana within a few years of opening her business. Pediatric \npatients enjoy a multitude of events hosted by Melanie's clinics, such \nas boy's and girl's movie night and a summer camp that specializes in \nteaching handwriting, friendship building, and sensory integration. \nToday, the Melanie Massey Therapy team consists of full-time physical \ntherapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists, as well as \na full billing department that allows patients to receive the necessary \ncare upon arrival worry free.\n  Melanie Massey Physical Therapy maintains a hopeful spirit and high-\nenergy staff that continuously motivates their patients in reaching \ntheir recovery goals. Furthermore, Melanie encourages her staff to \ncontinue their education while employed in her physical therapy \ncenters, ensuring her staff can be among the most highly trained \ntherapists in north Louisiana.\n  The ability to help her patients overcome some of the most \nchallenging hurdles in their young lives serves as an inspiration to \nall entrepreneurs who devote themselves to the well-being of their \ncustomers. Congratulations to Melanie Massey Physical Therapy and her \nteam for being recognized as this week's Small Business of the \nWeek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6806-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRATULATING DENNIS AND RUTH DITCH\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to offer my congratulations to \nDennis and Ruth Ditch as they celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary \non September 25.

They are also the parents of three \ndaughters, Lori, Lynn, and Barbara, and have two grandchildren, Lana \nand Ginger.\n  Dennis and Ruth Ditch both grew up in western New York, and their \nfive decades together demonstrate the best qualities of a married \ncouple. They have supported one another in raising four children, moved \ncross country twice for work opportunities prior to settling in \nBloomfield, NY, and spent 25 years operating a small business they \nstarted together. Their commitment to one another never wavered even \nduring the trying period when Ruth underwent chemotherapy to overcome \nan aggressive form of lymphoma. In recent years, they have become \nleaders for Gideons International in their area.\n  As successful parents, entrepreneurs, and active members of their \ncommunity, Dennis and Ruth Ditch exemplify the values that make America \ngreat, whether in my home State of Wyoming or in New York. I give them \nmy best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6806-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING HARRY McGRATH\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Harry \nP. McGrath, Sr., a Pennsylvanian and a close friend. Harry passed away \nunexpectedly on September 7, 2015.\n  Harry devoted his life to his family and to public service and \nadvocacy. Following his graduation from Dunmore High School, where he \nwas an outstanding student and athlete, and Kutztown University, he \nworked as a Special Agent in the U.S. Secret Service. During the 1980s \nhe protected President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H.W. \nBush, earning commendations for his work in Grenada and the Khyber \nPass. By the time he left the Secret Service to attend law school, he \nhad earned special achievement and performance awards for his \nsignificant contributions to the agency's efficient operation.\n  After graduating cum laude from the Widener University School of Law, \nwhere he was a member of the Law Review, Harry continued his work in \npublic service as a law clerk for Judge William J. Nealon in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He went on to \nbecome a distinguished lawyer in Northeastern Pennsylvania, admitted to \npractice law by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals, and the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania. He was a partner in the law firm of O'Malley, Harris, \nDurkin, and Perry PC and the founder of the McGrath Law Offices in \nScranton. With his legal expertise, significant experience and sound \njudgement, Harry was an ideal person to serve as the chairman of my \nJudicial Selection for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n  In addition to his work as a lawyer, Harry was also a strong advocate \nfor Pennsylvania's children, as the solicitor for more than 30 years \nfor the Scranton School District, representing students, parents, \nteachers, and administrators in matters of education and employment. He \nwas passionate about his work on behalf of children with learning \ndisabilities and other school-aged children in need. He was an early \nand strong supporter of the new Scranton High School Project and a past \nmember of the Board of Directors of the Friendship House, an \norganization that provides quality programs and services designated to \nenhance the well-being of children and families in his community.\n  As much as public service and advocacy defined his career, politics \nwas in Harry's blood. Named after his grandfather, the late Harry P. \nO'Neill, a U.S. Representative in the 1950s, Harry McGrath worked hard \nto elect candidates to public office, candidates in whom he believed. \nHe served as Lackawanna County Democratic Party chairman and \nvolunteered his time, talent, and energy to countless campaigns \nthroughout his life.\n  Despite his numerous accomplishment, the most important legacy Harry \nleaves behind is his family. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife \nof 33 years, Joell; their four children, Harry, Bob, Betsey, and Joe; \nhis brothers and sisters; all of his nieces and nephews; and his many \nfriends. I pray that God will give them strength and that Harry's life \nof family, faith, and service will continue to inspire them in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6806-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6806-S6807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 23) to \nreauthorize the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, and for \nother purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 230.

A bill to improve, sustain, and transform the United States \nPostal Service; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, one of the factors in creating a favorable \nenvironment for job creation and job preservation is, of all things, \nsomething that has been around for 200 years to 225 years, and that is \nthe U.S. Postal Service. Not many people think of the Postal Service as \npart of the engine that helps drive our economy, but it is.\n  There are 7 to 8 million jobs that flow directly from work directly \ninvolved or indirectly involved with the Postal Service--7 to 8 million \njobs. For a number of years, the Postal Service has been losing money. \nThere are a lot of questions about whether they will be able to make \nit, whether they will be able to survive, whether they are going to \ncontribute or simply fold up and go away.\n  So I would note that another priority of mine for years has been \npostal reform. My dance partner on this for a number of years was \nSenator Susan Collins, a Republican and a very capable leader, and for \nthe last several years Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma--Dr. \nCoburn--who retired at the end of last year. We have worked with a lot \nof folks--Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate--in the \nlast couple of years to try to find a way not just to make the Postal \nService relevant but to enable them to be successful. And one of our \nreal challenges has been how to take a 200-plus-year-old network--a \nlegacy delivery network that goes to every mailbox in this country, \nbusiness or residential--and enable them to make money in a digital age \nin the 21st century.\n  A lot of us are buying stuff differently than we used to. We are \npaying our bills differently than we used to. We don't send a whole lot \nof first-class mail the way we used to.\n  When I was a naval flight officer in Southeast Asia for three tours, \nthe best day of the week was when the mail came. We would get all kinds \nof letters from home. We would get all kinds of postcards, birthday \ncards--you name it--Father's Day cards, and Valentine's Day cards. We \nwould get magazines, and we would get newspapers. It was the best day \nof the week. Today, our folks in the Armed Forces are deployed to \nAfghanistan or other places around the world, and they still get mail, \nbut it is not as important for them as it was for us because they have \nSkype, they have cell phones, and they have the Internet. They have \nother ways to communicate.\n  The challenge for the Postal Service has been, in a day and age where \nwe communicate very differently than we did during the last war--than \nwe do, say, in the war we have been involved in in Afghanistan for some \ntime now--how do they make money? How do they remain relevant? They are \nstarting to\n\n[[Page S6812]]\n\nget it. The Postal Service today--I think it was at 3 a.m. this \nmorning--the Postal Service, in 33 ZIP Codes in San Francisco, \ndelivered groceries. They use vehicles that otherwise would have been \nused between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. The folks who work for the Postal \nService have access to apartments and high rises to actually deliver \ngroceries. And I think they are delivering for Amazon in those 33 ZIP \ncodes. I think they have been trying it out for a while, and things are \ngoing pretty well. The Postal Service has turned around and has \ncontacted 100 other grocery chains around the country. They said: This \nis what we are doing for Amazon, and we could probably do this for you \nand help you and help serve customers in a different kind of way.\n  This morning, in a place in Delaware, just around Middletown, DE, \nwhich is north of Dover, the Postal Service, literally during the \nmiddle of the night--or rather Amazon with the Postal Service in the \nmiddle of the night combined to take items from that Amazon \ndistribution center in Middletown, DE, and literally drop off, all over \nthe Northeast, the mid-Atlantic--all over the region--drop off items \nthat are going to be delivered today. These are all kinds of products \nthat were ordered through Amazon yesterday on the Internet, by phone, \nand so forth, and they are being delivered literally today. The Postal \nService has a big hand in that.\n  Also, we have FedEx and UPS. A lot of folks think of FedEx and UPS as \ncompetitors of the Postal Service, and in a way they are, but they are \nalso very good partners together. It works this way. FedEx doesn't want \nto deliver to every mailbox in the country, especially in the more \nrural areas where there is a lot of separation and, frankly, it is \ncostly to do that. FedEx doesn't want to do it, and UPS doesn't want to \ndo it. But guess who goes every day--6 days a week, sometimes 7--to \npretty much every mailbox in the country? It is 6 days a week. Well, it \nis the Postal Service. So there has been a partnership for a number of \nyears now where the Postal Service delivers for UPS and for FedEx the \nlast mile, the last 2 miles, the last 5 miles, 10 miles, the last 20 \nmiles. The Postal Service makes some money doing that, and it helps \nFedEx and UPS maybe save some money. And when the Postal Service sends \nits packages by air mail, it actually will partner with FedEx or UPS in \norder to be able to move its products around the country in an \nexpeditious way.\n  So those are some things that are happening around the country that \nmost people aren't thinking about or mindful about, some ways the \nPostal Service is becoming more involved in the digital age.\n  Christmas is still 3 months or so away, but as people start thinking \nabout Christmas shopping, holiday shopping, in a lot of cases they are \ngoing to get on the phone and get on the Internet and order. Those \npackages they are ordering are going to have to be delivered by \nsomebody, and the Postal Service is one of those somebodies.\n  I think the last time we saw the numbers--while first-class mail \ncontinues to trend down by a couple of percent per year, what is going \nup--I think the last time we saw 12 to 14 percent a year--is delivery \npackages and parcels. So the Postal Service is finding out how to be \nrelevant even in the digital age in ways they haven't thought about \nbefore.\n  There are other things they could do. Among those things is they \ncould deliver wine and beer. UPS does that, and FedEx does that. The \npostal service does that in Australia. I think they make maybe $5 \nbillion a year doing that. I would like to say Australia doesn't have \nas many people as we do; they just drink more. But there is lots of \nmoney to be made by the Postal Service here, and I don't know of any \nreason why we shouldn't allow them to be involved in that business as \nwell, with appropriate safeguards and as long as States approve of that \nactivity.\n  Those are some things I would mention about the Postal Service.\n  The other thing I would say is that over the past couple of years, \neven though we found it difficult to pass legislation, one of the \nthings the Postal Service has done on their own is they have tried to \nrightsize the enterprise to reflect the delivery--less--of first-class \nmail and the delivery of a little bit lower amounts of what we call \nstandard mail, which could be nonprofits using the mail, it could be \nfor-profits, it could be all kinds of stuff, but it is not first-class \nmail.\n  But one of the things the Postal Service has sought to do is to look \nat their workforce and say: In a day and age when we have to deliver a \nlot less mail, do we still need the same number of full-time employees?\n  They decided the answer is no, and I think their full-time \nequivalents are I would say down by a third from where it was about a \ndecade ago.\n  The number of mail-processing centers across the country is down by \nabout half, from maybe 600 to 300.\n  The number of post offices really hasn't changed a whole lot. They \nhave over 30,000, maybe closer to 40,000 post offices around the \ncountry, some active, large, vibrant, and some small, rural, not a lot \nof activity, but important to those communities.\n  What the Postal Service has done with a number of their smaller post \noffices is basically they have said to the communities: You know, there \nis not a lot going on in your post offices. Are the amount of stamps \nand revenues generated by post offices really enough to make it \nworthwhile to run this post office 6 days a week, 8 to 10 hours a day?\n  What they have done is they have sort of presented a menu--the Postal \nService has presented a menu to communities and said: You can't have a \n6-day-a-week, 8- to 10-hour-a-day post office in your community, but \nyou can have a post office if you want, maybe 4 hours a day, 6 hours a \nday.\n  The person running it would be maybe a contract employee, maybe not a \nfull-time employee with full benefits but someone maybe making $15 an \nhour. For some people, that is pretty good money. And then the \ncommunities would still end up with their post offices. Or maybe the \npost office should be a rural letter carrier driving around on his or \nher route in the rural part of a county or a State. It would literally \nbe a post office on wheels, a little bit like a bookmobile was when I \nwas a kid growing up. Everybody on that route would know that rural \nletter carrier was going to be here or there throughout the day and be \nthere to take packages or to provide stamps or to send mail or to \nprovide services that you would normally get in a post office in a more \nurban, suburban area.\n  But long story short, the Postal Service has done a fair amount to \nreduce--I am tempted to call it--the size of their enterprise and the \ncost of their enterprise. There are fewer full-time-equivalent \nemployees, fewer mail-processing centers. And while they still have a \nlot of post offices, a number of them--maybe one out of every five or \nso, one out of every four--is a post office that may be open 2 hours a \nday, 4 hours a day, 6 hours a day instead of 8 hours a day or 10 hours \na day.\n  Today I am introducing legislation that seeks to enable the Postal \nService, which is still--actually, if you didn't consider one factor, \nwhich is that the Postal Service is required by law to put money aside \nto meet a liability that most private companies and almost every State \nand local government and the Federal Government, too, have not \naddressed, and that is the health care liability of their pensioners.\n  Back in the late 1990s when I was Governor of Delaware--we had worked \nfor years--Governor Pete DuPont, Governor Mike Castle, and my \nadministration--to move from the State with the worst credit rating in \nAmerica to a State with an AAA credit rating. In my next to last year \nas Governor, 1999, Delaware--in 1977 we had the worst credit rating in \nthe country, and in 1999 we earned AAA credit ratings across the \nboard--Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch. It was a day of great \njubilation. But even after they awarded us our AAA credit ratings, they \nsaid to us: You have a problem, Delaware. And as it turned out, so did \n49 other States. That is because while we had a fully funded pension \nfund, we had not set aside any money for a significant cost of the \npensioners, and that is their health care costs once they reached the \nage of 65. And most employers in the country, those employers of any \nconsequence, when their retirees reach the age of 65, and DuPont \ncompany is a great example--my\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\nwife had a wonderful 27-year career with them, but when DuPont's \nretirees reach the age of 65, the DuPont company doesn't say: To heck \nwith you. We are going to forget you.\n\n  They still try to meet their moral obligation to provide their \nemployees a pension and access to health care. Part of that is \nMedicare. DuPont, and frankly almost any company of any consequence, \nsays to their employees reaching the age of 65: Alright, you are 65, \nyou are eligible for Medicare Part A, Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D, \nand we expect retirees 65 or older to use it--to sign up and use it. It \nis a requirement. And if that doesn't cover all their medical needs--\nand it probably will not--a lot of companies will continue to provide a \nwraparound supplemental program to fill in the holes that are left \nunfilled by Medicare Part A, Part B, and Part D.\n  Well, as it turns out, postal retirees, when they reach the age of 65 \nand are eligible for Medicare, most of them sign up for Medicare Part \nA, a majority sign up for Medicare Part B--one of those is hospital \ncare and the other inpatient and the other outpatient doctor care--but \nalmost none of them sign up for Medicare Part D, as in ``delta.'' Part \nD is a drug program for Medicare that has been around for close to 13, \n14 years now. It has been a huge success--a huge success.\n  But while the postal service pays into Medicare, I think more than \nmaybe any other employer in the country--they pay more money, I think, \nthan any other employer in the country. I think the postal service is \ntheir No. 1 or No. 2 business in terms of full-time employees. And \nwhile they pay a ton of money into Medicare, they do not get full \nvalue. In fact, in effect, the postal service is actually overpaying to \nbring down the Medicare costs for other employers, including FedEx and \nUPS and DuPont, for that matter.\n  So the question is: Is that right? Is that fair? Is that equitable to \nthe postal service? Is it fair to their employees and their pension? I \ndon't think so, and neither did Dr. Coburn in the last Congress when we \noffered legislation that said this should be fixed. The postal service \nought to be treated like other companies. They ought to be able to get \nfull value for the contributions they make into Medicare.\n  That is something that should be part of postal reform legislation. \nIt is part of the legislation I am introducing today, and it was part \nof the legislation we introduced a year ago.\n  Another important part of the legislation we are introducing today \ndeals with the rates the postal service can charge. There was something \nafter the last recession called an exigent rate case. The postal \nservice's businesses were badly damaged. A lot of businesses that used \nfirst-class mail fled first-class mail and found a way to use the \nInternet and to replace the use of first-class mail, which had a \nseverely damaging impact on the postal service. The postal service \nasked for an exigent rate case, which gave them an opportunity or a way \nto raise their rates a bit. The question is, Is that going to be \nforever or is it going to go away?\n  We have been negotiating, with the help of a guy named John Kane, a \nmember of our staff on the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, an agreement with the postal service and with \nsome mailers and others that are interested in these issues to enable \nthe exigent rate case to stay in place for a couple more years, and \nthen we will go through a new process or an existing process to \nestablish a new postal rate for the postal service to charge. But this \nprovides some stability over the next couple of years.\n  I will not go through the whole bill, but let me just say that the \nidea behind our legislation is to enable the postal service to have \nreasonable revenues to be successful, to enable them to be treated \nfairly and I think equitably with respect to their payments into \nMedicare for their retirees, to also enable them to be more creative, \nand to find ways to use that 200-plus-year-old distribution network in \norder to make money--in order to make money.\n  There are lots of other ideas as well, with the kind of stuff that \nhappened this morning in those 33 zip codes in San Francisco and the \nkind of work that will happen tonight at the Amazon distribution center \nin Middletown, DE, and a lot of other places on this side of the United \nStates.\n  This is legislation I am introducing on my own. We have worked with \nstakeholders, which includes certainly the postal service, certainly \nincludes a lot of the customers--not every one of their customers--and \nincludes the employee groups--the unions, the groups that represent \npostmasters--and other people as well--regular customers, residential \ncustomers, business customers. So we are introducing legislation, and \nmy hope is that it will serve as a catalyst for a good conversation and \na much needed consensus to say this is where we are headed on postal \nreform in 2015 and beyond.\n  I have never introduced a perfect bill, and I am not introducing \nprobably a perfect bill now. But I think it is a pretty piece of \nlegislation. We have listened to a lot of folks, and we have listened \nto a lot of folks who serve here with us in the Senate--Democrats, \nRepublicans, folks on the committee and off the committee--and it is my \nhope we will have a chance to kick the tires on this new piece of \nlegislation I have introduced and somewhere fairly soon be able to have \na hearing so folks can come and say: This is what I like about it or \ndon't like about the legislation, and they will decide ways to make it \neven better.\n  I like to say that everything I do I know I can do better. But as it \nsays in the Constitution, ``in order to form a more perfect union''--in \nthe preamble of the Constitution, ``in order to form a more perfect \nunion''--our goal will be to form a more perfect postal service and \nhopefully form a more perfect piece of legislation. The real goal is to \nenable the postal service to be more successful--to enable them, and \nnot be running them down all the time.\n  We have great people who work for the postal service. They deliver \nmail in my neighborhood and probably yours as well. There are folks who \nare going to work right now in the postal service. They will be up late \ntonight sorting mail and making sure it will be ready to be delivered \ntomorrow. We have people who will be working tomorrow and Saturday \ndelivering the mail. We will have folks delivering some mail, priority \nmail, some of it on Sunday. The postal service is not just a 6-day \noperation today. They deliver a lot of packages and parcels now on \nSunday.\n  Our legislation is designed to enable those folks to be more \ninnovative, to unleash the innovative spirit within the postal service, \nand to bring ideas in from a lot of other folks to help the postal \nservice in that regard.\n  I think that pretty well covers my talking points. Mr. President, I \nask that, after you have had a chance to get a good rest this weekend, \nto maybe take a look. I will come and visit you, maybe tell you what we \nare doing here, and see if you would like to join us somewhere down the \nroad as a cosponsor or at least be a constructive critic. Either role \nwould be very welcome.\n  Today I am introducing the Improving Postal Operations, Service and \nTransparency Act of 2015, known as the iPOST Act. As my colleagues here \nin the Senate know, the way we communicate as a society has changed \ndramatically over the past 20 years. Instead of sending a letter to \nloved ones overseas, we send a Facebook message or Skype. Instead of \nsending our bills every month, we go online and enter our billing \ninformation. Instead of flipping through a catalogue, we visit the \nretail store's website. But while the way we communicate and conduct \nbusiness has changed, we still require a vibrant, financially sound, \nand sustainable postal system. The United States Postal Service \ncontinues to be a critical enabler of communications and commerce that \nmaintains a unique delivery network that connects every community, \ntown, and city in this country and with posts around the world.\n  The Postal Service is a more than 200 year-old institution that today \nserves as the linchpin of a $1 trillion dollar mailing industry \nemploying more than 8.4 million people. It is the nexus between \nconsumers and businesses as diverse as Hallmark, Amazon, small town \nnewspapers, and mail-order pharmacies. Over the years, the Postal \nService has been a resilient institution that has consistently adjusted \nwith the times and adapting when necessary to remain a vital part of \nour Nation's economic infrastructure and really our everyday lives. \nMany would agree that,\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\nthough much has changed in our country and our economy since the \nformation of the Postal Service, the need for an efficient and secure \ntransfer of communications and goods has not. Nevertheless, the growing \ntrend toward digital communication, the Postal Service's significant \nlong-term financial liabilities, and the continued decline of First \nClass mail volume are threatening the future viability of this federal \nestablishment enshrined in the Constitution. Thus, it is incumbent upon \nCongress to give the Postal Service the tools necessary to address its \ngrowing costs and modernize so it can remain relevant for generations \nto come.\n  Two American industries that have also undergone major disruption in \nthe past and survived to live another day offer parallels to the Postal \nService's current predicament. The U.S. freight rail industry faced \ndisruption from the trucking industry and had significant overcapacity \nbeginning in the 1950s. Three interrelated components helped the \nfreight rail industry recover: a focus on improving productivity, \ncontaining costs, and generating revenue. Likewise, the U.S. auto \nindustry has faced similar challenges: overcapacity, too many \nsuppliers, and a declining market share. The freight rail and auto \nindustries both have come roaring back to life and profitability. But \nit's important to note that they did so in part thanks to helpful \nlegislative reform.\n  While containing costs, generating revenue, and improving \nproductivity are certainly part of the postal reform equation and \nsomething postal management must continue to focus on, we must do our \npart to bring badly needed structural reforms to the Postal Service's \nbusiness model and ensure long-term stability in the years to come.\n  Originally, the Postal Service was a federal department that required \nannual appropriations from Congress. In 1971, Congress passed \nlegislation to make the Postal Service an ``independent establishment \nof the executive branch,'' designed to run as a self-sustaining entity \nthat would cover its operating costs with revenues produced through \nsales, including postage and related products and services. Hence, the \nmodern version of the Postal Service was born.\n  As time passed, Postal Service reforms became necessary to create \nstability in the agency and to ensure that the American taxpayer and \nthe business community would continue to benefit from its products and \nservices. In an effort to address these needs, Congress enacted the \nPostal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006, PAEA. When PAEA was \nsigned into law a decade ago, First-Class Mail volume was peaking at \n213 billion pieces, the postal workforce was composed of almost 700,000 \ncareer employees and the e-commerce market was in its infancy with a \nvalue of just over $100 billion annually.\n  Unfortunately, passage of the PAEA came at the cusp of immense change \nin the mailing industry, and also our economy as a whole. The \nsignificant advancement in digital communication that continued through \nthe recession, the steady decline in First-Class Mail and Standard Mail \nvolume, and the rising costs associated with longstanding healthcare \nand retirement obligations created a tumultuous relationship between \nPostal Service revenues and costs.\n  In the decade since passage of PAEA, total Postal Service mail volume \nhas fallen some 27 percent to 155 billion pieces, the career workforce \nis 30 percent smaller and the booming domestic e-commerce market is now \nvalued at more than $300 billion. The effects of the Great Recession in \n2008 had a tremendous impact on the mailing industry, and by extension \nthe Postal Service's bottom line. To combat these effects, the Postal \nRegulatory Commission approved a temporary emergency rate increase, \nwhich has been the primary reason for the Postal Service's positive \noperating income over the past 2 years.\n  I have worked on postal issues with various colleagues for a large \npart of my time in the United States Senate. Further, I have been \nworking on postal reform diligently since 2010 when it became apparent \nthat the future of the Postal Service was in jeopardy. Last Congress, \nformer Senator Tom Coburn and I introduced a package that we felt moved \nthe Postal Service forward and solved the long term problems that \nplague it. Unfortunately, that bill did not pass and in January the \nPostal Service was forced to change its delivery standards. Since then, \nservice has noticeably declined.\n  I have worked diligently with my colleagues and a wide range of \npostal stakeholders including postal consumers, the mailing industry, \npostal labor unions, and Postal Service leadership for the last eight \nmonths on a compromise proposal. The legislation I have introduced is a \nstarting point in making sure the Postal Service remains relevant in \nthe digital age by achieving financial viability and better meeting our \ncommunication and commerce needs. I will continue to work with all \ninterested parties, my colleagues in the Senate and the House, \nincluding Chairman Ron Johnson of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and the Administration to build on, \nperfect, and revise this legislation going forward. I am confident that \nthe Postal Service can turn this corner and remain relevant in the \ndecades to come, but it is going to take collaboration, communication, \nand compromise from all stakeholders and Congress to make that happen.\n  The Improving Postal Operations, Service and Transparency Act, iPOST \nAct, will set the path to make solvency possible and fix the Postal \nService's financial and other challenges for the long-term. In \nparticular iPOST Act would ensure that our federal pension systems \nrecognize the differences between the postal and non-postal federal \nworkforce to prevent the Postal Service from paying more than it owes \ninto the federal retirement systems, as has happened in the past.\n  The iPOST Act would restructure the way the Postal Service funds its \nremaining liability for retiree healthcare by scrapping the existing, \nunaffordable payment schedule and replacing it with a system with \nrealistic payment goals that would allow the Postal Service to invest \nover the next 10 years in a more lucrative TSP-like account. Combined, \nthese provisions would help the Postal Service and taxpayers by paying \ndown the Postal Service's long-term retiree health obligations sooner.\n  The iPOST Act would create a Postal Service Health Benefits Program, \nPSHBP, within the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, FEHBP, and \nrequire that all Medicare-eligible postal annuitants and employees \nenroll in Medicare parts A, B, and D. This would ensure better \ncoordination between PSHBP and Medicare than we see with FEHBP and \nMedicare today and allow the Postal Service to reap the full benefit of \nthe resources it and its employees pay into Medicare.\n  The iPOSTAct would require an independent analysis of the recent \nnetwork changes put into place by the Postal Service and how service \ncan be improved, particularly in rural areas. The bill further proposes \na pause in the Postal Service's network optimization efforts for 2 \nyears for plants and 5 years for post offices to ensure a stabilization \nof service for all postal customers.\n  The iPOST Act would provide customers big and small with better \ntransparency into how the Postal Service performs for them regardless \nof whether they live in a large city, a suburban development, or a \nremote rural area.\n  The iPOST Act would makes the current temporary emergency rate \nincrease permanent while freezing any further rate increases until a \nnew rate system can be established by the Postal Regulatory Commission \nby January 1, 2018.\n  The iPOST Act would allow the Postal Service, based on meeting \ncertain conditions, to introduce new non-postal products and services, \nship beer, wine and distilled spirits, and partner with State and local \ngovernments in providing government services.\n  In introducing this bill, I invite all interested stakeholders from \naround the country, whether they happen to be residents of rural, \nurban, or suburban communities, businesses that use the mail broadly or \nindividual customers of the Postal Service, to come to the table and \nwork with Congress on a viable path forward. I encourage the mailing \nindustry, the postal unions, and Postal Service management to continue \nto discuss reform measures and to view this bill as a possible path \nforward to consensus. To my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I \nlook forward to working with you to make\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\nwhat I think is a good bill even better. Again, introduction is the \nfirst step in this process. I am committed to working together to find \nconsensus on this legislation and fix the serious, but solvable \nchallenges facing the Postal Service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 2059. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income amounts received on account of claims based on \ncertain unlawful discrimination and to allow income averaging for \nbackpay and frontpay awards received on account of such claims, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Civil Justice Tax \nFairness Act of 2015. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague \nfrom Maryland, Senator Cardin, in introducing this bipartisan bill.\n  This bill would change the taxation of awards received by individuals \nthat result from judgments in or settlements of employment \ndiscrimination and civil rights cases, and would apply to victims in \ncases including racial discrimination, sexual discrimination, and \nwhistleblower discrimination. These changes would correct an inequity \nin current law and are designed to promote the fair and equitable \nsettlement of such claims.\n  In 2003, I introduced the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act. In 2004, \nCongress adopted the most important part of that bill, allowing \nsuccessful plaintiffs in civil rights actions to deduct the portion of \ntheir awards covering attorneys' fees from their annual incomes. This \nprovision eliminated the double-taxation of such fees, which are still \ntaxable income to the attorney. Two important provisions from my 2003 \nbill, which I will describe in a moment, have yet to be addressed, and \nthe bill we introduce today would enact them.\n  The primary purpose of the bill we are introducing today is to remedy \nan unintended consequence of a 1996 law, which made damage awards that \nare not based on ``physical injuries or physical sickness'' part of a \nplaintiff's taxable income. Because most acts of employment \ndiscrimination and civil rights violations do not cause physical \ninjuries, this provision has had a direct and negative impact on \nplaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been subjected to \nintentional employment discrimination or other intentional violations \nof their civil rights.\n  Our bill would remedy the unfair method of taxation of civil rights \nvictims' settlements and court awards with respect to ``frontpay'' and \n``backpay,'' and with respect to the taxation of noneconomic damages. \nBy way of background, I should explain that awards of compensation \nattributable to the difference between what the employee was paid and \nthe amount he or she should have been paid are known as ``backpay.'' \n``Frontpay'' represents the future wages and benefits that would have \nbeen paid had the former employee not been terminated or had the \nemployee not been forced to resign.\n  Our bill contains two important reforms: First, award amounts for \nfrontpay or backpay would continue to be included as taxable income, \nbut would be eligible for income averaging according to the time period \ncovered by the award. This correction would allow individuals to pay \ntaxes at the same marginal rates that would have applied to them had \nthey not suffered discrimination. Income averaging more fairly takes \ninto account the person's financial standing apart from the lump sum of \nthe award.\n  Second, the bill would also allow plaintiffs to exclude non-economic \ndamages, amounts awarded for pain, suffering or other health effects, \nfrom their income, to treat employment and civil rights claims the same \nas claims that involve a physical injury.\n  The Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act would encourage the fair \nsettlement of employment discrimination claims. Our legislation would \nallow both plaintiffs and defendants to settle claims based on the \ndamages suffered, not on the excessive taxes that are now levied--\ntaxation that adds insult to a civil rights victim's injury and serves \nas a barrier to the just settlement of civil rights claims.\n  I invite my colleagues to join Senator Cardin and me in support of \nthis bipartisan, common sense legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Employment Lawyers\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                               September 16, 2015.\n     Re: Introduction of the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Employment \n     Lawyers Association (NELA) we commend and thank you for your \n     leadership in introducing the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act \n     of 2015 (CJTFA). Your interest in this bill demonstrates the \n     kind of vision that is increasingly rare--the vision that it \n     is possible to find solutions to pressing problems that are \n     beneficial to both America's workers and employers.\n       Founded in 1985, NELA is the largest professional \n     membership organization in the country comprised of lawyers \n     who represent employees in labor, employment, and civil \n     rights disputes. NELA advances employee rights and serves \n     lawyers who advocate for equality and justice in the American \n     workplace. With 69 circuit, state, and local affiliates, NELA \n     has a membership of over 4,000 attorneys working on behalf of \n     those who have faced illegal treatment in the workplace. \n     There has been unanimity among our members for nearly 20 \n     years that passage of the Civil Justice Tax Fairness Act is a \n     top legislative priority.\n       The CJTFA has significant ramifications for people who have \n     been harmed by illegal treatment in their workplace. No one \n     starts a new job with any thought that they will find \n     themselves in a subsequent legal dispute with their employer, \n     yet this is unfortunately a reality for America's workers. \n     The CJTFA, which has been known as the Civil Rights Tax \n     Fairness Act and the Civil Rights Tax Relief Act in prior \n     Congresses, is a ``win-win'' for both employees and business. \n     Previous versions of the CJTFA garnered widespread support by \n     a broad-based coalition of business, civil rights, and legal \n     organizations such as the U.S Chamber of Commerce (USCC), the \n     Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR), and the \n     American Bar Association (ABA). At present, we have the \n     support of the ABA and we know that many other organizations \n     will be joining us in the near future.\n       The CJTFA will correct current inequities in tax treatment \n     of settlements and awards received by individuals in \n     employment and civil rights cases. Under current law, those \n     who suffer noneconomic damages as a result of unfair \n     employment practices pay taxes; those who suffer noneconomic \n     damages as a result of physical injuries (such as from car \n     accidents) do not. The CJTFA will correct this unfairness by \n     excluding from gross income non-economic damages received in \n     civil rights and employment cases.\n       Similarly, employees who have not lost wages pay taxes at \n     the rates applicable to the actual wages they earned in each \n     year. But if they receive back or front pay in a settlement \n     or award, they must pay taxes on lump sum recoveries that \n     represent multiple years of such pay--a patently unfair \n     practice. The CJTFA will correct this unfairness by taxing \n     lump sum recoveries as if they were received in the year \n     earned and by providing an exemption from the alternative \n     minimum tax (AMT) for any resulting tax benefit.\n       By making settlements less expensive and easier to achieve, \n     the CJTFA will reduce the number of employment and civil \n     rights cases that go to trial, freeing up valuable court \n     resources for other matters. The CJTFA not only benefits the \n     parties to employment disputes, but also America's taxpayers \n     who must bear the costs associated with a less efficient \n     judicial system.\n       On behalf of our 69 affiliates, 4,000 members, and the \n     hundreds of thousands of employees they represent, we are \n     extremely pleased that you are championing this important \n     bipartisan, bicameral legislation. We look forward to working \n     closely with you and your staff to gain passage of the CJTFA \n     in the 114th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Terisa E. Chaw,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6815-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6815-S6816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 257--CONGRATULATING CAPTAIN KRISTEN GRIEST AND FIRST \n     LIEUTENANT SHAYE HAVER ON THEIR GRADUATION FROM RANGER SCHOOL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Ayotte, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mrs. Capito, Mrs. Ernst, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Fischer, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Ms. Heitkamp, Ms. Hirono, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. Murkowski, \nMrs. Murray, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Warren, Mr. Perdue, Mr. \nMurphy, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Tester, Mr. Flake, Mr. Reed, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Isakson, Mr.\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nWarner, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Franken, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Heinrich, \nMs. Klobuchar, Mr. Coons, Mr. Thune, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Gardner) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Armed Services:\n\n                              S. Res. 257\n\n       Whereas United States Army Rangers ``Lead the Way!'' and \n     have played a decisive role in military engagements since \n     before the Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas Ranger School prepares members of the Armed Forces \n     to serve as leaders and members of elite combat forces tasked \n     with dismounted infantry, airborne, airmobile, amphibious, \n     and independent squad and platoon-size operations;\n       Whereas Ranger School is one of the toughest training \n     courses for which a member can volunteer, with three phases \n     testing a member's ability to patrol, navigate, mountaineer, \n     and execute combat arms functional skills;\n       Whereas students in Ranger School train to exhaustion, \n     pushing the limits of their minds and bodies;\n       Whereas although many members apply to Ranger School, fewer \n     than 45 percent, on average, possess the mental and physical \n     toughness required to earn the highly coveted Ranger tab \n     signifying graduation from the School;\n       Whereas Captain Kristen Griest and First Lieutenant Shaye \n     Haver braved the rigors of Ranger School, becoming the first \n     women to successfully earn the Ranger tab;\n       Whereas they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their fellow \n     members, carrying their own weight and, at times, the weight \n     of others;\n       Whereas their personal courage, sacrifices, and \n     extraordinary leadership skills establish them as role models \n     for women and men alike, proving that skill, not gender, \n     determines military aptitude and success; and\n       Whereas, as graduates of the United States Military \n     Academy, they exemplify the time-honored creed of ``Duty, \n     Honor, Country'', and will continue to shape the future of \n     our military and the Rangers in the years to come: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and recognizes the patriotism and historic \n     contributions to the United States by Captain Kristen Griest \n     and First Lieutenant Shaye Haver;\n       (2) commends their character, courage, and tenacity as the \n     first women to earn the Ranger tab signifying graduation from \n     Ranger School;\n       (3) recognizes that our military and our country are more \n     battle ready as a result of their accomplishments;\n       (4) celebrates their service as they continue to ``Lead the \n     Way!'' as our nation's newest United States Army Rangers; and\n       (5) congratulates them for their inspiring and \n     groundbreaking accomplishments.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to honor and congratulate CPT \nKristen Griest and 1LT Shaye Haver for their historic accomplishment of \nbeing the first two women soldiers to complete U.S. Army Ranger School \nand earn their highly coveted Ranger tabs.\n  Earning the right to wear a Ranger tab is not for the faint-hearted. \nThe rigors of the course test even the strongest servicemembers. Many \ntry; few succeed.\n  Through their grit and determination, Captain Griest and Lieutenant \nHaver have demonstrated that character, courage, and tenacity, not \ngender, are the hallmarks of great servicemembers and leaders.\n  Just as teamwork and dedication are the benchmarks for military \neffectiveness, they are also the mandates of the U.S. Army Rangers who \nare tasked with our Nation's most challenging and difficult missions. \nCaptain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, along with their fellow Ranger \nSchool classmates, braved the challenges and serve as role models for \ngirls and boys--women and men--in the United States and around the \nworld. This integrated class answered our Nation's call to service. \nThey stood shoulder-to-shoulder, enduring the course's extreme mental \nand physical stress, together. Each carried his or her own weight, and \nat times the weight of others, proving that integration represents not \njust a lofty goal, but an achievable reality. Their collective and \ndistinguished accomplishments embody the values of our Armed Forces and \nour Nation.\n  The journey toward integration, however, has been hard fought. Before \nthem, the first African Americans and women who answered the call to \nservice laid the foundation for making integration possible. These \npioneers inherently understood the importance of their contributions to \nthe realization of integration. They also recognized the undeniable \ntruth that an integrated and balanced force is a successful force both \non and off the battlefield.\n  The effectiveness of a military unit is almost always determined by \nthe cohesion of its individual members, their dedication to the team, \nand their commitment to the mission. No individual servicemember can \nsucceed by his or her efforts alone. Success is forged from equality \nand integration.\n  As we celebrate Captain Griest's and Lieutenant Haver's historic and \ninspiring achievements, we express our pride and gratitude for their \npersonal courage and sacrifice. I am confident that the military and \nour country are more battle ready as a result. I am also confident that \nCaptain Griest and Lieutenant Haver will continue to serve with \ndistinction as they ``Lead the Way!'' as our Nation's newest U.S. Army \nRangers. As a result of their milestone achievements, they have \ninspired a nation.\n  With this in mind, I am pleased to offer this resolution with \nSenators Mikulski, Ayotte, Baldwin, Boxer, Cantwell, Capito, Ernst, \nFeinstein, Fischer, Gillibrand, Heitkamp, Hirono, Klobuchar, McCaskill, \nMurkowski, Murray, Shaheen, Stabenow, Warren, Perdue, Murphy, Kirk, \nTester, Flake, Reed, Donnelly, Grassley, Blumenthal, Isakson, Warner, \nLeahy, Franken, Rubio, Heinrich, Coons, Thune, and Merkley honoring and \nrecognizing the patriotism and historic contributions to the United \nStates by Captain Griest and Lieutenant Haver, and extend my best \nwishes and heartiest congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/17/senate-section/article/S6816-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6816-S6817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 258--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 20 THROUGH 26, \n     2015, AS ``NATIONAL ADULT EDUCATION AND FAMILY LITERACY WEEK''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Reed, Mr. Donnelly, and Mr. Peters) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I submitted this resolution \nrecognizing and commending those who boldly prevented what could have \namounted to an unspeakable tragedy aboard a high-speed train headed \ntoward Paris, France, on August 21, 2015.\n  Those who took these courageous actions were: U.S. Air Force Airman \nFirst Class Spencer Stone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist \nAleksander Skarlatos, California State University Sacramento student \nAnthony Sadler, French-American Mark Moogalian, Frenchman Damien A., \nand Chris Norman, a British citizen.\n  I would particularly like to recognize U.S. Air Force Airman First \nClass Spencer Stone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander \nSkarlatos, and California State University Sacramento student Anthony \nSadler, three childhood friends who grew up in California, and thank \nthem for their fearlessness, commitment to one another, and swift \naction that saved countless lives.\n  That day, aboard the train carrying more than 500 passengers, a \ngunman armed himself with a Kalashnikov rifle, a pistol, a box cutter, \nhundreds of rounds of ammunition, and a container of gasoline, seeking \nto exact serious harm on innocent passengers.\n  In response to this threat, U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer \nStone, Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos, \ncollege student Anthony Sadler, Mark Moogalian, Chris Norman, and \nDamien A. took action to protect other passengers.\n  They subdued the gunman, risking their lives for the safety of others \nand representing the type of courage that should inspire us all.\n  Initially, Damien A. and Mark Moogalian encountered the gunman and \ntried to disarm him. In the struggle, Mark Moogalian suffered a gunshot \nwound. We wish Mark Moogalian a full and speedy recovery from his \nwounds, and thank him for his courageous action.\n  Upon noticing the disruption, U.S. Air Force Airman First Class \nSpencer Stone saw the gunman in the passenger car and immediately tried \nto subdue him.\n  He grabbed the gunman around the neck to prevent the gunman from \nshooting his weapon. U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone \nsuffered multiple box cutter wounds while wrestling the gunman.\n  Oregon Army National Guard Specialist Aleksander Skarlatos quickly \nfollowed, as did Anthony Sadler and Chris Norman.\n  Ultimately, the gunman was subdued, rendered unconscious, and tied up \non the floor of the train.\n  And, U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, a medical \ntechnician himself injured by the attacker's box cutter, then treated \nMark Moogalian's injuries and helped save his life.\n  The swift, decisive, and courageous actions of these men prevented \nwhat could have been the deaths of dozens of passengers.\n  Their heroism should be recognized as an inspiration by all \nAmericans, including by this body, and I thank all of my Senate \ncolleagues for cosponsoring the resolution to honor their bravery and \nheroic acts.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 191, H.R. 719.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 719) to require the Transportation Security \n     Administration to conform to existing Federal law and \n     regulations regarding criminal investigator positions, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Office of Inspection \n     Accountability Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law \n     enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal \n     investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on \n     average at least\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\n     50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, or \n     detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses \n     against the criminal laws of the United States.\n       (2) According to the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS IG), the Transportation Security \n     Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its cadre of \n     criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection are \n     meeting this requirement, even though they are considered law \n     enforcement officers under TSA policy and receive premium \n     pay.\n       (3) Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of \n     Inspection primarily monitor the results of criminal \n     investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate \n     administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry \n     out inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which \n     the DHS IG asserts could be performed by employees other than \n     criminal investigators at a lower cost.\n       (4) The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA \n     criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection who are \n     incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much \n     as $17 million over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes \n     to the number of criminal investigators in the Office of \n     Inspection, according to the DHS IG.\n       (5) This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for \n     the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the \n     costs of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement \n     benefits, police vehicles, and weapons.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the \n     Transportation Security Administration.\n       (2) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' \n     means the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security \n     (Transportation Security) of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n       (3) Inspector general.--The term ``Inspector General'' \n     means the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 4. INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDIT.\n\n       (a) Audit.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Inspector General shall analyze \n     the data and methods that the Assistant Secretary uses to \n     identify Office of Inspection employees of the Administration \n     who meet the requirements of sections 8331(20), 8401(17), and \n     5545a of title 5, United States Code, and provide the \n     relevant findings to the Assistant Secretary, including a \n     finding on whether the data and methods are adequate and \n     valid.\n       (b) Prohibition on Hiring.--If the Inspector General finds \n     that such data and methods are inadequate or invalid, the \n     Administration shall not hire any new employee to work in the \n     Office of Inspection of the Administration until--\n       (1) the Assistant Secretary makes a certification described \n     in section 5 to the Committee on Homeland Security of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Inspector General submits to such Committees a \n     finding, not later than 30 days after the Assistant Secretary \n     makes such certification, that the Assistant Secretary \n     utilized adequate and valid data and methods to make such \n     certification.\n\n     SEC. 5. TSA OFFICE OF INSPECTION WORKFORCE CERTIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Certification to Congress.--The Assistant Secretary \n     shall, by not later than 90 days after the date the Inspector \n     General provides its findings to the Assistant Secretary \n     under section 4(a), document and certify in writing to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate that only those Office of \n     Inspection employees of the Administration who meet the \n     requirements of sections 8331(20), 8401(17), and 5545a of \n     title 5, United States Code, are classified as criminal \n     investigators and are receiving premium pay and other \n     benefits associated with such classification.\n       (b) Employee Reclassification.--The Assistant Secretary \n     shall reclassify criminal investigator positions in the \n     Office of Inspection as noncriminal investigator positions or \n     non-law enforcement positions if the individuals in those \n     positions do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of \n     at least 50 percent of their time performing criminal \n     investigative duties.\n       (c) Projected Cost Savings.--\n       (1) In general.--The Assistant Secretary shall estimate the \n     total long-term cost savings to the Federal Government \n     resulting from the implementation of subsection (b), and \n     provide such estimate to the Committee on Homeland Security \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate by not \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Contents.--Such estimate shall identify savings \n     associated with the positions reclassified under subsection \n     (b) and include, among other factors the Assistant Secretary \n     considers appropriate, savings from--\n       (A) law enforcement training;\n       (B) early retirement benefits;\n       (C) law enforcement availability and other premium pay; and\n       (D) weapons, vehicles, and communications devices.\n\n     SEC. 6.
