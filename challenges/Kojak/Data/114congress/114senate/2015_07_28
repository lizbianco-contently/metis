Madam President, the Senate continues to move closer \nand closer to passage of a bipartisan, multiyear highway bill. The \nlegislation we advanced again last night is fiscally responsible. It \nwill not raise taxes by a penny. It will give State and local \ngovernments the kind of stability they need to plan longer term \nprojects for America's roads and bridges.\n  The bill couldn't have advanced as far as it has already without a \nlot of very hard work from a lot of dedicated Members. I want to thank \neach of them. Doing the right thing for the American people has meant \ntaking some bruises. But the American people sent us here to do some \nchallenging things. They deserve our best efforts on their behalf. I am \nproud to see the Senate continue along this difficult but promising \nroad.\n  Success was never assured at the beginning of this process. It wasn't \nassured even yesterday, and we are not done yet. The important thing is \nthat the Senate is now on the verge of passing a multiyear highway \nbill. The Senate is now positioned to pass another important piece of \nlegislation for the American people. With cooperation, the Senate may \nstill be able to consider more germane ideas to improve the bill even \nfurther. But the bottom line is this: If Republicans and Democrats \nresolve to keep working hard for the American people, we will get this \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6045-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in the western part of the United States, \nit is now 8:05 in the morning. I am sure as one of these young girls is \nrushing to go out to school--let's assume she is an African-American \ngirl--she is telling her mother, her dad or her teacher what she wants \nto be when she grows up. Maybe she wants to be a veterinarian, a \nteacher, a nurse, maybe even President of the United States or maybe \nrun some company.\n  The little girl is going to be shocked if her parents said: You can \ndo it--any of those jobs--but remember that you will have to work twice \nas hard--at least twice as hard--to earn the same amount of money that \nyour male colleagues do or your brother does or Billy, the neighbor, \ndoes. How would that little girl respond? She would probably exclaim: \nThat is not fair. She would be right. It isn't fair. It is an \ninjustice.\n  Earlier this spring--April 14 to be exact--we recognized Equal Pay \nDay, marking how far into this year the average woman has to work to \nearn what a man, for the exact same job, earned last year. This pay \ndisparity between men and women doing the same work is known as the \nwage gap. On average, an American woman makes 77 cents for every dollar \nthat their male colleague makes for doing the exact same work. As bad \nas that is, the wage gap is even much worse if you are a woman of \ncolor.\n  Today is Black Women's Equal Pay Day, a day that symbolizes how far \ninto 2015 African-American women must work to earn what their male \ncounterparts earned in 2014. What this means is she worked all of last \nyear and now up until this day to basically\n\n[[Page S6046]]\n\nearn the same that her male counterpart did.\n  Let's think about that for just a second. A woman must work a full \nyear plus an additional 6 months and 28 days just to make what her male \ncoworkers made in 1 year. That is 208 days more than a man must work \nfor the exact same salary.\n  The average African-American woman working full time year-round will \nmake 64 cents for every dollar that her White male counterpart makes. \nIt is unconscionable that in the 21st century we have not resolved this \nincome disparity.\n  For millions of African-American women struggling to make ends meet \nto put food on the table, the wage gap puts the American dream out of \nreach. To give these women a fair shot--an equal shot--at prosperity, \nCongress must take action.\n  We have to ensure that all women, African American and otherwise, are \nempowered to ensure that they are receiving equal pay for equal work. \nBut that is not all. We should raise the minimum wage.\n  I could do a quiz in this room, and I think everyone would miss it by \nquite a long mark, of how many Black women are earning minimum wage, \nwhat percentage of Black women are earning minimum wage in this \ncountry. Of 100 percent of people earning the minimum wage, what \npercentage is Black women? Almost 25 percent. Black women are almost 25 \npercent of everyone drawing the minimum wage. To be exact, it is a \nlittle over 23 percent.\n  An increase in the Federal minimum wage would mean more money for \ntheir families. It would be maybe to buy groceries or for an extra pair \nof shoes for their children--or a pair of shoes for their children--or \nmaybe to help with their education in some way, and importantly, for \nmore time to spend at home.\n  No woman should make less money than a man doing the same exact work. \nAfrican-American women deserve better. So do my daughters and my \ngranddaughters. That is why I remain committed to ensuring that \nAmerican women receive equal pay for equal work.\n  I encourage all Republicans, especially the leader, to take up \nSenator Murray's Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help close the wage \ndisparity for African-American women.\n  That may be a tall order to expect from today's Senate Republicans. \nAfter all, five times in 5 years, Republicans have blocked equal pay \nfor women. How? By filibustering. Five times in 5 years Republicans \nhave told their very own sisters, daughters, and wives that they are \nnot interested in fixing this income disparity. It is unfair. I can't \nunderstand it.\n  Who here can explain the concept of pay inequality to their daughter \nor granddaughter without shuddering? How do you tell a little girl--a \nlittle girl with big dreams--that in America today her life's work will \nnot be compensated like a man's. It is not right. It is not fair.\n  Today, as we recognize Black Women's Equal Pay Day, I hope my \nRepublican colleagues will finally understand that it is unfair to \ncontinue the way we are, and we should finally come to our senses. I \nhope that the Republican leader will make the necessary moves to allow \nus to address this injustice that hurts millions of American families. \nTwenty-three percent of people drawing the minimum wage are African-\nAmerican women. All women deserve equal pay for equal work.\n  Would the Chair be good enough to tell the Senate what the business \nof the day is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6046-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the business before the Senate is the \nconstruction of highways and bridges and the operation of mass transit \nand buses across America. How important is that to our economy? I know \nin my home State it is critically important, but I think it is \nimportant across the Nation.\n  Our infrastructure, our roads, and bridges are critical for business \nto operate profitably and for people to have good-paying jobs. We all \nknow the tragedies that occur when bridges collapse or are closed, and \nwe know that thousands across this country need repair.\n  When it comes to mass transit, come on down to the Loop in Chicago in \nthe morning and stand with me and watch the folks streaming out of the \ntrain stations and off the CTA and off the buses, headed to work every \nday. It is essential to the economy of Chicago and Illinois, the State \nI represent.\n  The fact is that on Friday the authorization to build these highways \nand bridges and maintain mass transit and buses expires. It is the 33rd \nshort-term extension of the highway trust fund--the 33rd. There was a \ntime when we would pass with regularity and predictability a 5- or 6-\nyear highway bill on a bipartisan basis, and we are anxious to do it.\n  There was a time when Members of the House and Senate knew the needs \nback home and knew that the Federal Government played a critical role \nin filling those needs, and so they voted for the highway trust fund \nreauthorization.\n  In my State of Illinois, 80 percent of the highway construction is \npaid for by the Federal Government. When the Federal Government stops \npaying, folks stop working. You have seen it; haven't you--the \npotholes, the highways that aren't finished? You wonder why in the heck \ndid they put all those blockades up and slow down the traffic and \nnobody is working.\n  The problem has to do with the way we are currently funding our \nhighway program. We are doing it in bits and pieces. My colleague and \nfriend from California, Senator Boxer, draws a pretty interesting \nanalogy. She said that if you were setting out to buy a home and went \nto the bank, and the bank said that, of course, we will offer you a \nmortgage, and here is a 60-day mortgage to buy your home, you would \nsay: Wait a minute; I am not going to make an investment such as buying \na home if I can only get a loan for 60 days. That is what has happened \nto the highway trust fund. The expiration of this temporary \nauthorization on Friday is the end of a 60-day mortgage which we have \noffered to America to build highways.\n\n  Well, several Members of the Senate decided to do something unique--\nnot totally unique but unusual, let's say--to try to find a bipartisan \ncompromise that can move this country forward, try to break through \nsome of the rhetoric and debate on the highway trust fund and find \nsomething that works.\n  I wish to especially salute Senator Barbara Boxer of California for \nleading this effort on the Democratic side and joining with Senator \nMitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, and Senator Inhofe \nfrom Oklahoma, who is the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee.\n  This is indeed an odd couple, Barbara Boxer and Mitch McConnell, but \nthey have come up with a plan--a compromise--to solve a problem.\n  When I go home to Illinois, what I hear over and over from the people \nI represent is, Senator, when are you folks in Washington going to stop \nsquabbling? When are you going to stop fighting? Can you basically sit \ndown and reach an agreement to solve a\n\n[[Page S6047]]\n\nproblem we face? That is what Senator Boxer and Senator McConnell have \ndone, and I have joined in the effort. Here is what they are proposing: \nInstead of a 60-day extension of the trust fund, it would be a 3-year \nextension. Six years of authorization but 3 years where the money is on \nthe table. I wish it was longer, but at this point I will jump at that. \nIt has been more than 10 years since we have had a highway bill that \nlong. So it is for 3 years. There is a modest growth each year in \nspending. I wish it was more. It ultimately is going to give the \nresources back to the States and localities so they can start building \nthe infrastructure America needs to be successful and to compete.\n  We have worked long and hard on it. It is controversial. It has \ndivided caucuses. There are 46 Democrats in the Senate and 21 of us \nvoted last night to move forward on this bill. So even within our \nranks, there is a difference of opinion. I am glad the Senator from \nCalifornia is here to keep me on my toes. She said 22 Democrats last \nnight voted to move forward. I wish all of them were on board, but some \nof them have their own legitimate concerns for not being there.\n  The point I am getting to is that when it came to the necessary vote, \nwe needed 60; we had 62. I have to check with Senator Boxer to make \nsure I am correct. There were 62 votes to move forward and 22 were \nDemocrats. We stepped up and made the difference to help move this \nprocess forward.\n  So here we are. We are close to the finish line. We are not quite \nthere. Because of the procedures of the Senate, we can't do it as \nquickly as we would like because we have to follow the rules. The rules \ntell us we are likely to get this wrapped up perhaps tomorrow--I hope \nas soon as tomorrow--and then we say thank goodness. With a Friday \ndeadline, we will get something done this week before we go home for \nthe August recess. I would say from the Senate point of view, that is \nexactly right. It means I can say to not only the mayors back home but \nalso to the Governor, the contractors, the workers: OK. Here are the \nresources to move forward for 3 years. I can also say we have done what \nwe were sent to do, to solve a problem and to do it on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  There is a problem. The problem we have is that Senate action alone \nis not enough. We need the House of Representatives to take the same \naction. There was an announcement yesterday from a Congressman from \nCalifornia that the House is not going to take up this measure. They \nwant to go home. They want to start their August recess earlier than \nany other August recess has been started in 10 years. They want to \nleave. The Republican majority has decided they don't want to take up \nthis bill; they just want to leave, and that is truly unfortunate.\n  This is our chance to solve a problem for America on a bipartisan \nbasis. This is our chance to invest in our country and put people to \nwork building roads and bridges and expanding mass transit, buying the \nbuses we need to serve our communities. This is our chance. Yet what we \nhear from the Republican side in the House of Representatives is, \nSorry, we are going home. We will see you in September.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Rhode \nIsland for a question.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The Senator from Illinois has just said the House is \nplanning to bug out this week before the Friday deadline when the \nhighway trust fund collapses for the August recess.\n  May I ask the Senator from Illinois, through the Chair, the following \nquestion: Is it even August? Isn't it July 28 today?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to take judicial notice that according to \nthe Calendar of Business, it is still July; Tuesday, July 28, 2015.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. In the past, have we not worked into the early week \nor weeks of August before taking the so-called August recess?\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the past 10 years, the August recess has started in \nAugust. The House of Representatives wishes to start it in July.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And Friday is when the funding for our highways comes \nto an end. It appears to be the intention of the House to have gotten \nout of Dodge by then in order to, I guess, dodge any consequence for \nnot having met us on bipartisan terms with a bipartisan 6-year bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Apparently, they need a rest and they want to go home for \nthat purpose, but I wish they would stay and finish this business \nbefore they go.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course. I yield to the senior Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would observe, after just walking in, \nthat we are talking about the actions that have not been taken formally \nbut that several Members of the House have talked about--we are going \nto bail out of here.\n  My feeling is this--and I am asking a question through the Chair if \nthe Senator from Illinois would agree with my observation. One of the \nreasons I think those statements have been made in the House is because \nthey never believed we were going to be able pass a 6-year highway \nreauthorization bill in the Senate.\n  Now, once that realization is there--and I am going to make an appeal \nto whoever is trying to string out this debate to shorten the time so \nwe can have the vote that is pending right now take place and get on \nwith the last and final vote, so we would actually have that ready \nwhile the House is still in session. They could very well take it up at \nthat time.\n  Now, if the individuals have placed themselves in a corner so that is \nnot going to happen, I don't know. But is it worth a try? That is my \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, through the Chair, let me respond to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, to first thank him for his bipartisan \nleadership on the committee. He and Senator Boxer are an outstanding \nexample of bipartisanship when it comes to this issue. They have \nproduced a 6-year authorization, and though I may not agree with some \nof the particulars, I thank him for that leadership on his side on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  As far as the efforts of the Senator from Oklahoma to speed up the \nvote in the Senate so we can catch our House colleagues before they \nleave, I would support it completely, but the Senator from Oklahoma and \nI both know that any single Senator can divert and stop that effort. I \nwill support the Senator in bringing this forward as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate that. The only other question I have is the \nsecond part that I will ask. There is time to do this. I am going to \npersonally make every effort--and I think Senator Boxer shares my \nanxiety over getting this bill into a position so we can vote.\n  All we have to do is move this up so we are not going to be voting at \nthe expiring time of 4 o'clock in the morning, when that could just as \neasily be tonight, and that would give us time to allow the House to \nlook at it and perhaps come up with a better judgment than they have \nexpressed so far.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would just say through the Chair to the Senator from \nOklahoma, we have to appeal to the better angels of our colleagues' \nnature, and a cooperative effort would be somewhat miraculous but worth \na try. I am happy to support him in that effort.\n  Let me just close and yield the floor to whoever would like to speak. \nThis is a chance to do what America expects us to do. Why were we sent \nhere? Why did we get elected? I am proud to represent Illinois, but I \nwas sent to solve problems, make life better, and create an economy \nthat is growing.\n  There is nothing more bipartisan and more important than the \ninfrastructure of this country. If people wonder about that, go visit \nChina and look at what is going on there. There are building cranes in \nevery direction. Highway and train routes are being built in every \ndirection because they are preparing their Chinese economy for the 21st \ncentury. Is America? I don't think so. What we are doing is passing \nshort-term extensions of the highway trust fund. We cannot patch our \nway to prosperity. We cannot, on a short-term basis, have a long-term \nplan to build America's economy. Because of the hard work on both sides \nof the aisle, compromises being made, we are at a point where we can \nhave a 3-year highway bill, and it is time for us to do it, no excuses.\n\n[[Page S6048]]\n\n  I support what the Senator from Oklahoma said: Let's accelerate this \nin the Senate, if we can, and then pray that our colleagues in the \nHouse decide to hang around long enough to take up this bill, which I \nbelieve would be a worthy alternative to another short-term extension.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for one last \nquestion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator join me in reaching out to try to see \nif we can get unanimous consent to go ahead and move forward? I know \nwhat we are doing is more significant than other things that are going \non. If they don't like the bill for some reason, that is one thing, but \nbring it forward so this can be done. I am inclined to hope we could \nencourage any of those who are just killing time right now to join us \nin doing this.\n  It is my intention to go ahead and make that request, and I will ask \nif the Senator from Illinois would join me in that effort.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, through the Chair, I would say to my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, let's sit down and put this UC together. Then, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma can take it, as we do by custom, to his \ncloakroom and I will take it to mine and let's see if we can get this \nmoving forward. I wish to protect the rights of Members, but I think \nmany of them would like to join us in accelerating this process so \nthere is activity on the floor which is productive. I am happy to work \nwith the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, let me thank the Senator from \nIllinois and the Senator from Oklahoma for their efforts on the floor \ntoday. I think this continued progress toward a bipartisan 6-year deal \nto make sure our highways and bridges are funded and repaired is a very \nimportant piece of the work.\n  I wish to join the Senator from Illinois in saluting the efforts of \nmy ranking member, Senator Boxer, who has worked so hard through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to get to a place where we now \nhave a Senate bipartisan compromise for a 6-year bill, with 3 years \nfully funded, and the prospect for all of our State departments of \ntransportation to be able to take on big projects, knowing that funding \nis out there.\n  We are taking up this conversation while our own American Society of \nCivil Engineers gives our American roads the grade of a D. I don't know \nabout the Presiding Officer, but if my kids came home with a D, I would \nnot be amused and pleased about that. So when our own engineers tell us \nour roads are a D and our Federal highway program has limped along, 2 \nmonths, 6 months--these tiny, little steps forward--and now we have a \nchance to put a serious slug of money on the table so our departments \nof transportation can do the work our roads so desperately need, why \nnot go forward with that? Across this country, Americans pay more than \n$500 a year in car repairs as a result of our terrible roads--so $500 \nout of their pockets getting their wheels realigned or their tires \nrepaired because they have been banged by potholes and bad roads \nhurting their vehicles. There is a real pocketbook consequence for \nAmericans if we fail to act.\n  We have a bipartisan compromise. We should push it forward. What the \nHouse is doing is not helpful. I hope, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, my chairman on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee said, they come up with a better judgment than they have \nexpressed so far. I think that under these circumstances, bugging out \nand starting the August recess before this problem is solved--indeed, \nbefore it is even August--is a pretty serious misjudgment.\n  So let's hope we can keep after this. We do have strong support for \ngetting this done. Whether it is the American Association of General \nContractors, whether it is the National Association of Manufacturers, \nwhether it is the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are a lot of \norganizations that customarily support the Republican side that want to \nget this done. I hope they will be having conversations with Speaker \nBoehner and with Majority Leader McCarthy to ask them to have better \njudgment about what to do in this circumstance, other than to bug out \nfor an August recess before it is even August and leave Americans high \nand dry without a bipartisan 6-year bill that is being fashioned in the \nSenate right now.\n  Again, I wish to express my appreciation to my Ranking Member Barbara \nBoxer, who has worked so hard to bring us to this point and our \nchairman, Senator Inhofe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise to speak in favor of the DRIVE \nAct. I was a supporter of this bill from the first vote we had in the \nlast week. There were some changes made immediately that I thought were \nimportant. I think this long-term bill is incredibly important to our \ncountry's future. Time and again, we have had these short-term \nextensions, and that is what the House of Representatives is talking \nabout again.\n  We have an opportunity here. Americans, as we know, can't fix a road \nin 2 months. In a State such as Minnesota, where we have two seasons, \none road construction season and one winter, citizens cannot plan ahead \nand our State cannot plan ahead when we continue to have these short-\nterm extensions. They also want to do bigger things and better things \nfor transportation in our State, and this funding and this bill will \nallow them to do that, instead of this Mickey Mouse short-term \nextension time after time after time.\n  As we have heard from my colleagues, ranking member Senator Boxer, \nour chairman, Senator Inhofe, Senator Durbin, and Senator Whitehouse \ntoday, I think it is incredibly important that we move forward with \nthis bill.\n  This Senator came to this issue in a very tragic way; that is, when a \nbridge fell down in the middle of a summer day. The anniversary of this \nbridge collapse is coming up in just a few days. It was a beautiful \nsummer day, rush hour, and there were tons of traffic going over one of \nthe most heavily traveled bridges in our State. This wasn't just a \nbridge; this was an eight-lane highway. It was something you wouldn't \neven notice as a bridge because there were so many cars on it. It was \nthe I-35W bridge.\n  On that day, I was in Washington. I remember trying to call some \npeople in Minnesota. The cell phone services wouldn't work, and I was \nwondering what was wrong with the cell phone service. What I found \nabout 5 minutes later is that people were calling, panicked about their \nloved ones because tens of thousands of people were traveling near that \nbridge that day. In fact, when that bridge collapsed, tragically, 13 \npeople died and dozens of cars were submerged.\n  Heroes who came to the front that day didn't run away from that \nbridge. They ran toward it. No one will forget the off-duty firefighter \nShanna Hanson, who was going in and out, in and out on a rope tethered \nto the side of the bridge, trying to get people, trying to find people \nin the murky water. The fact that 13 people died--tragic as it was--was \nsomething of a miracle, given how many people were injured. Over 100 \npeople were injured in the collapse.\n  A schoolbus sat precariously on the edge of the bridge. A Tasty \ntruckdriver literally veered out so the schoolbus wouldn't go over the \nedge and ended up tragically dying himself when the truck caught on \nfire. The schoolbus was labeled the ``miracle bus'' because youth \nworkers on the bus had the presence of mind to take these little kids \nwho were on the bus going out for a summer outing and get them out the \nback and to safety. That happened. All of that happened on August 1.\n  As I said that day, a bridge just shouldn't fall down in the middle \nof America--not an eight-lane highway, not a bridge which is literally \n8 blocks from my house and which I drive on every day with my family, \nwith my daughter. That is the bridge that fell down.\n  So what did we do in Minnesota? In 13 months, we rebuilt that bridge. \nOn a bipartisan basis, just like you see with this bill with the DRIVE \nAct, we worked together across the aisle. We got the Federal funding, \nand we rebuilt that bridge, but that is not where the story ends.\n\n[[Page S6049]]\n\n  Because of what happened, because of the design defect that caused \nthat bridge to fall, in addition to two other issues NHTSA found, which \nare that there weren't adequate inspections and they also found there \nwere problems with construction guides because there was construction \nwork going on--but the bottom cause was a design defect.\n  If we had adequate highway funding, adequate inspections, and we were \nable to go back in and look at bridges, as we did after the fact in \nMinnesota, and found that others had the same defect and that they had \nto be replaced--our State put more money into infrastructure, which \nhelped us--I should add for my colleagues in this Chamber that it was \none of the major reasons CNBC rated Minnesota as one of the best States \nto do business in the country, the best State to do business in, \nfollowed by Texas, Georgia, and Colorado. Two of the major factors they \nlooked at were the quality of life and infrastructure.\n  After this collapse occurred, we invested, and that is what this bill \nis about. It is about making a safer America. As Senator Whitehouse \njust outlined, our country is getting D's for infrastructure. It is \nabout a safer America. It is about reducing congestion, but it is also \nabout our economy, as shown by what has happened in Minnesota since the \nbridge collapse. It is about building our economy. When we are building \nour economy based on exports, we have to have a way to get goods to \nmarket. The way you do that is to upgrade railways and upgrade locks \nand dams, as we did in an earlier bill last year when we updated \nhighways and we updated bridges.\n  I am very excited about this bill. I love the fact that this leads us \nto a 21st century transportation system. I love the fact that we were \nable to get my distracted driving provisions in there, with the help of \nSenator Thune, Senator Nelson, and I had worked on them with Senator \nHoeven.\n  Distracted driving is a major safety risk in this country that we are \nfinally going to be able to find a way to get the money out to the \nStates so it is not just sitting and piling up and going nowhere, so \nStates can start educating people about distracted driving.\n  There is the work in the bill on graduated driving that I worked on \nso hard, on licenses as well as drunk driving. There are a lot of good \nmeasures in this bill.\n  Mostly this bill is about the long term. It is about looking at the \nlong-term economy and looking at the long-term safety issues, instead \nof just putting on a bandaid every 2 months, every 3 months, every 6 \nmonths. This is an opportunity that can't be missed.\n  I ask my colleagues for their strong support. We have strong support \nfor this as well as the Ex-Im Bank. I ask my colleagues across the way \nin the House to support this bill, do the right thing, and come up with \na long-term solution.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question from the chairman?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Senator, How many people were killed in that \nbridge collapse?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. There were 13 people killed that day.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware that around the same time that \nhappened, in my State of Oklahoma, we were in the process of the last \nlong-term bill in 2005. A mother with three children was driving below \na bridge in Oklahoma City. Some concrete dropped off and killed the \nmother. We corrected that in the 2005 bill.\n  But the question I would ask you is, Why do we wait until people die \nbefore this happens? I have a list of bridges that are in need of \nattention, and later today I will read it for the third time. We can \navoid things such as this from happening, but if we don't do something, \nif we are not going to do it, then large projects cannot be done with \nshort-term extensions. My question is, Why do we wait until death is at \nour door?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I appreciate that question from the Senator from \nOklahoma. I thank the chairman for his work on this bill, for his \nchairmanship on the committee, and his willingness to work across the \naisle on this bill.\n  I would say this is a major problem. If we do just a short-term \nextension, then maybe a project gets funded here and there, but we \ndon't do the long-term maintenance, which is never as glamorous as \nbuilding new projects.\n  This is about long-term maintenance and work that needs to be done on \nour existing roads and bridges as well as exciting new opportunities. \nBut when we don't have that kind of clear funding source for our States \nto see that we have a window, as the Presiding Officer knows with her \nleadership in the State of Nebraska, you just can't do projects in a \nState when the funding is not going to be there 3 months later. One is \nnot able to invest in the maintenance and long-term work that needs to \nbe done, and that is why this Senator thanks the chairman and the \nranking member, Senator Boxer, for her incredible work on this bill as \nwell because this is about long-term funding for planning, for safety, \nand also for our economy.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend because she has been such a leader. I \nwas listening to every word she said, as well as Senator Inhofe talking \nabout the mother who was killed because of a bridge collapse. This \ntouches our hearts as family members. Yes, as Senators, but as family \nmembers we know those families will never be the same--the family, the \nchildren of that mother, the families of those who are grieving the \nloss of their relatives.\n  I ask my friend, who was so early on a supporter, is she aware that \nseven States have either canceled projects or completely shut down \ntheir highway and transit spending? Is she aware of that?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes, I am.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to say that I have a chart here that shows the \nStates that have either canceled or delayed highway projects. These \nprojects are valued at over $1.6 billion. Think about the jobs and the \nbusinesses that are suffering. They are in Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, \nMontana, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  I have a further question. I know my friend has heard me say this. Is \nmy friend aware that the Associated General Contractors of America came \nout with a new study? They were just in the New York Times stating that \nbecause of our, I will use the word ``dithering''--because we haven't \ncome up with the long-term bill, which we are now attempting to do--25 \nStates have lost construction jobs just in the last month. Is my friend \naware of this study?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Yes, I have heard of that study, and I think it mimics \nwhat we have seen in other studies. If we don't plan ahead, people will \nstart cutting off the work.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will just say before I yield that the States that lost \nconstruction jobs last month, according to the general contractors, are \nAlaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, \nMississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, \nNew Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, \nTennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. I \nwanted to read those off.\n  I will talk about that later, but I wish to thank my friend because \nthe point--when she talked about what happened on this bridge, my \nfriend didn't have to read one word of any statement. This was a \nheartbreaking memory she will always have. We all go through this in \nour time here, when there are earthquakes, floods, fires, and bridge \ncollapses.\n  I would ask my friend this last question: Does the Senator think this \nis important enough that the House should stay an extra week or even a \nfew days to take up our bill, pass it or if they don't like it, amend \nit, send it back, and let's get this done for the American people.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I say to Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe, I think \nthat is why we are here today, to talk about the fact that we have come \ntogether across party lines with people from completely different \npolitical ideologies to agree that we need a long-term fix to our \ntransportation problem.\n  As the Senator mentioned the people, I think sometimes people think \nabout transportation as bricks and mortar or something very esoteric, \nbut it is not; it is about the people who use the system. Senator \nInhofe talked about the\n\n[[Page S6050]]\n\npeople who died in the bridge collapse in his State. There is a \nmemorial for the 13 people who died in our State. I would suggest, if \nyou ever come to the Twin Cities, come and look at it because it \nshows--as Senator Inhofe knows--everyone uses the roads and bridges. \nThese people came from vastly different backgrounds. They were young \npeople. There was a man who died. He and his wife had just decided they \nwanted to have a baby. Of all things, after he died, she decided to \nadopt children by herself, and she decided to adopt them from Haiti. \nThen the tragedy happened in Haiti, and we actually helped her get \nthese children home. These are people who worked all kinds of different \njobs. Some were coming home from work, some were students, some were \nmoms busy in their car. Those are the people who died. They were \nAmerica. America uses our bridges and roads and trains. We have to \nremember this is about the people who work construction, this is about \nthe people who use the roads and bridges, and this is about our economy \nmoving forward.\n  Sometimes we get so into facts and figures and what one House does \nand what the other House does that we forget why we are spending money \non our bridges and our roads and what this means for our future \neconomy.\n  I thank the leaders of this bill for what they have done, their \nwillingness to take a lot of heat for working across the aisle, for \nmaking sure that what we are using to pay for this bill are things that \nmake sense for our country and continue to allow us to move forward, \nand also for making changes to the bill when other Members had problems \nwith it. That is why they are gaining so much momentum, and I am sure \nour friends over in the House are looking at this bill. They have \nexamined the pay-fors--they have now had weeks to do that--and they \nhave also looked at the safety provisions and other things in the bill.\n  So at some point they are going to have the ability to decide if they \nare for this bill or against it or, as Senator Boxer mentioned, if they \nwant to make some changes. But the key is that we have a good base bill \nwhich has brought people together from across the country, from \ndifferent ideologies, which they can use and look at. If they just want \nto do another one of these short-term fixes--it is never going to get \nus where we need to be so we don't have another one of these bridges \ncollapse on August 1, in the middle of a summer day. That happened in \nthis country in this century. It will happen again if we keep this up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nwould like to thank her again. What I want to say to her is something \nshe has said to me over and over; that is, the importance of finding \ncommon ground when we can. We all know we cannot give up our \nprinciples, but we have to search for common ground.\n  And everyone knows--and Senator Inhofe and I kind of joke about it--\nwe could not be different in terms of our ideology. We really could \nnot. But on this one, on this piece, the need to have a strong \ninfrastructure, we are as one, as progressives, as conservatives.\n  Frankly, I think everyone in the Senate and in the House should come \ntogether around the principle that you cannot have a strong economy if \nyou cannot move goods. That is why my friend Senator Inhofe put \ntogether a great new freight title in our bill this time, part of the \nformula. It is hugely important. If we cannot move goods, if we cannot \nmove people, we are going to fall behind.\n  Clearly, when bridges collapse, there is devastation. I have shown \nthis particular bridge collapse, along with the one on which Senator \nKlobuchar was so eloquent. This is a bridge in my great State. We have \n40 million people. We take in about 40 to 50 percent of all the imports \ninto our Nation; they go into trucks and trains and planes. They use \nour roads, and they go across the country to deliver goods to everyone.\n  Well, the bridge that collapsed in California a few days ago--maybe a \nweek or two ago now--was deemed to be obsolete because it was built for \nvery light traffic. It is the bridge between California and Arizona. \nThere was very little traffic at the time it was built. Now we have a \nhuge amount of traffic. This bridge collapsed. Thank the Lord no one \ndied, so I can stand up here and say that.\n  This, to me, is the poster child of the work we are doing together. \nThis is the poster child. There is a list of bridges--there are more \nthan 60,000 deficient bridges in America. This is America. They are \ndeficient--some worse than others, but they are deficient.\n  I have listed just a few here--just a few: Alabama, Arizona, \nArkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, \nFlorida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMaine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, \nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, \nSouth Carolina, Texas, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin. This is just a \nhandful--a couple of handfuls of the 60,000-plus bridges that are \ndeficient.\n  Senator Inhofe, in your State we have listed as an example the I-40 \nbridge over Crooked Oak Creek. As I was saying yesterday, when I was a \ncountry supervisor a very long time ago, we found out as supervisors--\nand we were a very bipartisan group--that our civic center was at risk \nof collapse in an earthquake. In those years, we did not know that much \nabout how to reinforce. It was just coming to light. It is a Frank \nLloyd Wright building, a gorgeous building, a historic building. We \nwere told that if we did not fix it, there was a possibility that we \ncould be held personally liable if something happened.\n  Clearly, no one here is going to be personally held liable if a \nbridge collapses, but morally we need to understand that now that we \nknow we have 60,000-plus bridges in bad condition and that 50 percent \nof our roads are not up to par, we have an obligation to fix it. It is \nvery clear that we must do so.\n  I am proud that almost half of the Democratic caucus has come \ntogether with a larger percentage of the Republican caucus to put \ntogether a transportation bill. I am proud of that. It is on the road \nto passage. Last night, at a crucial moment late in the evening, we got \n62 votes. That was not an easy thing to do because, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, there were things she wanted in that bill, and there \nwere more things I wanted. I wanted things out of the bill and other \nthings added. Each one of us, of course--we are people who are \npassionate about these issues. We would have written the bill \ndifferently. I would say that anyone in America, having the chance, \nwould write it differently. But the art of compromise is something we \nshould not be afraid of. You are not compromising your principles; you \nare seeing where you can find a sweet spot. I believe we did that.\n  I am urging the House not to leave on their summer break and to stay \nand work on this bill. We have done a lot of the heavy lifting. We have \ndone a lot of the heavy compromising. They can do more. They can take \nout things they do not like, add things they want. We can sit down in a \nconference. We can get this done.\n  My opinion: They should take it and pass it. When a bill has 62 votes \nhere, that is pretty darn good. If they want to tweak it, they can do \nit. But I think they need to stay.\n  I served proudly with my friend Senator Inhofe in the House. I served \nfor 10 years. It has been 10 years since the House has had this long of \na break. They have not left before August for the August recess. I \nthink they should stay. They should stay.\n  You know, the average American, when they are about to go on their \nsummer break, the boss says: Clean up your desk, please. Finish your \nwork, please. Don't just pile everything on one side of the table, \nplease. Take care of it.\n  The House ought to finish its work. Take up our bill, amend it, send \nit back, and we will get it done. Most of the work is done. Most \nAmericans have to tie up loose ends before they take a long break. I \nmight add, I think it is a 5-week break--a 5-week break. Do your work. \nMaybe you can only go on a 4-week break. That would still be twice the \ntime most Americans get. Do your work.\n\n  When I say bridges are in poor condition, that is not hyperbole, that \nis fact. This is not some study put out by a\n\n[[Page S6051]]\n\nDemocrat or a Republican; it is put out by the engineers. Our \ninfrastructure is rated--I believe it is a D overall. If our child came \nhome and said ``Mom, I have a D,'' we would not be happy. Well, \ntaxpayers are not happy that our infrastructure is rated a D.\n  So I ask the House: Please stay and do your job. Roll up your \nsleeves. We will work with you. We can resolve these things. You have \nhad time to look at our bill.\n  I will close with just two more points. I want to give the highlights \nof our Transportation bill on which we worked so hard across party \nlines--Senator Inhofe; myself; the Banking Committee, chairman and \nranking; the Commerce Committee, chairman and ranking; the Finance \nCommittee, which paid for this bill.\n  Some people are voting against it because they do not like the way it \nis paid for. They say it is better to find some long-term answer in \ninternational tax reform. Personally, I think that is a great idea, but \nyou have time to pay for the last 3 years in that fashion. We have paid \nfor 3 years; this bill is 6 years. Pay for the last 3 years.\n  As for me, I am a lonely voice here. There are about five of us who \nsay: A penny a month for 10 months on the gas tax. We don't have the \nvotes. So what do I do? Go in my corner and cry? I don't have the \nvotes. No, we have to put a bill together. So this is a $50 billion-a-\nyear bill for 6 years. Three years are paid for. Every State gets more \nformula funding for both highways and transit. There are two new \nprograms: a formula freight program that my friend Senator Inhofe, \nworking with Republicans and Democrats, put together; and a new grant \nprogram for major projects called the AMP Program. Senator Whitehouse \nworked across the aisle for that program. All of our States are \neligible.\n  It includes the McCaskill bill. It is the McCaskill-Schumer bill that \nsays rental car companies cannot lease out cars that are under recall. \nI think this is important because we see a lot of the problems with the \nTakata air bags.\n  Because Senator Nelson has worked so hard on that, we have tripled \nNHTSA fines. We have used that money in the bill to help put positive \ntrain control on the commuter rails. This is important. People are \ndying because we do not have positive train control.\n  Is the bill the perfect bill on safety? In my view, it is not. In \nsomebody else's view it is. It is a compromise. But I think, overall, \nit is solid. Every State will see an increase in their highway dollars, \nin their transit dollars.\n  In closing, I wish to thank Senators on both sides of the aisle, \nincluding the Presiding Officer because we did work together. We did a \ngood job. It was hard to do. I know my friend had one provision she \nwanted. She had to scale it back. It is hard to do that. I had a \nprogram I wanted. It got scaled back. We all have to give and take, but \nthat is what the people expect of us. Whether they are Democrats, \nRepublicans, Independents, it does not matter--they want us to get \nsomething done.\n  I am proud of the Senate. We are not done yet. We still need some \nmore votes on this, so everyone stay tuned. But if the House will stay \nan extra few days and take up our bill, we can get this done for the \nAmerican people. We can save businesses, we can save jobs, we can keep \nthis recovery going, and we can feel proud that we fixed our bridges, \nthat we fixed our highways, and that we did the work we are supposed to \ndo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, well, I am going to have to disagree \nwith my partner over here on one thing; that is, the insistence that \nthe House stay. In my opinion, they are not going to stay. That is \ndone. But this can still be done with their targeted adjournment date \nfor them. The way that can happen is for us to right now--we are \nwaiting out the vote. If nobody yields backs--it is on the Inhofe \nsubstitute. That is what we are doing right now. That vote can take \nplace at 5 o'clock in the morning. If you moved that up--and right now \nwe are asking unanimous consent to do that. If we are able to do that, \nthat could happen this afternoon. That means we could have the next \nstep, which would be to move to the bill. That could be done while they \nare still here.\n  What I do not want to happen is to have them--you know, we are \nsuccessful and done with our bill and then send it over to the House \nand they are gone. So I think we can still do it while the House is \nstill here.\n  I have to say--and I am not sure the ranking member of my committee, \nSenator Boxer, agrees with this, but I think they never believed we \nwould be able to get the bill done. That being the case, they staked \nout early and said they--for any number of reasons, they are going to \nbe gone. Well, we can do it. All we have to do is to move this up and \nto get time yielded back. We can do the same thing then on final \npassage. We could have the bill over there in good enough time--\nWednesday; that is tomorrow--that they could still act on the bill. \nThat would be my goal on this because I think that is the only way.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would love to get this done in 5 minutes. So let me be \nclear about where I stand. But has my friend received confirmation from \nSpeaker Boehner that he would take up the bill tomorrow? My \nunderstanding is that they moved up their--this is what I heard. I \ncan't swear to it, I don't know exactly, but what I heard is they are \nactually moving up their adjournment from Thursday to Wednesday so they \ncan escape from having to take up our bill.\n\n  Does my friend believe that if we could get this bill done, they \nwould stay 24 hours and deal with our bill?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reclaiming my time, I don't know what they would do, how \nlong they would stay. If we don't finish it until they already are \ngone, then we know that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK.\n  Mr. INHOFE. But I still think that can be done. There is this \nurgency. We have worked long and hard. People say they haven't had time \nto get into this thing. We passed our bill. They have had 5 or 6 weeks \nto absorb this. And this argument that we have a 6-year bill with only \n3 years of funding--this is kind of a phony argument because we have a \nvalve that doesn't exist anywhere else that if we go through and start \na 6-year bill, that would allow us to get into the major projects which \nthe Senator from Minnesota was talking about and which the Senator and \nI have been talking about that you cannot get into with short-term \nextensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right.\n  (Mr. CRUZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. We all understand that. So we can start those projects. \nGiven 3 years, I can assure you that we would have the opportunity to \nfind offsets that would be acceptable. We were operating under the gun \nbefore. This would take that away. We can go ahead and accept the fact \nthat we have 3 years funded.\n  For those individuals--and I am speaking now of my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle--who are conservative who have had the argument that \nwe will then have to borrow money in order to finish the 6 years.\n  We can really have it both ways. We start the projects, and then \nthere will be enough pressure on and we will be able to do--\nincidentally, I have to keep reminding my friends that there is a \nconservative position, and that is to pass this bill.\n  You know, I get so tired of people--there are a lot of people out \nthere who actually voted for the $800 billion--way back at the \nbeginning of the Obama administration--the $800 billion stimulus bill \nthat didn't stimulate. We tried to put an amendment on there. I know \nthe Senator from California and I cosponsored amendments. They were all \nrejected.\n  Then along came the $700 billion bailout, and a lot of my Republican \nfriends voted for that.\n  Now they complain that the money isn't there. Well, the money can be \nthere. And if it hadn't been for those two things, we wouldn't be \nhaving this conversation today. But the money can be there. We need \ntime to let that happen. Certainly, as we pass this bill, start the \nmajor projects that are going on, then we will be in a position to do \nthat. The key to making that happen, to allowing that to happen--I am \nnot going to give up because the House\n\n[[Page S6052]]\n\nhasn't left yet. They say they are going to leave tomorrow afternoon. \nWell, if we go ahead and yield back enough time to get this vote this \nafternoon, we could do the same thing on the final vote.\n  By the way, those individuals who want to have amendments, you can \nstill have germane amendments that would not be treated as an \namendment, but we would consider putting those into the managers' \namendment. If that happens, that would become part of the vote we would \nbe voting on tomorrow. To allow that to happen, we have to go ahead and \nyield back time so that we can have this vote take place and start \nworking on those amendments that are germane to see which of those we \nare going to be in a position to consider.\n  Anyway, that is what I am hoping will happen. I think there is an \nopportunity.\n  Again, people who make statements--and I have a lot of friends in the \nHouse. I spent 8 years in the House. These individuals who are speaking \nnow--one of them made kind of an off-the-cuff statement about, you \nknow, we are just not going to consider it. Well, I really believe most \nof them over there felt we weren't going to be successful in passing a \nbill. So it is still possible we can do that. We do have the time left, \nand we know what we have to do to do that.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the sense of urgency.\n  First, I appreciate the fact that this conversation took place. The \nSenator from Minnesota had some pretty graphic pictures of what \nhappened that took the lives of 13 people, a bridge falling down.\n  The DRIVE Act contains some other key provisions outside of \nprioritizing bridge safety and stability.\n  Today, the National Highway System carries more than 55 percent of \nthe Nation's highway traffic and 97 percent of the truck freight \ntraffic.\n  We have never had a freight provision. This is my sixth bill that I \nhave worked on--actually going all the way back to the House days--and \nwe have never had a freight provision to take care of this problem.\n  Of the 4 million miles of public road, the National Highway System \nrepresents 5.5 percent of the Nation's most heavily traveled miles of \nroad. Americans depend upon a well-maintained National Highway System \nthat provides critical connections between urban and rural communities. \nAmerican businesses pay an estimated $27 billion a year in extra \nfreight transportation costs due to the poor condition of public roads.\n  Look at it. Look at that. How many lanes are there on this one? There \nare six lanes, all of them stopped. What happens when they stop? The \nengines keep going. The air is polluted. Gasoline costs a lot of money, \nand the freight cannot go through. Well, that is why we have this.\n  Recognizing that it is the foundation of the Nation's economy and the \nkey to the Nation's ability to compete in the global economy, it is \nessential that we focus efforts to improve freight movement on the \nNational Highway System. Incidentally, if we don't pass this bill and \nif we go back to extensions, that ain't going to happen. It can't \nhappen.\n  I always have to pause to remind my conservative friends--and I can \nsay this because I have had the ranking of the most conservative Member \nprobably more than anybody else has--the Constitution tells us what we \nare supposed to be doing. We are doing a lot of things the Constitution \nnever contemplated. It says in article I, section 8 that we in the \nHouse and the Senate are supposed to be defending America and roads and \nbridges. That is what we are supposed to be doing. So I would just say \nI have to remind people that the conservative position in the \nConstitution is to go ahead and do what we are trying to do with the \nDRIVE Act today.\n  The DRIVE Act includes two new programs to help the States deliver \nprojects that promote the safe movement of consumer goods and products.\n  The first new program is the National Freight Program. That is what \nwe are talking about right now.\n  That is what is bogged down in traffic right here.\n  It is distributed by a formula that will provide funds to all States \nto enhance the movement of goods, reduce costs, and improve the \nperformances of businesses. The program would expand flexibility for \nboth rural and urban areas.\n  A lot of the reason this hasn't been handled before is that States \nsend in their priorities. You know, one of the few things in government \nthat do work is what we are going through right now. When we set up a \nformula, we take into consideration what the people at home want, what \nthe people in my State of Oklahoma think is the most important thing in \nterms of roads, bridges, highways, and maintenance. There are some \nliberals here in Washington who think there has never been a good \ndecision unless it came out of Washington. But we always emphasize what \nthey consider to be the greatest concern within their States.\n  The reason that freight doesn't often get the high priority it should \nis because a lot of the freight moves in and out of a State and the \nStates don't evaluate that as an economic benefit. That is shortsighted \nbecause States on either side provide that kind of traffic, and it does \nadd to the economy of the State, it is just not direct the way the rest \nof the projects are.\n  So we have this type of congestion taking place.\n  Secondly, it will improve efforts to identify projects with a high \nreturn on investment through State freight plans and State advisory \ncommittees.\n  The second new program is the Assistance for Major Projects Program, \nwhich creates a competitive grant program to provide funds for major \nprojects of high importance to a community, a region, or to the Nation. \nThe program includes a set-aside for rural areas and it ensures an \nequitable geographic distribution of the funds. The State of Oklahoma \nis a rural State, so that is very important.\n  One thing you cannot do with the short-term extensions--keep in mind, \nthe last time we had a long-term bill, the reauthorization bill, was \n2005. By the time 2009 got here, we were working on just the short-term \nextensions--33 short-term extensions. So you can't do those major \nprojects that have to be done sooner or later in our country.\n  In Chicago, IL, the I-290 and the I-90/I-94 intersection is the \nintersection we have been looking at with the congestion. It is the No. \n1 worst freight bottleneck in the United States. The average speed \nslows down to 29 miles an hour. Morning and evening rush hour speeds \nhave been known to drop below 20 miles an hour. It carries about \n300,000 vehicles a day. That is the Chicago I-29.\n  Houston, TX, the I-45 at U.S. 59--and certainly the occupier of the \nchair is fully aware of this and I am sure has been bogged down in \ntraffic many times on the Texas I-45 at U.S. 59 exchange. Houston, TX, \nis the home of 5 of the top 20 freight bottlenecks in the Nation. Texas \nis home to 9 of the top 25 freight bottlenecks. Freight bottlenecks \ncost the freight industry in Texas $671 million annually and 8.8 \nmillion hours of delay.\n  This is what we are looking at, looking at Houston. It happens that I \nwas stopped there going there one time. That is why I always fly down \nto South Texas rather than drive--to avoid that.\n  So I-45 at the intersection is ranked third in the Nation by the \ncongestion index. It is the same I-45 at 610 North that is ranked 15. \nThere is an average speed slowdown to 39 miles per hour, and there they \nare, out there wasting valuable time.\n  Fort Lee, NJ. The I-95 you are looking at right now connects Fort \nLee, NJ, to New York City. It is the second worst freight bottleneck by \ncongestion index in the Nation. The average speed slows to 29 miles an \nhour. Rush hour speeds in the morning and evening slow down to about 15 \nmiles an hour.\n  The nearby I-95 Cross-Bronx Expressway is the most congested corridor \nin the country. By the way, anyone from here in Washington who is going \nup to anyplace along the coast, Connecticut on up North, has to go \nthrough that, and I have had to do that. I had an occasion just the \nother day to give a commencement talk up at the Coast Guard Academy. To \nget up there, I had to go all the way across that bridge, and it almost \nmade me late. So that is one that is well known.\n  The George Washington Bridge is the world's busiest motor vehicle \nbridge, carrying over 106 million cars a year.\n\n[[Page S6053]]\n\n  Anyway, that is what we have right now. We have a freight program to \nalleviate this type of congestion and increase America's ability to \nconduct commerce on our highways.\n  We have another talk that we have given several times where we go \nover all of the bridges. The Senator from Minnesota was talking about \nthe tragedy of the bridges. But if you look and you see, it is not just \nconfined to the east coast. If you look and you see, in my State of \nOklahoma, in the northeastern section, we have more deficient bridges--\nprobably ranked No. 3 in the Nation, I would say--and those bridges are \nnot going to be addressed until we have a chance to do it.\n  Simply look at this Eisenhower quote, a republican president who \nunderstood the need for federal investment in our military and our \nhighways. I always like this because I chair the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and have been ranking member of the Senate Armed Forces \ncommittee. I think it is deplorable, what President Obama has done to \nour military. I call it the disarming of America.\n  Yet the guy who started this whole thing--I don't think even the \nChair is aware of the fact that the reason Eisenhower started this way \nback in 1956 was to defend our Nation. He said: As it is right now, we \ndon't have any type of a system where you can take goods and services \nand move them across either coast to be sent out in the defense of this \ncountry.\n  So I am hoping that we all realize the need to reauthorize this long-\nterm bill. Right now, we are in the middle of not doing anything, not \ngetting done, but it is a 30-hour delay. If we can just move that up so \nthat instead of voting on that at 5 o'clock in the morning, we can vote \non it this afternoon--which would be just as easy to do, and I am going \nto ask unanimous consent that we be able to do that--then we could move \non and do the same thing as we move toward the bill.\n  Now, if that happens, for those individuals--and I would hope the \nstaff is listening to this--who have germane amendments, we can't take \nup amendments after passage. This is going to pass. We know this is \ngoing to pass, but is it going to pass this afternoon or is it going to \npass tomorrow morning? If so, we then would not be in a position to do \nanything if the House has already adjourned.\n  If this happens, if Members will bring amendments down, we will \nconsider germane amendments. We still have the managers' amendment we \nwill be able to put these in, and so we will consider these. So there \nis an opportunity for that to take place, and I wouldn't want anyone \nvoting to deny this opportunity to finish this bill and let the House \nat least look at it, thinking they will not be able to get their \namendments in.\n  We haven't had an opportunity to get amendments in for a long time. I \nalways hasten to say this because how long has it been now. It has been \n6 weeks since we passed this out of our committee and it passed \nunanimously--every Democrat and every Republican. I have to say the \nRepublicans on the committee I chair are among the most conservative \nRepublicans and the Democrats are among the most liberal Democrats. \nThat is a holdover from when the Democrats had control of the Senate, \nand the Environment and Public Works Committee was chaired by my \ncolleague, who refers to herself as a very proud progressive, which \nmeans liberal, and I am a very proud conservative. So we all have this \nin common.\n  Just to have this opportunity to have this up so we can consider it, \nwe would have to move this up and get this vote today instead of \ntonight. So I am hoping that will still be the case. We are making our \ncase on that. Again, that would allow us to get this done in a way--or \nat least to let the House look at this and see whether it is an option \nthey may want to pursue. I know several have painted themselves into a \ncorner, but nonetheless we could do this if we can hurry this up.\n  I know there are other speakers on the floor, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from \nOklahoma for his great work on this legislation. He has been a fierce \nadvocate for transportation funding, for doing highway bills on more \nthan a short-term basis. As he has mentioned numerous times, since 2009 \nwe have had 33 short-term extensions--patches, if you will--which make \nit very difficult to run a highway program.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma has been, as I said, a fierce and \npersistent advocate that one of the responsibilities we have around \nhere is to make sure we are building the infrastructure in this country \nthat keeps our economy competitive, that allows people and freight to \nmove in an efficient way and to ensure our economy is strong and \nvibrant.\n  I can tell you, as someone who represents a rural State in the middle \nof the country, the supply chain we have between our highways and \nbridges, our railroads, our ports, is critically important for us to \nget our products, the things we raise and grow in South Dakota, to the \nmarketplace. Agriculture is our No. 1 industry. It drives our economy. \nIt is incredibly dependent upon transportation. So a strong, vibrant, \nrobust economy depends upon transportation.\n  Obviously, we want to have a system that is safe, and that is one of \nthe issues I want to speak to with regard to this bill as well. I \nappreciate the great work Senator Inhofe and his team, working with \nSenator Boxer, have done on this bill.\n  We are going to continue to debate this. I hope we can bring it to a \nclose. As the Senator from Oklahoma pointed out, if we did that, we \nwould have an opportunity to at least put it before the House and give \nthem a chance to act on it, whether they choose to or not. I would \ncertainly hope the House of Representatives would take a hard look at \nthis bill and consider taking it up and moving it because there has \nbeen a lot of work that has gone into it. We have a deadline ahead of \nus, and if we don't do this, we are going to be stuck with yet \nanother--the 34th--short-term extension, which just kicks the can down \nthe road and makes it more difficult for those who are in the position \nof having to make decisions about planning and designing our \ninfrastructure in this country to do that.\n  Obviously, there are a lot of people and a lot of jobs that depend \nupon the decisions that come out of Washington with regard to this \nbill. So I, too, encourage our colleagues in the Senate to move as \nquickly as we can to complete action on the Senate bill and to allow \nthe House of Representatives to take a chance at considering it and \nperhaps getting this issue resolved and a long-term bill in place.\n  These bills are nothing new in the Senate. The bill before us today \nis notable because it is the first Transportation bill, as I mentioned, \nin almost a decade to provide more than 2 years of funding for our \nNation's infrastructure needs. Since 2009, Congress has passed more \nthan 33 short-term funding extensions. That is an average of \napproximately five funding extensions a year. That is not a good way to \nmanage our Nation's infrastructure and it wastes an incredible amount \nof money.\n  Around the country, hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of \nthousands of jobs depend on funding contained in transportation bills. \nWhen Congress fails to provide the necessary certainty about the way \ntransportation funding is going to be allocated, States and local \ngovernments are left without the certainty they need to authorize \nprojects to make long-term plans for transportation infrastructure. \nThat means essential construction projects get deferred, necessary \nrepairs may not get made, and the jobs that depend on transportation \nare put in jeopardy.\n  My home State of South Dakota has been forced to defer important \nconstruction projects thanks to the lack of funding certainty. No \nindividual or business would start building a house or an office \nbuilding if it could only promise a contractor 3 months of funding. In \nthe same way, Congress can't expect a State to begin construction of a \nnew bridge or highway without the certainty that their project is going \nto be fully funded.\n  The highway bill before us--the DRIVE Act--reauthorizes \ntransportation programs for 6 years and provides 3 years of guaranteed \nfunding. All 3 years of funding have been paid for without raising the \ngas tax and without adding a dime to the deficit. This bill will give \nStates and local governments the certainty they need to plan\n\n[[Page S6054]]\n\nfor and commit to key infrastructure projects.\n  The bill will also help to strengthen our Nation's transportation \nsystem by increasing transparency in the allocation of transportation \ndollars, streamlining the permitting and environmental review processes \nand cutting redtape.\n  Mr. President, over the past few years of Democratic control, the \npublic has grown increasingly skeptical of Congress being able to \nfunction. When Republicans took the majority in January, we promised \nthe American people we would get the Senate working again, and we have \nbeen delivering on that promise.\n  This Transportation bill is another major legislative achievement and \nthe result of hard work by several committees that put together key \nprovisions to spur important infrastructure investment and safety \nimprovements. Republicans and Democrats alike got to make their voices \nheard in this process, and the resulting bill is stronger because of \nit.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I had the opportunity to work on the commerce section \nof the bill. Our focus was on enhancing the safety of our Nation's \ncars, trucks, and railroads, and the bill we produced makes key reforms \nthat will enhance transport safety around the country.\n  Over the past year, the commerce committee has spent a lot of time \nfocused on motor vehicle safety efforts. Last year was a record year \nfor auto problems, with more than 63 million vehicles recalled.\n  Two of the defects that have spurred recent auto recalls--the faulty \nGeneral Motors ignition switch and the defective airbag inflators from \nTakata--are responsible for numerous unnecessary deaths and injuries, \nat least 8 reported deaths in the case of Takata and more than 100 \ndeaths in the case of General Motors. Indications point to the Takata \nrecalls as being among the largest and most complex set of auto-related \nrecalls in our Nation's history, with more than 30 million cars \naffected.\n  Given the seriousness of these recalls, when it came time to draft \nthe highway bill, one of our priorities in the commerce committee was \naddressing auto safety issues and promoting greater consumer awareness \nand corporate responsibility. The commerce section of the DRIVE Act now \ntriples the civil penalties the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration can impose on automakers for a series of related safety \nviolations--from a cap of $35 million to a cap of $105 million--which \nshould provide a stronger deterrent against auto safety violations such \nas those that occurred in the case of the faulty ignition switches at \nGeneral Motors.\n  Our portion of the bill also improves notification methods to ensure \nthat consumers are made aware of recalls.\n  In the wake of the recall over the GM ignition switch defect, the \ninspector general at the Department of Transportation published a \nscathing report identifying serious lapses of the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, the government agency \nresponsible for overseeing safety in our Nation's cars and trucks.\n  The concerns raised included questions about the agency's ability to \nproperly identify and investigate safety problems--a concern that is \nfurther underscored, I might add, by the circumstances surrounding the \nTakata recalls.\n  In addition to targeting violations by automakers, our portion of the \nhighway bill also addresses the lapses at the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration identified in the inspector general's report.\n  In its typical fashion, the Obama administration claimed NHTSA's \nproblems could be solved by simply throwing more money at the agency, \nbut based on the expert testimony from the inspector general, it is \nclear money alone is not going to solve the problem. We need to ensure \nthat the agency fixes what is broken before we provide a significant \nincrease in funding authorization with taxpayer dollars.\n  Our bill makes additional funding increases for NHTSA's vehicle \nsafety efforts contingent on that agency's implementation of reforms \ncalled for by the inspector general, ensuring that this agency will be \nin a better position to address vehicle safety problems in the future.\n  I appreciate that NHTSA's current administration and Administrator \nhave pledged to implement all of these recommendations.\n  Another big focus of the commerce committee this year has been rail \nsafety. Nearly half of the commerce section of the DRIVE Act is made up \nof a bipartisan rail safety bill put together by the Republican junior \nSenator from Mississippi and the Democratic junior Senator from New \nJersey. Their work on important rail and Amtrak reform was almost ready \nfor a committee markup at the beginning of May, but after the tragic \ntrain derailment in Philadelphia, these two Senators opted to delay the \nmarkup and then added even more safety provisions to the bill they \ncrafted.\n  Their bill, which passed the committee with unanimous support from \ncommittee members of both parties, include provisions to strengthen our \nNation's rail infrastructure and smooths the way for the implementation \nof new safety technologies.\n  Our transportation infrastructure keeps our economy and our Nation \ngoing. Our Nation's farmers depend on our rail system to move their \ncrops to the market. Manufacturers rely on our Interstate Highway \nSystem to distribute their goods to stores across the United States. \nAll of us--all of us--depend on our Nation's roads and bridges to get \naround every single day. For too long, transportation has been the \nsubject of short-term legislation that leaves those responsible for \nbuilding and for maintaining our Nation's transportation system without \nthe certainty and the predictability they need to keep our roads and \nhighways thriving.\n  I am proud of the bill we have on the floor before us. I hope we can \npass this legislation as soon as possible and work with the House to \ndevelop a final bill that will allow us to fund our Nation's \ntransportation priorities on a long-term basis. We can't afford to \ncontinue this path we have been on of passing short-term extensions--33 \nalready in the last 5 years, more than 5 a year--and all the \nuncertainty that comes with that. That jeopardizes jobs across this \ncountry that are related to construction of these projects. It \njeopardizes the planning and engineering and design work that our \ndepartments of transportation across the country do, and it puts at \nrisk all of the transportation infrastructure that moves the freight, \nthat moves people across this country, which our economy depends on.\n  So I simply want to say that as a Member who represents a rural \nState, South Dakota--where we have 77,000 square miles, home to 800,000 \npeople--we depend heavily on roads and bridges to get to and from our \ndestinations. We have people who drive long distances to work. We have \npeople who come into our State every single year.\n  This time of the year we will have a million or so people descend \nupon a little town in South Dakota called Sturgis, which will be the \nplace where the annual motorcycle rally is hosted. We have people who \ncome by the thousands to our State every single year to visit the Black \nHills and Mount Rushmore. We depend upon a good, viable, robust \ntransportation system.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we are an agricultural economy which drives \nthe jobs in our State that keeps our Main Streets going. That \nagricultural economy depends upon getting those things we raise and \ngrow to the marketplace. That means good highways, railroads, ports--\nall the things that are essential to make sure our agricultural \nproducers can get the things they raise and grow to the places and \ndestinations they need to get to.\n  This is truly important work we are doing. I thank the Senator from \nOklahoma for his hard work. I certainly hope we can push this across \nthe finish line soon, so we will be able to present it to the House of \nRepresentatives, notwithstanding the statements that have been made \nthere. Perhaps they can look at this body of work and think, as we do, \nthat this gives us an opportunity to put something on the books, the \nlongest term bill we have had literally now in 10 years, and do \nsomething important for our economy and for jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S6055]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first, I appreciate the comments made by \nthe Senator from South Dakota, emphasizing what can't be done on short \nterms. I think we have been talking about that all morning.\n  Last week, 100 mayors from across the Nation wrote to the Senate \nleaders urging for a long-term transportation bill. They said, ``If the \nstatus quo continues, deficient transportation infrastructure will cost \nAmerican businesses $430 billion by 2020.''\n  Then there are the 31 construction and transportation groups that \nsent a harsh reminder to Congress that ``past extensions have not led \nto a lasting solution to the Highway Trust Fund's repeated revenue \nshortfalls.''\n  I remember because I have been around here for a while, and I have \nbeen through six of these transportation reauthorization bills. In the \ninterim, we always end up with short-term extensions. People don't \nrealize we can't do major projects with short-term extensions.\n  Now, I hear the argument sometimes that in this one we have a 6-year \nbill, but we are paying for only 3 years. That is fine. Make the \nargument. But there is something unique in the transportation system, \nwhich is that in the event we get through halfway--even though it is a \n6-year bill--and the funds are not available to the existing shortages \nof what we have added, then all projects stop. Not a penny can be \nspent. This isn't true anyplace else in our government, and I think \npeople have to realize that if we are going to do it.\n  When the Senator from Minnesota was talking and showing these very \ngraphic pictures of the bridge that collapsed killing 13 people, that \nreally sends something home. We can't wait until that happens before we \ndo the responsible thing.\n  I have to remind my conservative friends it is our constitutional \nduty. When we were sworn into office, we swore to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. The Constitution in article I, \nsection 8 tells us what we are supposed to be doing: We are supposed to \nbe defending America, including our bridges and roads. That is what we \nare supposed to be doing.\n  There is a way. I hope the people who--unless they just don't want to \ntake care of these big, serious problems and want to continue with the \nshort-term extensions, there is a way we can do this. We will be asking \nfor unanimous consent to go ahead and make a vote on what we are voting \non right now and considering. If all time has to expire, it would be 5 \na.m. tomorrow on the Inhofe substitute for the bill. That means we then \nwouldn't get around to having this bill passed until Thursday, and \nThursday would be after the House is gone. So it is over. That is it. \nThis would be a very easy thing to do.\n  Again, I am going to remind people that while we don't have the \nchance for amendments after this vote takes place, we can still have \nthe manager's amendment, where I personally will consider every one of \nthe amendments that comes forth. I am hoping that will happen.\n  That is what we are faced with right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6055-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, this Friday, July 31, the authorization \nfor the highway trust fund will expire and the fund itself will be \nnearly out of money. That means that unless Congress acts, projects in \nNew Hampshire and across the country will grind to an abrupt halt. In \nthe face of this, the House has passed yet another short-term, stopgap \nbill. The Senate is now debating and amending a long-term highway bill.\n  My clear preference is for a long-term bill. I think it would be a \nterrible mistake to pass yet another short-term extension without at \nthe same time taking action on a long-term bill like the Senate is \ncurrently doing. Only passing another short-term extension--which would \nbe the 34th since 2008--without taking steps toward a multiyear bill \nwould be kicking the can down the road, and in this case the road is \noverwhelmed by traffic, badly in need of modernization, and filled with \npatches and potholes. If you have driven around on the roads in the \nDistrict of Columbia, sometimes you wonder where you are because they \nare so bad, so filled with potholes. For a country that seeks to remain \ncompetitive in the 21st century, as we do in America, this is totally \ndysfunctional and destructive.\n  There are few more basic and necessary functions of government than \nproviding for modernized highways, bridges, and other transportation \ninfrastructure. Yet in Congress we have been grossly neglecting this \nresponsibility. China spends about 9 percent of gross domestic product \non infrastructure. Brazil spends about 8 percent. Even in Europe they \nare spending about 4 percent. But infrastructure spending in the United \nStates has fallen to just 2 percent of GDP.\n  Our highways and bridges face an $800 billion backlog of investment \nneeds, including nearly half a trillion dollars in critical repair \nwork. Americans spend a staggering 5.5 billion hours stuck in traffic \neach year. Yet in early May we saw a budget pass out of this Congress \nsupported by the majority party that slashed Federal funding for \ntransportation by 40 percent over the next decade.\n  I am especially concerned about disrepair and decay among our \nNation's bridges. That is why I filed an amendment which is a bill I \nhave introduced in previous Congresses called the SAFE Bridges Act. The \nFederal Highway Administration has identified more than 145,000--\n145,000--structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges. That \nis more than 20 percent of all the bridges in the United States. In New \nHampshire it is actually a higher percentage.\n  In May, I went with the mayor and city manager of Concord--New \nHampshire's State capital--to inspect the rusted-out and now-closed \nSewalls Falls Bridge, which is one of the three critical bridges in \nConcord across the Merrimack River. I worked very hard with the city--\nour office did--to get necessary approvals from the U.S. Department of \nTransportation to replace this bridge. In fact, it is a replacement \nproject that started back in 1994. The city of Concord lined up all the \npermits and approvals--and then nothing. Because of uncertainty about \nFederal funding for the project, it was stopped dead in its tracks.\n  My amendment, the SAFE Bridges Act, would authorize an additional $2 \nbillion annually for the next 3 years to enable States to repair and \nreplace their structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges. \nStates would get funding based on their share of deficient bridges \nnationwide, and the additional funding is fully paid for by closing a \ncorporate tax loophole.\n  As the Senate continues to debate the Transportation bill, I hope we \ndo get an opportunity to vote on relevant amendments like my SAFE \nBridges Act.\n  The neglect of our transportation infrastructure is creating \ncongestion and gridlock on our roads. It is hurting our economy and our \nglobal competitiveness. It is also killing jobs--especially in the \nconstruction trades, where employment has yet to recover from the great \nrecession.\n  According to a Duke University study, providing Federal funding to \nmeet the U.S. Department of Transportation's infrastructure requests \nwould create nearly 2.5 million new jobs. So our investment in this \nindustry, which is one of the slowest recovering from the recession, \nwould create millions of new jobs.\n  Several months ago, I joined in a bipartisan group of eight Senators \nwho had previously served as Governors--Senators King, Rounds, Kaine, \nHoeven, Warner, Carper, Manchin, and myself. We sent a letter to our \nSenate colleagues urging that we commit to fully funding national \ninfrastructure priorities and that we put a stop to the dysfunctional \nshort-term fixes that have become routine in recent years.\n\n[[Page S6056]]\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer appreciates that it was a visionary \nRepublican President, Dwight Eisenhower, who championed the Interstate \nHighway System in this country. The National Interstate and Defense \nHighways Act of 1956--I think it is critical to think about the title \nof that bill which was not just about commerce, but it was also about \ndefense. It was about the security of our country. It ensured dedicated \nFederal funding to build a network that today encompasses more than \n46,000 miles of roadways. That system has transformed our economy and \ncreated countless millions of jobs, but it is now six decades old. Its \ndedicated funding mechanism, the highway trust fund, is chronically \nunderfunded and just days from becoming insolvent. It is time for \nCongress to come together on a bipartisan basis to break the cycle of \npatchwork fixes.\n\n  The bill before us is not perfect. There are a number of provisions \nincluded that I don't agree with, if I had been writing the bill, but \nit is a compromise measure, and it was ably negotiated by the \nleadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nInhofe and Senator Boxer, along with numerous others in this body.\n  We have the opportunity to pass a 6-year authorization bill with 3 \nyears of funding. Yet what is happening in the House today? The House \nis passing another short-term extension. They are getting ready to \nleave town. They are not even going to stay and take up the long-term \nbill that is going to come out of the Senate. They are going to give us \nanother short-term bill that is going to leave States such as New \nHampshire up in the air, with thousands of people who are not sure if \nthey are going to have a job next week when the money runs out, who \naren't sure what the future is going to hold, companies that can't plan \nbecause they don't know if we have a long-term highway funding bill.\n  It is now time for Congress to pass a fully funded, multiyear highway \nbill that will allow governments at all levels to plan long-term \ncapital investment projects and to build a 21st-century transportation \nsystem that meets the needs of our 21st-century economy.\n  I hope that we in the Senate will be able to pass this bill and that \nour House colleagues will recognize they need to stay here and get this \nwork done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Keystone Pipeline and Oil Sanctions on Iran\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am here to speak about energy, both \nlower cost energy and who is going to supply it.\n  One might say: Why today? Well, because sources tell me that after \nalmost 7 years, President Obama is going to turn down the Keystone \nPipeline project--7 years. This is an application that was filed by the \nTransCanada company in September 2008. So here we are in year 6, and in \nSeptember it will be 7 years that the application has been pending. The \nadministration has still not made a decision--defeat through delay. So \nthe question is, Why then is he going to turn down the project now? It \nis because he will wait until Congress is out of session in August. \nThen he will turn down the project while Congress is not in session to \nhave less pushback, less criticism, of his decision if he makes it \nunder the radar. That timing is understandable because he is making a \npolitical decision rather than a decision based on the merits.\n\n  As we know, Congress overwhelmingly supports the project. The House \noverwhelmingly passed approval of the Keystone Pipeline project. In the \nSenate, we had 62 votes in favor of the measure. We were actually \nmissing some of our Members or we would have had 63, but there was \nstrong overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and the \nSenate. We sent the bill to the President and he vetoed it, but he \nstill has not made a decision. He vetoed it saying it was up to him to \nmake a decision, not the Congress. Congress went on record \noverwhelmingly in support of the project. Congress approved the \nproject, but he vetoed the bill.\n  It is the President's decision to make. Now we hear he is going to \nmake it and turn down the project, but the Congress overwhelmingly \nsupports it. The States on the Keystone Pipeline route overwhelmingly \nsupport it. There are six States on the route and every single State \nhas approved the project: Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, \nOklahoma, and Texas. They all approved the project. Congress supports \nit, the States support it, but most importantly the American people \nsupport it. In poll after poll, the American people have overwhelmingly \nshown support for the project--65 to 70 percent--strong, overwhelming \nsupport for the project.\n  Why do they support it? This is what it is all about: the merits of \nthe project. They support it on the merits because it means more energy \nfor this country that is produced in this country, in Canada, in my \nhome State of North Dakota, and in Montana. There are 830,000 barrels \nof oil a day produced in Canada and the United States that can be \nrefined in our refineries and can be used right here, rather than \ngetting it from some other country such as OPEC, Russia, Venezuela, you \nname it. It is energy we produce here at home. First and foremost, \nAmericans support it because they want our energy produced at home. \nThey want us to be energy secure. It is about jobs. It is about jobs.\n  This is a multibillion-dollar investment that creates good \nconstruction jobs. It is about economic growth, growing our economy \nhere at home, working with our closest friend and ally, Canada. It is \nalso about national security through energy security--not having to \ndepend on the Middle East or OPEC for our energy. It doesn't cost the \nFederal Government a penny--not a penny. This is, as I say, a \nmultibillion-dollar project that is completely built with private \ninvestment that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in \nlocal, State, and Federal tax revenue. It would not cost the Federal \nGovernment one penny, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncash revenues at the local, State, and Federal levels.\n  But maybe the greatest irony of all is this: At the same time the \nPresident is making it harder to produce energy here at home in our \ncountry and get energy from our closest friend and ally Canada, he \nwants to make it easier to produce oil in Iran. Think about that. Right \nnow the President is pressing Congress to approve an agreement with \nIran that would remove the sanctions on oil production and exports in \nIran. Under the proposed agreement that the President has submitted to \nthis Congress, he includes releasing the U.S. sanctions put in place by \nCongress that limit and restrict Iran's ability to produce and export \noil. These include energy sanctions that limit Iran's sale of crude \noil, which was specifically passed by Congress. Also, he wants to \nremove the sanctions on investment in Iran's oil, gas, petrochemical, \nand automotive sectors--again, sanctions passed by Congress. He wants \nto remove sanctions on the energy sector equipment and gasoline \nsanctions that were passed by Congress. In essence, what the President \nis doing is allowing Iran to export its oil, he is allowing investment \nto help them produce more oil, and he is allowing the export to Iran of \ntechnology that will help them produce more oil and gas. At the same \ntime, by turning down Keystone, the President is making it harder for \nus to produce and transport oil and gas in our country and work with \nour strongest ally, Canada. So what is the net effect of that? The net \neffect of that is it helps put OPEC back in the driver's seat.\n  If you don't believe me, let's just take a look at the numbers. The \nnumbers don't lie. Prior to 2012, before we put the Kirk-Menendez \ncongressional sanctions in place as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act at the end of 2011, during that year, at that time in \n2011, Iran was producing 2.6 million barrels of oil a day. By 2013,\n\n[[Page S6057]]\n\nafter the Kirk-Menendez sanctions had been in effect, Iran was down to \nexporting only 1.1 million barrels a day. Iran had gone from 2.6 \nmillion barrels a day down to 1.1 million barrels a day of oil they \nwere producing, exporting, and getting paid for. We cut that by more \nthan half.\n  My State of North Dakota alone produces 1.2 million barrels a day. \nThat is more than Iran is exporting right now, but if all these \nsanctions come off, Iran gets to go back up to that 2.6 million and \nbeyond. One million barrels at $50 a barrel is $50 million a day. One \ncan see this means hundreds of millions and billions of dollars to \nIran. This is certainly something to think about, going from 2.6 \nmillion barrels a day and having put sanctions in place, knocking it \ndown to 1.1 million barrels--and that is with exceptions the President \nhas allowed to the sanctions. That is without the sanctions being fully \nimplemented. It shows that the sanctions are very effective. It also \nshows that if we release them, Iran will get incredible amounts of \nmoney--not only dollars that have been held from them, but dollars they \nare going to generate every day from increased oil production.\n  So the President wants us to relieve these sanctions at the same time \nhe, in essence, impedes our oil and our growth in energy development in \nthis country.\n  The simple question I have is, How does that make sense? How does \nthat make sense? How do we get into a situation where we are enabling \nIran to produce more oil, but the U.S. produces less? That makes no \nsense, but that is the impact of the President's decision.\n  The President will make an argument that is based on environmental \nfactors. He will say he is making that decision for environmental \nreasons. He doesn't want the oil produced in Canada. He usually just \ndoesn't talk about the light sweet crude that is produced in the Bakken \narea of North Dakota and Montana, which is the lightest, sweetest crude \nI know of. He tries to make the argument that he doesn't like oil that \nis produced in Canada for environmental reasons.\n  Remember I said this has been pending now for almost 7 years. We are \nin year 6. In the President's own Department of State, the \nenvironmental impact statement says the Keystone will have no \nsignificant environmental impact. It will be interesting to see when \nCongress is out of session--in August when the President turns this \ndown, trying to get under the radar--what he has to say about how he is \ngoing to address the State Department's clear environmental impact \nstatement, finding no significant environmental impact, but we will see \nwhat it is. At the same time, the President will work to convince \nAmericans that all sanctions should be lifted from Iran so they can \nproduce more oil and bring more money into their country.\n  There is an old saying. Essentially it goes like this: Those who fail \nto heed the lessons of history are destined to repeat them. President \nObama is not breaking our dependence on foreign oil, he is reinstating \nit. The President is not strengthening our energy future, he is \nweakening it, and I urge him to reconsider.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, every day it seems as though Americans \nare hearing more and more news about how badly ObamaCare is failing. \nSome of the latest headlines have had to do with just how expensive \nhealth insurance is going to be next year under the President's health \ncare law. The price increases that are being reported are truly \nstaggering. Insurance companies are planning to raise rates 20 percent, \n30 percent, even 40 percent on some of their plans, and they say it is \nbecause of the health care law.\n  The New York Times had an article just a couple of weeks ago. It \nquoted one lead advocate in the State of Oregon saying specifically \nthat some people may ``start wondering if insurance is affordable, or \nif it's worth the money.''\n  Well, a lot of Americans have been wondering if the entire health \ncare law is actually worth the money. Now, some Democrats have said \nthat these outrageous price increases will not affect everyone. Well, \nthey sure affect a lot of people. You know, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle say that the increases will not be as large as they \nare going to be, if you are willing to switch plans every year or if \nyou accept less access to doctors or even less access to medications.\n  Well, the argument makes the same mistake that President Obama made \nfrom the beginning about the health care law, and it confuses coverage \nwith actual care. In Connecticut, some insurance companies say they \nhave come up with ways to slow down the increase in their premiums. \nWhat they are doing is they are actually cutting access to care. One \ncompany decided that it could save some money by reducing the use of \nspecialty drugs. So some people who have this insurance may not be \ngetting the drugs they used to get.\n  Another company in Connecticut decided that it could charge a little \nless by limiting the number of doctors that the patients could see. \nInstead of raising rates by 12.5 percent next year as they had planned, \nthey said the company will now just be raising rates 11.5 percent. That \nis the kind of situation that hard-working families are facing--higher \npremiums, less access to care.\n  These narrow networks of hospitals and doctors are not just hurting \npeople in Connecticut. They are turning up in ObamaCare plans all \nacross the country. There was a study that came out this month. It \nfound that plans offered through ObamaCare insurance exchanges across \nthe country covered 34 percent fewer doctors than the average plan sold \noutside the exchanges.\n  Now, it is even worse for some specialists. According to the report, \nexchange plans include 42 percent fewer oncology and cardiac \nspecialists. That is cancer doctors. That is heart doctors. So if you \nhave cancer or if you have a heart condition, there is a much lower \nchance that your doctor is covered by your ObamaCare insurance.\n  People are paying outrageously high premiums, copays, and \ndeductibles, and they are left with insurance coverage that may not \ncover their care. So a lot of people have decided they just cannot \nafford the Affordable Care Act. They would rather pay a tax penalty to \nthe IRS than spend hard-earned money on this limited and expensive \nObamaCare insurance. According to the IRS, last year 7.5 million hard-\nworking taxpayers paid that tax penalty. That is 1 out of 17 taxpayers. \nAnother 12 million people could not afford ObamaCare insurance or did \nnot want it, and they filed a form saying they should not have to pay \nthe penalty at all because it was unaffordable. There were only 6 \nmillion people who actually signed up for ObamaCare exchange plans last \nyear. Almost 20 million people rejected ObamaCare because it was too \nexpensive and it was not right for them and their families.\n  Now, President Obama has said repeatedly that the health care law is \nworking--he said even better than he expected. Is this what he is \ntalking about--even better than he expected? More Americans are \nrejecting ObamaCare than are signing up for it on the Federal exchange. \nIs that better than the President expected? Does President Obama think \nthat the Federal insurance exchange is working better than he expected?\n  There were headlines about this recently as well and how Washington \nhas failed to protect taxpayer dollars. The Government Accountability \nOffice set up a test of healthcare.gov, the President's Web site, the \none that failed so miserably. What they did is they created 12 \nfraudulent applications in order to see if they could actually get \nhealth insurance subsidies using fraudulent applications, and 11 of \nthose 12 phony applications were approved last year. Now, here we are a \nyear later. It turns out that the Washington bureaucrats--you cannot \nbelieve it--reviewed these policies and renewed the taxpayer-funded \nsubsidies for all 11 of these phony applicants. Some of them even\n\n[[Page S6058]]\n\ngot higher subsidies this year than they did last year.\n  So what does the Government Accountability Office say about it? Well, \nthe chief investigator looked at it. He said: There still appears to be \nno system in place--no system in place--to catch missing or fabricated \ndocumentation. It is incredible and it is disturbing, and it is no \nsurprise that taxpayers are offended.\n  Finally, we are also seeing more news about one of the taxes that the \nDemocrats included in their health care law. There was a headline in \nthe New York Times last Wednesday: ``Concern Grows on Health Tax.'' \nThat was on Wednesday, July 22, first page of the business section. \n``Concern Grows on Health Tax.'' Now, this is about the new 40-percent \ntax on so-called Cadillac health insurance plans. These are the plans \nthat employers offer to their workers. These are the plans that \nWashington says are too generous.\n  The article tells the story of Kurt Gallow, who works at a paper mill \nin Longview, WA. When you follow over, it says: Concern grows over \nexcise tax's effect on health care plans. There are a number of people \nworking and talking at this location in Longview, WA. But the story of \nKurt is also about his wife, Brenda. She has diabetes. The article says \nthat Kurt and Brenda are ``worrying about his company's proposed new \nhealth care plan, which would require workers to pay as much as $6,000 \ntoward their family's medical bills.''\n  Now, that is a huge amount of money for anyone. But it is a huge \namount of money for some of these very hard-working families. Now, \nthese are changes that their employer has to make because of the \nPresident's health care law. You know what. This is not even an \nObamaCare plan. This is not something they are buying through the \nexchange. These are people who get their insurance through work. Now, \nPresident Obama said that if you get your insurance through your job, \n``nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the \ncoverage or the doctor you have.''\n  Well, millions of Americans across the country are finding out that \nwas just one more expensive broken promise made by the President. \nObamaCare continues to be a complicated and costly mess. Republicans \nhave offered good ideas about how to lower health care costs, how to \nimprove access, and how to help Americans lead healthier lives. We all \nhave ideas that will get rid of some of the ridiculous Washington-\nimposed mandates that are driving up costs and forcing so many \nAmericans to go without insurance and certainly without care.\n  Six years ago, the American people were unhappy with health care in \nthis country. They did not think the solution was higher prices, less \naccess to care, and higher taxes as well. The American people are not \nsatisfied with these constant headlines about all of the problems with \nthe President's health care law.\n  Congress should not be satisfied with the current state of health \ncare in this country either or with the disastrous side effects of the \nPresident's health care law. It is time for the President to admit the \nhealth care law is causing pain and problems all across the country. It \nis time to start anew, to give people the care they need from a doctor \nthey choose at lower costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we all know the Chamber is engaged in the \npassage of a multiyear highway bill--not just highways, but this deals \nwith mass transit, transportation infrastructure in general. To me, the \nmost important thing about what we are doing is the fact we are not \ngoing to do another temporary patch--which we have done, I am told, 33 \ntimes--but we actually are going to pass a 3-year highway bill.\n  To me, the best news, I would say to the Presiding Officer, is now it \nlooks as if we have the House thoroughly engaged, so it is not just a \nquestion of this bill or nothing. Perhaps, if experience is any guide, \nwe can come up with something even better by collaborating with our \nHouse colleagues.\n  I wanted to come to the floor and talk a little bit about the impact \nof this bill on my State, the State of Texas, because we are a fast-\ngrowing State. We have about 27 million people there now. People are \nmoving from around the country to Texas because our economy is growing. \nLast year, our economy grew at the rate of 5.2 percent. To compare that \nto the Nation, last year the Nation's economy grew at 2.2 percent. What \ndoes that mean? That means there are a lot more jobs and a lot more \nopportunities, so people are literally voting with their feet, leaving \nthe States where there are limited opportunities and coming to States \nsuch as Texas where there are more opportunities. But that means more \ncongestion, more traffic, and more challenges when it comes to our \nroadways, our rural freight routes, and it means challenges for our \neconomy.\n  Many States, of course, would be delighted to have the problems we \nare having because, frankly, people are moving away from many States, \nnot to many States. I know the Presiding Officer's State of Oklahoma is \nexperiencing economic growth and job growth too because we share a \ncommon interest and sector of our economy, the energy economy, which \nthe rest of the country would do well to learn from the examples in \nOklahoma and Texas as part of our economic success story.\n  As others have mentioned, one of the chief reasons this bill has so \nmuch enthusiasm behind it is because it gives freedom and flexibility \nto the States to plan for infrastructure needs in the future. It \nperhaps should go without saying, but a 6-month patch, if we were to \nkick this over until December, doesn't give anybody any certainty to \nplan these long-term infrastructure projects which take literally not \nmonths but years.\n  As I said, for a State such as Texas that is growing rapidly--by some \nestimates 600 people a day are moving to the State--improving our \nroadways and bridges is vitally important for the continued growth of \nour economy and increased prosperity for our people, and we have the \npractical challenge of handling a growing number of cars and trucks on \nour roads. One way this bill gives added freedom and flexibility to the \nStates is through a provision that would help Texas and other border \nStates meet their growing infrastructure needs, particularly at the \nsouthern border, with improvements that are not only necessary to get \nus and goods from point A to point B, but to keep us safe as well.\n  Frequently, when we talk about the border, we talk about border \nsecurity. That is a very important consideration and, frankly, we have \nnot committed the Federal resources we should to border security to \nmake sure we know who is coming into the country and why they are here. \nOf course, we know that recently, even in the news, people have \ncontinued to penetrate our border, even those with criminal records, \ncausing havoc and, indeed, committing crimes against innocent people \nsuch as occurred recently in the terrible incident that happened in San \nFrancisco.\n  Our border, border infrastructure, and border security are the front \nlines of our defense, to keep our people safe, to regulate who comes \ninto the country, and to make sure that only legitimate people can \nenter.\n  The question is--as one law professor recently testified before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, when it comes to immigration, there is \nreally only one question: Are you going to have controlled immigration \nor uncontrolled immigration? It is basically that simple.\n  I am on the floor to talk about transportation and the importance of \nthis bill in terms of the border infrastructure when it comes to trade \nand commerce, but as I mentioned, it also is an important frontline \nwhen it comes to the safety and security of the American people.\n  We are fortunate in Texas to be the top exporting State in the \nNation. That is one of the reasons our economy has grown faster than \nthe rest of the country. The agricultural products that are grown \nthere, the livestock that is raised, and the manufactured goods that \nare made are exported to markets all around the world, which creates \ngood jobs, well-paying jobs at home.\n\n[[Page S6059]]\n\n  It also takes good infrastructure to move more than $100 billion in \nexported goods from Texas to Mexico each year, supporting hundreds of \nthousands of jobs in Texas alone. It is estimated, when you look at the \nNation as a whole, that binational trade between Mexico and the United \nStates supports as many as 6 million American jobs. That is something \nwe frequently overlook when we talk about our relationship with our \nneighbor south of the border and immigration, and that is there are \nmany benefits to legal trade, traffic, controlled legal immigration, \nand, indeed, as I mentioned, $100 billion of exported goods from Texas \nto Mexico each year supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  In this bill, by allowing Texas and other border States more \nflexibility in long-term planning of border projects, consumers and \nworkers can benefit as goods are shipped more efficiently back and \nforth. Our border infrastructure is essential to moving massive amounts \nof trade, which travel through our ports of entry every day. For Texas \nand the United States to remain competitive, the border region must \nhave the quality infrastructure to truck, train, and ship billions of \ndollars' worth of goods efficiently and safely.\n  Doing nothing to invest in transportation at the border is not a \nviable option. A recent report from the Texas State Legislature found \nthat $116 million in U.S. economic output is lost or forfeited every \nsingle minute. The trucks sit idle at the border with Mexico. They are \nliterally frozen in place because they are bottlenecked because of \narchaic, antiquated infrastructure and lack of appropriate staffing at \nthe border.\n  Infrastructure on the border also plays another important role, \npreventing things such as illicit drugs and merchandise from entering \nthe country. In many respects, as I said, our border crossings, the \ntechnology employed there, and the professionals who work there--they \nare the first line of defense against bad actors who want to get into \nthe country illegally or get contraband goods through our ports.\n  In Texas, better roads and bridges at the border region mean better \neconomic opportunity and quality of life for our growing border \ncommunities. Fortunately, the border infrastructure provision in this \nhighway bill would give the Governor in Texas and all other border \nStates the freedom to assess the biggest transportation problems facing \nthose States and would also provide essential tools to address them.\n  By dedicating funds to invest in border infrastructure projects at \nthe discretion of State Governors, we can make sure our States have the \nresources they need to enhance trade and travel and to keep us safe at \nthe same time.\n  This is not, of course, a new notion. Throughout my time in the \nSenate, I have worked with folks in Texas and elsewhere, people on both \nsides of the aisle and on both ends of the Capitol, to try to find ways \nto facilitate greater levels of legitimate commerce and travel at our \nNation's ports of entry and throughout the border region.\n  I am thankful for making this progress in this legislation. I commend \nmy Texas colleagues--Congressmen Will Hurd and Henry Cuellar, among \nothers--for working with us and for introducing similar legislation on \nborder infrastructure in their Chamber. Hopefully, as we now move from \na Senate bill to a House bill that can then be reconciled in a \nconference committee, these important improvements will be retained and \nbe part of a conference report.\n  The bottom line is that quality infrastructure and making sure our \nborder is safe and effective is a bipartisan, bicameral issue, and one \nthat clearly unites people in my State and across the border region of \nour southern States.\n  I am thankful to see this provision included, and I hope it gets \npassed soon to give our States the opportunity to dedicate even more \nnecessary resources to the border.\n  This provision is an important example of the overall theme of this \nbill, giving the States a reliable way forward to plan for their long-\nterm infrastructure needs. More than anything else, I believe this \nlegislation is an investment in our future and the next generation.\n  I thank all of our colleagues for working with us to get this bill \nmoving forward. We have an important vote tomorrow morning, and then we \nhave another final passage vote, I believe, on Thursday. In the \nmeantime, the House is going to send us a 3-month bill, which will give \nus the necessary time for the House then to consider their own \ntransportation bill and then to get us to a conference where we can \nreconcile the differences.\n  As the Presiding Officer and I have discussed before in the past, if \nthat is any indication, that will give us even greater ability to \ninfluence the ultimate outcome in a way that improves this product in a \nbicameral and bipartisan sort of way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Planned Parenthood\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in recent weeks, the American people have \nlearned the shocking story of the barbaric practices Planned Parenthood \nuses to terminate life and to harvest organs of innocent human life. In \na video released earlier this month that has gone viral--as it should \nhave--the senior director of medical research at Planned Parenthood \nexplained the process by which she harvests aborted body parts to be \nprovided for medical research. I quote her:\n\n       We've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because \n     we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm gonna \n     basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm gonna \n     to see if I can get it all intact.\n\n  Additional videos have been released--I am told more are to come--\nwith Planned Parenthood officials discussing the organ harvesting of \nfetuses. Unborn children. Beating hearts on the sonogram, on the \nscreen. Human beings.\n  Despite the stunning impact and outrage of millions of Americans, \nPlanned Parenthood's response to the release of these videos is this: \nBlame the messenger or the videographer, but let's not address the \npractice of harvesting aborted body parts.\n  Ross Douthat writes for the New York Times. I urge every Senator to \nread his July 25, 2015, column, entitled ``Looking Away From \nAbortion.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 25, 2015]\n\n                       Looking Away From Abortion\n\n                           (By Ross Douthat)\n\n       In an essay in his 1976 collection, ``Mortal Lessons,'' the \n     physician Richard Selzer describes a strange suburban scene. \n     People go outside in the morning in his neighborhood, after \n     the garbage trucks have passed, and find ``a foreignness upon \n     the pavement,'' a softness underfoot.\n       Looking down, Selzer first thinks he sees oversize baby \n     birds, then rubber baby dolls, until the realization comes \n     that the street is littered with the tiny, naked, all-too-\n     human bodies of aborted fetuses.\n       Later, the local hospital director speaks to Selzer, trying \n     to impose order on the grisly scene. It was an accident, of \n     course: The tiny corpses were accidentally ``mixed up with \n     the other debris'' instead of being incinerated or interred. \n     ``It is not an everyday occurrence. Once in a lifetime, he \n     says.''\n       And Selzer tries to nod along: ``Now you see. It is \n     orderly. It is sensible. The world is not mad. This is still \n     a civilized society . . .\n       ``But just this once, you know it isn't. You saw, and you \n     know.''\n       Resolute abortion rights supporters would dismiss that \n     claim of knowledge. Death and viscera are never pretty, they \n     would say, but something can be disgusting without being \n     barbaric. Just because it's awful to discover fetuses \n     underfoot doesn't mean the unborn have a right to life.\n       And it's precisely this argument that's been marshaled \n     lately in response to a new reminder of the fleshly realities \n     of abortion: The conversations, videotaped covertly by pro-\n     life activists posing as fetal organ buyers, in which \n     officials from Planned Parenthood cheerfully discuss the \n     procedures for extracting those organs intact during an \n     abortion and the prices they command.\n       It may be disturbing to hear those procedures described: \n     ``. . . we've been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, \n     because we know that, so I'm not gonna crush that part, I'm \n     gonna basically crush below, I'm gonna crush above, and I'm \n     gonna see if I can get it all intact.''\n\n[[Page S6060]]\n\n       It may be unseemly to hear a Planned Parenthood official \n     haggle over pricing for those organs: ``Let me just figure \n     out what others are getting, and if this is in the ballpark, \n     then it's fine, if it's still low, then we can bump it up. I \n     want a Lamborghini.''\n       But in the end, Planned Parenthood's defenders insist, \n     listening to an abortionist discuss manipulating the \n     ``calvarium'' (that is, the dying fetus's skull) so that it \n     emerges research-ready from the womb is fundamentally no \n     different than listening to a doctor discuss heart surgery or \n     organ transplants. It's unsettling, yes, but just because \n     it's gross doesn't prove it's wrong.\n       Which is true, but in this case not really true enough. \n     Because real knowledge isn't purely theoretical; it's the \n     fruit of experience, recognition, imagination, life itself.\n       And the problem these videos create for Planned Parenthood \n     isn't just a generalized queasiness at surgery and blood.\n       It's a very specific disgust, informed by reason and \n     experience--the reasoning that notes that it's precisely a \n     fetus's humanity that makes its organs valuable, and the \n     experience of recognizing one's own children, on the \n     ultrasound monitor and after, as something more than just \n     ``products of conception'' or tissue for the knife.\n       That's why Planned Parenthood's apologists have fallen back \n     on complaints about ``deceptive editing'' (though full videos \n     were released in both cases), or else simply asked people to \n     look away. And it's why many of my colleagues in the press \n     seem uncomfortable reporting on the actual content of the \n     videos.\n       Because dwelling on that content gets you uncomfortably \n     close to Selzer's tipping point--that moment when you start \n     pondering the possibility that an institution at the heart of \n     respectable liberal society is dedicated to a practice that \n     deserves to be called barbarism.\n       That's a hard thing to accept. It's part of why so many \n     people hover in the conflicted borderlands of the pro-choice \n     side. They don't like abortion, they think its critics have a \n     point . . . but to actively join our side would require \n     passing too comprehensive a judgment on their coalition, \n     their country, their friends, their very selves.\n       This reluctance is a human universal. It's why white \n     Southerners long preferred Lost Cause mythology to \n     slaveholding realities. It's why patriotic Americans rarely \n     want to dwell too long on My Lai or Manzanar or Nagasaki. \n     It's why, like many conservatives, I was loath to engage with \n     the reality of torture in Bush-era interrogation programs.\n       But the reluctance to look closely doesn't change the truth \n     of what there is to see. Those were dead human beings on \n     Richard Selzer's street 40 years ago, and these are dead \n     human beings being discussed on video today: Human beings \n     that the nice, idealistic medical personnel at Planned \n     Parenthood have spent their careers crushing, evacuating, and \n     carving up for parts.\n       The pro-life sting was sweeping; there are reportedly 10 \n     videos to go. You can turn away. But there will be plenty of \n     chances to look, to see, to know.\n  Mr. COATS. I will share a couple of excerpts from his piece.\n  Writing in the New York Times, Ross Douthat says:\n\n       And the problem these videos create for Planned Parenthood \n     isn't just a generalized queasiness at surgery and blood. \n     It's a very specific disgust, informed by reason and \n     experience--the reasoning that notes that it's precisely a \n     fetus's humanity that makes its organs valuable, and the \n     experience of recognizing one's own children, on the \n     ultrasound monitor and after, as something more than just \n     ``products of conception'' or tissue for the knife.\n\n  For those who defend the role of Planned Parenthood, Douthat writes \nthat reflecting on the content of these videos ``gets you uncomfortably \nclose to . . . that moment when you start pondering the possibility \nthat an institution at the heart of respectable liberal society is \ndedicated to a practice that deserves to be called barbarism.''\n  I wish to repeat that again. He writes about the barbarity of what \nhas taken place here and the videos of the response of Planned \nParenthood--the description of what actually is happening to a child on \nthe way to birth, seen in the ultrasound, hearing the beating of the \nheart, and then talking about the methods used so that certain parts of \nthat body are not crushed and so that other parts of the body can be \nharvested for other purposes and sold--sold for money. That this is \npart of what Planned Parenthood is all about is just stunning.\n  Douthat said that even though people want to ignore it, even though \nthey want to talk about it and blame the videographer--that he took \nthings out of context--how can you take what is said and happened out \nof context and provide any rationale or justification for what is being \ndone?\n  He said: But surely that is the moment when you start to ponder the \npossibility that an institution at the heart of respectable liberal \nsociety is actually dedicated to a practice that deserves to be called \nbarbarism. That is a hard thing to accept, he said.\n  But, as difficult as that is, Douthat states that we must acknowledge \nthat what is being discussed in these videos is human beings, and the \nnice, idealistic medical personnel at Planned Parenthood have spent \ntheir careers crushing, evacuating, and carving up that human life for \nparts to be sold on the market.\n  It is important that this body let Planned Parenthood know the \nAmerican people do not support these inhumane practices. Congress \nshould debate this issue. It should vote. It should vote soon. It \nshould not leave here for our August recess until we send a clear \nmessage to Planned Parenthood that this is totally unacceptable, that \nthe taxpayers of America will not fund with 1 cent of their tax dollars \nthis barbaric practice, provided through an agency that pretends to be \noffering sound health care advice to pregnant mothers. Every Senator \nshould have the opportunity to affirm that life is sacred and a \nprecious gift, and it must be protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Supreme Court Decisions\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to give my analysis \nof the last year of Supreme Court decisions. There is a misconception \nthat our Supreme Court is conservative, but in the term that just \nended, the Supreme Court upheld a key provision of ObamaCare. It read \nthe plain language of that ObamaCare statute that provided that health \ninsurance subsidies apply only to exchanges established by the States \nand said that they are available on exchanges created by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  It ruled that fair housing discrimination cases can be brought even \nwhere there is no intent to discriminate. A harmful impact, then, is \nenough to bring a case.\n  It found that same-sex marriages are constitutionally required.\n  It expanded the reach of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act and made it \neasier to win cases under that law.\n  The Court decided that racial gerrymandering cases under section 5 of \nthe Voting Rights Act must consider the effect on individual districts \nregardless of minority voting in the State as a whole. The Court said \nas well that in those cases, courts must look beyond the numbers when \ndeciding whether minority voters have been packed into districts to \ndilute their influence on elections.\n  In fact, the Court reflected a very liberal bent in the last term. \nMore worrisome, its liberalism derives not from the Constitution but \nthe policy preferences of the Justices. Application of longstanding \npolitical science models shows that this year's Supreme Court rulings \nwere the most liberal since the Warren Court years of the 1960s. As a \nUCLA professor stated, ``Shockingly, the Supreme Court may have been \nmore liberal than the Obama Administration this term.''\n  The liberal Justices and the conservative Justices on the Supreme \nCourt judge differently, and that is what I want to show to my \ncolleagues. The conservative Justices acted as umpires, for the most \npart. They considered the facts and the law and decided the cases as \nthey understood the Constitution. The liberal Justices prevailed so \nfrequently because Justice Kennedy, Chief Justice Roberts, and--at \nleast one time--Justice Thomas each voted with the liberals in at least \ntwo close, significant cases. As a University of Michigan professor \ncommented, ``The chief justice really does take restraint seriously. At \ntimes, that is going to put a justice in contraposition to what his \nideological preferences might be.''\n  By contrast, looking at the other end of the spectrum, there are no \nclose cases in which even a single liberal Justice voted with \nconservative Justices to make a majority. Only two of the major cases \nwere decided 5 to 4 in a conservative direction.\n  The New York Times identified the 10 most important cases of the \nterm. The Washington Post selected 13 cases.\n\n[[Page S6061]]\n\nWhichever list is consulted, liberal results predominated. In each of \nthe cases, the four liberal Justices voted as a bloc for a--as you \nmight expect--liberal result. I want to show why this isn't a \ncoincidence. The liberal Justices act like players on the same team. \nLiberal Justices have actually admitted that they strategize in advance \nto vote as a bloc in support of liberal outcomes. Justice Ginsburg \nstated this last year: ``We have made a concerted effort to speak with \none voice in important cases.'' I fear that this attitude and the votes \nof these Justices give rise to an appearance that their loyalties are \nto each other and to their preferred principles and policies rather \nthan to the Constitution. Certainly, it is easier to make cases come \nout the way you want than to carefully consider the facts, precedent, \ntext, and the arguments of the parties before reaching a decision that \nmight run counter to your preferred outcome. And for those Justices, it \nis easier to do so if you know you have four votes in your pocket \nbefore you begin the task.\n  We accept the important role the Supreme Court plays in our \nconstitutional system. The Constitution trumps the inconsistent policy \nchoices of the American people enacted through their elected \nrepresentatives. That is what we call the rule of law. But when \nJustices strike down laws based not on the Constitution but on their \nown policy preferences, that is the rule of judges. The Court in that \ninstance acts as a superlegislature. Those rulings should, therefore, \nbe questioned. At my town meeting Saturday in Iowa, they were being \nquestioned. The Justices' personal policy views are entitled to no more \nrespect than the policy views of the American people.\n  When Supreme Court nominees come before the Judiciary Committee for \nconfirmation, they know better than to say they will enforce their own \nviews. They don't say the Constitution is a living document with a \nmeaning that changes over time. They know they wouldn't be confirmed if \nthat is what they said. Instead, they say the text controls or if the \ntext is unclear, the structure and the original intent of the Founders \ngovern. They say constitutional interpretation is not about politics or \ngood policy; they tell us it is ``law all the way down.'' But when they \nget on the bench, all bets seem to be off.\n  For instance, the text of the Constitution allows the government to \ndeprive people of life if due process of law is provided. It makes \nreferences to capital--or death penalty--cases. It is therefore clear \nthat the death penalty is constitutional. There may be some valid \nquestions on when the death penalty would be legal. Nonetheless, last \nmonth Justice Breyer and another Justice wrote that they think it is \nvery likely that the death penalty is unconstitutional in all cases--in \nother words, just throw out the words of the Constitution. That ought \nto be extremely disturbing to all of us. It is essentially a revival of \nthe Warren Court, where the Justices' personal views trump the \nConstitution.\n  The Court also ruled this year on same-sex marriage. I support \ntraditional marriage, as a sizable percentage of the American people \nstill do. However, I do respect people of different views. The \nConstitution says nothing about whether same-sex marriage is required. \nThat is for the people to decide through the democratic process. When \nthe Supreme Court ruled otherwise, that prompted a significant portion \nof the populace to believe that the Justices were reading their own \nview into the Constitution. The decision was based on a doctrine called \n``substantive due process.'' Substantive due process is really nothing \nmore than an open invitation to Justices to read their own policy views \ninto the Constitution.\n  This year, the Court ruled that the word ``liberty'' includes the \nright to define and express identity, individual autonomy, and dignity. \nWhere do you find those words in the Constitution? In the past, the \nCourt had narrowly construed substantive due process to protect only \nthose rights established in light of objective history and their deep \nroots in society. The majority effectively then overturned those rules.\n\n  The Court now thinks the meaning of the clause does not turn on the \ntext or the intentions of the Framers. Rather, the Court ruled that the \nmeaning of due process changes as ``we''--the Justices--apply, as they \nwould say, ``new insight'' that derives from, in their words, a \n``better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives \ndefine a liberty that remains urgent in our own era.''\n  In the view of the slim majority, the role of the Court is to make, \nin their words, ``new dimensions of freedom . . . apparent to new \ngenerations.''\n  This is the language of the doctrine of the living Constitution. It \nis the Justices, then, amending the Constitution without Congress and \nthe States voting to do so. It is another Earl Warren deciding cases by \nasking what is just and what is fair, and that is in his mind and not \nwhat the Constitution and the laws require.\n  It is not law at all, never mind ``law all the way down.''\n  While the decision permits those who hold the traditional view of \nmarriage to discuss their views, it said nothing about the real \nconstitutional right to freely exercise religion--with the emphasis \nupon ``exercise.''\n  Another of the Court's liberal decisions gave short shrift to another \nright protected by the Constitution: free speech. That decision treated \nas government speech what is actually private speech. It is an \nimportant distinction in the real world. Government must treat private \nspeech neutrally. It cannot play favorites, but the government can \ndiscriminate against viewpoints it does not like when the speech is the \ngovernment's speech. It can fund speech that discourages use of illegal \ndrugs, for instance, without funding speech that encourages drug use.\n  As a result of the First Amendment ruling, the government may be able \nto deny many kinds of government benefits to those who dare to express \nviews with which the government disagrees. This then would be an \nominous development for everyone.\n  Specifically, the government may be able to deny tax exemptions and \ncharitable deductions based on the free expression of the groups \ninvolved. That would make a scandal such as the IRS's denial of tax-\nexempt status to organizations based on their presumptive conservative \npolicy stands constitutionally permissible.\n  Substantive due process has been used for the last 50 years only to \ninvent new liberal constitutional rights. Conservatives have not used \nsubstantive due process to invent new conservative constitutional \nrights. In creating new such rights, liberal Justices never are \nhesitant to overturn conservative precedents, but those same Justices \nconsider the liberal substantive due process precedents to be \nsacrosanct under stare decisis. In other words, they are effectively \nsaying ``what is mine is mine and what is yours is negotiable.''\n  Conservatives issue legal rulings that produce liberal policy \neffects, but liberal Justices will not issue legal rulings that are \nconservative. So as I am trying to show to my colleagues, each side \nplays by different rules.\n  Is it any wonder that so many people in this country think the game \nis not on the level? A recent CNN poll--a media organization that no \none would say is rightwing--found that 37 percent of those surveyed \nthink the Court is too liberal. Only 20 percent characterized it as \nbeing too conservative. I am concerned about how that backlash could \nmanifest itself.\n  Even if Justices abuse their power of judicial review by substituting \ntheir policy views for the Constitution, we need judicial independence \nto safeguard the actual Constitution. We should not do anything to \nundermine judicial independence, but if the Court does not give the \npublic the confidence that the meaning of ``liberty'' in the due \nprocess clause means something other than the policy preferences of \nfive Justices, the consequences could be serious for our constitutional \norder.\n  The Supreme Court, similar to a river flooding its banks, is not \nstaying within its proper channel. I strongly encourage all Justices of \nthe Court to exercise the self-restraint the Constitution demands and \nthat its Framers anticipated.\n  Ultimately, that will be the only way the courts will retain their \nnecessary powers to preserve the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6062]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, while I would normally be coming down at \nthis time to talk about the Transportation reauthorization bill, which \nis one of the most significant bills we will be considering--there are \nproblems right now in getting it done before the House leaves, but we \nare going to make every effort to have it done by the end of this week. \nI think that is very important because, for all of the reasons we \ntalked about, we can't continue to do part-time extensions that don't \nallow us to get to any of the real problems we have. However, that is \nnot why I came to the floor this afternoon. I am here this afternoon to \nspeak on a different topic.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1877 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nMcCain and Rounds be added as cosponsors to the S. 1877.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, right now we are in kind of a waiting \nperiod. We have made a request. It seems that request is being denied \nbecause it takes unanimous consent to come up with language that will \nallow us to waive time.\n  The time that is pending right now on the Inhofe amendment will not \nexpire for 30 hours. Precloture will not expire until 5 a.m. tomorrow, \nso it looks like that will make it too late to get our bill passed \nprior to the time the House goes home.\n  This could always change. I think a lot of people are taking this \nposition because they didn't think we would be able to pass the bill. I \nthink we are going to pass it. I think we can pass it very likely on \nThursday, and so even if the House is gone, we will be preparing to go \nin and handle that bill when we all come back after the recess.\n  I just want to mention this because I think it is very important for \npeople to understand that we are going to be using this. We have gone \nthrough a lot of work on the bill.\n  The highway reauthorization bill was passed unanimously out of the \ncommittee I chaired, the Environment and Public Works Committee. Every \nRepublican and Democrat voted for it. So it is one of the few \nbipartisan efforts to take place in a body that is often criticized for \nnot getting anything done. This will be a major bill. It will become a \nreality.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, thank you. To the chair of the \ncommittee, congratulations, Mr. Inhofe, on the progress made so far \nwith regard to the highway bill, indicating that we will pass something \non Thursday and send it over to the House. It is important we address \nthis issue. It is important we put people back to work. We have \ncrumbling roads and bridges.\n  I hope everybody in this Chamber agrees that we need a highway bill \nand, specifically, we need one as long-term as possible in order to \ngive people predictability and certainty to be able to plan projects \nand to be able to deal with what is an increasing problem in our \ncountry, which is a lack of funds in infrastructure.\n  I hear it back home in Ohio. What I am hearing is: Give us certainty. \nLet us know what the plan is. Congress, in doing these short-term \nextensions, is not creating a plan.\n  If we end up with a short-term extension because the House and Senate \ncan't agree, then I hope we will make a commitment when we do that to \nsay: OK. After whatever that short-term period is--I have heard the \nrumor of 3 months--that at that point we will come up with a long-term \nproposal together.\n  I happen to think one way we could find a longer term proposal is to \nhave international tax reform. We should do it anyway. We should do it \nwhether or not the highway trust fund is connected to it. There are \nways to reform the Tax Code so companies that are overseas, that have \nrevenues overseas, that won't bring them back now because our tax rates \nare so high might be willing to bring them back at a lower rate. If \nthey bring those funds back and are taxed on those funds, there might \nbe an opportunity to provide some funding for long-term solutions to \nthe highway trust fund, perhaps in conjunction with some of the other \npay-fors that are part of the bill we are talking about. International \ntax reform is necessary in and of itself. I didn't come to the floor to \ntalk about that, although tomorrow we do have a hearing in the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations on this very issue.\n  I will tell my colleagues and those who are listening, if we do not \nreform our Tax Code, update our currently noncompetitive Tax Code, we \nare going to see more and more jobs and investment going overseas. It \nis that simple.\n  We already see it. Last year, in dollar terms, there were twice as \nmany foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies than there were the year \nbefore. Think about that. These are big companies with big names. One \nname you might know is Burger King, another is Budweiser. Another one \nthat is thinking about it is Monsanto. These are big companies.\n  A lot of companies have already decided they are not going to stay in \nthe United States because our Tax Code is so bad. It puts them at such \na disadvantage vis-a-vis their competitors around the world that they \ncan't survive. They have to become foreign entities in order to be \ncompetitive. We have to fix that. It is Washington that is creating the \nproblem. Many criticize these companies. I say if there is any blame to \nshow, it is right here in Washington, DC, by allowing the Tax Code that \nwas written in the 1960s to continue when every other one of our \ncompetitors around the world has reformed their tax codes and lowered \ntheir rates. This is something we can and should do. There is \nbipartisan consensus around this--maybe not in the details but in a \nframework.\n  Senator Schumer, on the other side of the aisle, and I put together a \nreport on this recently. We spent 3 or 4 months working on this, but it \nis a combination of a lot of different hearings and projects that have \nbeen undertaken over the last several years on this. We know what we \nhave to do. We know we have to go to a competitive international system \nthat allows us to be able to say to our workers in America: We are \ngoing to give you the tools to compete and win. We are not going to \nallow you to continue to have to compete with one hand tied behind your \nback, which is what is happening right now. The beneficiaries of this \nwould be the American economy but specifically the American worker.\n  The folks in the boardrooms are going to be fine one way or the \nother. When you have these foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies or \nyou have these so-called inversions where companies go overseas, the \nmajor executives in the company do just fine. The stock usually goes \nup. What happens is you lose workforce, you lose jobs here in America, \nsalaries don't go up--they stay flat--and that is who is taking the \nbrunt of this. So we have to fix that system, and I think we can do it \nperhaps in the next few months as part of this highway trust fund. That \nwould be, I hope, an incentive to do it. Again, we should do it anyway, \neven if there is no highway trust fund need for us to find additional \nsources of funding.\n  In the meantime, I applaud the chairman and others who included in \nthe highway trust fund legislation we are currently looking at. This is \nthe legislation the chairman says we are likely to vote on Thursday. \nIncluded in that are a couple of other provisions that are quite \nhelpful.\n  The one I want to talk about is with regard to regulations and \npermitting. When you think about it, we are struggling to find enough \nmoney to put into the highway trust fund to extend it as long as \npossible, right? Everybody is concerned about the fact that we have \nroads and bridges and can't put enough people back to work. One \nsolution to this is to go to the taxpayers and say: We need more \nfunding from the Federal tax base to go into this. That is what is \nhappening, frankly. Another one is to say is there a better way to \nbuild these roads and bridges to save money so every tax dollar goes \nfurther, so we are telling the American people we are not only funding \ninfrastructure, but we are\n\n[[Page S6063]]\n\ndoing it in the most cost-effective, efficient way. That is not \nhappening now. One reason it is not happening now is because it is so \ndarn hard to permit something, so hard to get the green light to go \nahead and start construction on something.\n  I hear this all the time back home. I hear it with regard to \ncommercial buildings, I hear it with regard to energy projects, and I \nhear it with regard to roads and bridges. You have so many hoops you \nhave to go through, many of which are Federal, some of which are local, \nsome of which are State--many of which are Federal, that it adds costs \nto the project. It adds delay to the project, and it makes it so you \nare always worried about a litigation risk because people can go back \nyears after the project is completed and say: Aha. I am going to file a \nlawsuit because you didn't follow all of these Federal regulations and \nrules quite the way you should have. That adds cost that we should not \nbe incurring.\n\n  Instead, as we pass this highway bill, we are going to pass something \nthat is called permitting reform. The Federal permitting system is \nbeing reformed in this underlying bill. My colleagues ought to know \nabout that. I am going to make a plea that regardless of what happens, \nwhether it is a 6-year bill, which I think would be great, again adding \npredictability and certainty, or whether it is 3 years, which maybe we \nare going to pass on Thursday, or whether it is 3 months, which is what \nsome are saying--the rumor is perhaps the House will send it back to \nthe Senate--whatever the extension period is, let's include this \nlegislation to make it easier to green-light a project to have America \nget back into the business of building things, not just roads and \nbridges--although it will help on this bill--but also other projects: \nenergy projects, construction projects, commercial buildings, and so \non.\n  Let me give you a really frightening statistic. There is a group that \ndoes an international assessment every year of all the countries in the \nworld. It asks: How easy is it to do business in various countries? \nThey compare the countries. One of the countries of course in the mix \nis us, the United States of America. You would hope we would be at the \ntop of the list--the best place to invest--that we would be the \ncountry, since we are a capitalist free enterprise country where we \nvalue ingenuity and want to move forward with projects and get things \ndone, that we would be at the top of the list. We are not. We are now \nNo. 41 in the world in terms of the ease to get a construction permit \nto build something--No. 41 in the world.\n  Capital is global these days. It moves around the world, and \ncertainly around the country, but around the world. So you go to a big \ncity overseas, let's say London. You see all sorts of cranes. Why? \nBecause actually in that city it is easier to build something than it \nis here in the United States. That is crazy. We should have a system \nhere in the United States where you have to go for the proper \nregulations, you have to be sure you are building something that is \nsafe and environmentally sound, but that it is easy to do it. You can \ndo it quickly. We are now 41st in the world.\n  This drives investment out of the United States and puts that \ninvestment in other countries. This is why this legislation is so \nimportant. Again, for the roads and bridges it is important, but also \nin general to put people back to work.\n  Here is something interesting about this legislation. We have worked \non this for almost 4 years--about 3.5 years now. My cosponsor is Claire \nMcCaskill, who is a Democrat, so we have a Republican and a Democrat \ndoing this together. Over time we have been able to build support, \nslowly but surely, to the point that we now have a good group of \nbipartisan cosponsors, pretty evenly balanced between Republicans and \nDemocrats, but we also have some support from the outside that is \nunusually balanced.\n  We have the Chamber of Commerce supporting this in the business \ncommunity. That might be expected. A lot of them are interested in how \nto build something and build it more quickly, but we also have the AFL-\nCIO building trades council strongly in support of this. I appreciate \nthat. Because they get it. This is about work and specifically about \nconstruction jobs. A lot of those jobs went away during the financial \ncrisis of 2007, 2008, and 2009. They have been slow to come back. \nUnemployment is still relatively high among construction workers. \nFrankly, a lot of them have moved on to something else because they \nhave not had jobs.\n  The AFL-CIO building trades council and the business community are \ntogether on this. They are working with us together to ensure that we \ncan get this done in the highway bill and to move forward with not just \nsomething that will help on roads and bridges, but it will help on all \nkinds of projects.\n  I heard about this in the context of energy. When I first got \nelected, a company came to me. It is called American Municipal Power, \nAMP. AMP does small energy projects all over our State and some other \nStates. They came to me and said: You know, Rob, we have been trying to \nput a powerplant on the Ohio River. Now, you might think that normally \nwould be a coal plant or a gas plant, or even a nuclear plant--there \nare all those along the Ohio River. They said: No, we are actually \ntrying to put a hydro plant. The Ohio River is not a particularly \nnatural place for hydro, you would not think, but it turns out there is \na nice flow in the Ohio River. It is a big river.\n  They had this great idea at the locks of the Ohio River to add a \nmunicipal powerplant, hydroplant, but they said: We cannot get through \nall of these Federal hoops. There are up to 35 different Federal \nlicenses and permits you now have to get to do an energy project. Think \nabout that. You have to get 35 different Federal licenses and permits \nin order to start construction and to move forward with an energy \nproject.\n  That is what they found in the Ohio River. They came to me and said: \nWhat can you do to help? We started to look at it and figured out: My \ngosh. The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. You have \nso many agencies involved, so many different interests involved, \nwhether it is the Army Corps of Engineers, the USGS, whether it is EPA, \nwhether it is again State and local regulations. I am just talking \nabout the Federal side when I talk about the 35 permits and \nregulations.\n  What American Municipal Power wanted was to be able to get something \ndone in a predictable way and have somebody be accountable. We liked \nthat idea, so we moved forward with this legislation providing more \naccountability.\n  We also heard from Baard Energy. Baard had plans to build a $6 \nbillion synthetic fuels plant in Wellsville, OH. This was a coal-to-\nliquid plant that would not only convert coal into clean diesel and jet \nfuel, it would also have created, we were told, up to 2,500 jobs. This \nis in a part of Eastern Ohio where these jobs are so valuable, so \nprecious.\n  They couldn't do it at the end of the day because the permitting \ndelays and the lawsuits they got so interfered with the project that \ntheir capital left. It wasn't patient enough to wait around for all the \ndelays, all the potential lawsuits, all the problems. So, again, from \nthem we learned: Well, let's have accountability, one agency \nresponsible, but also let's look at this issue of not just lack of \naccountability, but the fact that these lawsuits continue to slow these \nprojects down and make it more difficult to move forward.\n  Our legislation addresses all of these issues. It does so in a very \nthoughtful and, I think, reasonable way, in a way that is common sense. \nWe have got support on both sides of the aisle. First of all, it \nstrengthens coordination and deadline setting. We talked about having \nsome accountability. One agency is now accountable, so instead of \nagencies being able to go: Well, you know, we are fine, but how about \nthis other agency? Not our fault, their fault, pointing fingers. Now \nyou have got one agency that is in charge.\n  Deadline setting. This creates an interagency council to best \nidentify what the best practices are, but also set deadlines for \nreviews. Right now with no deadlines, the things often go on and on and \non, in approvals of important infrastructure projects.\n  It also strengthens cooperation between the State and local \npermitting authorities, another problem. As I said earlier, there are \nlocal and State issues as well, and we try to avoid duplication and the \ndelay that comes from that.\n  Second, the legislation facilitates greater transparency and greater \npublic participation in the permitting\n\n[[Page S6064]]\n\nprocess. It creates what we call an online dashboard where you can look \nat the dashboard--whether you are a company that is involved in this or \nwhether you are a member of the public who is interested in this--you \ncan look on that dashboard and see this is where the permit is. OK. It \nis at that agency. Well, why? You can see whether it has completed its \nreview. And where are we on this?\n  It encourages not just the ability to track agency progress, which I \nthink will have a very important effect--sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant sometimes in bringing this out; making the transparency \nbetter is a good idea, but it also brings more input from stakeholders.\n  We also require in our legislation that the agencies accept comments \nfrom stakeholders early in the approval process. Why? Because another \nproblem we found was that often the concerns come very late in the \nprocess, so you have an investment, you have workers working on this. \nAll of a sudden a concern comes in, it stops everything, slows it down, \nand makes it very inefficient.\n  Instead we are saying: OK. Comments, they are very important, but \nlet's accept those comments earlier in the process. Let's identify \nthese important public concerns from the very start. Then finally, it \ninstitutes a set of litigation reforms that I think is very important. \nOne I will mention, which I think is probably going to be surprising to \na lot of people: Right now there is a statute of limitations on \nlawsuits that runs 6 years. This is after the environmental review, the \nNEPA review--6 years. Think about that. We limit that 6 years to 2 \nyears. I would have liked to limit it even further to be frank.\n  In our original legislation we tried to limit it even further, but \nthis again is a consensus-building project. We want to be sure we kept \nthe bipartisan support, we kept support on the outside, including from \ngroups like the Natural Resources Defense Council that have worked with \nus on this.\n  So we have accountability, transparency, litigation reforms, with the \nwhole goal of saying: Let's take, in the case of these construction \nprojects, the roads and bridges, the Federal dollars, and let's let \nthem work in a more efficient way so every dollar goes further, so we \ncan get these roads and bridges going, so we are not paying so much for \ndelays and redtape, so we are not paying so much more for lawsuits, so \nwe can actually get this thing moving. That is in this legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues who, like me, go back home and hear about \nregulatory reform and the need for us to streamline the process will \nstrongly support this part of the legislation, even if they cannot \nsupport all of the legislation. I hope they will continue to push this \nSenate and the House of Representatives to pass this permitting reform \nlegislation.\n  If we do that and it lands on the President's desk, I believe he will \nsign it. I believe that because we have worked with him closely and \nbecause frankly it will have such strong bipartisan support. It is the \nright thing to do. It enables us to say to the people we represent: You \nknow what. We are not just asking for some more money for roads and \nbridges, which is important and will create more jobs and make our \neconomy more efficient--we need to do that. The crumbling \ninfrastructure is real.\n  It is also an opportunity for us to do it in a more efficient way. \nThe President's job council, at the end of 2011, issued a report. You \nmight remember that. President Obama selected Jeffrey Immelt, who is a \nvery widely respected executive--GE CEO--to chair the jobs council. He \ncame up with a bunch of recommendations, many of which I think were \nvery constructive.\n  One was about this very issue. This is what they said. They said we \nought to reform the permitting process because we should, as the \nPresident said, ``do everything we can to make it easier for folks to \nbring products to market, and to start and expand new businesses, and \nto grow and hire new workers.'' That was the President.\n  Sean McGarvey is the president of the North America's Building Trades \nUnion. We talked about the AFL-CIO building trades union. This is what \nSean McGarvey has said: ``If there was ever an issue that could be \nconsidered a no-brainer for Congress, the Federal Permitting \nImprovement Act is it.''\n  I agree with Sean. This is a no-brainer. Let's get it done as part of \nthe legislation we are going to pass this week. I believe we will pass \nit. If we do not pass the highway bill this week, let's ensure that we \ninclude the permitting reforms in whatever we do pass.\n  Again, whether it is a 3-month extension or a 6-year extension, we \nshould be sure that we are removing unnecessary delays, bureaucratic \nhurdles, so that more Americans who are looking for a job can find a \njob, and so that tax dollars can go further. I want to thank Claire \nMcCaskill, the Senator from Missouri, who has been the cosponsor of \nthis over the last few years. Sometimes it has not been easy working \nthrough this. She has taken some arrows, but it is the right thing to \ndo. It is meaningful legislation that will actually help move our \neconomy in the right direction and help us to be able to repair more of \nthese roads and bridges because we will be doing it more efficiently.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the highway \nbill. I understand there will be a cloture vote tomorrow and then \npotentially, if that is achieved, final passage the day after. I want \nto say again that I appreciate the efforts of so many in various areas, \nthat my comments today are not intended to be directed at any \nindividual or either side of the aisle.\n  I was elected in 2006 and I came in during 2007, so I have been here \nroughly 8\\1/2\\ years. One of the reasons I ran for office was to deal \nwith our Nation's fiscal issues. I was so concerned about the direction \nin which our country was going. As you know, just about every military \nleader we have will tell you that the greatest threat to our Nation's \nnational security is us, those of us here in Congress, and the way we \ndeal with our fiscal issues.\n  The simplest fiscal issue I know of to solve is the highway bill \nbecause it is simple math. It is not like Medicare, where all these \nactuarial issues have to be dealt with and you have to make assumptions \nabout the impact on care and all those kinds of things. The highway \nbill is just simple math. It is so easy. There is money that comes in \nand there is money that goes out.\n  I think everybody in this body knows the highway bill was set up \nbased on a user fee program where people who are using the highways pay \nfor that through user fees and then the money would be there in a trust \nfund--a real trust fund--where, in fact, the money would go out. So we \nwould have a system in our country where we would pay for our highways \nand other infrastructure in that regard. As a matter of fact, the State \nof Tennessee has zero road debt because that is exactly the way they \nhandle their State portion.\n  I know a lot has been said about this Presidential race and what is \ndriving some of the interesting anomalies that are occurring right now. \nPeople are saying: Well, certain candidates are receiving a lot of \nattention because of the anger people in America have toward \nWashington. I would just say that this bill--this is an outline of it--\nshould be exhibit A as to why people in America are angry at \nWashington. Both sides of the aisle, both ends of the Capitol, this is \nexhibit A.\n  Again, I understand this was a combined effort with lots of people, \nbut let me point out a few things.\n  No. 1, we have had five general fund transfers--in other words, \ntaking money out of our general fund and sending it over to the highway \ntrust fund. That has totaled $60 billion since 2008.\n  We have these wonderful young interns who come up here to learn about \nWashington. They come up here to experience Washington. They have read \nin their history books and other places--in civics--about this being \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world. I would think that in most \ncases they probably look up to people here on the floor. Some of them \nmay aspire to\n\n[[Page S6065]]\n\nsomeday actually serve in the Senate. But what they are going to be \nwitnessing should this bill become law is 100 folks in this room--not \nall of them but a number of people in this room--voting to basically \nsteal money from them.\n  They are stealing money from you so that all of us can look good to \nour constituents and pass a highway bill. So we are going to steal \nmoney from you so that we don't have to deal with this issue. It is \ncalled generational theft.\n  So to the pages and to the people you have been working with for so \nlong, just know--and I don't know any other way to describe this. Let \nme explain. This is a 3-year bill we are going to pay for over 10 \nyears. One hundred percent of the spending, in other words, takes place \nbetween the years 2016 and 2018--100 percent of the spending--but 69 \npercent of the offsets, the money coming in, actually comes in--you \nheard me say 2016 to 2018--between 2022 and 2025. So that would be like \nyour mother or father going to the grocery store and buying groceries \nand saying: Well, I am not going to pay for this today; I will pay for \nthis in 7 or 8 or 9 years down the road. Every time they went to the \ngrocery store, they did that. You can imagine how your household \nfinances would operate if that is what they did. If this bill becomes \nlaw, that is what the people in this body will be doing to you. It is \ngenerational theft.\n  We use these tricky accounting rules around here where if we pay for \nsomething over 10 years even though we spend the money in 1 year, we \ncount that, believe it or not, as paid for.\n  It is even worse on something like a highway trust bill. See, this is \nsomething where money is supposed to come in at the same rate money is \ngoing out. You can expect some aberrations on when money comes in and \nwhen money goes out on other kinds of programs--you can expect that--\nbut not on the highway trust fund.\n  This is the kind of math, by the way, each of you probably knew about \nin the third or fourth grade, where you could figure out how much money \nis coming in and how much money is going out. But on both sides of the \nCapitol and on both sides of the aisle, since 2008, instead of dealing \nwith this issue--which, by the way, means you have to make some tough \nchoices. You could spend less money in the trust fund. That would be a \nway to make it add up. You could devolve some of the responsibilities \nback to States. By the way, so many roads are now becoming roads the \nFederal system pays for, there might be a good argument for that. There \nis a good argument for that. Or you could just increase revenues and \nmake sure those who are driving on the roads in our country today pay \nmore to do it. But that is not what is going to happen. We are going to \npull a trick on the American people. And here I get back to that anger \nissue and the reason so many people are upset with Washington. Again, \nthis is exhibit A.\n  As a matter of fact, only 9 percent of the money coming in over this \n10-year period comes in during the period of time we are spending on \nthe highway bill. Can you believe that? Yet we say it is paid for.\n  Let me tell you what else we are doing. This is fascinating to me. \nCongress, in its brilliance, has created a system where only Fannie and \nFreddie--remember the two behemoths that had $5 trillion in housing \nmortgages in our country, the big giants that failed back in 2008? What \nwe have done in this bill--I am not going to do it, but if people vote \nfor this bill, what they will be agreeing to do is to extend the \nguarantee fee on mortgages out, by the way, the last couple of years of \nthis bill, so, again, money comes in way beyond the time we spend it.\n  So let's say you guys go to college. I know many of you will. When \nyou get out, you decide to buy a home. Let me tell you how we, in our \nwisdom, have decided to pay for our highways. We are going to make you \npay more for your mortgage. You are not going to know that, by the way; \nwe are going to hide it in your mortgage.\n  See, we want to make sure the American people don't really know how \nwe are paying for these things. We try to hide these things from folks \nso that when we run for reelection, we don't create any ire amongst the \npublic.\n  This one is hard for me to believe. Now, I can understand some people \nin this body supporting this, those who support Fannie and Freddie \ncontinuing on forever, because what we are really doing is now the \nFederal Government, in order to pay for our roads, is relying on Fannie \nand Freddie. So how could you do away with them? Think about it.\n  We have had so many people in this body talk big about winding down \nFannie and Freddie and about how they are a threat to our Nation. I \nhave actually written a bill to try to deal with that and had a lot of \nsupport from people on both sides of the aisle. We all talk big, but \nlet me tell you what we are going to do. To pay for the highways, we \nare going to continue the policy of making sure that every time \nsomebody gets a mortgage, they pay a little more for that mortgage--the \nentire time, by the way, that mortgage is in place. That generates \nabout $2 billion. Of course, the American people won't know or see \nthat, and so that, of course, makes it very popular.\n  Let me talk about another one. This is fascinating to me. The Federal \nReserve System has been paying a dividend to member banks that invest \nin their regional Feds. Since 1930, that dividend rate has been 6 \npercent. I don't know if that is the right number.\n  By the way, some people are confusing this with a monetary policy \nissue, which is the amount that is being paid on the reserve. That is \nnot what this is. This is something which has been in place since the \n1930s. We never had a hearing on it, by the way, and I have no idea \nwhat we should be paying, OK? I have no idea. But just out of the blue, \nto generate $17 billion--without a hearing; never been a hearing; as a \nmatter of fact, I would say most people in this body have never heard \nof this issue--to pay for our roads and again make sure we stay in \ngreat stead with our constituents back home so we don't have to make \nany tough choices, we are going to change that from 6 to 1.5 \npercent. That generates $17 billion. But, again, it keeps us from \nhaving to deal with this issue head on. By the way, a lot of that money \ncomes in way beyond the period of time we are spending the money on the \nroadways.\n\n  This is the one that gets me. I love this one. I love this one. We \nare going to sell 101 million barrels of oil from something called the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve from 2018 to 2025. We have a big Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, which is in our national security interests. As a \nmatter of fact, I would say that if President Obama were to propose \nthis particular pay-for, most everyone on our side of the aisle would \njust raise unbelievable--I need to choose my words--would be very \nupset. It would be dead on arrival because what it does is it weakens \nour national security.\n  We have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In a time of crisis, we want \nto make sure the people in America have access to this Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve.\n  This is so grave. We are generating $9 billion, by the way, in the \nyears 2018 through 2025--again, beyond the time of even paying for this \nhighway measure. So again, it is generational theft--selling assets \ndown the road to pay for things today. It generates $9 billion, and \nhalf of the sales occur in 2024 and 2025. So it is kicking the can down \nthe road.\n  For America, please, please, be upset about this. Please, please, be \nangry about this.\n  Let me tell you what we are doing. We all make investments and pay \nattention to the markets a little bit. We hope we can save some money. \nOil is selling today at under $50 a barrel. But let me tell you at what \nwe have decided we are going to sell this oil. We are just going to \nmake it up--at $89 a barrel. Think about that.\n  Congress in its wisdom has decided we are going to sell 101 million \nbarrels of oil. We are so bright and we can anticipate the future so \nwell that we know, by golly, that when we sell this oil between 2018 \nand 2025, it is going to be at $89 a barrel, even though it is under \n$50 a barrel today. But we know that because we represent America. We \nhave been elected to the Senate.\n  So that is how we are generating it. By the way, if during that \nperiod of time oil happens to be selling at $74 a barrel, we break \neven. If it sells for anything under that, it is less. But by the way, \nthere is $9 billion of made-up money just because we have decided\n\n[[Page S6066]]\n\nthat is what the price of oil is going to be at that time.\n  I just have to say that this is one of the most irresponsible pieces \nof legislation I have seen come this far in the Senate. Let me say this \none more time. This has to be one of the most irresponsible pieces of \nlegislation that I have seen make it this far in the Senate.\n  I am very disappointed with where we are. I am not directing that at \nanybody. People on both sides of the aisle are involved in getting it \nwhere it is today. People on both sides of the building have used these \ntypes of gimmicks and tricks to basically involve ourselves in abject \ngenerational theft, keeping us from making tough decisions today. They \nare not even tough, to be honest--just using our God-given common \nsense, the same thing that most Americans get up every day and have to \ndeal with.\n  I have been so uplifted in my home State and by my home town of \nChattanooga to watch how ordinary citizens with huge patriotism and \nlarge amounts of common sense have dealt with the tremendous tragedy in \nour hometown. I have just been overwhelmed by it. I wish all of America \ncould see the response of people who wake up every day carrying out \ntheir ordinary duties, husbands and wives and sons and daughters. They \ncare about our Nation. They care about its future. They care about our \nmilitary. They care about people who protect us. I wish that somehow \npeople could see that. I know people see it in all of their hometowns \naround the country. I know people see this greatness. Yet in this bill, \nI don't see any common sense. How could we pay for our highways \nutilizing this type of pay-for?\n  So I rise to say that I don't support this piece of legislation. I \nthink that has been made clear. I hope that as people analyze the pay-\nfors--which, again, in my opinion could not be more ridiculous on \nsomething like a highway bill--this bill will go down, and we will \nfigure out a way to deal with this in a more productive way. Again, the \nright way to deal with this, if you have a trust fund, is to have fees \nthat come in and the same amount that go out.\n  I think in this minor conversation here, these pages probably get \nthat. I think America gets that. I hope, again, this bill does not \npass. I hope it does not become law, and I hope we can gather and \nfigure out another way of dealing with this in a responsible way that \ndoesn't use gimmicks, as this certainly uses.\n  I don't know how anybody could say: By the way, the Senate has \nassumed that in the years 2024 and 2025, oil will sell at $89 a barrel. \nNow, if the Senate was that good at giving financial advice--certainly, \nif we look at our balance sheets and the deficits we have been running, \npeople would know that is anything but the truth.\n  The fact is that this bill should not become law and should not be \nsupported. I intend to vote against it. I intend to encourage others to \nvote against it. I hope that at some point in my tenure here we will \nactually begin to deal with our fiscal issues head on, in a direct way \nthat solves them for the long term and really doesn't sweep them under \nthe rug for this generation, unfortunately, to have to clean up our \nmess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, in poll after poll, the American \npeople have told this Congress that it is time to wake up to the ever-\ngrowing threat from carbon pollution. Two-thirds of Americans support \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan to cut emissions \nfrom powerplants and invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy. \nEven a majority of Republicans support action to reduce carbon \npollution. But we do nothing.\n  So here I am again, for the 108th time, for a speech of which the \nPresiding Officer has become something of a frequent flyer, to urge \nthat we listen to our constituents and do the job that we were sent \nhere to do.\n  Sadly, Congress is stuck in the grip of the big polluters and their \nunlimited, unreported campaign spending. After the dreadful Citizens \nUnited Supreme Court decision of 2010, two things happened. One, \ncorporate political spending poured into secretive unaccountable groups \nthat now wield untold influence in our elections. Two, Republicans--\nparticularly Republican voices in Congress--fell silent on carbon \npollution and climate change. It was a stopper.\n  So despite the wishes of the American people and despite an \noverwhelming scientific consensus, the majority in the Senate has no \nplan whatsoever to address the catastrophic changes we see in our \noceans and our atmosphere, in our farms and our forests.\n  Many of the Republican candidates for President, for fear of \noffending their fossil fuel billionaire donors, ignore not only the \nclear tide of public opinion and not only the warnings of our \nscientific and national security officials but ignore the climate \ndisruptions in their own home States. They ignore the homegrown climate \nresearch of their own State's scientists and universities.\n  Earlier this year I came to the floor with my colleague and friend, \nSenator Baldwin of Wisconsin, to consider the effects of carbon \npollution in her Badger State. Senator Baldwin is a fierce defender of \nWisconsin families and businesses and is fighting to protect \nWisconsin's climate, from the Great Lakes to the legendary dairy farms.\n  Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, on the other hand, has gone another \nway. He has gone right down the fossil fuel industry rabbit hole. He \npulled the plug on scientific and environmental functions in State \ngovernment and he attacks environmental programs in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Let's look at the facts in Wisconsin. According to the scientists at \nthe University of Wisconsin-Madison, weather stations around Wisconsin \nmeasure that average temperatures in Wisconsin increased by about 1.1 \ndegrees Fahrenheit between 1950 and 2006. During the same period, \nWisconsin got wetter as well as warmer. Annual average precipitation in \nWisconsin increased by almost 3 inches--again, measured.\n  As more and more carbon pollution piles up in the atmosphere, \nresearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison estimate and project \nthat by midcentury Wisconsin could warm by 4 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit. \nBy the end of the century, the climate in Wisconsin may look more like \nthat of present-day Missouri or Oklahoma, raising the prospect of \ndramatic shifts in the Wisconsin economy and way of life.\n  These changes would not be kind to Wisconsin's iconic badger. The \nUpper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative lists \nthe Wisconsin badger as one of the region's species at risk from \nclimate change. It has no apparent effect on Governor Walker, however.\n  There was the Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts. The \nWisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts was formed in 2007 by \nthe Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the University of \nWisconsin Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. The scientists \nand public officials in this program are studying how climate change \nwill affect Wisconsin's wildlife, water resources, and public health, \nand important Wisconsin industries such as forestry, agriculture, and \nshipping and tourism on the Great Lakes.\n  Climate change threatens pillars of the Wisconsin economy. The \ninitiative's agricultural working group reports that higher summer \ntemperatures and increasing drought will create significant stress on \nlivestock, even touching Wisconsin's famed cheese industry. Victor \nCabrera, an assistant professor in the University of Wisconsin-Madison \nDairy Science Department, says that this heat stress interferes with \nboth fertility and milk production. Dairy cows could give as much as 10 \npercent less milk. Professor Cabrera in Wisconsin is not alone. He is \nnot alone. The U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts that by 2030 \nclimate change will cost the U.S. dairy sector between $79 million and \n$199 million per year in lost production. Does Governor Walker care? \nApparently not, but\n\n[[Page S6067]]\n\nthe University of Wisconsin does. So it is leading a USDA-funded effort \nto identify practices that minimize greenhouse gases from milk \nproduction and make dairies more resilient to Wisconsin's changing \nclimate. Some Wisconsin dairy farmers, for instance, are burning excess \nmethane in enormous manure digesters to generate their own renewable \nelectricity.\n  It is not just the farmers. Wisconsin has sportsmen. Wisconsin's \nsportsmen treasure Wisconsin's 10,000 miles of trout streams--some of \nthe best trout fishing in the country. Trout Unlimited found that \nfishing in the Driftless Area of southwest Wisconsin and parts of \nIllinois, Minnesota, and Iowa adds over $1 billion per year to the \nsurrounding economy. But the cold-water fish such as the brook trout \nare highly sensitive to temperature increases in streams.\n  Under the worst cases analyzed by the researchers at the University \nof Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, \n``brook trout are projected to be completely lost from Wisconsin \nstreams.'' Even the best case scenarios see losses of as much as 44 \npercent of the Wisconsin brookies' current range by midcentury. That is \nWisconsin's own Department of Natural Resources. Other cold water \nspecies such as the brown trout are not much better off than the \nbrookies.\n  The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is not alone. It is not \nalone. The American Fly Fishing Trade Association said this in a recent \npublic statement:\n\n       Climate change is no longer a potential threat; it demands \n     our attention now. . . . We call on our elected officials to \n     put partisan politics aside and work quickly to enact federal \n     policy to address the threats presented by global climate \n     change.\n\n  On to Wisconsin's loggers, Wisconsin has a significant logging \nindustry, and the loggers are having trouble getting to the timber when \nhard, frozen winter ground becomes too thawed and too soggy to hold up \nlogging equipment. According to a study out of the University of \nWisconsin, that frozen period for loggers to work has decreased by 2 to \n3 weeks since 1948, shortening the working window for loggers before \ntheir gear bogs down.\n  In every corner of the State, Wisconsin's own scientists are seeing \ndramatic climate changes. Wisconsin's businesses and communities are \nalready taking a hard hit. How does their Governor respond? You can \nprobably see this coming: ``I am not a scientist''--the classic denier \ndodge.\n  Governor Walker, we know you are not a scientist, but it is OK \nbecause you have some of the top scientists right there at your own \nUniversity of Wisconsin. You have teams of scientists working for you \nat your State agencies right in Wisconsin.\n  But do we expect that Scott Walker will listen to a scientist? No. \nNo. He has a different plan--to eliminate more than 60 positions at the \nWisconsin Department of Natural Resources, including dozens of \nscientific staff. That is one way to not have to listen to them.\n  Whom does Scott Walker listen to? Well, the Koch Brothers political \nnetwork has said it plans on spending $900 million in the 2016 election \ncycle--$900 million. The President of one of the biggest Koch Brothers-\nbacked organizations, Tim Phillips of a group called Americans for \nProsperity, has threatened publicly that any Republican candidate in \nthe 2016 Presidential campaign who supported climate action ``would be \nat a severe disadvantage in the Republican nomination process.'' So \nthey are going to throw $900 million at the election, and they have a \n``severe disadvantage'' threat floating around. Nice little campaign \nyou got here; be a shame if it was severely disadvantaged.\n  Well, it did not take Governor Walker long to sign that same \nAmericans for Prosperity organization's no climate tax pledge--what do \nyou know--vowing to oppose any legislation on climate change without an \nequivalent amount of tax cuts. It is amazing what waving around $900 \nmillion will do.\n  Whom else does Scott Walker listen to? Well, the majority leader \nrecently called on all Governors to rebel against the EPA's Clean Power \nPlan. So far, only six took up the majority leader's call. One of them \nis--guess who--Scott Walker. In December he wrote to the EPA that their \nplan would be ``a blow to Wisconsin residents and business owners.'' In \nJanuary he announced that he was planning to sue the Agency instead.\n  Maybe Governor Walker would think differently if he listened to \nWisconsin's business owners. Lori Compas, executive director of the \nWisconsin Business Alliance, endorsed the EPA's Clean Power Plan \nproposal as a boon, a benefit to the Wisconsin economy. Here is what \nshe said:\n\n       Encouraging renewable energy development will result in \n     business growth, job creation, cleaner air, and a quicker \n     path to energy independence.\n\n  That is what she wrote.\n  I will continue. She said:\n\n       Our society does not have to decide whether our policies \n     should favor jobs or the environment. We should look for \n     opportunities for us to promote jobs and the environment and \n     the Clean Power Plan is a great way to do that.\n\n  That is the Wisconsin Business Alliance speaking. Those Wisconsin \nbusinesses are not alone. They are not alone. Yesterday 13 of the \nlargest corporations in America joined in President Obama's American \nBusiness Act on Climate Pledge, committing to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, invest in renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable \npractices across their respective markets and up their supply chains. \nThese are some pretty big-time nameplate Americans companies: Alcoa, \nApple, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Cargill, Coca-Cola, \nGeneral Motors, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, PepsiCo, UPS, and \nWalmart. That is a pretty broad spectrum of America's corporate \nhierarchy. Is it the Republican majority's position that they are all \nalso in on the hoax?\n  The Republican majority has accused NASA's scientists, whose just \nflew a craft by Pluto and who are driving a rover around on the surface \nof Mars, of being in on a hoax; that climate change is a hoax and that \nNASA scientists are in on it. Is Walmart in on the hoax too? Do the \nSenators from Arkansas want to go home and tell the Walmart executives \nthat they are in on a hoax? Do the Senators from Georgia want to go \nhome and tell the CEO of Coca-Cola that they are in on a hoax? I don't \nthink so. It is an untenable argument.\n  We have to move on. These leaders of American commerce declare, in a \nvoice that Republicans should listen to:\n\n       We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be \n     costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the \n     transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple \n     benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public \n     health, resilience to natural disasters and the health of the \n     global environment.\n\n  That is quite a crowd who signed off on that statement. More will \ncome because other companies, such as VF Industries and Mars and \nUnilever, agree with them.\n  Our good Earth is sending us a clear message. The message our good \nEarth is sending us is that carbon pollution is driving unprecedented \nchange. It is showing the change happening in the Earth around us. \nVoters too are sending us a clear message. They are speaking up to say \nthat climate change is a problem and they want their leaders to take \naction and that it is time we got our heads out of the sand.\n  Unfortunately, there is a problem. The big polluters have a powerful \npolitical megaphone. They do not hesitate to use it. They back it up \nwith big, dark money campaign spending that is distorting our democracy \nin disgraceful ways.\n  The result is that, like so many Republican candidates for the \nPresidency, Scott Walker of Wisconsin has no plan, will not listen to \nhis home State scientists at his home State university, and ignores \nwhat his loggers and trout fishermen and businesses are all seeing and \nsaying. But, oh my, does he listen to the big polluters.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to recognize and commend Colonel \nThomas L'Esperance for his noteworthy career with the Vermont State \nPolice, which will conclude next month with his retirement. One of the \nstrongest voices in Vermont law enforcement for the past 28 years, \nColonel L'Esperance has dutifully served the public and sought to \nprotect his fellow Vermonters as an invaluable member and leader in \nVermont. He rose through the ranks of the Vermont State Police after \nbeginning his career as a detective trooper with the Brattleboro \nbarracks in 1987, and has since assumed new and challenging roles \nwithin the force. He has contributed to Vermont's public safety and \nhelped to combat crime by serving as a detective trooper, the Southern \nVermont Drug Task Force field supervisor, director of the Bureau of \nCriminal Investigations, and, since 2009, as the director of the \nVermont State Police. Colonel L'Esperance has earned the respect and \nadmiration of his colleagues throughout his career for his unwavering \ndedication and ability to empathize with those whom he serves and \nprotects.\n  In recent years, Vermont has faced immeasurable challenges in \ncombating the cycle of heroin and opioid abuse. In 2014, I called on \nColonel L'Esperance to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee field \nhearing in Rutland, VT, about this very challenge. Colonel L'Esperance \ngraciously and with expertise provided testimony on the harmful effects \nof addiction in the State of Vermont, and on the challenges facing \nVermont's law enforcement community in combating such abuse. His \ntestimony was exemplary, not only because of his firsthand experience \nwith this critical policing and public health issue, but also because \nof the colonel's personal commitment to eliminating this destructive \nepidemic from our State. I thank Colonel L'Esperance for his powerful \ntestimony and for the great work he has done throughout his career in \nfighting criminal activity in our State.\n  While his retirement from the position of Vermont State Police \ndirector will be a loss for the force and for the State of Vermont, I \nam confident that Colonel L'Esperance will bring the same level of \nexcellence to the next chapter of his career. Colonel L'Esperance will \nno doubt continue to serve others with integrity and with the highest \nregard for the public's safety. I am proud of Colonel L'Esperance for \nhis exceptional work with the Vermont State Police, and I am grateful \nfor all of his efforts in improving the safety and wellbeing of \nVermonters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6068-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Senate is being asked to approve the \nIntelligence authorization bill for fiscal year 2016 by unanimous \nconsent. When this bill was reported by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I and other colleagues noted that it contained one provision \nthat required further debate.\n  This provision, section 603, would require Internet and \ncommunications companies to make reports to the government if they \nbecome aware of ``terrorist activity.'' Over the past 3 weeks a number \nof Internet companies have raised very valid concerns about this \nprovision. In particular, they note that this provision is quite vague, \nand does not specify how these companies should know what is and is not \nterrorist activity.\n  The Internet Association, which is comprised of dozens of leading \ntechnology companies, has warned that uncertainty about the meaning of \nthis vague language will create ``an impossible compliance problem'' \nand lead to ``massive reporting of items that are not likely to be of \nmaterial concern to public safety.'' That is obviously something that I \nthink every Senator wants to avoid. Internet companies should not be \nsubject to broad requirements to police the speech of their users.\n  There is no question that tracking terrorist activity and preventing \nonline terrorist recruitment should be top priorities for law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies. And leading technology companies \ncertainly have a role to play here. The Director of the FBI testified \nthis month that technology companies are ``pretty good about telling \nus'' when they see something of serious concern. But I haven't yet \nheard any law enforcement or intelligence agencies suggest that this \nprovision will actually help catch terrorists, and I take the concerns \nthat have been raised about its breadth and vagueness seriously.\n  For these reasons, I object to this unanimous consent request. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to revise or remove this \nprovision so that the rest of the bill can proceed forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6068-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER AND TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize an exceptional \nPresident and a true friend to the United States who cherishes that \nPresident's memory. Those of us from the great State of Kansas are \njustly proud of Dwight David Eisenhower, fondly known as ``Ike'' to his \nAbilene neighbors. The Republic of China, Taiwan, calls him a loyal \nfriend.\n  In 1911, Eisenhower left his boyhood home in Kansas for the U.S. \nMilitary Academy at West Point. During World War II, Eisenhower was in \ncharge of plans in the Pacific War and commanding general of the Army's \nEuropean Theater. On June 6, 1944, General Eisenhower led the D-day \ninvasion on the beaches of Normandy and liberated Europe. During this \ntime, Taiwan stood as our ally in Asia, with the Flying Tigers in the \nDoolittle Raid and along the Burma Road. In 1951, President Truman \nasked Eisenhower to become the first Supreme Allied Commander in \nEurope. After a long and decorated military career, America's voters \nsaid, ``I like Ike,'' by overwhelmingly electing him as the 34th \nPresident of the United States in 1952.\n  Today, it is my privilege to serve as Chairman of the Eisenhower \nMemorial Commission. Because this memorial honors a Kansan, a war hero, \nand a President the world admires, our good friend and partner, the \ngovernment and people of the Republic of China, has generously made a \ngift to ensure the memory of Dwight D. Eisenhower is preserved for \ngenerations to come.\n  It is fortunate for all that our Taiwanese friends have not forgotten \nPresident Eisenhower's staunch support for their security and his \nstrong commitment to the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. In 1960, President \nEisenhower made the first official U.S. visit to Taipei to meet with \nPresident Chiang Kai-shek. As Taiwan's Representative to the United \nStates, Dr. Shen has told me, ``President Eisenhower holds a very \nspecial place in the hearts of the people of Taiwan.''\n  It was Eisenhower who signed the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty \nin 1954. The next year, on the occasion of the passage of the Formosa \nResolution by the Congress, President Eisenhower further pledged to \n``protect the territories in the Western Pacific under the jurisdiction \nof the Republic of China.'' It was also Eisenhower who dispatched the \nU.S. Seventh Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait in the 1950s, thus \nassuring that the people of Taiwan would remain secure from any \nexternal military threat. Deservedly, a significant portion of \nPresident Eisenhower's foreign policy legacy is maintaining peace and \nsecurity in the Taiwan Strait.\n  In honoring a great general and President, Taiwan has demonstrated an \nunbroken bond of friendship, dating back to World War II. That enduring \nfriendship is yet another key element of President Eisenhower's legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6068-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6068-S6069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WORLD WAR II VETERANS VISIT\n\n  Mr. GARDNER.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to regulate \n     airline baggage fees and processes for consumers as it \n     relates to transportation of passenger luggage and passenger \n     delays resulting from lost, damaged, or delayed luggage; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 207\n\n       Whereas, deregulation of the airline industry in the United \n     States began more than three decades ago in 1978; and\n       Whereas, a consequence of deregulation was the elimination \n     of federal control over many airline business practices, \n     including pricing and domestic route selection; and\n       Whereas, though deregulation limits federal control of \n     airline business practices generally, the federal government \n     continues to legislate and enforce certain consumer \n     protections for airline passengers; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress largely determines the \n     degree to which certain rights of airline passengers are \n     codified in law or developed through regulatory rulemaking; \n     and\n       Whereas, since deregulation, the primary means of \n     competition amongst airlines has progressively centered on \n     price, not service; and\n       Whereas, certain concerns for passengers of airlines \n     include increasing baggage fees and passenger delays \n     resulting from lost, damaged, or delayed passenger luggage; \n     and\n       Whereas, the airline industry began to charge passengers a \n     checked baggage fee per bag to curtail rising jet fuel costs \n     and to supplement marginal revenue during times of economic \n     decline; and\n\n[[Page S6073]]\n\n       Whereas, as a result of increasing airline baggage fees \n     charged by airlines for checked luggage, passengers are \n     encouraged to increase the contents of carry-on luggage to \n     avoid the extra cost of baggage fees; and\n       Whereas, increased carry-on luggage of boarding airline \n     passengers may be correlated to the claims of lost, damaged, \n     or delayed passenger luggage, because passengers are \n     oftentimes asked to check carry-on luggage at the boarding \n     gate, which may require passengers to wait for such luggage \n     after deboarding an aircraft, or luggage and contents may \n     become damaged during the process of fitting carry-on luggage \n     onto boarded aircrafts; and\n       Whereas, although checked luggage may be lost, damaged, or \n     delayed for a variety of reasons, baggage handling systems, \n     airline negligence, and the act of luggage offloading to \n     accommodate extra fuel have also been discussed as reasons \n     for lost, damaged, or delayed passenger luggage; and\n       Whereas, the aforementioned concerns of airline passengers \n     are issues of consumer protection for which the United States \n     Congress has the constitutional power to address and \n     determine fair and reasonable solutions through codified law \n     or regulatory rulemaking: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to regulate airline baggage fees and \n     processes for consumers as it relates to transportation of \n     passenger luggage and passenger delays resulting from lost, \n     damaged, or delayed luggage; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-71. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as are necessary to amend the \n     employer shared responsibility provisions regarding employee \n     health coverage under Section 4980H of the Internal Revenue \n     Code, as enacted by the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act, to eliminate penalties on school districts; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 87\n\n       Whereas, a highly contentious aspect of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148), \n     referred to hereafter as ``the ACA'', is its imposition of \n     financial penalties on employers known as ``employer shared \n     responsibility''; and\n       Whereas, the employer shared responsibility penalty applies \n     to certain businesses with fifty or more full-time employees \n     that either do not offer insurance or offer coverage which \n     does not meet minimum standards set forth in the ACA; and\n       Whereas, after nearly four years of delays and regulatory \n     uncertainty regarding application of the employer shared \n     responsibility penalty following enactment of the ACA in \n     March of 2010, the Internal Revenue Service, in its final \n     regulations on the penalty issued in February of 2014 (79 \n     Fed. Reg. 8544 (February 22, 2014)), provided that there is \n     no exclusion from the penalty for government entities; and\n       Whereas, for purposes of the penalty, a ``full-time \n     employee'' is now defined as any employee working an average \n     of more than thirty hours per week or one hundred thirty \n     hours per month; and\n       Whereas, because many part-time and temporary school \n     personnel count as ``full-time employees'' under the ACA, the \n     school districts of this state now face crippling financial \n     penalties, typically in the amount of two thousand dollars \n     per employee who lacks health coverage, for not providing \n     health coverage to personnel who traditionally have not been \n     considered full-time employees: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to amend the employer shared responsibility \n     provisions regarding employee health coverage under Section \n     4980H of the Internal Revenue Code, as enacted by the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, to eliminate penalties on \n     school districts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-72.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Rounds):\n  S. 1877. A bill to require the Attorney General to appoint a special \nprosecutor to investigage Planned Parenthood, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have all been disturbed--just really \noutraged--about the things that have come from Planned Parenthood \nrecently. We have seen the videos exposing their casual disregard of \nhuman life. It is unconscionable. It is very sad. We have known this \nfor a long time. The junior Senator, Mr. Lankford, back when he was in \nthe House of Representatives was introducing bills to defund Planned \nParenthood, and that was before the most recent events that have \nhappened.\n\n  The Center For Medical Progress spent 3 years investigating Planned \nParenthood and produced at least three videos revealing what appears to \nbe an intentional and illegal harvesting of body parts from aborted \nbabies.\n  There are countries such as China that condone killing children, but \nour Nation should not be condoning the act of killing our own children \nor allowing these corrupt organizations to sell body parts for profit. \nThere was a book that was written that I remember very well entitled \n``Modernizing China'' by Anthony Kubek. This was 30 years ago, when \nthere was still a separation between China and Taiwan. They talked \nabout at that time having a limit on how many babies people could have. \nThey would go in and find out that there was one more child than they \nshould have had, and they would take that baby and kill it. Of course, \nthe harvesting of body parts was taking place there. That was China. \nThis is America. It is hard to believe this could be happening.\n  It is not about being pro-life or pro-choice anymore; it is about our \ncountry's moral conscience. If Planned Parenthood has either profited \nfrom selling aborted babies' organs or they have modified procedures \nused to conduct an abortion for the purposes of obtaining body parts, \nthen they have broken the law.\n  In fact, the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 \nstates that ``no alteration of the timing, method or procedures used to \nterminate the pregnancy [may be] made solely for the purposes of \nobtaining tissue.'' That includes arms, legs, kidneys, and body parts, \nbut this is exactly what Planned Parenthood has admitted to doing in \nthese videos.\n  The Federal law also states it is unlawful to sell human fetal \ntissue. Title 42 of the U.S. Code, section 289g-2(a) states: ``It shall \nbe unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise \ntransfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the \ntransfer affects interstate commerce.'' Again, it is illegal.\n  Based on the evidence in these videos, particularly with the Planned \nParenthood employees haggling and negotiating over prices, joking about \nit, and using the income of the dead babies' body parts to buy a \nLamborghini--some kind of automobile--it seems as if it is commonplace. \nThere is a total disregard for the babies or what they were doing.\n  My colleague Senator Ernst of Iowa and I, along with others in the \nSenate, wrote to the Department of Health and Human Services requesting \nanswers to these questions.\n  One thing that is important to note is that Planned Parenthood \nreceives $1.4 million of taxpayers' money every day. It is unthinkable \nthat they are being supported by the taxpayers in the United States, \naccording to their 2013-2014 annual report. They received 528.4 million \ntaxpayer dollars and then performed and profited from illegal and \nimmoral actions taking the lives of innocent babies. This is so \nincredibly evil it is even hard to talk about.\n  We are talking about women being manipulated into putting their \nhealth on the line for a government-funded organization to profit from \nharvesting their child's body. Vulnerable women are being coerced into \nhaving abortions and delaying the abortions until the baby has grown to \nthe age within the womb that they would have fully developed body parts \nin order to sell. This is what is happening today.\n  Planned Parenthood fights to keep mothers from seeing the human value \nof their babies with an ultrasound. They don't want the mother to hear \nthe baby inside their womb with an ultrasound, but they will use the \nsame technology to guide them to more valuable organs as they perform \nabortions for monetary gain. These actions deserve to be fully \ninvestigated. Crimes have been committed. It is our moral obligation to \nfully prosecute any violations of the law.\n  Today I have introduced legislation that would require the \nappointment of a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute these \natrocities. To pay for this, the legislation would rescind all moneys \nthat have been appropriated to Planned Parenthood and provide the \nspecial prosecutor with as much of this money to conduct the \ninvestigation as is necessary.\n  We have to protect innocent lives. Now that this has opened the door \nto a reality that has been suspected for so many years, this Senator \nwants America and the world to know that endangering women's health and \nprofiting from killing children is not acceptable.\n  The video just released today shows a lab technician placing and \ncelebrating the monetary value of a baby's arms, legs, kidneys, and \nspinal cord as they pulled apart its body.\n  The bill is S. 1877. We have gotten a lot of calls about it. I didn't \nwant to let this opportunity go by without coming to the floor and \ngetting something started to do something to stop the barbaric acts we \nare seeing on behalf of Planned Parenthood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6077-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6077-S6078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 233--RECOGNIZING JULY 28, 2015, AS ``WORLD HEPATITIS \n                                 DAY''\n\n  Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Schatz) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 233\n\n       Whereas hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and the incidence of \n     liver disease caused by these viruses, have become urgent \n     problems of a global proportion;\n       Whereas an estimated 350,000,000 people worldwide live with \n     chronic hepatitis B, and an estimated 780,000 people \n     worldwide die each year due to hepatitis B;\n       Whereas an estimated 150,000,000 people worldwide are \n     chronically infected with hepatitis C, and an estimated \n     500,000 people worldwide die each year due to a liver-related \n     illness caused by hepatitis C;\n       Whereas an estimated 1,000,000 people worldwide die each \n     year due to liver failure or primary liver cancer resulting \n     from a chronic infection of hepatitis;\n       Whereas an estimated 5,300,000 people in the United States \n     are infected with either hepatitis B or hepatitis C, \n     including 1,400,000 people who are chronically infected with \n     hepatitis B and 2,700,000 people who are chronically infected \n     with hepatitis C;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (referred to in this preamble as ``CDC'') estimated that \n     there were 19,764 new hepatitis B infections and 29,718 new \n     hepatitis C infections, respectively, in the United States in \n     2013;\n       Whereas the CDC has found significant increases in the \n     transmission of new hepatitis cases in the United States \n     since 2010, including a 151 percent increase between 2010 and\n\n[[Page S6078]]\n\n     2013 in new transmissions of hepatitis C in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas chronic viral hepatitis claims thousands of lives \n     each year in the United States, with 19,368 deaths due to \n     hepatitis C in the United States in 2013;\n       Whereas, in 2014, $4,500,000,000 in Medicare funds were \n     spent on hepatitis C treatments;\n       Whereas a person who has become chronically infected with \n     hepatitis B or hepatitis C may not have symptoms for up to 40 \n     years after the initial infection occurred;\n       Whereas African Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific \n     Islanders, Latinos, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, gay and \n     bisexual men, and persons who inject drugs intravenously all \n     have higher rates of chronic viral hepatitis infections in \n     the United States than other groups of people;\n       Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders bear the \n     greatest burden of hepatitis B related deaths in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas hepatitis C is 10 times more infectious than human \n     immunodeficiency virus (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``HIV'');\n       Whereas hepatitis B is 50 to 100 times more infectious than \n     HIV;\n       Whereas an estimated 25 percent of people who live in the \n     United States and are infected with HIV are also infected \n     with hepatitis C;\n       Whereas life expectancies for persons infected with HIV \n     have increased with antiretroviral treatment, and liver \n     disease, much of which is related to hepatitis B and \n     hepatitis C infections, has become the most common cause of \n     death among this population that is not related to acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome;\n       Whereas, despite the fact that chronic viral hepatitis is \n     the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, \n     65 percent of people living with hepatitis B and an estimated \n     75 percent of people living with hepatitis C are unaware of \n     their infection;\n       Whereas hepatitis B is preventable through vaccination, and \n     both hepatitis B and hepatitis C are preventable with proper \n     public health interventions, including programs that offer \n     access to sterile injection equipment for people who inject \n     drugs intravenously;\n       Whereas effective and safe treatment is available for \n     people living with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, including new \n     curative treatments for hepatitis C;

which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 20\n\n       Whereas, July 26, 2015, marks the 25th anniversary of the \n     date of enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n     1990 (referred to in this preamble as the ``ADA'');\n       Whereas the ADA has been one of the most significant and \n     effective civil rights laws passed by Congress;\n       Whereas, prior to the date of enactment of the ADA, \n     individuals with disabilities were too often denied the \n     opportunity to fully participate in society due to \n     intolerance, misunderstanding, ignorance, or unfair \n     stereotypes;\n       Whereas the dedicated efforts of passionate and courageous \n     disability rights advocates served to awaken Congress and the \n     people of the United States to the discrimination and \n     prejudice that individuals with disabilities face;\n       Whereas Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to craft \n     legislation to make discrimination against individuals with \n     disabilities illegal;\n       Whereas Congress passed the ADA, and President George \n     Herbert Walker Bush signed the ADA into law on July 26, 1990;\n       Whereas the purpose of the ADA is to fulfill the goals of \n     opportunity, independent living, integration, and economic \n     self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities who live \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the ADA--\n       (1) prohibits employers from discriminating against \n     qualified individuals with disabilities;\n       (2) requires that State and local governmental entities \n     accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities;\n       (3) requires a place of public accommodation to take \n     reasonable steps to ensure that the goods and services it \n     provides are accessible to individuals with disabilities; and\n       (4) requires new trains and buses to be accessible to \n     individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas the ADA has played a historic role in allowing more \n     than 55,000,000 individuals in the United States who have \n     disabilities to better participate in society by removing \n     barriers to employment, transportation, public services, \n     telecommunications, and public accommodations;\n       Whereas the ADA has served as a model for disability rights \n     in other countries;\n       Whereas every individual in the United States, not just \n     those with disabilities, benefits from the accommodations \n     that have become commonplace since the passage of the ADA, \n     including curb cuts at street intersections, ramps for access \n     to buildings, and other accommodations that provide access to \n     public transportation, stadiums, telecommunications, voting \n     machines, and websites;\n       Whereas, 25 years after the date of enactment of the ADA, \n     it remains a crucial tool, as children and adults with \n     disabilities still experience barriers that interfere with \n     their full participation in mainstream life in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, 25 years after the date of enactment of the ADA, \n     individuals in the United States who have disabilities are \n     twice as likely to live in poverty than individuals without \n     disabilities, and individuals with disabilities continue to \n     experience high rates of unemployment and underemployment;\n       Whereas, 25 years after the date of enactment of the ADA \n     and 16 years after the Supreme Court issued the decision in \n     Olmstead v. L.C., many individuals with disabilities still \n     live and work in segregated and institutional settings \n     because of a lack of access to support services that would \n     allow such individuals to live and work in their community;\n       Whereas, 25 years after the date of enactment of the ADA, \n     the ADA remains a crucial tool for individuals with \n     disabilities who experience barriers to accessability in \n     telecommunications and information technologies; and\n       Whereas the United States has a responsibility to welcome \n     back and create opportunities for the tens of thousands of \n     working-age veterans who have been wounded in action or have \n     suffered injuries or illnesses related to their service in \n     the Global War on Terror: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 25th anniversary of the date \n     of enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (2) salutes everyone whose efforts contributed to the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (3) encourages everyone in the United States to celebrate \n     the advancement of freedom and the expansion of opportunity \n     made possible by the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to \n     support opportunity, independent living, economic self-\n     sufficiency, and the full participation of individuals in the \n     United States who have disabilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S6078-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6078-S6079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2538.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transportation Empowerment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 63002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the objective of the Federal highway program has been \n     to facilitate the construction of a modern freeway system \n     that promotes efficient interstate commerce by connecting all \n     States;\n       (2) the objective described in paragraph (1) has been \n     attained, and the Interstate System connecting all States is \n     near completion;\n       (3) each State has the responsibility of providing an \n     efficient transportation network for the residents of the \n     State;\n       (4) each State has the means to build and operate a network \n     of transportation systems, including highways, that best \n     serves the needs of the State;\n       (5) each State is best capable of determining the needs of \n     the State and acting on those needs;\n       (6) the Federal role in highway transportation has, over \n     time, usurped the role of the States by taxing motor fuels \n     used in the States and then distributing the proceeds to the \n     States based on the perceptions of the Federal Government on \n     what is best for the States;\n       (7) the Federal Government has used the Federal motor fuels \n     tax revenues to force all States to take actions that are not \n     necessarily appropriate for individual States;\n       (8) the Federal distribution, review, and enforcement \n     process wastes billions of dollars on unproductive \n     activities;\n       (9) Federal mandates that apply uniformly to all 50 States, \n     regardless of the different circumstances of the States, \n     cause the States to waste billions of hard-earned tax dollars \n     on projects, programs, and activities that the States would \n     not otherwise undertake; and\n       (10) Congress has expressed a strong interest in reducing \n     the role of the Federal Government by allowing each State to \n     manage its own affairs.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to provide a new policy blueprint to govern the Federal \n     role in transportation once existing and prior financial \n     obligations are met;\n       (2) to return to the individual States maximum \n     discretionary authority and fiscal responsibility for all \n     elements of the national surface transportation systems that \n     are not within the direct purview of the Federal Government;\n       (3) to preserve Federal responsibility for the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways;\n       (4) to preserve the responsibility of the Department of \n     Transportation for--\n       (A) design, construction, and preservation of \n     transportation facilities on Federal public land;\n       (B) national programs of transportation research and \n     development and transportation safety; and\n       (C) emergency assistance to the States in response to \n     natural disasters;\n       (5) to eliminate to the maximum extent practicable Federal \n     obstacles to the ability of each State to apply innovative \n     solutions to the financing, design, construction, operation, \n     and preservation of Federal and State transportation \n     facilities; and\n       (6) with respect to transportation activities carried out \n     by States, local governments, and the private sector, to \n     encourage--\n       (A) competition among States, local governments, and the \n     private sector; and\n       (B) innovation, energy efficiency, private sector \n     participation, and productivity.\n\n     SEC. 63003. FUNDING LIMITATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the \n     Secretary of Transportation determines for any of fiscal \n     years 2022 through 2026 that the aggregate amount required to \n     carry out transportation programs and projects under this \n     title and amendments made by this title exceeds the estimated \n     aggregate amount in the Highway Trust Fund available for \n     those programs and projects for the fiscal year, each amount \n     made available for that program or project shall be reduced \n     by the pro rata percentage required to reduce the aggregate \n     amount required to carry out those programs and projects to \n     an amount equal to that available for those programs and \n     projects in the Highway Trust Fund for the fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 63004.
