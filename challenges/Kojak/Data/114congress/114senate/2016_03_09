Mr. President, the Senate will soon have a chance to \ncome together in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct, a bill designed to help address the prescription opioid and heroin \nepidemic that is spreading across our country.\n  We have seen the impact this crisis is having in all 50 States, how \nit is affecting people of all different ages and backgrounds. We know \nthat heroin and prescription opioid addiction devastates communities, \ndestroys families, and claims thousands of lives each year, but we also \nknow there are steps we can take here in the Senate that can help heal \nour Nation. For instance, just a few months ago we appropriated $400 \nmillion to opioid-specific programs--which is nearly one-third more \nthan what the Senate appropriated the preceding year--and all $400 \nmillion of those funds remain available to be spent today.\n  We can take another step forward now--a big step--with the passage of \nthis authorization bill. Just listen to what some officials are saying \nabout CARA's potential impact: Northern Kentucky's top anti-drug \nofficial said this bill can help ``allow individuals, families, and \ncommunities to heal from this scourge.'' The president and CEO of a \nnonprofit organization with programs in Kentucky noted that CARA can \n``create lasting impact in Kentucky'' and ultimately help lead to more \nKentuckians ``receiv[ing] the treatment they desperately need. A group \nthat provides overdose prevention training in the Commonwealth said \nthat CARA can give them a ``stronger foundation to move from training \nto action.'' President Obama's own drug czar noted that provisions like \nthose in CARA are ``critically important to make headway'' in this \nepidemic.\n  The bill before us, with all of its important provisions, is the \nresult of hard work and leadership from many colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. Of course, there is the lead Republican sponsor of this \nbill, the junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, who has worked closely \nwith colleagues in both parties, such as the junior Senator from New \nHampshire, Ms. Ayotte, as\n\n[[Page S1352]]\n\nwell as the junior Senator from Rhode Island and the senior Senator \nfrom Minnesota. There is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Grassley, who worked to move this bill quickly out of committee \nby voice vote.\n  I also thank the many Senators who worked with the bill managers to \nprocess the kinds of amendments both sides agreed would make this bill \neven better. That includes the senior Senators from Iowa and \nCalifornia, whose amendment would aid in targeting illegal drug \nimportation. It includes the senior Senator from West Virginia, whose \namendment will build upon education and awareness efforts in an effort \nto underline the dangers of opioid abuse. It includes the junior \nSenator from Pennsylvania, whose amendment would allow Medicare \nAdvantage and Part D plans to implement a prescription drug abuse \nprevention tool, a tool similar to what is already available and used \nin Kentucky in the Medicaid Program and in private plans.\n  The bipartisan collaboration we have seen thus far shows what we can \nachieve on behalf of the American people when we work together toward \nimportant shared priorities. The passage of CARA would bring us one \nstep closer to ending prescription opioid and heroin addiction and \noverdose, so let's keep working together to pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1352-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Republican leader and I have worked \ntogether in leadership capacities in the Senate for almost 20 years. He \nhas been the whip and I was the whip. I was majority leader, he was \nminority leader, and vice versa. My presentations the last few weeks do \nnot take away from the fact that Mitch McConnell and I are friends. We \nhave worked together for a long time, and we have done our best to move \nthe Senate forward. But that does not take away from my need as a \nSenator to pronounce publicly when he and I disagree. So I want to make \nsure the record is reflective of that.\n  As each day passes, the Republican leader continues to transform his \ncaucus into the party of Donald Trump. That is not good. You can see it \nin the Republicans' rhetoric. The Senators are using increasingly \nextreme and disturbing language in defending their unprecedented \nobstruction of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, who yet is \nunnamed.\n  The assistant Republican leader said the President's eventual nominee \n``will bear some resemblance to a pinata.'' We talked about, in the \npast, what a pinata is. He is comparing a Supreme Court nominee to a \nchildren's party favor that gets smashed repeatedly with a baseball bat \nor something similar to a baseball bat. That is nothing more than a \nthinly veiled threat from Senator Cornyn, serving notice on the coming \nassault on the President's nominee.\n  We should not forget that we don't know who this nominee will be. We \nknow nothing about this person, whether it is a man or a woman, \neducated at Harvard or Stanford or the University of Utah or the \nUniversity of New Mexico. We don't know. But the Republican leader \ndoesn't care who the eventual nominee is. It appears that is the case. \nHe doesn't want his Senators to care either. All he cares about is \nappeasing the Trump wing of the party--which is getting pretty big--and \nTrump's radical followers.\n  After all, this is the same Republican leader who yesterday again \nrefused to distance himself from Donald Trump. He refused to condemn \nhis hateful campaign for President. Instead, he pledged to support the \nRepublican nominee. It is really shocking to see this transformation. \nRepublicans have not always been this irrational and vicious.\n  Even Senator Cornyn used to know better. During Justice Alito's \nconfirmation hearings, the then-junior Senator from Texas was also \ntalking about pinatas as he decried personal attacks on Supreme Court \nnominees. Here is what he said:\n\n       I'm happy Judge Alito survived these unwarranted attacks. \n     I'm also sorry that his family had to be subjected to them, \n     as well. At some point, however, we as a committee will need \n     to come to terms with our confirmation process. The current \n     regime treats Supreme Court nominees more like pinatas than \n     human beings. And that's something none of us should be \n     willing to tolerate.\n\n  The Republican whip gave this pinata talk the day the Senate \nJudiciary Committee approved the Alito nomination. Now that President \nObama is the one putting forth a Supreme Court nominee, it seems the \nassistant Republican leader is willing to tolerate, even promote, these \n``unwarranted attacks'' he once denounced. Why the change? The answer \nis very simple: The senior Senator from Texas, like every other member \nof his caucus, is simply obeying the Republican leader's orders as he \nleads them to become the party of Trump, the caucus of Trump, the \nconference of Trump. This is the path the Republican leader has chosen \nfor his party--a path of demagoguery and lapsed constitutional duties, \na path which he forged and which led to the rise of Donald Trump. I do \nnot understand why so many of my Republican colleagues are blindly \nfollowing this path down a very bumpy road. Where are the moderate \nRepublicans--however few there may be--who see that they are being used \nby the Republican leader to appease the Trump wing of the party? Where \nare the voices of reason from within the Republican caucus who will \ntake a stand against this unprecedented dereliction of duty?\n  Keep in mind, a decade ago the Senator from Texas was decrying a \nRepublican nominee being treated like a pinata. Now, fast-forward 10 \nyears, and he is saying: I am going to make a pinata out of whoever it \nis, even though they don't know who it is.\n  I know there have to be some moderate Republicans, or Republicans, \nbecause outside of this building, there are Republicans urging their \ncolleagues to forgo this ludicrous obstruction.\n  A person I enjoyed working with right here, a very conservative \nSenator from Mississippi, Trent Lott, was the majority leader, and I \nworked with him very closely. He was a conservative, I repeat, but he \nwas very pragmatic. Yesterday or the day before, he lamented his \nparty's handling of the Supreme Court vacancy. Here is what he said:\n\n       I probably would've handled it differently. My attitude, \n     particularly on the Supreme Court, was that elections do have \n     consequences, sometimes bad, and I tried to lean toward being \n     supportive of the president's nominees, Democrat or \n     Republican.\n\n  That is how we should do things around here. It was the standard that \nif a President put forward a nominee and that person did not have some \nethical problems and was basically qualified, we would take care of \nthat. There is no better example of that than Clarence Thomas. I didn't \nvote for Clarence Thomas. I wish he hadn't gotten enough votes. But we \ndid not stop that matter from going forward. He just barely made it. He \ngot 52 votes. But there was no filibuster. He was nominated by a \nRepublican President. The President liked him. On paper, he was \nqualified. He was a graduate of Yale Law School. But that isn't how \nthey are doing things around here anymore.\n  What Trent Lott said--he is not alone. Former Republican Senator from \nIndiana--someone we all liked a lot--Dick Lugar is urging Senate \nRepublicans to do the right thing and honor their constitutional duty. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       I can understand their reluctance given the controversy \n     that surrounds all of the debate that has already occurred. \n     But that is not sufficient reason to forgo your duty.\n\n  What Richard Lugar is saying is: Do your jobs. You have a \nconstitutional obligation to do that.\n  Those are two quotes I just gave from strong Republican leaders \ntelling Senate Republicans to do their jobs. So why won't they? Of the \nsix nominations made to vacancies that have existed during Presidential \nelection years since 1900--more than 100 years ago--each of the six has \nbeen confirmed by the Senate. That is what the Senate has done in the \npast and should do now.\n  I say to my friends across the aisle: Listen to reason. Heed your \nconstitutional duties. Listen to what the American people are \nsaying. They are not taking a popular stand. It is wrong. Don't fall on \nyour sword for Donald Trump and his kind. Don't sacrifice your \nintegrity as a Senator. Stand up\n\n[[Page S1353]]\n\nand do the right thing. Promise to give President Obama's nominee a \nmeeting, a hearing, and a vote. That is your job, so do it.\n\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor.

Mr. President, there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, \nand this Chamber and the American people must fully understand what is \nat stake in choosing the person to fill that vacancy. For a generation, \nJustice Nino Scalia was the conservative heart of the Supreme Court. \nWhoever takes his seat will not replace him because there is no \nreplacement, but his passing has the potential to dramatically shift \nthe delicate balance of the Court. Should Justice Scalia be replaced by \na philosophically liberal Justice, the implications for the rights of \nAmericans and the direction of our Nation would be profound.\n  A liberal Justice may mean that the individual right to keep and bear \narms will be nullified and laws that deprive Americans of the means to \nprotect themselves and their families will proliferate. A liberal \nJustice may mean that the President's extraconstitutional Executive \norder to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants will be upheld, trampling \nthe separation of powers and the will of the American people. A liberal \nJustice may mean that President Obama's plan to destroy America's coal \nindustry will survive, destroying thousands of jobs and steady income \nfor American families.\n  A liberal Justice may mean that the government will be empowered to \nforce people of faith to violate their deeply held beliefs to subsidize \nabortifacients they abhor, and these are only the issues we can \nforesee. Novel issues that strike at the core of our constitutional \norder will continue to arise and how they are settled will hinge \ngreatly on the next Justice. Because so much depends on who the next \nJustice is, we cannot rush into this decision. Because the law may take \nsuch a dramatic turn, the Members of this Chamber must first get the \ninput of the American people on what the direction of our country \nshould be, and because the next Justice will guide American law for the \nnext generation, the Senate should not subordinate our constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent on a Supreme Court nominee to a \nlameduck President with a stale mandate.\n  This is the way forward that the majority leader and Chairman \nGrassley have charted, and it is the right one. After all, we have an \nelection in November. In a few short months, we will have a new \nPresident and new Senators who can consider the next Justice with the \nfull faith of the American people.\n  Why would we cut off the national debate about this next Justice? Why \nwould we squelch the voice of the people? Why would we deny the voters \na chance to weigh in on the makeup of the Supreme Court? There is \nabsolutely no reason to do so or at least no principled reason to do \nso. That is why no Congress in our history has confirmed a Supreme \nCourt nominee of a lameduck President of either party for a vacancy \nthat arose in an election year.\n  Abiding by this practice this year is even more pressing. Some of my \nDemocratic colleagues argue that the American people have already \nweighed in on the Supreme Court by reelecting President Obama in 2012, \nbut I will remind those who make this argument that the Constitution \nrequires two institutions, the President and the Senate, to agree upon \na new Justice, and in 2014 the voters overwhelmingly chose to send \nRepublicans to the Senate, making clear their dissatisfaction with this \nPresident's cavalier attitude toward the Constitution and his duty to \nexecute the laws as written. If the 2014 election meant anything, it \nmeant that Americans do not want this President to determine alone the \ncourse of American law for a generation in the Supreme Court. When \nArkansas elected me in 2014 to represent them, they sent me to \nWashington with the mandate to act as a check on the President, and I \nwill carry out that mandate.\n  Many of my Democratic colleagues have come to this floor to demand \nthat the Senate's longstanding practice of declining to confirm Supreme \nCourt Justices in an election year be discarded and a nominee \nconsidered right away. Perhaps the most impassioned of these pleas come \nfrom the senior Senator from Nevada; that the minority leader would \nwish to discard a longstanding practice of the Senate--particularly one \nrelated to the judicial nominations--is not a surprise. He was, of \ncourse, the person in 2013 who detonated the so-called nuclear option, \ndiscarding the 60-vote threshold for appellate and district court \njudicial nominees that existed in this Chamber for 200 years. He did so \nin order to steamroll the institutional rights of the minority party \nand pack the lower courts with as many liberal Obama nominees as \npossible.\n  In terms of dignity and public esteem, such as he had, that ill-\nconsidered move cost the minority leader dearly. He could only exercise \nthe nuclear option if he flip-flopped on his prior vehement opposition \nto it. In 2005, the minority leader stood steadfastly against the \nnuclear option when it served his political interests. He called the \nnuclear option wrong, illegal, and even un-American. He was--to adapt a \nfamiliar saying--against the nuclear option before he was for it.\n  In the current debate over filling Justice Scalia's seat, we are \nseeing the minority leader perform a similarly brazen flip-flop, not \nthat we should be surprised by that. Today the minority leader claimed \nthat the Constitution compels the Senate to immediately take up any \nnominee President Obama sends our way, but 10 years ago, again, he sang \na much different tune. The minority leader came to this very same floor \nto speak passionately in defense of the constitutional prerogative of \nthe Senate to defer a vote on the President's Supreme Court pick. He \nforcefully stated that nowhere in the Constitution does it say the \nSenate has a duty to give Presidential nominees an up-or-down vote. It \nsays appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, and that is very different than saying that every nominee \nreceives a vote.\n  What has changed in the 10 years since the minority leader uttered \nthose words? Well, of course, merely the politics of the situation.\n  I ask, if the current President were a Republican, would the minority \nleader be taking the position he is today?\n  If the current President were not a fellow Democrat, would the \nminority leader still be inclined to trash the constitutional \nprerogatives of the Senate and abandon its longstanding customs?\n  In light of what you might call the diversity of the minority \nleader's views over time, I think it is understandable that questions \nhave been raised about the sincerity of his position. In the quiet \nmoments following the rambling jeremiads that the minority leader \ndirects at Republicans on the Senate floor, I think my colleagues might \nbe forgiven if they entertain the thought that the principled ground on \nwhich he claims to stand is slightly less than firm.\n  In the coming months, there is much work for Congress to do. We must \npass a bill to fund and rebuild our military.\n\n[[Page S1354]]\n\nWe must continue to improve the conditions for wage growth and the \ncreation of new jobs. We must conduct stringent oversight to rein in \nthe excesses of the President on a quixotic pursuit of a legacy, but \nwith regard to a Supreme Court nomination, the only task for this \nSenate is to wait passionately and listen to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Mr. President, over the last 20 years we have seen \nincredible advancements in computing, telecommunications, and \ninformation technology. The United States has led the world in this \ninnovation thanks to our brilliant entrepreneurs, scientists, world-\nclass universities, massive private sector capital investment, a \nculture that rewards risk-taking, and a favorable regulatory \nenvironment, but increasingly our lead in innovation is threatened as \nAmerican businesses are forced to contend with an ever-growing number \nof outdated laws and regulations. While our businesses have often \nmanaged to succeed anyway, American industries deserve better from our \ngovernment.\n  Congress has a responsibility to ensure that our statutes and \nregulations are appropriately and narrowly tailored for today's economy \nand for the future. My Commerce Committee colleagues and I have been \neager to do our part in ensuring our Nation's communications laws keep \npace with innovation. Last week, we unanimously passed the bipartisan \nMOBILE NOW Act, which I introduced, along with the committee's ranking \nmember Senator Bill Nelson. This legislation will give a boost to \nAmerican innovators who are looking to make the next generation of \nwireless technology, known as 5G, a reality.\n  Mr. President, 5G wireless will obviously mean things like faster \nmovie downloads and more advanced smartphones, and it will also mean \nmassive leaps forward in areas like technology, entertainment, public \nsafety, and health care, as well as other economic benefits that will \nmake American lives better.\n  One of the best examples I have heard came from former FCC \nCommissioner Meredith Attwell Baker. She pointed out that right now a \nSmart Car communicating with 4G wireless technology takes 4\\1/2\\ feet \nto brake in response to an obstacle. By contrast, a Smart car with 5G \ntechnology would travel only 1 inch before braking, which could be the \ndifference between life and death. In order to make 5G wireless \ntechnology a reality, we have to put the right policies in place. \nPolicies that maximize the efficiency of the airwaves that transmit \nwireless broadband signals and the bands of electromagnetic spectrum \nthat make up our Nation's airwaves are in limited supply. While we \ncan't make more airwaves to carry additional spectrum, we can make \nchanges to how they are used and who uses them in order to improve \nefficiency and to do more of what we have.\n  The MOBILE NOW Act will require the government to make at least 255 \nmegahertz of spectrum available for private sector broadband use by the \nyear 2020. That is a lot of spectrum, but MOBILE NOW doesn't stop \nthere. The bill also directs government to assess more than 12,000 \nmegahertz of superhigh frequency spectrum for wireless broadband \nsuitability. For technical reasons, that spectrum has seen only limited \nuse to date, but as new technologies come online in the next few years, \nthis spectrum will become increasingly viable.\n  Indeed, most people expect that these superhigh bands will become \ncritical for our 5G future. Making spectrum available is important, but \nfreeing up spectrum does not help our digital economy unless and until \nwe put it to good use. This is why several of MOBILE NOW's provisions \nfocus on speeding up the deployment of the communications facilities at \nthe heart of our Nation's broadband networks. One way to do that is by \nputting a shot clock on Federal agencies to force them to make speedy \ndecisions on companies' applications to place wireless facilities on \nFederal property. This is critical for rural States like South Dakota \nand Nevada where placing wireless facilities on Federal lands could \nbring more high-speed Internet service to underserved communities.\n  The MOBILE NOW Act is an example of what is possible when Members put \naside their partisan differences and work together to come up with \ncommonsense proposals to spur economic growth. In addition to the \nprovisions Senator Nelson and I wrote, MOBILE NOW also includes all or \npart of six other bills which represent the work of Senators Booker, \nDaines, Fischer, Gardner, Klobuchar, Manchin, Moran, Rubio, Schatz, and \nUdall. We also adopted important amendments from Senators Heller and \nPeters. Even the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee--Senator Inhofe, as well as a longtime \nformer member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Boxer--made key \ncontributions to the bill's ``dig once'' section.\n\n  The MOBILE NOW Act would not have been possible without the \ncollaboration of these Senators. So it is my hope that this spirit of \nbipartisanship will also carry over to the Commerce Committee's efforts \nto reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission. Compared to other \nFederal agencies, the FCC is relatively small. But as the regulator of \nthe communications and technology industries, both of which are central \nto America's modern economy, the Commission has significant influence \nover the direction of our country.\n  Given the importance of the FCC, my colleagues might be surprised to \nlearn that Congress has not reauthorized it in more than a quarter of a \ncentury. You have to go back to 1990 to find the last time that the \nFCC, or the Federal Communications Commission, was reauthorized.\n  The work of the FCC has continued during that period, of course, but \nreauthorizing this agency every 2 years ensures that Congress will be \nable to make sure that the FCC has all the tools it needs to keep up \nwith our rapidly changing digital landscape. Some 26 years ago--I think \nit is safe to say--none of us in this Chamber knew anything about the \nWeb, let alone about smartphones or streaming videos.\n  Since then, the communications landscape has been fundamentally \ntransformed by digital technology, mobile services, and the Internet. \nYet the FCC in that entire time has gone unauthorized, making it the \noldest expired authorization in the Commerce Committee's broad \njurisdiction. I hope we can change that.\n  On Monday I introduced the FCC Reauthorization Act of 2016, which \nincludes a handful of noncontroversial, good-government reforms to go \nwith a 2-year reauthorization window. By restarting the FCC's regular \nauthorization cycle, the bill will ensure that necessary congressional \noversight of the FCC's budget and procedures occur routinely.\n  As indicated by the FCC Commissioners themselves at our oversight \nhearing last week, a consistent legislative reauthorization process \nwill produce a more responsible and a more productive relationship \nbetween Congress and the Commission. This will result in better \noutcomes for both consumers and the rapidly growing broadband-based \neconomy.\n  Telecom policy was once considered to be one of the least partisan \nissues in Congress. While the campaign for net neutrality has certainly \nchanged the political playing field over the last decade, I believe \nthere is still a lot of room for bipartisanship on tech and \ntelecommunications issues. The MOBILE NOW Act and the FCC \nReauthorization Act are two bills that can make a real difference. I \nlook forward to working with colleagues on the Commerce Committee and \nin the full Senate to pass both of these bills in the coming months.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate is taking a second step to \ndeal with a public health crisis that is destroying lives and damaging \ncommunities across the Nation, the epidemic of opioid and heroin abuse. \nStep 1 late last year was to reduce spending in other programs and \nincrease the dollars available to deal with this addiction.\n  An estimated 1.9 million American adults have an opioid-use addiction \nor disorder related to prescription drug pain relievers. Another \n500,860 have an opioid-use disorder related to heroin. Some 2.5 million \nAmericans are dealing with this problem. Our Nation's veterans are \nparticularly at risk for developing a dependency on opioids. A study \npublished in 2014 found a high prevalence of chronic pain among \nveterans because of their service. The chronic pain among veterans was \n44 percent compared to 26 percent in the general public.\n  There was a higher prevalence of opioid use, at 15.1 percent, in the \nU.S. military after a combat deployment, after possible injuries in \ntraining or injuries from an IED attack, compared to just 4 percent in \nthe general public. In 2014, more than 1,000 Missourians died from an \nopioid overdose. In St. Louis alone, deaths related to opioid abuse \nhave increased nearly three times since 2007.\n  Member after member has come to the floor, just as they came to me \nlast year as the chairman of the funding committee for health and human \nservices and explained what a problem this is in their State. The \nmajority leader made a point to me the other day that in Kentucky more \npeople died last year from drug overdoses than died from car accidents.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4 people \nevery day die from an overdose of opioid pain relievers, and 78 people \ndie every day from a combination of pain reliever overdoses or heroin \noverdose.\n  Many times those prescription opioids have been the pathway to \nheroin. Deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled in the past 14 \nyears. These are stunning statistics. The Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention has rightly labeled this an ``epidemic.'' This should \nget a good vote on the Senate floor today or tomorrow. But just because \nit gets a good vote, it does not mean it was not an important debate to \nhave.\n  Just because it gets a good vote and is now better funded than it has \nbeen in the past, that does not mean the Senate and the House don't \nneed to weigh in and say: Here is more specific ability to deal with \nthese problems in new ways. The good news is that addiction is a \ntreatable disease. Those who receive treatment can recover and go on to \nlead full, healthy, and productive lives.\n  In Missouri 72 percent of the individuals who had gone through our \nState's opioid treatment program in random tests test drug-free. The \nproblem with addiction is that only about 10 percent of individuals who \nare battling drug addiction receive treatment. That is why I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of this bill. That is why it is important that we \ncommit ourselves to win the fight against addiction.\n  We need to make sure that all of the stakeholders are involved. As to \nfirst responders, if you are a first responder attached to a fire \ndepartment, for instance, the odds are that you are going to respond to \nthree times as many drug overdoses as you do to fires. So whether it is \nfirst responders, paramedics, or the law enforcement community, we need \nto use all of our resources to try to be sure that we are doing what \nneeds to be done here.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that we are debating \nprovides grants from multiple government agencies to encourage State \nand local communities to pursue strategies that we know work. The only \nthing you have to do is be sure and implement those strategies.\n  The bill expands the educational efforts to understand addiction as a \nchronic illness. That promotes treatment and recovery and prevents \nopioid abuse from going forward. The bill also expands resources to \nidentify and to treat the incarcerated population suffering from \naddiction disorders with evidence-based treatment.\n  Finally, it expands disposal sites for unwanted prescription \nmedications to help them out of the hands of children and adolescents. \nWay too many unused painkillers are still in people's medicine cabinets \nor their dresser drawer, waiting for somebody else to find them and, \nonce they know they are there, to find them again.\n  This bill represents a strong bipartisan effort to address this \nepidemic. I filed two amendments that I think will improve the bill. I \nhope to see them in the managers' package. The first amendment will \njust simply expand the efforts that we have already made in a bill that \nSenator Stabenow and I introduced a couple of years ago and that got a \nsignificant pilot project in the Excellence in Mental Health Act.\n  What that does is to provide 24-hour access for people living with \nbehavioral health issues--with mental health issues. That would include \nsubstance abuse disorder. Excellence in Mental Health creates a \ndemonstration program that really just simply, in the right kind of \nfacilities, requires that mental health is dealt with like all other \nhealth--that behavioral health is dealt with like all other health.\n  When we started that debate, there was a belief that no more than 20 \nStates would implement Excellence in Mental Health if every State in \nthe country were allowed to do it if they wanted to. We now have 24 \nStates that have applied to be one of the eight State pilots. The \nadministration said: Why don't we increase the 8 States to 14 States? \nWe have an amendment to this bill that would say: Let's go ahead and \nincrease the 14 States to all 24 States, because not only is this the \nright thing to do but what these States will find out is that when you \ndeal with mental health like all other health, you probably save money \nbecause the other health issues that people with behavioral health \nissues have are so much more easily dealt with.\n  It has been long said that we have really turned over, in an \noutrageous way, the mental health obligations of our society to the \nlocal police departments and the emergency rooms. That is no way to do \nthis. It is no way to solve this problem. We are about 50 years behind. \nWe are beginning now to catch up in the ways we should.\n  I also filed an amendment to authorize the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to use telehealth to allow this program to work more \neffectively, to allow telehealth to be one of the specifically \nreimbursable opportunities here.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, individuals in rural \ncommunities are more likely--not as likely, not less likely, but more \nlikely--to overdose on prescription painkillers than people in the \ncities, people in urban areas. In fact, death rates from overdoses in \nrural areas now greatly outpace the rate in large metropolitan areas, \nwhich historically had higher rates.\n  So what do you do to connect those individuals with the kind of help \nthey might need on a basis that they can turn to that help when they \nneed to? One way to do that, certainly, is telehealth treatment \noptions. Telehealth allows individuals in rural or medically \nunderserved areas--many of whom just simply don't have other treatment \noptions--to receive the care they need, to receive the attention their \nissue needs remotely.\n  Additionally, telehealth can be an important component in ensuring \nthat those patients receiving treatment for pain management use opioids \neffectively and appropriately and don't get started down the wrong path \nand the wrong way.\n  In July 2014, the Journal of the American Medical Association \npublished a study that followed patients who reported moderate to \nintense chronic musculoskeletal pain. Of the 250 patients in the study, \nhalf received the normal standard of care and half received a year of \ntelephone monitoring in addition to normal care.\n  Patients who were monitored via telehealth were twice as likely to \nreport less pain after 12 months, having someone to talk to or being \nable to ask a question about whether they should increase the medicine \nbecause their pain was worse that day. Researchers\n\n[[Page S1356]]\n\nhave clearly noted that fewer telehealth patients started taking \nescalated doses of opioids than people who were simply taking medicine \non their own. Telehealth holds promise in lots of areas. I believe this \nhappens to be one of them. As chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices Appropriations Subcommittee, I was proud to see us increase \nfunding at a 284-percent increase. I will say again that we did that by \ncutting funding in other areas. One of the things the government has to \nstart doing is to truly prioritize. If everything is a priority, \nnothing is a priority.\n\n  Today, with this piece of legislation, the Senate is telling our \nfriends on the other side of the Capitol and around the country that \nthis is an epidemic we intend to deal with. I look forward to the \ncontinuation of this debate, the end of this debate, and passing this \nbill.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about Bob Levinson, a \nretired FBI agent who 9 years ago today disappeared in Iran. He was on \nthe tourist island of Kish. It is a little island off the coast of \nIran, and it is Iranian territory. It is in the Persian Gulf. It is \njust a few minutes' flight from Dubai. Bob Levinson was there. There is \nconflicting information, but in the process of checking out from his \nhotel and getting into a cab and going to the airport to return--I \nthink to Dubai--he disappeared 9 years ago today.\n  There is a lot of mystery surrounding the disappearance, and there is \na lot of mystery surrounding what has happened ever since. There is a \nmystery as to why the FBI, shortly after his disappearance, was \nsomewhat lackadaisical about pursuing it. It is a mystery as to why the \nCIA was not coordinating with the FBI in pursuing vigorously the \ndisappearance of Bob. There is no mystery surrounding the fact that, \nfinally, the two agencies got their act together and started to \nvigorously pursue the disappearance of Bob Levinson. I wish to give \ngreat credit to the agency, since they tried to get to the bottom of \nit, but that has led us nowhere, and here we are 9 years later.\n  It is particularly troubling to all of us, including all of our \nnegotiating team for the Iranian nuclear agreement, because at every \nmeeting, both high level and low level, at the direction of our \nSecretary of State, first Hillary Clinton and then John Kerry, over and \nover it was brought up to the Iranian Government. It is frustrating for \nthis Senator, being the Senator from Florida where a wife and seven \nchildren are left behind, and for Christine Levinson, whom I have met \nwith many times, as well as her sons and daughters and most recently \nboth Christine and her son, as they plead for help, for just any \ninformation.\n  About 5 years ago there was proof of life, and it was a video, and \nBob was looking very gaunt. He had been gone several years at this \npoint. He was pleading: Don't forget him. Sometime after that, but \nwithin a year, the last proof of life was a photograph showing an even \nmore emaciated Bob with a huge beard and unkempt hair. Again, the \npicture says all we need to know. Why is he being left behind? Here, 9 \nyears later, supposedly we don't know anything.\n  This Senator, on behalf of Christine and her family, went years ago \nto the Iranian mission at the United Nations--the only place that Iran \nhad an ambassador here in the United States, since we do not have \ndiplomatic relations--and made the case on humanitarian grounds. That \ncase has been made over and over and over again, including directly \nwith Foreign Minister Zarif and the new Iranian Ambassador last \nSeptember, in a meeting of a handful of Senators on behalf of all of \nthose who have been kept by Iran. Subsequently, some have been \nreleased, including the fellow from Michigan, the former marine, and so \nforth, whom we know about--but nothing about Bob Levinson.\n\n  Of course, the Government of Iran always says: We don't know anything \nabout it. Oh, we thought he was in Pakistan.\n  Those are always the answers. But he disappeared in Iran, and with \nthe very strict state-controlled Iranian security apparatus, obviously, \nthey know what happened. Certainly, 9 years later, they should know \nwhat happened or at least have the capacity to be able to find out what \nhappened to Bob Levinson. The rest of us keep searching in every \npossible way.\n  A couple of years ago it became apparent to this Senator that the \nAssociated Press was about to publish a story talking about Bob \nLevinson's clandestine activities. This Senator called the executive \neditor and pled that they not publish the story, that they do what the \nresponsible New York Times had done. New York Times investigative \nreporter Barry Meier sat on the story for over 3 years, knowing that if \nthe story about clandestine activities were published, it could \njeopardize Bob's life. To no avail, the Associated Press executive \neditor said to this Senator: Well, they already know this. Despite my \npleading to them, the answer was no, and they went ahead and published \nthe article. I vigorously disagreed with the Associated Press's \nconclusions, and I think that jeopardized Bob's wherewithal as well as \nhis safety.\n  Here we are, several years later, 9 years after the apparent \ndisappearance, and still there is nothing about Bob Levinson. So it is \nthe conclusion of this Senator that if the Government of Iran--namely, \nPresident Ruhani, as told to us by his Foreign Minister Zarif--knows \nnothing about it, well, somebody in Iran does. Maybe that tells us \nsomething about Iranian society and the Iranian Government--that there \nare these different power centers, one being the Revolutionary Guard \nand another the exclusive Quds Force. But there is one person that is \nover all of this in Iran, and that is the Supreme Leader, and he should \nknow. All the pleas that have been made on the basis of a humanitarian \nplea for a family--a wife and seven children--thus far have been \nignored.\n  This brings us to the next point. According to New York Times \ninvestigative reporter Barry Meier, a meeting took place in 2011 in \nParis in the Iranian Embassy with the Iranian Ambassador by a group of \nprivate American citizens who were doing what they could to facilitate \nthe location of Bob or any information about Bob, and the Iranian \nAmbassador told them that, yes, Iran had Bob Levinson. This is \naccording to a story published in the New York Times by Barry Meier a \nfew months ago.\n  This Senator called Barry Meier and asked: ``Are you sure of your \nfacts?'' And he said yes. This Senator then called one of the people \nthat was associated with this audience of private citizens, and that \nperson, when I met with him, confirmed that what the New York Times had \npublished was accurate and true, and that, in fact, the FBI had been \ncalled and the FBI had met with representatives of the Iranian Embassy \nin Paris right across the street from the Embassy in a cafe in Paris.\n  This Senator called the former Deputy Director of the FBI--a man of \nimpeccable reputation--Sean Joyce, who before he was Deputy Director \nhad spearheaded the efforts on trying to find Bob Levinson and \ncontinued that in his new role as the No. 2 in the FBI. Just last week \nthis Senator talked to Sean Joyce, and he said that he didn't know \nanything about this. Well, if an investigative reporter has found out \nthis information and it has been confirmed by people who were there or \nknew of that meeting and, at the time in 2011, the top guy in the FBI \nwho is spearheading the efforts to try to get Bob Levinson, a former \nFBI agent, doesn't know about it, what does this suggest? It suggests \nthat there is a huge disconnect in the FBI, which leads this Senator, \nwho has been on this case for 9 years on behalf of a grieving wife and \nseven children, to wonder what in the world is going on.\n  Until this turmoil is sorted out, the bottom line is that we want Bob \nLevinson home with his family for humanitarian reasons. I know John \nKerry is doing all he can, but we have to find\n\n[[Page S1357]]\n\nanother way to get to the Supreme Leader. Maybe it is through some of \nthese private contacts. Why has that not been coordinated? I know the \nWhite House is involved in this, but do they know about that 2011 \nmeeting? If FBI agents were there on the case, why was the White House \nnot informed along with the leadership of the FBI? Something is \nterribly amiss, and we need to get to the bottom of it.\n  Sadly, on this ninth year of Bob Levinson's disappearance, a \npatriotic American who--poof--on the way to the airport disappeared \nfrom Kish Island, Iran--sadly, 9 years later, there is no information \nabout bringing Bob Levinson home.\n  To the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, the \nhead of the FBI, the head of all of our alphabet agencies: It is time \nto get the information about Bob and bring him home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds).

Mr. President, on February 13, 2016, the Supreme Court \nlost one of its Justices, our Nation lost a true legal giant.\n  Justice Scalia was described by colleagues as ``extraordinary,'' \n``treasured,'' and ``a stylistic genius.'' Beyond his unwavering \ndedication to upholding the originalist viewpoint of the Constitution, \nJustice Scalia was also wholeheartedly committed to his family. He was \na husband, father of 9, and grandfather to 36 grandchildren.\n  His son Paul said of him during his homily:\n\n       God blessed Dad with a love for his family. . . . He was \n     the father that God gave us for the great adventure of family \n     life. . . . He loved us, and sought to show that love. And \n     sought to share the blessing of the faith he treasured. And \n     he gave us one another, to have each other for support. \n     That's the greatest wealth parents can bestow, and right now \n     we are particularly grateful for it.\n\n  Justice Antonin Scalia was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1986 by \nPresident Reagan and was confirmed by the Senate in a unanimous vote. \nWhile his time on the Court often led to some criticism of his legal \nopinions and his very colorful dissents, he remained respected by his \ncolleagues, even those of the opposite end of the judicial spectrum. \nThis is a sign of true character--to have an open, honest debate about \na particular issue while respecting the individual person holding an \nopinion different from your own.\n  Justice Scalia said:\n\n       I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And some very good \n     people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't separate \n     the two, you gotta get another day job.\n\n  The sentiment was best portrayed through his friendship with Justice \nGinsburg. As one of his friends, she said:\n\n       We are different, but we are one. Different in our \n     interpretation of written texts. One in our reverence for the \n     Constitution and the institution we serve. From our years \n     together on the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We \n     disagreed now and then, but when I wrote for the Court and \n     received a Scalia dissent, the opinion ultimately released \n     was notably better than my initial circulation.\n\n  Justice Scalia was known for his wit and his sarcasm in his writings, \nfamously referring to legal interpretations of his colleagues as \n``jiggery-pokery,'' ``pure applesauce,'' and ``a ghoul in a late horror \nmovie.'' Yet it was these same criticisms that Justice Ginsburg said \nnailed the weak spots in her opinions and gave her what she needed to \nstrengthen her writings.\n  Justice Scalia represented a consistent, constitutional voice on the \nSupreme Court. Just as the Constitution is the pillar of our legal \nsystem, so too is his affirmation to this foundational document of our \nNation. He said:\n\n       It is an enduring Constitution that I want to defend. . . . \n     It's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the \n     Bill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution, as opposed \n     to what people today would like.\n\n  Justice Kennedy said:\n\n       In years to come any history of the Supreme Court will, and \n     must, recount the wisdom, scholarship, and technical \n     brilliance that Justice Scalia brought to the Court. His \n     insistence on demanding standards shaped the work of the \n     Court in its private discussions, its oral arguments, and its \n     written opinions. Yet these historic achievements are all the \n     more impressive and compelling because the foundations of \n     Justice Scalia's jurisprudence, the driving force in all his \n     work, and his powerful personality were shaped by an \n     unyielding commitment to the Constitution of the United \n     States and to the highest ethical and moral standards.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, with Justice Scalia's passing, we have a vacancy on \nthe Court to fill.\n  The question is, When?\n  I would submit, with only months left until the Presidential \nelection, that we should let the people decide.\n  I have heard over and over for the past 7 years that elections have \nconsequences, but apparently some people seem to only think elections \nhave consequences on Presidential elections. The American people \nelected a brand new Senate in 2014 because of their incredible \nfrustration with the operation of the previous Senate and because of \nthe direction that we are now heading under this President.\n  I have heard this argument for years: The President should be able to \ndo what he wants. He is the President. But may I remind everyone of a \ndocument in our National Archives called the U.S. Constitution, which \ngives divided power to our Nation. The President is not over the \nSenate, not over the House, and not over the Supreme Court.\n  Hyperbole of this has been overwhelming to me in the debate of the \npast few weeks. I have heard that unless we replace Justice Scalia \nright now, we will ``shut down the court.'' I have heard on this floor \npeople say that if we don't replace Justice Scalia immediately, it is \n``dangerous,'' it is ``unprecedented,'' it is unheard of. I have heard: \n``Do your job''--a failure to do your duty. I even heard one Senator \nsay: ``The Constitution says the President shall appoint and the Senate \nshall consent.''\n  Well, let me show you article II, section 2 of the Constitution where \nthat comes up. It says that the President ``shall have Power, by and \nwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided \ntwo thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate''--the \nPresident shall nominate. That is his constitutional responsibility. \nBut it is not the constitutional responsibility--it never says the \nSenate shall give consent to the President. Why? Because the \nConstitution gives the role of selecting a Supreme Court nominee in a \n50-50 responsibility between the Senate and the President of the United \nStates.\n  The President shall nominate; that is his responsibility. But that \nonly moves forward with the advice and consent of the Senate. There is \nno ``shall give consent.'' There is no requirement how it moves.\n  In fact, Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers, on this very \nissue, said that the ``ordinary power of appointment is confided to the \nPresident and Senate jointly.''\n  This is a 50-50 agreement. What we are facing right now are \nincredible attacks on the chairman of the Judiciary\n\n[[Page S1358]]\n\nCommittee because he dares to do what Vice President Biden, Senator \nSchumer, and Senator Reid recommended years ago. I even heard that we \nshouldn't listen to the words of Vice President Biden. I would \nunderstand why people would say that, because when you go back to Vice \nPresident Biden's words, when he was a Senator and chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, in the same spot Chairman Grassley is in now, this \nis what, at that time, Senator Biden said. Senator Biden, chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, arguing on this same issue, said: ``Arguing \nfrom constitutional history and Senate precedent, I want to address one \nquestion and one question only: What are the rights and duties of the \nSenate in considering nominees to the Supreme Court?''\n  This is from Vice President Biden--then Senator Biden:\n\n       Some argue that the Senate should defer to the President in \n     the selection process. They argue that any nominee who meets \n     the narrow standards of legal distinction, high moral \n     character, and judicial temperament is entitled to be \n     confirmed in the Senate without further question. . . . \n     Apparently, there are some in this body and outside this body \n     who share that view.\n       I stand here today to argue that opposite proposition.\n\n  This is from Vice President Biden. He stated at that time:\n\n       We have quashed the myth that the Senate must defer to a \n     President's choice of a Supreme Court Justice, the men and \n     women at the apex of the independent third branch of \n     Government.\n       Can our Supreme Court nomination and confirmation process, \n     so wracked by discord and bitterness, be repaired in a \n     Presidential election year?\n\n  Vice President Biden, as Senator Biden, said:\n\n       History teaches us that this is extremely unlikely. Some of \n     our Nation's most bitter and heated confirmation fights have \n     come in Presidential election years.\n       The Senate too, Mr. President, must consider how it would \n     respond to a Supreme Court vacancy that would occur in the \n     full throes of an election year.\n\n  Vice President Biden at that time said this:\n\n       It is my view that if the President goes the way of \n     Presidents Fillmore and Johnson and presses an election-year \n     nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously \n     consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the \n     nomination until after the political campaign season is over.\n\n  He said, instead:\n\n       It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the \n     political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme \n     Court nomination must be put off until after the election \n     campaign is over. That is what is fair to the nominee and is \n     central to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me, Mr. \n     President, we will be in deep trouble as an institution.\n\n  This past week Senator Reid came to the floor to discuss Senator \nGrassley and what he is doing, which is exactly what then-Senator Biden \nrecommended to be done, and he made this statement. Senator Reid said \nthis past week:\n\n       Last Thursday, the senior Senator from Iowa addressed the \n     Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, which took \n     place here in Washington. In his speech to them, here is what \n     Senator Grassley said: ``I feel it's about time that we have \n     a national debate on the Supreme Court and how it fits in \n     with our constitutional system of government.''\n\n  Then Senator Reid continued:\n\n       The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is suggesting that \n     we reevaluate the Founding Fathers' work, reevaluate the \n     Constitution of the United States, and change the \n     Constitution of the United States. Why is Senator Grassley \n     debating what the Constitution makes clear? The Senate must \n     provide its advice and consent on nominees appointed by the \n     President to the Supreme Court. Think of the irony. Justice \n     Scalia was a strict constitutionalist. Yet now, in the weeks \n     following his death, Senator Grassley wants to throw out the \n     Constitution just because President Obama gets to pick \n     Scalia's replacement.\n\n  That is what Senator Reid said this week.\n  Let's look at what Senator Reid said in 2005 on this exact same \nissue. In 2005, on this floor, Senator Reid said: ``The President of \nthe United States has joined the fray to become the latest to rewrite \nthe Constitution and reinvent reality.''\n  This is speaking of President Bush at the time. Senator Reid \ncontinued, ``Speaking to fellow Republicans Tuesday night, two days \nago. He said that the Senate `has a duty to promptly consider each \nnominee on the Senate floor, discuss and debate their qualifications \nand then give them the up-or-down vote that they deserve.' Referring to \nthe President's words--duty to whom? The duties of the Senate.'' This \nis from Senator Reid in 2005:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give Presidential appointees a vote. The fact \n     was even acknowledged by the majority leader that a vote is \n     not required. Senator Byrd asked the majority leader if the \n     Constitution accorded each nominee an up-or-down vote on the \n     Senate floor. The answer was no. Senator Frist was candid. \n     The answer was no. The language was not there, Senator Frist \n     said. He is correct. Senators should read the same copy of \n     the Constitution Senator Frist had memorized.\n\n  Continuing with what Senator Reid said:\n\n       It is clear that the President misunderstands the meaning \n     of the advice and consent clause. That is not how America \n     works. The Senate is not a rubber stamp for the executive \n     branch.\n\n  So earlier this week, Senator Reid chastised Senator Grassley, saying \nhe wants to rewrite the Constitution. In 2005 Senator Reid stood on \nthis floor and encouraged all Members to read the Constitution--that it \nnowhere requires that we take an up-or-down vote. So I don't know which \none to take on this--the current statements from Senator Reid or the \nprevious statements from Senator Reid--because they are in direct \ncontradiction.\n  Senator Schumer, on July 27, 2007, speaking about the last 18 months \nof President Bush's term as President, said:\n\n       For the rest of this President's term and if there is \n     another Republican elected with the same selection criteria \n     let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of \n     confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of \n     balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by \n     another Roberts; or Justice Ginsburg replaced by another \n     Alito.\n       Given the track record of this President and the experience \n     of obfuscation at the hearings, with respect to the Supreme \n     Court, at least: I will recommend to my colleagues that we \n     should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in \n     extraordinary circumstances.\n\n  I have also heard: Don't look at the words but the actions. Senator \nReid, Senator Schumer, and, when they were here, Senator Obama and \nSenator Biden have all filibustered Supreme Court nominees when they \nwere Senators--all four of them have. Suddenly, now this is a dangerous \nidea that will shut down justice and is completely unconstitutional, \nand there are shouts of ``Do your job'' that come from the same Senate \nleaders who blocked untold nominations from untold Republican \nPresidents and didn't allow amendments on basic bills.\n  There is a lot of emotion in this body. I get that. There are a lot \nof politics in this process. I would hope to bring some facts to light \nand to turn down the hyperbole and all the rhetoric. So let me bring \nsome basic facts to this.\n  The last time a Supreme Court vacancy arose in an election year and \nthe Senate approved a new appointee to the Court in that same year was \n1932. Since there is no nominee right now, it would not be possible to \nfill the vacancy in time for that individual to hear cases in the \nspring session of the Supreme Court. That means any nomination selected \nnow would only be able to serve--in our colleagues' arguments--in the \nfall, which is a much shorter session of the Supreme Court, before this \nPresident actually leaves. So we are talking about the final session at \nthe end of this fall--a very few number of cases.\n  Justice Stephen Breyer, just a few weeks ago, stated this about the \npassing of Justice Scalia:\n\n       We'll miss him, but we'll do our work. For the most part, \n     it will not change.\n\n  The Supreme Court is open and is working this week. In fact, the \nCourt hasn't halted at all. The Court has heard 10 cases already since \nJustice Scalia's passing, and they are continuing to release decisions.\n  It is a myth that there needs to be an uneven number of Justices for \nthe Supreme Court to actually work. In the past 6 years, 80 percent of \nthe cases were decided 6 to 3 or greater. So it is a small minority of \nthe cases that ever get to a 5-to-4 decision. And we don't know that a \n5-to-4 would end up not being a 5-to-3 at this point.\n  Eight members can operate the Court. In fact, the Constitution \ndoesn't even give a specific number to the Justices. How many Justices \nare on the Supreme Court has always been a decision of the President \nand the Congress\n\n[[Page S1359]]\n\ntogether. The first Congress, for example, enacted the Judiciary Act of \n1789, which stated the Supreme Court consists of ``a chief justice and \nfive associate justices.'' If you are counting right, that is six \nJustices on the early Supreme Court.\n  The size of the Court varied during the 19th century, with the Court \nshrinking to 5 Justices for a while, following the passage of the \nJudiciary Act of 1801, growing to as large as 10 Justices in 1863. Then \nin 1869, Congress changed the number to nine, where it has remained.\n  But the Court doesn't need nine Justices to actually decide a case. \nIn fact, Congress has established the quorum requirements to be only \nsix. If the Court ends in a tie decision, 4 to 4, or in the case of six \njustices, 3 to 3, the Court will not write an opinion but will affirm \nthe lower court, or it will ask for a reargument of the case.\n  In other words, the Court is already set up to function and is \nfunctioning, and it will continue to function with eight people.\n  I would say what is really happening is that the Democrats, who \nimplemented the nuclear option while they were leading the Senate and \npacked all the lower courts, urgently want to be able to pack the \nSupreme Court as well. That will not happen.\n  We will also not allow a recess appointment, as has been floated \nmultiple times in the media--the President will just do a recess \nappointment and go around us. The Senate chooses when the Senate is in \nrecess, not the President. So we can do this: We can remain in \ncontinuous session without recess to prevent a recess appointment by \nthis President through the rest of this year. Many of my Republican \ncolleagues and I have already agreed to be in Washington every 3 days \nfor the rest of this year to gavel in this body in pro forma session so \nthis President cannot put in a recess appointment judge.\n  Ironically enough, this right of the Senate was approved by the \nSupreme Court just a few years ago by a 9-to-0 ruling when this \nPresident tried to force in new members on the National Labor Relations \nBoard through a recess appointment, and this Supreme Court kicked those \nout, saying the President cannot choose when the Senate is in recess.\n  Our Nation faces really big issues: accelerating debt, threats from \nterrorism, a struggling economy, major education, and health care \nreform issues. This is a moment when the people of the United States \nshould speak about the direction of our Nation. We are still a nation \nof the people, by the people, for the people. And for the next \nPresident and for the next Supreme Court nomination, we should let the \npeople decide.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, last month we all learned with great \nsadness of Justice Antonin Scalia's passing after nearly 30 years on \nthe Court. He would have turned 80 years old on Friday, March 11.\n  In recent weeks, foremost on people's minds as they reflect on \nJustice Scalia's legacy and his life is his dedication to the letter of \nthe law, his respect for constitutional and statutory text, his view \nthat the U.S. Constitution is a sacred document which must be read and \nadhered to.\n  His decisions and opinions were aimed to follow the Constitution \nwherever it took him, even if it may not have been to a place where he \nwould agree politically. Justice Scalia not only understood the \nimportance of not legislating from the bench, but he also cared deeply \nabout the lesson being taught by the work of the Court. Through his \nwritings, his opinions, including his dissents, he taught us great \nlessons.\n  Now all of this is very important and relevant, ironically, as we \nconsider our role and path forward in the decision to fill his vacancy. \nInstead, unfortunately, we have seen rhetoric and arguments which fly \nin the face of that dedication to the text, to the Constitution, to \nstatutory law and rules, and following that letter.\n  My esteemed Democratic colleagues have taken to the Senate floor, and \nthey have encouraged outside groups to storm committee rooms--all \narguing that somehow there is a legislative or constitutional mandate \nthat the Senate have hearings, take a vote now, and not allow the \nAmerican people to weigh in through the election. They argue that \nsomehow the Senate is constitutionally obligated to hold hearings and \nvote right now before the election, but as Justice Scalia would surely \npoint out: Read the text. Look at the Constitution. Look at all \nrelevant statutes and rules. That is not the case. It is clear, \notherwise. In fact, it is crystal clear. So let's do that in homage to \nJustice Scalia.\n  He wrote many opinions arguing for exactly what I am saying: Read the \nclear language that is at issue--either the Constitution or a statute \nor whatever is at issue. He wrote opinions against what before his time \nwas rampant use of so-called legislative history, looking at the \nhistory of how a law was passed really to give people fodder to make it \nup as they go along and reach almost any conclusion and interpretation \nthey want to. Justice Scalia taught us--and he had a real impact on the \nCourt through his decisions--that we need an unwavering commitment to \nprinciple and respect to statutory text as written.\n  As he often said in so many different ways, ``Legislative history is \nirrelevant when the statutory text is clear.'' In one opinion he noted \nthat ``if one were to search for an interpretive technique that, on the \nwhole, was more likely to confuse than to clarify, one could hardly \nfind a more promising candidate than legislative history.'' He said \ndirectly that ``our cases have said that legislative history is \nirrelevant when the statutory text is clear.''\n  Again, that is a big part of his legacy and very relevant in this \ndiscussion about how the Senate should fulfill its duties. Let's look \nat the text of the Constitution and any relevant text like our rules \nbelow the Constitution.\n  In the U.S. Constitution, article II, section 2, clause 2 says \nclearly: The President ``shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public \nMinisters and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other \nOfficers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein \notherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law.''\n  That is what it says on the issue. That is all it says on the issue. \nThose words are straightforward, and those words do not mandate a \nhearing or a vote in any certain timeframe. It is very clear from the \nFounders and from numerous Court decisions since then that within the \nconstraints of those words, the Senate sets its rules of how to proceed \non all Senate matters, including confirmations. So another very \nimportant and very clear text that we should read word for word and \nadhere to are the standing Senate rules. Senate rule XXXI states: \n``When nominations shall be made by the President of the United States \nto the Senate, they shall, unless otherwise ordered, be referred to \nappropriate committees; and the final question on every nomination \nshall be, `Will the Senate advise and consent to this nomination?' \nwhich question shall not be put on the same day on which the nomination \nis received, nor on the day on which it may be reported by a committee, \nunless by unanimous consent.''\n  It only says when the vote cannot be taken. It doesn't say that a \nhearing has to happen or a vote has to be taken within a certain amount \nof time.\n  Another part of rule XXXI is even more direct on this point: \n``Nominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at \nwhich they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session \nwithout being again made to the Senate by the President.''\n  So this is even more direct and makes crystal clear that there is no \nrequirement of a hearing or a vote on any particular nomination in any \nparticular timeframe during a session. Again, that is very \nstraightforward, very crystal clear, but the Congressional Research \nService has a report which validates and confirms the obvious. Upon \ntheir review of all of this text, they say:\n\n       A committee considering a nomination has four options. It \n     can report the nomination to\n\n[[Page S1360]]\n\n     the Senate favorably, unfavorably, or without recommendation, \n     or it can choose to take no action.\n\n  So they say the obvious from reading the relevant text. Those are the \noptions. There is no requirement for a hearing or for a vote within any \ncertain timeframe.\n  There are other ``authorities''--I will put that in air quotes--which \nconfirm this view, and ironically those authorities I am referring to \nare Democrats who are taking exactly the opposite view now. When the \nshoe was on the other foot, time and time again, they said: There is no \nrequirement to move forward on any certain timeframe.\n  The minority leader, Harry Reid, said: ``Nowhere in [the \nConstitution] does it say the Senate has a duty to give Presidential \n[nominees] a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every \nnominee receives a vote.'' That is a direct quote.\n\n  In June of 2003, Senator Patrick Leahy--he is significant because he \nis ranking member of the Judiciary Committee--said clearly:\n\n       The Constitution divides the appointment power between the \n     president and the Senate. It expects senators to advise the \n     President, not just rubber stamp his choices. It says advise \n     and consent, not nominate and rubber stamp.\n\n  Even further back, in June of 1992, then-Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, now-Vice President Joe Biden argued for the need to set \naside partisanship and work to bring unity forward in the Senate by \nsaying: ``President Bush should consider following the practice of a \nmajority of his predecessors and not name a nominee until after the \nNovember election is completed.'' He said that during a Presidential \nelection year, just like we are in the midst of a Presidential election \nyear right now.\n  Chuck Schumer, another leader of the Judiciary Committee, said much \nthe same thing in the past, making crystal clear that there is no \nrequirement--in fact, he said 18 months before the expiration of \nPresident Bush's term. So not during his last year, but 18 months \nbefore the end of that term that the Senate shouldn't confirm any Bush \nnominee, except in extraordinary circumstances.\n  It is very clear from their own words that there is no obligation to \nuse any certain timeframe to have any absolute committee hearing or \nvote within a certain period of time. So then the question is, What is \nthe best thing to do for the American people? I firmly believe the best \nthing to do for the American people is to put the American people in \ncharge, to put them in the lead, to maximize their role, their power, \nand their vote. That is what the opportunity of a major Presidential \nelection gives us.\n  Of course, if you have a vacancy early on in the term of a President, \nyou are not going to have another big election for some time, but that \nis certainly not the case right now. We are in the midst of a huge \nelection with enormous consequences for the future, and it is very \nclear the choices--whatever the final two choices may be--would offer \nvery different options in terms of the type of Supreme Court Justice \nthey would appoint.\n  I think we best serve the American people in almost all cases--\ncertainly in this case--by maximizing their voice, their role, and \ntheir power. They often feel absolutely shunned, put to the side, \nignored by Congress, by Washington now. We need to put them in charge, \nand in this Presidential election year we have a unique opportunity do \nthat. That certainly is what I am committed to doing.\n  I can tell you, as I travel Louisiana, the huge majority of my fellow \ncitizens whom I have talked to agree with that approach. I just \nfinished doing four townhall meetings in all different parts of the \nState. In a few weeks I am going to do four more, all different parts \nof the State. That is not a scientific survey, but nobody came to those \ntownhall meetings who didn't agree with that path forward. A great \nmajority of calls and emails and letters from my fellow Louisiana \ncitizens on this issue absolutely confirm and support that path \nforward.\n  Let's put the American people in charge. They are crying for a voice. \nThey are crying with frustration over not being listened to by \nWashington. This is a major decision. Let's put them in charge. Let's \nlet them lead in this Presidential election year on this very important \nissue.\n  Of course, whoever is elected, the next President will have a big \nimpact on our country. That person will serve for 4, maybe 8 years and \nmake decisions that are enormous on a whole host of issues, but this \nappointment to the Supreme Court could have an even more lasting \nimpact, could have an impact for decades to come, and it is even more \nimportant in that frame of mind, in that viewpoint, to put the American \npeople in charge, to maximize their role and their voice about what \ndirection we should take.\n  So many Louisianians feel as I do. The Court has strayed from Justice \nScalia's proper philosophy of actually reading the Constitution and \nreading statutory text and applying it as written. So many Louisianians \nfeel as I do; that they are making it up, in many cases, as they go \nalong; that they are legislating from the bench; that they are using \nclever techniques, such as looking to legislative history--something \nJustice Scalia, as I noted, railed against--as ammunition to get to \nwhatever endpoint they desire to get to. That is not the role of any \ncourt, certainly not the role of the Supreme Court.\n  The Supreme Court should apply the Constitution and the law as \nwritten, not make it up as they go along, not legislate from the bench, \nnot get to some political endpoint through clever legal arguments--just \nas we in understanding our role should read the Constitution, should \nread the Senate rules and not suggest what is clearly not the case; \nthat somehow there is a mandate to have a hearing, to have a vote in \nsome set period of time.\n  I urge my colleagues to put the American people in charge. This is a \nbig decision, and I think we will do far better putting them in charge \nthan allowing some insider Washington game to control and manipulate \nthe process without hearing their voice, which we have every \nopportunity to properly hear through this important election this year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am so pleased we are making strong \nprogress on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I hope we \nwill get this bill done within a day. It is very important, especially \nto States with rural areas, such as the Presiding Officer's and mine, \nand I am glad we are starting to make headway.\n\n\n                         U.S.-Canada Relations\n\n  Today, Mr. President, I am here to talk about something else, and \nthat is the importance of the U.S. relationship with Canada. Senator \nCrapo and I cochair the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group \nand have been working in the trenches on everything from softwood \nlumber, to the Detroit-Windsor bridge crossing, to issues of \nintellectual property, to dairy, to beef, and with the arrival of Prime \nMinister Trudeau, this work has suddenly gotten a little more \nglamorous. We are excited about that and excited about the Nation's \nnewfound interest in our important relationship with Canada. In fact, \nCanada is one of our largest trading partners. There is so much \nbusiness that goes on between the Presiding Officer's State and Canada, \nas well as my State and Canada. Prime Minister Trudeau is bringing a \nnewfound interest in this work.\n  Many of our two countries' priorities, which include national \nsecurity, infrastructure, and energy, align closely. During this visit, \nI expect our relationship will deepen, and we will hear more about how \nour two nations will work together on our shared priorities. We hope \nthey will discuss hockey, which is something that is very important to \nMinnesota and Canada. A number of our hockey players have actually come \nfrom Canada, and a number of the Canadian hockey players have come from \nMinnesota. But we think there are other important topics as well.\n\n[[Page S1361]]\n\n  First, I will start with our economic relationship--a relationship \nthat supports 9 million U.S. jobs. Canada purchases more goods from \nAmerica than any other nation. If you asked people what country in the \nworld is the biggest purchaser of U.S. goods, I think they might not \npredict that the answer is Canada. Canada is the No. 1 buyer of goods \nproduced in 35 out of 50 States, including Minnesota. Last year \nCanadians bought $376 billion worth of goods made by American \nbusinesses, and it is a two-way street. The United States imports more \nthan $300 billion in Canadian goods every year.\n  Over the years, to enhance this relationship, we have taken many \nimportant steps to improve the flow of travellers and goods across our \ncommon border. In the wake of September 11, we created a U.S. passport \ncard, which is a secure but less expensive and more convenient \nalternative to a traditional passport. We removed unnecessary double \nscreening of luggage--a bipartisan bill I passed with Senator Roy Blunt \nof Missouri--and then expanded the number of preclearance airports, \nwhich allows American security personnel to be in those airports. I \nthink we are up to eight now.\n  We have agreed to build a new bridge connecting Windsor, Ontario, and \nDetroit, MI. It is a source of great concern. The bridge that is there \nnow is privately owned and has huge lines. It is not a very good \nsituation. So a new bridge is in the works, and we are very excited \nthat our two countries worked on that together.\n  I especially want to acknowledge Ambassador Doer, the longtime \nAmbassador from Canada to the United States who worked on that with our \ntwo Ambassadors. I also want to acknowledge the newly named Canadian \nAmbassador, Ambassador David MacNaughton, who will continue the strong \ndiplomatic relations between our countries.\n  Our national security partnership is also incredibly important. We \nshare the longest border in the world with Canada. Obviously border \nissues are important, but more than that, Canada, as part of NATO, has \nworked with us not only in Afghanistan, where they supplied many troops \nand now provide funding there, but they are also on the frontline with \nISIS. They actually have hundreds of trainers working on the frontline \nthere. I would be remiss not to mention them standing up to Russian \naggression in Ukraine. Believe it or not, Canada has a major Ukrainian \npopulation, and they have been our friend in dealing with Ukraine as \nwell.\n  Prime Minister Trudeau has also been a leader in welcoming refugees \nto the country. Right after his election, he showed up at the airport \nto greet Syrian refugees. It was not just a symbol; they actually \nbrought in 25,000 Syrian refugees during the last year and are expected \nto take in 10,000 more this year, which is significantly more in total \nthan the United States has been able to bring in. We know the vetting \nprocess is incredibly important, but we do want to thank Canada for \ntaking part in what is a travesty internationally.\n  They are working on combating Ebola with initiatives such as Power \nAfrica and are also working with us on the climate change numbers.\n  By the way, our two countries are working together with Mexico. We \nhave formed a very powerful trading block, and we want to encourage \nthat with our standards and other things that we do in terms of \nbuilding electrical capabilities to allow us, as a North American \nblock, with a new day in North America, which was agreed to among the \nthree Presidents of countries in the last 2 years, to compete in the \nblock in an increasingly competitive global economy, including \nharmonizing emission standards and doing other work together.\n  As one of the cochairs of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary \nGroup, we welcome the new Prime Minister to Washington. When I was \nsworn in as a U.S. Senator in 2013, my friends and colleagues \ncelebrated at the Canadian Embassy. I am the first person I have found \nto have my swearing-in at the Canadian Embassy, but I chose it to make \na point--that we should not forget one of our best trading partners. \nFor years it was the only Embassy draped in banners that read \n``friends, neighbors, partners, allies.'' So many other countries do \nnot acknowledge their friendship with the United States in a way that I \nthink they should. Canada doesn't hide it. Canada is proud of it. And \nwe welcome the Prime Minister today.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the opening words to the preamble of the \nConstitution of the United States are familiar to all of us: ``We the \nPeople.'' But what do those words mean?\n  It was ``the People'' who established the U.S. Constitution. We \nestablished, among other things, the Senate in article I, section 1, of \nthe Constitution. It is for ``the People'' that my colleagues and I, \nalong with every other public official across these United States, now \nserve.\n  And it was on behalf of ``the People'' that the Constitution \nestablished ``one supreme Court,'' consisting of judges appointed ``by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.''\n  Since the tragic passing of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, there \nhas been a great deal of debate about this particular provision of the \nConstitution. But there should be no controversy. The text of our \nfounding charter is clear.\n  The President has full and complete power to nominate individuals to \nthe Supreme Court, and the Senate has full and complete power to reject \nor confirm the nominee. It is as simple as that. Indeed, the Senate \nretains complete discretion with respect to whether it should even \nconsider--much less accept or reject--Presidential nominees.\n  This should not be controversial. It is how virtually every student \nof the Constitution--and how nearly every Member of Congress--has \nunderstood the Senate's power of advice and consent for the past 228 \nyears since the Constitution was ratified.\n  Senator Harry Reid said in 2005: ``Nowhere in that document does it \nsay the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote.''\n  Senator Pat Leahy in 2003 acknowledged that the power of ``advice and \nconsent'' included the power to withhold consent.\n  Then-Senator Joe Biden in 1992 argued from the floor of this Chamber \nthat the Senate should refuse to consider a Supreme Court nominee until \nthe people had spoken in the upcoming Presidential election.\n  But now, with the Presidential election in full swing, some of my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle maintain that the opposite is \ntrue. Some argue instead that the Senate is constitutionally obligated \nto hold hearings and to vote on any candidate President Obama might \neventually nominate to replace Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court. I \nrespectfully dissent.\n  If this a-textual and a-historical account of the Constitution were \naccurate--and it is not, but if it were--then prior Senates violated \nthe Constitution when they did not cast up-or-down votes on Supreme \nCourt nominees. Even the Standing Rules of the Senate would be \nthemselves suspect under this theory, contemplating as they do that \n``[n]ominations neither confirmed nor rejected during the session at \nwhich they are made shall not be acted upon at any succeeding session \nwithout being again made to the Senate by the President. . . . ''\n  Neither does the prospect of a temporary eight-member Supreme Court \nraise any significant constitutional concern or even any significant \npragmatic concern for the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  For instance, during the Supreme Court's 2010-to-2011 term, the Court \ndecided over 30 cases with 8 or fewer Justices participating, almost \nentirely as a result of recusals arising, as they often do in this \ncircumstance, from Justice Kagan's nomination. Similarly, following the \nretirement of Justice Powell in 1987, the Court acted on 80 cases with \n8 or fewer Justices. In short, the sky does not fall when the Court \noperates with only eight Justices. As Justice Breyer recently stated, \nthe work of the Court ``[f]or the most part . . . will not change.''\n  Now, we have to remember that any Supreme Court nominee made by \nPresident Obama would not be seated until weeks before the people \nchoose the next President. Let me explain what I mean by that. Even if \nthe President of the United States were to nominate someone today to \nserve on the Supreme Court of the United States to replace Justice \nScalia, using historical averages, under any calculation of the amount \nof time that it typically takes to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, \nthat confirmation could not be completed until after the Supreme Court \nis scheduled to have heard its last oral arguments for this term--the \nterm that began in October of 2015. What does that mean? Well, it means \nthat for the rest of this year, the Justice couldn't participate in \ncases being argued this year. What that also means is that by the time \nthe Court resumes its work and begins its next session starting in \nOctober of this year, we would be just weeks before the next \nPresidential election. Yet that would be the first moment at which any \nnewly confirmed Justice would start hearing cases being argued before \nthe Court--cases being argued on their merits for consideration before \nthe Court--just weeks before the next Presidential election.\n  Consider also that since the nomination of Justice Scalia to the \nSupreme Court in 1986, nearly 30 years ago, it has taken more than 70 \ndays, on average, for the Senate to confirm or reject a nominee after \nthat nominee has been submitted to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent.\n  So, again, based on that historic average, even if the President \nnominated somebody today and assuming that nominee were confirmed, that \nindividual would not be seated in time to hear or rule on any of the \ncases the Court is considering on the merits for its docket this year, \nand that would, of course, mean that the next time arguments were \nheard, the first time this particular Justice could participate in such \narguments on the merits before the Court would be just weeks before the \nPresidential election.\n  This is a lifetime appointment to the highest Court in the land--a \nCourt that considers not only the interpretation of Federal laws, \nstatutes, and regulations in operation within the Federal Government, \nbut also the very meaning of the Constitution itself. In light of the \nfact that this is a lifetime appointment to that Court and in light of \nthe fact that the people are about to speak this November to decide who \nought to occupy the Oval Office, we should, in respect and deference to \nthe people of this great country, wait until the American people have \nspoken. They deserve a voice.\n  In my view, the future of the Supreme Court is now at stake, and the \nelection for our next President is also, of course, well underway \nalready. So it is the people who should determine what kind of Supreme \nCourt they wish to have.\n  Now, the President is entitled, of course, to discharge his own \nconstitutional authority to nominate. No one can take that from him. \nThat belongs to him. But the Senate is equally entitled to withhold \nconsent and to protect the people's voice. We have to remember that it \nwas considered at the Constitutional Convention the possibility that \nthe Senate would itself have the exclusive power to nominate executive \nbranch officials. It was also suggested that the Senate be given a veto \npower over the President's appointment prerogative. Neither of those \nended up in the Constitution. Instead, what ended up in the \nConstitution, based, I believe, on the Massachusetts Constitution, was \na shared power--one in which the President has the power to nominate \nbut does not have the power to appoint, unless or until such time as \nthe Senate chooses to grant its advice and consent and thereby confirm \na nominee put forward by the President.\n  As James Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers, ambition must \ncounteract ambition, and the people should decide.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, there is a vacancy on the most important \nCourt in America, and the message from Senate Republicans is crystal \nclear: Forget the Constitution. It doesn't matter who President Obama \nnominates because the Republicans will allow no votes on that nominee. \nThey will hold no hearings on that nominee.\n  Their response to one of the most solemn and consequential tasks that \nour\n\n[[Page S1363]]\n\ngovernment performs--the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice--will \nbe to pretend that that nominee and President Obama himself simply do \nnot exist--cannot see them, cannot hear them.\n\n  At the same time they are blocking all possible Supreme Court \nnominees, Senate Republicans are in a panic because their party seems \nto be on the verge of nominating one of two extremists for President--\ntwo candidates who think nothing of attacking the legitimacy of their \npolitical opponents and demeaning millions of Americans, two candidates \nwhose extremism, Republicans worry, will lead their party to defeat in \nNovember.\n  These are not separate issues. They are the same issue. If Republican \nSenators want to stand up to extremists running for President, they can \nstart right now by standing up to extremists in the Senate. They can \nstart by doing what they were elected to do right here in the Senate. \nThey can start by doing their jobs.\n  The refusal of the Republican Senators to execute the most basic \nconstitutional duties of their office is shocking, but it is not new. \nArticle II, section 2 of the Constitution says that the President of \nthe United States ``shall nominate'' judges, executive officials, and \nJustices to the Supreme Court with the ``Advice and Consent of the \nSenate.'' There is no secret clause that says ``except when that \nPresident is a Democrat,'' but for 7 years that is how Republicans in \nthe Senate have acted. Since the first day of the Obama Presidency, \nRepublican Senators have bowed to extremists who have rejected the \nObama Presidency and abused the rules of the Senate in an all-out \neffort to cripple his administration and to paralyze the Federal \ncourts. The Constitution directs Senators to provide advice and consent \non the President's nominee, and every Senator swore an oath to uphold \nthe Constitution. If Senators object to a nominee's qualifications, \nthey can vote no and they can explain themselves to the American \npeople. President Obama and I are members of the same political party, \nbut I haven't agreed with every single nomination he has made, and I \nhaven't been shy about it. That is how advice and consent works. Learn \nabout the nominee and then use your best good-faith judgment about \ntheir qualifications, but Republican extremists aren't voting against \nindividuals based on a good-faith judgment about a specific person. No. \nThey are blocking votes wholesale in order to keep those jobs vacant \nand undermine the government itself.\n  For years Republicans have executed a strategy to delay votes on \nconfirming government officials across the board. In 2013, only 1 year \ninto President Obama's second term, Republican leaders flatly rejected \nhis authority to confirm any judges to fill any of the three open seats \non the second highest court in the country, and Democrats had to change \nthe filibuster rules in order to move those nominees forward. Once \nRepublicans took over the Senate in 2015, judicial confirmations nearly \nground to a halt.\n  It is not just judges. For months after the President won reelection, \nRepublicans held up his nominees to run the Department of Labor and \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, largely on the suspicion that those \nhighly qualified individuals might actually help those agencies do \ntheir work. For years Republicans held up nominees to the National \nLabor Relations Board--even Republican nominees--in order to cripple \nthe ability of that 80-year-old agency to resolve disputes between \nworkers and their bosses. For years Republicans held up the President's \nchoice to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, refusing to \nconfirm anyone unless the President would agree to gut the agency.\n  Republicans regularly hold up the confirmation of dozens of \nAmbassadors, undermining our national security and our relationships \nwith other nations. Last year Republicans blocked confirmation of the \nAttorney General, the highest law enforcement official in this \ncountry--blocked her for 166 days--longer than it took the Senate to \nconsider the prior seven Attorneys General combined.\n  For more than a year the Republican chairman of the Banking Committee \nhasn't held a single vote on any of the 16 Presidential nominees \nsitting on his desk, not even nominees who are critical to maintaining \nthe financial stability of this country or the ones who are responsible \nfor choking off the flow of money to ISIS.\n  The message couldn't be clearer. No matter how much it damages the \nNation, no matter how much it undermines the courts, no matter whether \nit cripples the government or lays waste to our Constitution, Senate \nRepublicans do pretty much everything they can to avoid acknowledging \nthe legitimacy of our democratically elected President. For too long \nthe Republicans in the Senate have wanted to have it both ways. They \nwant to feed the ugly lies and nullify the Obama Presidency while also \nclaiming they can govern responsibly. Well, that game is over. \nCandidates motivated by bigotry and resentment, candidates unable to \ngovern, candidates reflecting the same extremism that has been nursed \nalong for 7 years right here in the U.S. Senate are on the verge of \nwinning the Republican Party's nomination for President.\n  Now Republican Senators must make a decision because here is the \ndeal: Extremists may not like it, but Barack Obama won the Presidency \nin 2008 by 9 million votes. He won reelection in 2012 by 5 million \nvotes. There were no recounts and no hanging chads, no stuffing the \nballot box or tampering with voting machines, no intervention by the \nU.S. Supreme Court. No. President Obama was elected the legitimate \nPresident 7 years ago, and he is the legitimate President right now. So \nif it is true that some Republican Senators are finally ready to stand \nup to the extremism that denies the legitimacy of this President and of \nthe Constitution, I say to you: Do your job. Vote for a Supreme Court \nnominee. Do your job. Vote on district court judges and circuit court \njudges. Do your job. Vote on Ambassadors. Do your job. Vote on agency \nleaders and counterterrorism officials. If you want to stop extremism \nin your party, you can start by showing the American people that you \nrespect the President of the United States and the Constitution enough \nto do your job right here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to address the \nresponsibility of the Senate in its advice and consent role under the \nConstitution. Of course, the President's duty is to nominate a Justice \nwhen the vacancy exists for a Justice, and that responsibility is very \nclearly written into our Constitution. The Constitution also very \nclearly conveys the Senate's role in providing advice and consent. This \nis the vision of our founding document. Actually, our Founding Fathers \nwrestled with exactly how to best construct this nomination and \nconfirmation process. They knew there had to be a way to appoint judges \nin the judiciary and certainly ambassadors and directors in the \nexecutive branch, how to go about that. In those early efforts to craft \nthe Constitution, some argued that this responsibility should be with \nthe Executive, with the President; others argued that, no, no, it is \nbetter given to the assembly, to the body. Well, that conversation went \nback and forth. We can read a little bit about the thinking through \nAlexander Hamilton's The Federalist Papers 76 because he laid out the \nconversation as it went back and forth. They recognized that there were \ncertainly advantages to having the President make the appointments.\n  I quote from Alexander Hamilton's paper:\n\n       The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will \n     naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact \n     regard to reputation. He will under this account feel himself \n     under stronger obligations and more interested to investigate \n     with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be \n     filled.\n\n  In short, direct your accountability to one individual who would be \nresponsible for carrying that out.\n  But they were also concerned about some disadvantages of the \nExecutive\n\n[[Page S1364]]\n\nmaking appointments. Giving absolute power of appointment to the \nPresident could lead to unwarranted favoritism, as it was put, or \nincompetence in those appointed.\n  Well, then again they thought, how about the assembly? They recognize \nthat you have certainly a rich makeup of views in an assembly and \nperhaps that could be of value. On the other hand, they also felt that \nthere would be a lot of horse-trading over appointments and that they \nwould just never get the job done, and indeed, as Hamilton noted, ``the \nintrinsic merit of the candidate will be too often left out of sight.''\n  So that was the dilemma, and they came up with a strategy to take the \nstrength of the Executive and the strength of the assembly; \nspecifically, that you would indeed have the power invested in one \nperson, and of course the Executive, in creating nominations for the \nexecutive branch, wanted to make sure those--there was an inherent \ndesire to make sure those folks were competent, but there was also \nstill this concern about, what if there was too much favoritism and \nwhat if individuals of unfit character were appointed to the bench? So \ngive the Senate the chance to review and provide consent or, as \nHamilton wrote, ``to prevent the appointment of unfit characters.'' \nThat is what it boiled down to. So the strength of the Executive and \nthe strength of the Senate combined in order to solve this knotty \nproblem of how you filled the key posts in the judiciary and the key \nposts in the executive.\n  All of this led to the exact crafting of article II, section 2, of \nthe Constitution. It referred that the President--``and he shall \nnominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the \nsupreme Court,'' and so on and so forth. Of course, this isn't, when \nthere is a vacancy, the President can if he or she desires; no, it is \nshall. This is a responsibility. You have to fill the position. So the \nPresident has an obligation under this clause, and we in the Senate \nhave an obligation to follow up with the advice and consent function.\n\n  That is where we stand and why this esteemed Chamber has operated now \nthroughout the more than 200-year history in providing that check and \nbalance on the Executive. It is the President's responsibility to \nnominate, and it is our responsibility to vet those nominees, to \nexamine them, to see if they have the fit, the characteristics of both \ntheir own qualifications and their character. That is the basis: \nqualifications and character. That is the question that we have \naddressed in this Chamber century after century.\n  But here we are today with a unique circumstance in which the \nleadership of this body has said: We are not going to fulfill the \nresponsibility that is given to us under the Constitution. We are going \non strike. We don't want to do our job.\n  I think the American people are saying the opposite: Senate, do your \njob. Senate, you were assigned a job in the Constitution. Senators, you \nsigned an oath to abide by that Constitution. You have a responsibility \nunder the vision of our Government to make it work. You have a \nresponsibility to fulfill that job, to do that job.\n  The Supreme Court is only the latest manifestation of the challenges \nwe have had with nominations for the executive and for the judicial. I \nhope we can come together and develop a much more rapid system of \nvetting nominees and, if there is not a major objection, having those \nat lower levels essentially conveyed quickly into their posts, because \nthis is something that we know will be the case.\n  We know that over time, there will be Republican administrations and \nthere will be Democratic administrations. We know that under the vision \nof three co-equal branches of Government, it is not the role of \nCongress to systematically undermine the other two branches. That was \nnot the design of our Constitution. So we wield a particularly sacred \nresponsibility not to use our partisan inclinations as a tool to try to \ndestroy the Presidency of a different political party or to pack, \nbasically, the courts according to our own philosophy. We are not doing \nthat now. As a body, we are failing our responsibility.\n  The Constitution says: Do your job. The people of America say: Do \nyour job. The leadership here in the Senate is saying: We refuse to do \nour job. That is just wrong.\n  Our Court does play this critical role in making sure that our laws \nand regulations stay within the bounds of the Constitution. It is not \nsince the Civil War that the Supreme Court has been left with a vacancy \nof more than a year. The Civil War is a very unique circumstance. Since \nthe 1980s, every person appointed to the Supreme Court has been given a \nprompt hearing and a vote within 100 days. Since 1975, it has taken on \naverage only 67 days to confirm Supreme Court nominees.\n  We can look at the list: Justice Kagan, 88 days; Justice Sotomayor, \n67 days; Alito, 83; Roberts, 63; Breyer, 74; Ginsburg, 51; Thomas, 99; \nSouter, 69; and, on through the list, Kennedy, 65; Scalia, who just \npassed away, 85; and Rehnquist, 89.\n  You notice that these are nominations by both Democratic Presidents \nand Republican Presidents. And in each case, the Senate--regardless of \nthe party in control of the Senate--did their job, vetted these \nnominees, held a vote on them, and proceeded. But now we have more than \n317 days still left in this administration, and the leadership of this \nbody is saying that they are not going to do their job for 317 days. \nThey are not going to meet with a nominee, not going to hold a \ncommittee meeting on the nominee, not going to report that to the \nfloor, not going to hold a floor debate--not because of the standards \nset up in the Constitution, not because of this standard: Is this a fit \ncharacter? Is he or she fit by qualifications? Is he or she fit by \njudicial temperament? The standard of unfit character--no, this is a \nstrike, a job strike based solely on partisan politics. This is \nbringing partisan politics into the very place it should never be--\nconfirmation of our judges not at 100 days but more than 300 days, \nwhich is totally out of sync with the history of this Nation, totally \nout of sync with the responsibility that each of us is assigned to help \nprovide advice and consent.\n  More than a dozen Supreme Court Justices have been confirmed in the \nfinal year of a Presidency. I want to emphasize that because there have \nbeen folks here in the Chamber who have said: Well, there should be \nsome special rule. In fact, they even thought there was some special \nrule that you don't confirm a Supreme Court Justice in the final year \nof a Presidency.\n  That simply is not the case. More than a dozen Justices have been \nconfirmed in the final year of a Presidency. Most recently, Justice \nKennedy was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's final \nterm. It was not a Republican-led Senate that did that confirmation. It \nwas a Democrat party-led Senate that did that confirmation because the \nDemocratic Party leadership and Members said: This is not partisanship. \nThis is a responsibility we have, and we are going to execute it.\n  But, unfortunately, we are hearing a very different story at this \nmoment from the Republican leadership in this body, and it is an \nembarrassment. It is an embarrassment to this Chamber. It is an \nembarrassment to our responsibility. I certainly am appealing that it \nbe remedied. There is time to remedy it. The President hasn't put \nforward his nomination yet. It is time to recognize that perhaps those \ncomments that were put forward in the heat of the moment can be set \naside and we can still do our job.\n  When people elect a President, they don't say to the President: Do \nyour job for 3 years, but you get the last year off. When they elect \nus, they don't say: Well, do your job for 5 years, but you get the last \nyear off. They certainly don't say: And by the way, after a couple of \nyears, you can take a year off from your constitutional \nresponsibilities. A President is elected for all 4 years. Our \nresponsibility is to provide advice and consent, and it goes on \ncontinuously.\n  In the last 200 years, the Senate has carried out its duty to give a \nfair and timely hearing and a floor vote to the President's Supreme \nCourt nominees--whether the President was a Democrat or a Republican, \nwhether this body was led by a Democratic majority or a Republican \nmajority. Let's not change that tradition. Let's not fail our \nresponsibility. In fact, let's honor our constitutional responsibility.\n\n[[Page S1365]]\n\n  I will close by calling on my colleagues: Let's work together to \ndiminish the partisanship and improve the problem-solving. Let's turn \ndown the rhetoric in terms of our back and forth during this campaign \nyear and, certainly, turn it down enough that we can fulfill that core \nresponsibility that provides advice and consent on nominations and \ncertainly on what is probably the most significant and important \nnomination--that of an individual to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates of America.\n  To summarize, the Constitution lays out the job before us. The \nAmerican citizens expect us to do our jobs. Let's do our job.\n\n\n                       Genetically Modified Food\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to shift gears here to discuss a bill that \nhas recently come out of committee and the way that we should consider \nresponding to it. This conversation is all about defending Americans' \nright to know what is in the food they buy and Americans' right to know \nwhat is in the food they feed to their family and they feed to their \nchildren. I will also discuss the legislation I am putting forward to \nattempt to be a bridge between some very different visions on that \ntopic.\n  Let me start by saying this is all about genetically modified food \nand the information provided to citizens on the package about that. \nThis often turns into a debate: Well, GMO has done some wonderful \nthings over here. Others say: Well, it has created some problems over \nhere.\n  I am going to acknowledge that both of those are true. It has done \nsome very positive things, and I will mention some in specific. But it \nhas also created some challenges, some problems, and I will mention \nsome of those. But after we recognize that that is the case, where do \nwe come back to? Here is where we come back to: We should enable the \nindividual in our beautiful Republic to make the decision and not have \nBig Government make the decision or suppress information. That is what \nhappens in the non-``we the people'' world. That is what happens in \ndictatorships. That is not what should happen here in the United States \nof America, where individuals have the right to know what is in their \nfood.\n  Let me go ahead and explain some of the benefits and some of the \nchallenges. Let's start with the example of golden rice. Golden rice \nwas developed by the International Rice Research Institute. It provides \ngreater amounts of vitamin A in the rice to reduce the deficiency that \nexists in many diets around this planet for that essential vitamin.\n  That is a pretty positive development. I don't know at this point of \nany side effects or other things that have been brought to light. \nNature is complicated, but for now, let's recognize that providing \nvitamin A where it is needed is a pretty positive thing.\n  Let's take a look at carrots. Carrot cells have been transgenically \nmodified to produce a chemical that treats Gaucher's disease. Gaucher's \ndisease is a metabolic disorder where people lack a specific enzyme \nwhich helps rid the body of certain fatty substances. Those fatty \nsubstances then accumulate, causing enlarged livers, spleens, bone \ndamage, bruising, and anemia. These transgenic carrots are part of the \nanswer, part of the solution.\n  Let's turn to sweet potatoes. Researchers are genetically modifying \nsweet potatoes to withstand multiple viral infections commonly \nencountered in South Africa, making this a much more successful crop \nand providing more food to people who need more food. So that is a \npositive development.\n  All of this is not a one-sided scientific picture. There are also \nscientifically documented concerns. We can call them scientifically \ndocumented problems that have occurred with transgenic crops.\n  Let me start by noting that the most common transgenic crops in \nAmerica are crops that have been modified to be resistant to \nglyphosate. That is an herbicide. After the introduction of these \nresistant crops, which means you can put more herbicides or weed \nkillers--you can put a lot more weed killer onto the acreage--you \nbasically knock out the weeds much more easily and less expensively \nthan with other strategies.\n  What happened? Well, basically, since 1994--early 1990s--several \nmajor crops have become almost 100-percent transgenic-glyphosate \ntolerant. The amount of glyphosate put on the crops has grown from 7.4 \nmillion pounds in 1994--let's round it off--to 160 million pounds in \n2012, and the number keeps climbing. This is a huge amount of \nherbicide. Try to picture in your head 160 million pounds of herbicide. \nWell, it is so effective in killing everything except the GM corn, GM \nsoybeans, and GM sugar beets. It is so effective in killing everything \nelse that very few weeds survive. One of the weeds that doesn't \nsurvive, because most don't, is milkweed. Milkweed happens to be the \nfood for the monarch butterfly. As we have seen the enormous increase \nof glyphosate applied to our fields, we have seen a crashing of the \nmonarch butterfly ecology. It is not the only thing affecting the \nmonarch. Several other things are affecting them as well, but it is--in \nscientific study after study--a very significant factor.\n\n  Let's also take a look at something else; that is, that all of this \nglyphosate doesn't stay on the fields. When it rains, it gets washed \ninto our waterways. Our waterways are full of things that are affected \nby our herbicides, and so it has a big impact on the ecology of our \nstreams and rivers. That is a serious scientifically documented issue \nthat we are continuing to learn more about as time passes.\n  Let's turn to another issue. This is a fascinating story. It is about \na pest that bores into the roots of corn. It is called the corn \nrootworm. The corn was modified so it would have a pesticide in the \ncells and would kill the rootworm when it bored into the corn, but \nguess what happened. If you do this on a vast scale, Mother Nature \ncomes along and has a few genetic mutations here and there and suddenly \nthat rootworm starts to propagate with others that are now resistant to \nthis pesticide that has been put into the roots. So now more pesticide \nhas to be added to the corn, and as a result of that we have an \nopposite outcome than what was expected.\n  The hope was that this would reduce pesticides, but now you have to \nput the pesticides back in it, and so now we have the evolution of \nsuperbugs. Here we have the adult beetle, and the rootworm is a \nreference to the larvae stage of this beetle. These are the type of \nconcerns that are raised.\n  I say all of this just to explain that while there are benefits of \ntransgenic crops, there are also issues that are raised in the natural \nworld. So anyone who takes this floor and says that nobody should be \nconcerned about bioengineered crops is simply refusing to look at the \nscientific literature that says, no, there are things we should be \nconcerned about. That is why it comes back to the right of the \nindividual to know what is in their food. They want to know if it is a \ntransgenic crop, and they can look up the details and make their own \ndecision. Why have Big Government say that we are going to make the \ndecision for you? Why have Big Government say that we don't trust you \nwith information and we are not going to allow you to know what is in \nyour food? No. That should be in some dictatorship, not in the United \nStates of America.\n  Well, we have a big battle now because out of committee last week has \ncome a bill, and this bill is known as the DARK bill. It stands for \nDeny Americans the Right to Know because Big Ag says that we don't \nbelieve in this whole ``we the people'' model of a republic. No, we \nlike to have a government that makes decisions for people and that \ndenies information to people because we don't trust them, as consumers, \nto decide what they want to eat. We don't want them to know what they \nare feeding their children and their family. We want to make the \ndecision for them. Well, 90-plus percent of Americans disagree. They \nwant the information to make the decision on their own. They can find \nout about the benefits over here. They can find out about the concerns \nover here. Different foods have different transgenic crops in them. \nThey should get to make the decision and not have Big Government making \nthe decision for them.\n  This bill, the DARK Act, prohibits counties, cities, and States from \nany decision to provide information on a package to their citizens \nabout what is in their food regarding transgenic crops.\n  I got together with the representatives of the food industry and \nadvocates for consumer information. I tried\n\n[[Page S1366]]\n\nto find out if there is an overlap so we can craft a bill that will \nbring these two communities together, and we made some progress on \nthat, and so I will share that with everyone.\n  Basically, a big concern of the food industry--totally legitimate--is \nthat they don't want 50 different standards in 50 different States or \nto have a bunch of counties decide to make up their own rules, which \nwould result in hundreds or thousands of rules. If you operate a \nwarehouse, you can't send different cans of soups to grocery stores \nacross the country. No. So that makes sense. They want a 50-State \nsolution. Furthermore, they want to have it acknowledged that there is \nnothing pejorative about the concept of bioengineering or transgenic. \nThey want to know that people know this is a situation where there are \nsome positive benefits, and I have mentioned some of those positive \nbenefits. They don't want a label on the front of the package because \nthey think it would be scary to consumers, and they want flexibility as \nto exactly what system they use to alert consumers.\n  The bill I put forward provides all of those goals for a 50-State \nsolution. There is nothing on the front of the package, nothing \npejorative, and provides flexibility for the food industry. It does not \ngo to the final step that much of the food industry wants, which is no \nunpackaged labeling because then there is no compromise between the two \nsides.\n  The consumer side would like to have something mandatory so it is on \neach package of food. They want it clear so a person can pick up the \nfood or the can or the sack and have it easy to identify on the \npackage. That is the compromise bill I have put forward. It enables the \nfood industry to either put an asterisk on an ingredient that is \nbioengineered and have it explained below or it enables an industry to \nput a symbol in parentheses after the ingredient or it enables an \nindustry to just put a symbol on the ingredients panel. In Brazil they \nuse a ``t.'' It is a very simple ``t.'' It is not scary, but for those \nwho want to know, it is identified.\n  This approach of simplicity--nothing scary, simple access that is \neasy to see--this is the bulk of what both sides want to accomplish so \nwe can have a 50-State standard.\n  It has been endorsed by a number of groups. Over the last few days my \nbill has been endorsed by Campbell's, Stoneyfield, and Nature's Path. \nIt has been endorsed by Amy's Kitchen and Ben & Jerry's and Just Label \nIt.\n  We can give up the ability of each State to have a separate labeling \nsystem if we do this simple symbol or parentheses or asterisk on the \ningredients panel so a person who cares can look it up.\n  I think about it this way. My daughter has always wanted to buy \nproducts that don't have highly enriched corn syrup or high fructose \ncorn syrup. Along the way, she read something and said: I am just not \nsure that is something I want to buy. So she picks up a package, turns \nit over, and often the ingredients on the package have tiny print, but \nshe can figure it out. It is the same for this. Enable the consumer who \nis willing and wants to make the effort to be able to pick up a can--\nagain, it doesn't have to be on the front--and find out what is going \non.\n  This is the world standard. There are 64 other countries, including \n28 members of the European Union, Japan, Australia, and Brazil, that \nall require some type of indication on the ingredients panel or on the \npackage. Do you know who else is in that group? China. China is a \ndictatorship. China doesn't deny its citizens the right to know. How is \nit possible that a bill in this Chamber has been introduced to take \naway the right of Americans to know what is in their food? Even China \ndoesn't do that, and we must not do it either.\n  I appreciate the folks who have already signed up to sponsor this \nbill. Senator Leahy, Senator Tester, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nSanders, Senator Murphy, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Blumenthal, \nthank you. Thank you for standing up for your citizens' right to know. \nThank you for standing up for a fair compromise that solves the big \nproblem the food industry is facing with the potential of 50 different \nStates having 50 different standards. Thank you for finding the area of \ncompromise that works on both sides of this equation.\n  I appreciate the endorsements. I appreciate the sponsors, but what I \nreally appreciate is that we have freedom of speech in our country to \nbe able to carry on this conversation, but how is it consistent to have \nfreedom of speech and then say that we want to ban information from our \nconsumers? How is that consistent? This is like the mob that says that \nwe don't want our citizens to read certain books so we are going to \nburn them, we are going to ban them--and that is what this DARK Act \ndoes. It has been introduced and went through the Agriculture \nCommittee. It bans the ability of States to provide information to \ntheir consumers. That is just wrong. Even China doesn't go there, and \nwe should not go there either.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon we had a very \nstrong vote here in the U.S. Senate to move forward on the legislation \nwe are currently considering. It is called the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act. It is legislation that is intended to make the \nFederal Government a better partner with State and local governments, \nwith our nonprofits who are in the trenches around the country, and \nwith all of our States dealing with this now-epidemic level of heroin \naddiction, prescription drug addiction, and overdoses.\n  Today, as we are here in the Senate, on average, we will lose over \n100 people a day in the United States of America to deaths from \noverdoses. Frankly, that is just part of the problem, as horrible as \nthat is. So many people are being saved by this miracle drug called \nnaloxone or Narcan. Also, others who may not be overdosing are not \nworking. Their families are broken apart. They are committing crimes to \nsupport their addiction. So many Americans are not achieving their God-\ngiven purpose because of this addiction issue that is gripping our \ncountry. Our legislation is meant to address it in a very direct way.\n  The debate on the floor that we had over the past week has been very \ninteresting to me. It is the first time in decades that this Congress \nhas taken up this issue in this manner. We have had a very open debate \non addiction policy. What does it mean? I think what you heard Members \nsay on both sides of the aisle is that we have learned a lot about \naddiction over the years and that addiction now is viewed by most as a \ndisease, an illness. Like other illnesses, it needs treatment.\n  I think that is a very important change in terms of how we address \nthis issue, and the policy before us today on this floor that I hope we \nwill vote on in the next 12 hours or so represents a change in thinking \nabout this, that indeed we want to do everything we can to prevent the \naddiction in the first place, to keep people out of the funnel of \naddiction, to have better efforts in education and prevention, and that \nis in this legislation. But also, once we have people who are addicted, \nwe need to get them into treatment. And for people who are arrested for \npossession, who are users of drugs, it is better to get them into \ntreatment and recovery than just getting them into jail or prison \nbecause we have found that hasn't worked. So the criminal justice \nsystem has a role to play here--legalization is not a good idea--but \nthat ought to be, in part, diverting people into treatment that works \nbetter for them to be able to get at this problem. Otherwise, folks \nwill continue to see these incredibly high levels of use, addiction, \nand all the negative consequences that stem from that.\n  I thank my coauthor of this legislation, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. \nHe and I have worked together over the past few years on this \nlegislation, bringing in experts from all over the country and getting \nexpertise from our home States. In Ohio, we had a number of roundtable \ndiscussions that added a lot of important input to be able to come up \nwith legislation that actually\n\n[[Page S1367]]\n\nworks, that is actually going to direct funding to evidence-based \nprograms and prevention and treatment and recovery that work.\n  We talked a lot to our law enforcement community. That is one reason \nthe Fraternal Order of Police supports our legislation. So does the \nSheriffs' Association, so do the prosecutors, and so do the attorneys \ngeneral, because we have actually worked with them to say: How can you \nbe more effective in dealing with this very real problem you have in \nyour community? And if you talk to law enforcement, you talk to \nfirefighters, you talk to emergency medical folks, they will tell you \nthis issue is at the top of their list. They are frustrated by it. They \nare looking for a solution, and this legislation helps to come up with \nthe solution.\n  I also thank Senator Ayotte, Senator Klobuchar, and 42 bipartisan \ncosponsors for their support of this legislation. It is comprehensive, \nit is evidence-based, and it is going to make a difference.\n  Not only has it had a lot of support here in the Senate--and I hope \nwe will see that again in the final vote--but it also has support in \nthe House of Representatives. There was a companion bill at one time \nthat was identical to our legislation, also called CARA, the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Ours has changed a little bit \nthrough the process, but it is very similar to the House companion \nbill. There are over 80 cosponsors to that legislation. It is a \nbipartisan bill on the House side as well.\n\n  So this is one of those issues where if we pass it here in the \nSenate, we have a very good chance of passing it in the House and \ngetting it to the President for his signature so it can begin to make a \ndifference in our communities.\n  The reason we are here today talking about this is, again, because so \nmany people are suffering. There are 23 million Americans, it is said--\n23 million Americans--who are in recovery from addiction. Think about \nthat. We are doing this for them, to ensure that they can have \nsuccessful recoveries, to help them to ensure that they can keep their \nlives together and not fall back into this struggle of addiction.\n  With 23 million people recovering, think of the millions who are \nstill struggling. Together, those who are recovering and those who are \naddicted have begun to stand up and let their voices be heard. That is \none of the differences I have seen in this debate, is that the stigma \nthat has been associated with addiction has begun to be removed.\n  There was a rally here on the Capital Mall several months ago. It was \ncalled the Unite to Face Addiction rally. There were people there from \nall over the country. Thousands of people came to Washington, DC--\nthousands. And the message from them was, one, pass CARA, this \nlegislation--and I appreciate their help. We wouldn't be here today on \nthe floor talking about this issue if they hadn't engaged with their \nelected representatives in the House and the Senate and our leadership \nto help us get this moving. Second, there message was, look, addiction \nis a disease and it has to be treated like other illnesses, and we have \nto have legislation that helps break the stigma associated with drug \naddiction so that we can address it and we can begin to get people out \nof the grip of addiction and get our communities and families out of \nthe grip of addiction. This is a cause, and it is one that requires law \nenforcement and the criminal justice system, but it also requires love \nand faith and communities coming together. It is one that we can only \ncarry out together--all of us, not as Republicans or Democrats or \nIndependents but as Americans, as fathers and mothers, family members \nand friends and coworkers who care about those who are facing this \ngreat challenge of addiction.\n  CARA now has the support of over 130 groups around the country. These \nare criminal justice groups. These are people who are in the trenches \nevery day dealing with treatment and prevention. These are folks who \nare in public health. These are people who are in law enforcement and \nunderstand the importance of this. They have all come together to say: \nLet's pass this legislation so we can begin to implement this evidence-\nbased program to respond to this epidemic.\n  It does add prevention and education efforts. It does do a lot to get \nprescription drugs off the shelves and get the medication out of the \nhands of our youth. It does allow us to monitor drugs. It authorizes \nlaw enforcement task forces to combat heroin and methamphetamine in \nareas that are particularly hard hit. It expands the availability of \nthe miracle drug we talked about earlier--it doesn't always work, but \nit has saved a lot of lives--called naloxone or Narcan.\n  In the criminal justice system, it does identify and treat \nindividuals suffering from substance abuse disorders and expands \ndiversion and education efforts to give those individuals that second \nchance.\n  We give special help in this legislation to our veterans. We \nestablish more funds for these veterans treatment courts. I have been \nto them in Ohio. They are incredible. Yesterday, I talked about the \nstory of one of the veterans who had been in and out of the prison \nsystem. Now he not only has his life back together, he has his family \nback together. He is back in school getting a degree. He is one example \nof many who got off track because of PTSD, because of an addiction, \nused self-medication to deal with his PTSD, was in the prison system \nand is now back out. We are supporting that effort.\n  We do help women who are postpartum and suffer from addiction. We do \nhelp babies who are born addicted. We have this incredible situation \nwhere in Ohio we now have a 750-percent increase in the number of \nbabies who are born with this syndrome--with addiction. They have to be \ntaken through withdrawal. I have gone to these neonatal units with my \nwife, and we have seen these incredibly compassionate doctors and \nnurses. What I hear from them is, you have to do something. This \nlegislation takes that important step to the Federal level.\n  CARA supports recovery programs focused on youth and building \ncommunities of recovery. It creates a national task force on recovery \nto get the experts really engaged to help us to improve ways to address \nsome of the collateral consequences caused by addiction.\n  Economists will tell us that addiction now costs this country about \n$700 billion every year. Think about that. That is lost productivity. \nThat is more expensive health care. If you go to the emergency room in \nyour community to find out what is going on, you will see a lot of \npeople coming in because of addiction. There is the cost of policing \nand incarceration. Law enforcement tells me that most of the crime \nbeing committed in our communities is now being committed because of \nthis issue.\n  So $700 billion every single year is a lot of money, no doubt, but \naddiction costs us something else too: It costs us in dreams that are \nnever fulfilled, in families who are torn apart, in lives that are \nlost. We don't just measure our success in dollars and cents. We \nmeasure it in safer neighborhoods, less crime, in empty jail cells, and \nby the number of people who never have to struggle with drug abuse in \nthe first place because of more effective prevention and education. We \nmeasure it in the moms and dads who beat addictions so they can come \nback to be with their kids and bring their families back together. We \nmeasure it in the families who are not torn apart but instead are \nhealed.\n  As we move forward to pass this legislation--the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act--our message is a really simple one. To \nthose who struggle with addiction, to those who think they cannot \novercome, to those who believe there is no one out there who cares \nabout them or can help them: You are not alone. We are with you. There \nis hope. I have seen people beat this. I have known people who have \nbeat this. You can beat this.\n  And we can be a better partner here at the Federal Government to be \nable to help people overcome this struggle. We need to pass this bill \nand get it signed into law to begin to make a real difference for the \nfamilies we represent.\n  The House has companion legislation also called CARA. They have a big \nbipartisan group supporting it. After we pass this legislation here--\nbecause I am confident we will based on the vote this afternoon--I hope \nthe House will take it up, take up CARA, and get it passed. Let's get \nit to the President for his signature, and let's truly begin to\n\n[[Page S1368]]\n\ndeal with this epidemic--it is at crisis levels, it is urgent, and it \ncan't wait--so that we, all of us, can begin to make a real difference \nfor those we represent.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Senator Cardin of Maryland, my \ncolleague, and I are here on the floor today to ask that two \nnominations for the Federal bench, the district court, be confirmed. \nThey are the next two judges in line on the Executive Calendar for the \nFederal district courts.\n  One is Mr. Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr., a highly qualified nominee from \nthe State of Tennessee. The other is Ms. Paula Xinis from our own State \nof Maryland, a brilliant, talented lawyer who also is ready to be \nconfirmed. Both have been approved by the Judiciary Committee. Mr. \nCrenshaw was approved in July and has been waiting for a vote. Ms. \nXinis was approved by the Judiciary Committee in September. So it has \nbeen more than 6 months to allow Senators to be able to evaluate the \nexcellent work done by the Judiciary Committee on whether these \nnominees should be confirmed.\n  We think it is time that the full Senate did its job and gave these \ntwo outstanding candidates for the bench a vote. Therefore, I come to \nthe Senate floor with Senator Cardin and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnominations: Calendar No. 215 and Calendar No. 307; that the Senate \nproceed to vote without intervening action or debate on these \nnominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be in order to the nominations; that \nany related statements be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \njust point out to my friends from Maryland, and the senior Senator who \nhas made this consent request asking that we move off of the current \nlegislation--the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act--off of that \nimportant legislation into executive session to consider these \nnominations, that it is the prerogative of the majority leader to set \nthe agenda. If every Senator could come to the floor and cherry-pick \ndifferent nominations from the calendar and ask consent that we move to \nexecutive session and then consider those, it would result in some \nchaos. For those reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am certainly disappointed by the Senator \nfrom Texas objecting to the request of the senior Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski.\n  The request of Senator Mikulski is for us to consider two article III \njudges who are next in line for consideration before the U.S. Senate. \nThey have cleared the committee. They have both been approved by the \ncommittee by voice vote, a unanimous vote within the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I know Paula Xinis--the vacancy to be filled in Maryland at \nUniversity Park. She joined the law firm of Murphy, Falcon & Murphy in \nBaltimore. She is a senior trial attorney, well qualified to take the \nseat of the former chief justice, Deborah Chasanow. She was appointed \nby President Obama in March of 2015. We are now approaching the 1-year \nanniversary of her appointment--1 year anniversary for a \nnoncontroversial, well-qualified appointment to the district court.\n  Let me just talk a little bit about fairness. I heard what the \nSenator from Texas said about the majority leader scheduling the votes \non the floor of the Senate, but I think my colleagues should be aware \nof the facts in regard to filling judicial vacancies.\n  We have completed the confirmation process on 16 article III judges \nsince the beginning of this term of Congress. The comparable number in \nthe last 2 years of a Presidential term where the President was of the \nRepublican Party and the Senate was controlled by the Democrats--just \nthe opposite of what we have today--was the year 2007 and 2008 under \nPresident George W. Bush. The Judiciary Committee was chaired by \nChairman Leahy. That year, by March 9, we had cleared and confirmed 40 \njudicial appointments--40 compared to 16 in this Congress. By the end \nof the year, we had approved 68 of President Bush's nominees.\n  Going back to the other time with a Republican President and with a \nDemocratically controlled Senate--President Reagan--in 1987 and 1988, \nunder Chairman Biden, by March 9 of the last year, the Senate had \nconfirmed 47 of his nominations, compared to 16 this year, and by the \nend of the year, we had confirmed 85 nominees, including a Supreme \nCourt Justice, Justice Kennedy.\n  We have pending right now on the floor of the Senate that have \ncleared committees--every single one by voice vote unanimously--we have \n12 article III judges who are ready for action and 5 other judicial \nappointments, for a total of 17. But that is not the whole story. We \nhave 25 nominees who are still pending before the Judiciary Committee, \nincluding Stephanie Gallagher of Maryland, to fill a vacancy. This is \nnot the only vacancy we have in Maryland. We now have two in Maryland \nwaiting for action by the U.S. Senate.\n  So there is a matter of fairness here. There is also a matter of \nrespect for the judicial branch of government in allowing the courts to \nbe able to function.\n  The district court is where most individuals get their justice. That \nis the trial court. That is the court where most of our citizens will \ngo for their judicial relief. We have vacancies where appointments have \nbeen made that are noncontroversial, well-qualified people, and we \ncan't get a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate? My friend from Texas \ntells me this is the prerogative of the majority leader. It is our \nresponsibility to act on these nominations.\n  Senator Mikulski has set up a process in Maryland where we take an \ninterview process to get the very best talent to serve on our courts. I \nam honored to work with her as we go through the process of finding the \nvery best to serve on the courts. How do you expect to allow their name \nto come forward when it takes a year to consider a nomination? If you \nwant to get the very best on the courts, we have to act, and we have to \nbe responsible.\n  Let me just say something. We have to take up these nominations. I \nappreciate that we always have a lot of work that we have to do. We \nhave time today to get these nominations done. I call on the majority \nleader and I call on my friends to say: Look, let's get our court \nvacancies filled. Let's carry out our responsibility and vote on these \nnominations.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, why am I here today on the floor asking \nfor these two nominations to be confirmed? They are the next two judges \nin line on the Executive Calendar for our Federal district courts: \nWaverly Crenshaw, Jr., a highly qualified and talented nominee from the \ngreat State of Tennessee; and Paula Xinis, nominated from my State of \nMaryland. Both Mr. Crenshaw and Ms. Xinis have been waiting for months \nto have their day and get their vote. Mr. Crenshaw has been waiting \nsince July, Ms. Xinis since September. I think 6 months is enough time \nto provide our advice and evaluate these nominees. It is time to do our \njobs and give these candidates a vote. I urge the Republicans to allow \nthese nominations to move forward.\n  We are easily on pace to be the least productive Senate in recent \nhistory. Last year Republicans confirmed the fewest judges in almost 50 \nyears: a total of 11 in 2015. Since Republicans took over the Senate \nthe number of judicial emergencies has nearly tripled, which leaves \ncourts overworked and understaffed.\n  Now some Republicans say there is precedent for their obstructionism. \nSome Republican Senators have tried to fudge their numbers, saying the \njudges confirmed during our lameduck session at the end of 2014 should \ncount toward their abysmal numbers for 2015. Well, what about those \nnumbers? I didn't realize that's how the Senate\n\n[[Page S1369]]\n\nworked: that we take credit for work that others did. Some Republican \nSenators specifically asked for lameduck passage of their nominees. \nThey didn't want to wait for the next Congress--but they're stalling \nnow, before we are even in lameduck. They are already talking about \nstopping nominations with 9 months left to do work.\n  A lack of judges has real consequences for the American people. Due \nto our constitutional protections, criminal trials must happen with a \n``speedy and public trial.'' What does this mean in our courts? \nCriminal trials end up prioritized, protecting those charged with \ncrimes, but civil trials are put on hold--sometimes for years--while we \nwait for judges to have time for them. What does this mean for the \nAmerican people? Judges spend less time on cases, judges have to \nencourage cases to settle instead of getting their day in court, judges \nhave to encourage defendants to consider plea deals rather than wait \nout a lengthy trial process. Justice delayed is justice denied, which \nis what is happening around our country right now.\n  For Marylanders to receive their day in court, we need Judge Paula \nXinis to be on the bench. I was extremely proud to nominate Paula Xinis \nto President Obama with Senator Cardin. She is a brilliant litigator \nand public servant. When I consider nominees for the Federal bench, I \nhave four criteria: absolute integrity, judicial competence and \ntemperament, a commitment to core constitutional principles, and a \nhistory of civic engagement in Maryland. Ms. Xinis exceeds these \ncriteria. She has dedicated her career to the rule of law. The \npersistence and character she has shown in advocating for her clients \nand in her activities in the community make her truly an outstanding \nnominee. She has a deep respect for the law and what it means to every \nAmerican. She will ensure that everyone who comes before her truly \nfeels that they have been heard and have received equal justice under \nthe law.\n  It is absolutely critical that we have judges in our courts to make \nsure that the judiciary is strong, independent, and that all Americans \nget their days in court. The President has made dozens upon dozens of \njudicial nominations. Now the Senate must do its job. Enough time has \npassed on these two nominees. It is time to have our say. I do not take \nthis duty lightly, but I will do my job. I carefully evaluate nominees \nand render an independent judgement based on my commitment to core \nconstitutional principles. These candidates deserve timely hearings and \ntimely votes. We have had the hearings. We have had plenty of time to \nevaluate their merits. Now is the time to vote.\n  Mr. President, I would like to compliment once again my very able \ncolleague from Maryland for his statement, in which he laid out facts \nand he laid out the historic precedent, and I want to associate myself \nwith those remarks.\n  I also want to add that I am really frustrated. I am so frustrated \nthat, No. 1, President Obama doesn't get to be President Obama. His job \nas President is to nominate competent people for an independent branch \nof government, the Federal judiciary. He did his job. Then it came to \nthe Senate. Really, we thank the Judiciary Committee because they did \nhold a hearing and did their due diligence to examine the worthiness of \nwhether these nominees should be brought to the Senate. Do they have \nthe judicial temperament? Do they have the judicial experience? Are \nthey of sound character to truly be independent and render impartial \njustice, which our Constitution mandates? The Judiciary Committee said \nyes.\n  It comes to the Senate on something called the Executive Calendar. \nThat is Senate-speak for the nominating calendar. It means they are on \nthe calendar, waiting their turn to have a vote, but this is just a \nslowdown.\n  We don't want to be in a showdown here. I didn't bring this up with \nSenator Cardin to disrupt consideration of the opioid bill. We have a \nterrible problem in Maryland with opioids and heroin. We are for this \nbill. We are for bipartisan action, but we are driven to taking action, \nasking for unanimous consent because we are not getting action.\n  I would have yielded to a compromise if the gentleman from Texas, \nhimself a member at one time of the Texas Supreme Court, had said: How \nabout Mr. Crenshaw first and Ms. Xinis after the break that will be \ncoming up? You know, we are like college kids; we get spring break. \nWell, we would agree to that. All we are looking for is for Mr. \nCrenshaw, who was on the calendar before Ms. Xinis, to go first.\n  We are not pushing, but we are persistent. All we want is a time \ncertain when we could get a vote on Ms. Xinis. We are now in the \nbusiness of discouraging people from coming into public service. They \nare willing to put their career on hold and their life on examination \nto be able to serve on the Federal bench or other nominations. She did \nit. Our nominee did it. She is in a law firm. Her career is on hold.\n  We also have Ms. Stephanie Gallagher, who is a Federal magistrate \njudge, waiting for a hearing. What are we doing here? People are \nfinally going to say: I don't want the hassle. I don't want the \nharassment. I don't want to go through all this just to wait, wait, \nwait, wait.\n  The Senate needs to move in an orderly way. When a nominee has been \nmoved through the process, nominated by the President, gone through the \ndue diligence of the Judiciary Committee, and is waiting, I think we \nought to do it. I think we ought to take a couple of days and just vote \non these nominations.\n  I believe our courts are overwhelmed. There are backlogs in the \ncourts. There are people waiting for their ability to have a trial. We \nneed good judges. We need to be able to make sure that the people are \nwilling to serve and they have the credentials, the judicial \ntemperament, and the character to serve. We need to be able to at least \ngive them a vote. Now, if you don't like the Obama nominees, vote them \ndown. Vote them down, but don't slow down the process.\n  We have a constitutionally mandated process. Let's follow it. Let's \ndo our job. We have Mr. Crenshaw and Ms. Xinis. We are happy to have \nMr. Crenshaw go first, but we sure would like a date for Ms. Xinis.\n  We call out to our colleagues to give us a date, give us a vote. Give \nit to us now.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                 Omnibus and Defense Authorization Bill\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last night we saw another unusual election \nresult. We see a ``businessman'' now in a very significant lead for the \nnomination of the Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln and \nRonald Reagan.\n  As I watched the postmortems last night and this morning, we see \nagain that many of those who voted cite as one of their primary--if not \nthe primary--reasons distaste, anger, and frustration about Washington, \nDC, specifically the Congress of the United States, as well as the \nPresident. They believe they need somebody who is an outsider, someone \nwho is not ``of the establishment.'' I guess that applies to anyone who \nis in elected office.\n  Some of us have been surprised. Certainly no one predicted these \noutcomes, not only on the Republican side but on the Democratic side. \nWe saw our colleague from Vermont engineer quite a stunning upset in \nthe State of Michigan last night. But he also--even though a Member of \nthe Senate, Senator Sanders clearly is speaking in opposition to the \nmachine, the business as usual in Washington.\n  Sometimes we ask ourselves why the American people give us such a low \napproval rating. I see polls show that the approval rating of Congress \nis 12 percent, 13 percent, 14 percent, sometimes as high as 15 percent. \nI would inform and remind my colleagues that it wasn't always like \nthat. We didn't always have such a low approval rating in the Congress \nby the American people.\n\n[[Page S1370]]\n\n  I think it is worthy of note that in the last year since regaining \nthe majority, we have enacted some legislation that I think we could be \nproud to go back and talk to our constituents about, whether it be \neducation reform, where we did away with common core, or whether it be \na highway bill that was much needed to provide infrastructure for our \nStates, counties, and towns. We passed a budget. We passed a defense \nauthorization bill that has some of the most significant reforms in \nhistory. But the fact is, those numbers haven't changed, and they \nhaven't changed sometimes for good reason.\n  That is why I come to the floor today, because I am ashamed and \nembarrassed, as a representative of the people of my State, to talk \nabout billions of dollars of unnecessary wasteful spending of their \ntaxpayer dollars, and it happened on the Omnibus appropriations bill--\nomnibus. A lot of my constituents don't know what ``omnibus'' means. \nWhat it means is, we are required to take up 13 appropriations bills. \nWe don't do it--and I would put the responsibility for that on the \nother side of the aisle, but it doesn't matter, really, because we end \nup, at the end of the year, with a massive, hundreds of billions of \ndollars bill that is about this high, that none of us have seen or read \nand there is no amendment to it, and we have approximately 48 to 72 \nhours in which to vote yes or no, with the option being the government \nnot continuing to function. That is not the way to do business. That \ndoesn't inspire any confidence in us on the part of the American \npeople, and it is disgraceful.\n  So the omnibus, again, was passed with votes from both sides, \nactually, but the fact is that our responsibility was to take up these \nbills one by one, to examine them, to have amendments, and to have the \nCongress--in this case, the Senate--work its will. We didn't do that.\n  Here it was. We walked in, and here was this bill--not that size but \nthis size--that no one had read, no one had a chance to peruse, and \neven if we had, we couldn't do anything about it because the bill was \nnot amendable because if we amend it, then it bounces back to the other \nside of the Capitol, and we run out of time, and the government shuts \ndown. That is the wrong way to do business.\n  One of the major reasons for what happened is it is open to \nincredible abuse. I came to the floor today to talk about the abuse of \nthe most sacred responsibility we have, which is the defense of this \nNation.\n  I am proud to be chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a \npost I aspired to for many years. We work hard on the Defense \nauthorization bill. We work hard in the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. We work on a bipartisan basis. We have hearings, we examine \nthe issues, and we examine the programs. We are talking about, again, \nhundreds of billions of dollars, of taxpayers' dollars, whether it be \npay and benefits for the men and women who are serving or whether it be \nthe equipment they need or many of the policies that govern the defense \nof this Nation. And I am proud of the work we do.\n  So after producing a bill with an overwhelming majority vote--90-some \nvotes--with the authorization for all of this to do with our Nation's \ndefense, the Appropriations Committee decides to overrule what we have \nauthorized, in violation not only of the way the Senate is supposed to \nfunction but in violation of a resolution adopted by the Republican \nconference, which I will read:\n\n       Earmark Moratorium\n       Resolved, that it is the policy of the Republican \n     Conference that no Member shall request a congressionally \n     directed spending item, limited tax benefit, or limited \n     tariff benefit, as such items are used. . . .\n\n  Et cetera.\n  So what was in this omnibus bill? Let me give you the best example: \n$225 million for a ship called a joint high-speed vessel, for a ship \nthe Navy did not want. No one asked for this.\n  We had hearings in the Armed Services Committee on shipbuilding. We \nexamined all of the proposals. Some of them we didn't accept. Others we \ndid. Others, through votes in the committee, debate, and discussion, \ncame up with our shipbuilding authorization.\n  So what was done in this Omnibus appropriations bill by the \nAppropriations Committee? For the second year in a row, $225 million \nthe Navy did not request and did not need.\n  By the way, my friends, I would not take too much time in the Senate, \nbut building a ship is just the beginning of the expense. You have to \nman it, you have to put the ammunition on it, you have to put the \nequipment on it, and you have to operate it for as long as 30 years, \nand the Navy did not want it. The Navy has lots of unmet military \nrequirements. So what was put in there and why? Because, frankly--and I \nuse these words without reservation--it is made in Mobile, AL. It is \nmade in Mobile, AL. It is blatant. It is blatant. And then, of course, \nthere were so many other items in it.\n\n  It is like any other evil. First you condemn things. Then you condone \nthem. Then you embrace them. There is no better example of that than \nthe so-called money for ``medical research.'' In fact, years ago \nsomebody decided: Hey, we will spend some money for medical research on \nsome of the illnesses that affect the men and women in the military. I \ndon't take exception to that. But it grew and grew and grew and grew \nand grew.\n  Now, in this bill, $1.2 billion extra--not million but billion \ndollars--is asked for. Let me give examples: $120 million for breast \ncancer, $12 million for lung cancer, $6 million for multiple sclerosis, \n$20 million for ovarian cancer, $7.5 million for epilepsy, $12.9 \nmillion for HIV/AIDS. My friends, all of those are worthy causes. All \nof those should probably be funded.\n  We should do all those things, but not on the Defense bill. It was \nnot authorized and was jammed in for the Willy Sutton syndrome. The \nWilly Sutton syndrome is about the famous bank robber who, when asked \nwhy he robbed banks, said: That is where the money is. Well, the \ndefense appropriations is where the money is.\n  So here we have, over the last 23 years, as it has grown and grown \nand grown, just $2.4 billion of the $10 billion spent on these \ncongressionally directed medical research programs being relevant to \nthe military. In other words, $7 billion went to research things such \nas osteoporosis and mad cow disease instead of training, equipment, and \ncare for our troops and their families.\n  We do not have enough money to care for the men and women in the \nmilitary and take care of their families and take care of their medical \nneeds. We don't have enough money for that as a result of \nsequestration. So what did they do? They put in $1.2 billion more in \nmedical research.\n  There are a few other examples. There is an additional $7 million in \nfunding for a machine gun. These guns are made with a 500-percent \nincrease. There is $750 million for a National Guard and Reserve \nequipment fund and $600 million in additional funding for DOD's science \nand technology budget.\n  This is very interesting, my friends, this science and technology \nbudget. Here is what happens. They put out $600 million, and it is \nsupposed to be for ``scientific and technology research.'' But it \ndoesn't say for what specific item. So what happens is the members of \nthe Appropriations Committee then write to the Department of Defense \nand tell them to spend certain money on certain projects. That is the \nway of getting around the letter of the earmark ban if not the spirit \nof it.\n  Then, of course, there is the Russian rocket. Today we are having to \nuse for space launches Russian rocket engines. The company that makes \nthese Russian rocket engines happens to be run by cronies of Vladimir \nPutin. In fact, two of the cronies of Vladimir Putin are such thugs and \ngangsters that they have been on our sanctions list. We have sanctioned \nthem. Yet our friends on the Appropriations Committee, again, with \nULA--the people who are buying these rocket engines--are based in \nAlabama and, of course, headquartered in Chicago, IL. The engines, as I \nmentioned, are manufactured by this Russian company that is controlled \nby a guy name Chemezov and a guy named Rogozin, who have been \nsanctioned. Yet we are sending tens of millions of dollars to them.\n  What we did was we restricted the cost and encouraged the \ncompetition, and we had hearings on it. It was a big issue. We had \nvotes in the committee on it, we discussed it and we debated it. And so \nwhat did the appropriators do? They put a provision into this bill \nreversing what we authorizers did. That\n\n[[Page S1371]]\n\nis in complete violation of the rules of the Republican conference.\n  So I have talked very often with our twelve freshmen. I can't be more \nproud of what these freshmen Senators have brought to this conference. \nThey have brought enthusiasm, they have brought knowledge, they have \nbrought youth, they have brought military experience--people like \nSenator Ernst and Senator Cotton and others who bring their military \nexperience. I am so proud to have many of them serving on the Armed \nServices Committee. I have asked them to get together and condemn this. \nI campaigned for almost all of them. They promised the people of their \nStates, as I promised the people of my State, that I wouldn't allow \nthis waste of billions of their tax dollars, that I would fight against \nit. So I am asking our freshmen Senators to join together--and I hope \nthey will because I have had conversations with them--to reject this, \nand, if we go into another appropriations omnibus, that they will not \nallow this to happen.\n  Why did I focus my comments on defense? It is for two reasons. No. 1 \nis obvious. I am chairman of the Committee on Armed Services. So I take \nstrong exception when the men and women who are serving in the military \nare having to leave the military involuntarily because we don't have \nenough money, yet they are wasting billions--billions--of taxpayer \ndollars. Second of all, it is not right. It is not right. And thirdly, \nwe authorize--we authorize--and our bill is passed by the Senate and \nthe House, for 53 straight years, and signed by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  This bill is important to defend the Nation. When our careful \ndeliberations, our votes, our hearings, our debates day after day on \nthe floor of the Senate as we consider the authorization bill is then \noverturned--overturned--and pork barrel projects such as a $225 million \nextra vessel the Navy neither needs nor wants are added to it, then, my \nfriends, do not be surprised when we have an approval rating of 12 or \n13 or 14 percent.\n  The American people are smart. Our constituents are smart. When they \nsee billions of dollars wasted in this fashion, it is no wonder we \nreceive their condemnation and their sarcasm and their disapproval.\n  So I am asking my freshmen colleagues to take the lead--to take the \nlead because they are the ones who are closest to the people--and to \nhelp me reject this corrupt process. And it is corrupt.\n  I want to also assure all of my colleagues that if they try this \nagain--if they try this again--I will do everything in my power--\neverything in my power--to make sure it is reversed or that it never \nhappens to start with. We owe the American people much better than the \nprocess I just described.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the senior Senator from Texas, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the senior Senator from \nArizona, for his great work over the years, and particularly now in the \nCommittee on Armed Services, which he chairs. He has been tenacious in \nhis attempt to make sure that no dollars are inadvertently or \nunknowingly wasted, especially when it comes to the Pentagon.\n  I, for one, believe this is the No. 1 priority of our country. I know \nhe shares that view. But it is pretty hard to make the argument that we \nought to continue to give more money to the Pentagon if the money is \nnot being used efficiently, either because of their internal \nadministrative problems or for some other reason.\n  I know, because I happened to be at the Pentagon this morning, that \nmany of our military chiefs are concerned that the things that are \nbeing put in appropriations bills are not things they actually want or \nneed and that there are other priorities. The best way to get those \nvetted is through the Senate Committee on Armed Services and working \nwith the Appropriations Committee to make sure the money is being used \nas efficiently as possible and not wasted--certainly not on things the \nmilitary doesn't want or doesn't need.\n  So I thank my colleague for his continued leadership.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to talk about a few topics here. No. 1 is the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the legislation we have been \nworking on now for 2 weeks. Anybody who has been listening understands \nthe importance of this legislation, which will help stem the tide of \nthe massive epidemic of opioid prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse \nthat continues to claim lives across our country.\n  This bill is actually a good example of how the Senate can work in a \nbipartisan fashion to advance good policies that positively impact the \nlives of ordinary American citizens. I know most people in this \npolarized environment are not aware of this bipartisan work we have \nbeen able to do over this year and last year, but we have actually done \na number of good things. Some, if you told them, they might not even \nbelieve it, but to the people who are open to the facts, I think this \nis another good example. Of course, in this instance, it has been the \nresult of the strong leadership of the junior Senator from New \nHampshire, Ms. Ayotte; Senator Portman of Ohio; the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Chuck Grassley; \nalong with our Democratic counterparts, people like Senator Whitehouse.\n  I am hopeful this legislation will contain an amendment I offered \nlast week to help those who struggle with both substance abuse and \nmental illness. It is estimated that more than 10 million Americans \nsuffer from both addiction and mental health disorders. These are \ncalled co-occurring disorders. It is a fact that many people who don't \notherwise get treatment for their mental health problems try to self-\nmedicate, making their lives even more complicated and worse, and that \nis what this amendment is designed to address.\n  Many mental health and substance abuse services, like specialty \ncourts, have operated on separate tracks, and they only treat one part \nof the problem. This amendment really isn't all that earth-shaking. All \nit would do is make the commonsense link between mental health and \nsubstance abuse, something that we direct our existing criminal justice \nprograms to apply to these coexisting disorders as well. That way \npeople who struggle with both addiction and mental health problems can \nhave both of those problems addressed using the money we are already \nappropriating and already spending in grants to local law enforcement \nand medical providers.\n  It would also expand substance abuse and transitional services to \nhelp those suffering from co-occurring disorders to receive the \ntreatment they need to recover. So I look forward to voting on this \nlegislation and getting it passed soon.\n  I would note that we are having a few bumps along the way, in terms \nof our Democratic friends allowing votes on amendments. There are \napparently about 25 different amendments that have been negotiated \nbetween the Republicans and Democrats, but I am told our Democratic \nfriends are objecting to any amendments by Senators who happen to be \nrunning for election in 2016.\n  Now, the Democratic leader, in a fit of candor the other day, said \nthey were going to object to an amendment authored by the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Johnson, because he is running for election. Well, I \nwould ask them to back off of that sort of political hardball and to \nlet us get our work done.\n  It doesn't help when they object to noncontroversial amendments or \nthey take certain amendments hostage because they do not want somebody \nto score points by getting something done. I mean that is why we are \nsent here; it is to get things done for our constituents.\n  Regarding the amendment I mentioned just a moment ago, that \napparently is one of those being held hostage. I would like to share a \nletter from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American \nCorrectional Association, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations that supports the amendment I just talked about. If the \nDemocratic leadership will not listen to me, maybe they will listen to \nthem. I hope they will listen to the voices of the families who suffer \nfrom mental illness and to law enforcement officials.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S1372]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 2, 2016.\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cornyn, On behalf of the undersigned mental \n     health, substance abuse and criminal justice organizations, \n     we are writing to express our support of the Mental Health \n     and Substance Abuse Act amendments to S. 524, the \n     Comprehensive Addictions and Recovery Act (CARA).\n       Approximately 65% of persons incarcerated in jails and \n     prisons across the United States have substance use \n     disorders. Many of these individuals have co-occurring mental \n     illnesses such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, \n     or schizophrenia.\n       It is further estimated that 2 million people with serious \n     mental illness are admitted to jails across the U.S. each \n     year. Twenty percent of all inmates in state and federal \n     prisons, approximately 314,000 individuals, have serious \n     mental illness. Many of these individuals also have drug or \n     alcohol use problems.\n       Historically, mental health and substance abuse services \n     have been operated separately, and coordination in addressing \n     the needs of people with co-occurring mental illness and \n     substance use disorders has proven challenging. This has been \n     true as well with specialty courts established to address the \n     unique needs of non-violent offenders with substance use \n     disorders (drug courts) or mental illness (mental health \n     courts). Drug courts have frequently not been equipped to \n     address the needs of people with mental illness and mental \n     health courts have frequently not been equipped to address \n     the needs of people with substance use disorders.\n       The provisions included in the Mental Health and Substance \n     Abuse Amendments would be helpful in addressing these \n     problems.\n       Section 802 would add ``mental health treatment and \n     transitional services for those with mental illnesses or with \n     co-occurring disorders'' among those prioritized for \n     assistance when transitioning out of criminal justice \n     systems.\n       Section 803 would include ``training for drug court \n     personnel . . . on identifying and addressing co-occurring \n     substance abuse and mental health problems'' to federal \n     criminal justice training priorities.\n       Section 804 would add grants for developing and \n     implementing specialized residential substance abuse \n     treatment programs that ``provide appropriate treatment to \n     inmates with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse \n     disorders or challenges.''\n       Inclusion of these provisions in CARA would be very helpful \n     in fostering positive treatment outcomes and in reducing \n     recidivism among offenders with mental illness and substance \n     use disorders.\n       Senator Cornyn, we greatly appreciate your strong \n     leadership on these issues and stand ready to help in any way \n     we can to move them forward.\n       Please contact Ron Honberg with NAMI with any questions or \n     if we can provide further support.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), American \n     Correctional Association, National Association of Police \n     Organizations, TASC, Inc. (Treatment Alternatives for Safe \n     Communities--Illinois), The National Alliance to Advance \n     Adolescent Health, American Orthopsychiatric Association.\n\n\n              Calling For Appointment of a Special Counsel\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, separately, earlier this morning I joined \nmy colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee to hear testimony from \nthe Attorney General of the United States, Loretta Lynch.\n  As a former attorney general of my State, I have always taken a great \ninterest in our system of justice at the State level and now certainly \nat the national level, and I have tried to do everything I can to help \nstrengthen the rule of law and help keep the American people safe, and \nthat includes transparent and fair investigations.\n  I spent a little bit of time asking the Attorney General this morning \nabout her Department's investigation into the former Secretary of \nState, Hillary Clinton, and her use of a private email server during \nher tenure. I have talked many times on the floor about my concerns \nsurrounding her use of an unsecured email server. The former Secretary \ndid refuse to use the government server and decided to basically play \nby her own rules, setting up a server at her home in New York. But the \nfact is, this sort of reckless conduct put our country at great risk. \nSeveral experts from the intelligence community have outlined how her \nunsecured server left her emails--some highly classified--vulnerable to \nhacking in cyber attacks. So this is a very serious matter.\n  Last fall, about 6 months ago, I asked the Attorney General to \nappoint a special counsel to fairly and fully conduct an investigation. \nThat is because Secretary Clinton is not just a random citizen or \nformer government employee; her case is awfully high-profile. As a \nresult, I think there are many questioning whether she is being treated \nin exactly the same way as any other citizen would be treated under \nsimilar circumstances or whether she is getting some sort of \npreferential treatment. Because the Attorney General is a political \nappointee of the President of the United States and given Ms. Clinton's \nhigh profile, there are real conflicts of interest and real concerns \nabout politics ahead of justice. Those could be addressed and mitigated \nby providing a special counsel, as the law provides, to provide some \nmeasure of independence from the Attorney General so the public can \nhave confidence that this case is being treated just like every other \ncase and not with some sort of political favoritism based on a conflict \nof interest.\n  This morning, I questioned the Attorney General about recent reports \nthat the Department has granted immunity to the staffer who set up \nSecretary Clinton's private server.\n  So anybody listening understands, the only reason immunity would be \ngranted in a criminal investigation is if somebody invokes their Fifth \nAmendment rights against self-incrimination. But if given immunity, \nthen that individual must cooperate with law enforcement authorities \nand cannot refuse to answer questions because they no longer have any \nlikelihood or any chance of being convicted of that crime, having been \ngranted immunity.\n  This does indicate that this investigation has taken on a new level \nof seriousness, and I suspect the FBI continues to be hard at work \ntrying to get to the bottom of this, as I would expect them to do. I \nhope this indicates that the Department of Justice is treating this \ncase with the great care and gravity it requires. They are integral to \nthis grant of immunity because the FBI can't do this on their own, and \nit takes the prosecutors of the Department of Justice to agree to a \ngrant of immunity as part of an investigation.\n  I still believe the American people deserve an independent \ninvestigation, and I will continue to press for the appointment of a \nspecial counsel to that end.\n\n\n                    Mental Health Reform Legislation\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to address another issue I questioned \nthe Attorney General about, and that is about needed reforms to our \nmental health system. I believe I repeated to her today--I have \nrepeated this story so many times, I sometimes forget when I have said \nit before. But I recently had a chance to meet with a number of major \ncounty sheriffs, and somebody asked me: Would you like to meet the \nlargest mental health provider in America?\n  I said: Well, sure.\n  He said: Well, he is over here. It is the sheriff of Los Angeles \nCounty.\n  So the fact is, many people incarcerated in our jails are suffering \nfrom mental illness, and they may have committed petty crimes, such as \ntrespassing and the like, but they are not getting their condition \ntreated as long as they are warehoused in jails. Many communities, such \nas my hometown of San Antonio, TX, have created a model of how to \ndivert people from jail to get their mental health issues treated and \nat the same time make sure we don't continue this turnstile of people \ncoming in and out of our jails when their underlying mental illness \nproblems are not being treated.\n  I asked her to take a look at a bill I introduced, the Mental Health \nand Safe Communities Act, which is designed to help communities and \nfamilies who are struggling to help their loved ones who are mentally \nill. Many families don't have access to adequate treatment or lack the \nresources to comply with doctors' orders.\n  The fact is, back in the nineties, back when a major policy change \nwas made in America and people were essentially turned out of \ninstitutions where the mentally ill were treated, there wasn't any \nfollowup to make sure there was some sort of safety net or some follow-\non treatment to make sure their needs were taken care of.\n  Today, any of us who have walked down the street in a major American \ncity know we have a lot of homeless people living on our streets who \nare essentially suffering from some form or another of mental illness, \nand their\n\n[[Page S1373]]\n\nneeds are not being addressed. Some of them, perhaps because they \nabused alcohol or other drugs in order to try to medicate or take care \nof their problems on their own, end up committing crimes of one type or \nanother, not necessarily what I would call a serious crime but serious \nenough to get them arrested and put in jail.\n  I am hopeful that we will take this opportunity, as we are looking at \nour criminal justice system at large, along with prison reform and \nlegislation that passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee--which I \nhope will soon come to the floor of the Senate--to deal with issues \nlike this confluence of mental health and criminal justice in a way \nthat is more enlightened, in a way that is cheaper, and in a way that \nis more humane and more efficient than simply warehousing people who \nare mentally ill in our criminal justice system.\n  We can do better, and I am hopeful that models like those in Bexar \nCounty, TX, where mentally ill persons are able to find programs that \nactually help them solve their underlying problem--those kinds of \nmodels are helpful to the rest of the country and to us as we try to \ncraft means for our communities to better care for those suffering from \nmental illness.\n  I look forward to moving this legislation soon. The chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Alexander, \ntells me he has been working with Senator Murray, his ranking member, \nalong with Senator Cassidy and Senator Murphy, on another piece of \nlegislation that they are proposing on mental health. My hope is that \nthe group of us who are interested in this issue can cobble together a \nconsensus piece of legislation which the majority leader could then \nbring to the floor of the Senate to let us do some additional important \nbipartisan work to help address this problem.\n  I don't see any Senator wishing to speak, so I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Cuba\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, after decades of isolation, we are seeing a \nmeasured shift in our policy toward Cuba. We have resumed diplomatic \nrelations, expanded travel opportunities, lifted caps on financial \nassistance between families, and eased trade restrictions.\n  I congratulate the administration for spearheading these changes. It \ntook courage to embark on this path. These policy changes are supported \nby the vast majority of Cuban Americans. They are applauded by sector \nafter sector of the U.S. business community, and they are welcomed by \nAmericans at large, but still it took someone to lead and President \nObama did. I applaud him and his administration for doing so.\n  Make no mistake, conditions are improving for the Cuban people \nbecause of these changes. There are some who do not fully appreciate \nthe meaningfulness of this opening to Cuba. They maintain that we have \nsomehow offered concessions to the Cuban Government without benefit to \nthe United States or to the Cuban people. Some contend that we have \nmoved prematurely when human rights issues remain unresolved in Cuba.\n  To be clear, human rights abuses persist in Cuba. We all seek to \nremedy these abuses. Yet extending 50 years as the Cuban Government's \nconvenient scapegoat for the failure of socialism is unlikely to yield \ngains in human rights in the future any more than our policies have \ndone in the past. Instead, this opening to Cuba takes full advantage of \nthe opportunities presented by the failures of socialism. Recognizing \nthe inherent right of Americans to travel to Cuba isn't a concession to \ndictators. It is an expression of freedom. It is Americans who are \npenalized by our travel ban, not the Cuban Government.\n  During my first visit to Cuba in 2001, I told the Cuban Foreign \nMinister in a meeting in Havana that I was attempting to lift the U.S. \ntravel ban. I added, if the Cuban Government didn't improve its human \nrights effort, I would seek to lift the entire trade embargo. It was \ntaken as an attempt at humor, of course, but for me it was no joke. I \nhave always believed that denying Americans the ability to travel to \nand trade with Cuba has done more to extend dictatorial rule on that \nisland than any other policy we could have adopted.\n  For far too long U.S. administrations, both Republican and \nDemocratic, have insisted that U.S. measures, such as ending the travel \nban or easing the trade embargo, must be met by moves by the Cuban \nGovernment to improve the human rights condition of the citizenry. I \nunderstand this instinct, but I will submit that ending the travel ban \nand easing the trade embargo, even when done unilaterally, leads to \nbetter human rights conditions in Cuba.\n  Milton Friedman wrote that economic freedom is ``an indispensable \nmeans toward the achievement of political freedom.'' Far from being \nconcessions to dictators, changes in our policy toward Cuba are \nreinforcing and advancing opportunities for Cubans in the private \nsector. Citizens who are totally dependent on government for their \nlivelihood are subject to the whims of all-powerful leaders in a way \nthat those who are economically independent are not.\n  In a very real sense in Cuba, the economic agenda is the human rights \nagenda. Recognizing its precarious economic position in recent years, \nthe cash-strapped Castro regime has laid off thousands of government \nworkers and expanded legal opportunities in the private sector. This \nhas given way to a dramatic rise in the number of entrepreneurs on the \nisland who are running restaurants, bed and breakfasts, taxi services, \nbarbershops, beauty salons, and much more. In fact, it is estimated \nthat as many as one-third of Cuba's 5 million workers are now operating \nin Cuba's private sector. This exponential expansion of Cuba's \nentrepreneurial class would not have happened were it not for U.S. \npolicy changes in 2009 that has led to an explosion of travel and \nremittances among Cuban Americans. Some suggest that remittances to the \nisland are responsible for 70 to 80 percent of the capital used in \nsmall businesses in Cuba.\n  Recent changes to U.S. regulations allowing for additional travel and \nremittances have further expedited the expansion of the private sector \nin Cuba. Additional regulatory changes, such as allowing the so-called \npeople-to-people exchanges to be conducted on an individual as opposed \nto a group basis, would propel this movement even further. Again, this \nentrepreneurial expansion in Cuba has not only given scores of Cubans a \nbetter quality of life, it has lessened their dependence on the Cuban \nGovernment in a way that has improved their human rights condition.\n  The recent bilateral air service agreement also represents a key \npiece to ensuring the continued travel of Americans to the island. This \nagreement will, for the first time in 50 years, provide scheduled air \nservice between the United States and Cuba. Frequent and regular travel \nbetween the two countries will continue to open economic ties, and it \nwill lead to private sector economic opportunities on the island.\n  I should note that the administration has done just about all that \nits authority permits to affect change on the island. In the coming \nmonths, it will be up to Congress to take the next steps.\n  I hope that we--particularly those of us on this side of the aisle \nwho believe so strongly in the value of free markets and free \nenterprise--will remember these principles as we promote democracy and \nhuman rights in Cuba.\n  Margaret Thatcher famously said: ``There can be no liberty unless \nthere is economic liberty.'' This statement is as true in Cuba as it is \nanywhere in the world. It is my hope that this principle will guide our \nactions as we endeavor to promote freedom and liberty in Cuba.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1374]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am here this afternoon on the floor \nto join with colleagues as we discuss the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act, CARA. I would suggest that from the perspective of \nfamilies across the country, many would look at this and say this is \nprobably one of the more important pieces of legislation that this \nSenate could be taking up this year.\n  If we think about this crisis, this epidemic that we are seeing \nacross the country with opioid addiction, it is probably one of the \nmost pressing public health issues facing American families all across \nthe country. As we have heard from colleagues, this is not just one \nsingle State's issue. This is not just one region of the country. This \nis across all 50 States. I always like to think that in Alaska, because \nwe are so far away, we are so remote, perhaps we might be insulated \nfrom some of the negative aspects of this modern society. In fact, we \ncannot isolate, we cannot insulate ourselves from the scourge of the \ndrugs and the drug addiction we are seeing.\n  This addiction does not discriminate. It doesn't discriminate against \nany demographic, any group. Again, it can't be confined to a single \ngeographic region. It impacts young people. It impacts our older \npeople, the lower income people, the middle-income people, and the \nhigher income levels. Those of us who have served our Nation as our \nhonored veterans, pregnant women, and even newborn babies can suffer \nfrom addiction.\n  The stories we hear when we are back home visiting with our \nconstituents, talking with friends, talking with neighbors, and then \nhearing these stories recounted on the floor--these are heartbreaking \nstories that come from all over the country, from the east coast, \nagain, all the way to the most remote villages of Alaska. We have seen \nand we have heard the pain that opioid addiction causes. It is \nimportant that we take action and that we address this issue now before \nit worsens. Unfortunately, as we see the statistics, that is where it \nis going, that is the trend, and that is the direction.\n  The rates of addiction and hospitalization will only continue to \nskyrocket unless we can throttle this back, unless we can get our hands \naround it. This is our opportunity not only to treat but to prevent \nopioid addiction. Lots of numbers have been discussed on the floor \nabout this epidemic that we are seeing, and the numbers really are \nhorrifying. In Alaska, the mortality rates related to opioid and heroin \nabuse have more than tripled since 2008. In 2015, we had 33 Alaskans \ndie from heroin overdose--perhaps even more that we just haven't been \nable to identify. The rates on inpatient hospitalization for heroin and \nopioid poisoning have nearly doubled since 2008. The cost is over \nmillions of dollars.\n  As we know, it is often our young people who suffer from addiction \nthe most, and certainly the most directly. Between 2008 and 2013, the \nrate of individuals between 21 and 29 years old being admitted to \ntreatment centers has doubled. Again, we are talking about numbers, and \nwe are talking about statistics. But we are really not. We are talking \nabout our friends, we are talking about family, and we are talking \nabout neighbors. But we can make a difference if we provide the \nresources and if we provide the education and the outreach, not just to \nyoung people but to all, so that they understand the dangers of opioid \naddiction.\n  Unfortunately, some of what we have seen with this addiction is that \nsomehow or another, opioids are viewed as less a health threat because \nthey are prescription. What CARA does, what this legislation in front \nof us does, is to help address the educational need, provide States and \ncommunities with grant options and resources to ensure that all in the \ncommunity--the educators, the parents, the doctors, other members of \nthe community--have the knowledge and have the tools they need to guide \nand support young people and the community at large. But it is just so \nhard; it has been so hard to see families and friends lose their loved \nones to addiction.\n  Over the past several months in the community of Juneau, our State \ncapital, there have been a series of newspaper articles that have \nchronicled how that community has been impacted by the loss of young \npeople due to heroin. Six young people, all under the age of 30, were \nlost last year. In September, a young man who was a softball player \nlost his life due to heroin overdose. Two weeks after that, another \nfamily lost a son who was going to film school.\n  You read the stories, you read the details about the lives of these \nyoung people, who could be like any of us until something happens. And \nwhat that something is is an exposure to opioids and an addiction that, \nagain, cuts a life short. Those parents of these young people, as \nparents in States all across the Nation, grieve for the loss of their \nchildren and wonder what they could have done to perhaps help save \ntheir child's life. Again, the community of Juneau is recounting that, \nbut it is all over our communities.\n  This drug addiction knows no boundaries. It seeps into and corrodes \nAlaska's most remote and rural communities. These are communities, I \nwill remind you, where it is not like there is easy access to them. \nThese are communities--80 percent of the communities in the State of \nAlaska are not connected by road. In order to get to them, particularly \nthis time of year, the only way to get in is to fly in. It is expensive \nto fly in. In the summer, there are water options, but that too is \nexpensive. So while it is difficult for people to move in and out, \nsomehow or another the drugs are coming in and out. The heroin and the \nopioid addiction have found their way into these remote communities, \nleaving families and loved ones scrambling and desperate as they try to \nhelp those whom they love.\n  Unfortunately, the resources we have in terms of any form of \ntreatment centers are so incredibly limited. In one of the communities \nthat is on the road system, the community of Palmer, just north of \nAnchorage, our largest city, I was at an event this summer. Lots of \npeople wanted to talk to me at this picnic. There was a woman with her \ndaughter who was in her early twenties, and that woman waited \npatiently, patiently, patiently to be able to speak with me alone. She \nasked to go off into a corner of the outdoor area that we were in so \nthat she could speak to me about her daughter's situation. Her daughter \nwas an addict. She had been in and out of jail. She had been in and out \nof treatment. Nothing had worked, and this mother had no place else to \ngo, no place else for her daughter to go. So she, as one mom who cared, \nwas trying to help raise awareness of the lack of facilities, the lack \nof treatment, and the lack of options for so many in her situation. You \nlisten to stories like that, and you realize that we must attempt to do \nall we can.\n  Granted, we are sitting here in Washington, DC. The Federal \nGovernment doesn't always know what is best. We know that for a fact, \nbut how is it that we can help these families, these communities, as \nthey deal with, again, this scourge that has afflicted so many?\n  We have had some good news in the State of Alaska. Just this week, \nthe Alaska State House of Representatives passed a bill that will \nremove civil liabilities for providing or administering the drug \nnaloxone to treat opioid and heroin overdose. It was actually the \nrepresentative from Juneau, Representative Munoz, who spoke to the need \nfor reform and helped lead this important measure. That is on its way \nto the Governor's desk. Again, I think it is an important option for \nlifesaving treatment.\n  As we work together--those of us who have cosponsored the CARA bill \nand all who have expressed their concern--we know we need to keep the \npressure on. We need to keep the momentum up to address this, not only \nin Alaska but around the country, to fight back, to deal with this \naddiction we are seeing, and to really attack the issue from every \ndegree. From mental health to criminal justice reform, community \nprograms, educational resources, tools for veterans and pregnant women, \naddressing this widespread issue with a widespread response is \nimportant.\n  I thank my colleagues who have led on this issue, and the Presiding \nOfficer here today has clearly done just that. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer for his leadership on this.\n  As I have spoken this afternoon on opioid addiction, and perhaps more \nspecifically to heroin addiction, I always\n\n[[Page S1375]]\n\nfeel compelled to mention that in my State, and particularly in \nAnchorage, we have seen a spike of ``spice'' abuse. This is a synthetic \nmarijuana. More and more, we are seeing individuals who are being sent \nto the hospital. It is our firefighters who seemingly are responding to \nmore spice and more heroin incidents than they are responding to fire \ncalls. Recognizing that it is not just heroin, but it is other drugs \nthat are truly wreaking havoc on our families and our communities, we \nneed to unite together to make a difference.\n\n  So I think what we are doing here in this body is a first step. \nPassing this legislation is an important response, and through what we \nare doing, we can work to change the direction in which, unfortunately, \nwe have been going.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for \ntoday's cloture vote on S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act of 2015. I would have voted yea.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today marks the 36th edition of my ``Waste \nof the Week.'' For those who have been listening I have been down here \nevery week, while the Senate is in session, addressing what has been \ndocumented as waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I took on a major role when first coming back to the Senate starting \nin 2011 to deal with the larger issue of our plunge into debt through \ndeficit spending year after year after year. Despite numerous attempts, \nmany of them bipartisan, all blocked by decisions made at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue, we have not been able to put in place a reasonable \nplan--or any plan whatsoever--that would reduce our spending, balance \nthe budget and begin to chip away at this ever-deepening cesspool of \ndebt. It is hurting our economy, and laying a burden on future \ngenerations that will have enormous negative consequences.\n  Given the fact that those larger efforts came to naught, I have \ndecided to start chipping away from the other end of the fiscal \nspectrum to identify waste, fraud, and abuse, a much more efficient, \neffective Federal Government and not waste taxpayer dollars that these \ndays are hard-earned and pretty scarce.\n  This ``Waste of the Week'' deals with not as substantive an issue as \nmany of these. The speeches talk about a whole range of issues that are \ntaking a lot of taxpayer dollars out of the purses and wallets of our \nconstituents, sent to Washington and simply wasted.\n  Every once in a while I try to present something that is so \nridiculous, so unnecessary, that it catches the public's attention and \nought to embarrass every Member of this body. Some arguments can be \nmade about, well, perhaps the Social Security Disability Trust Fund \ncould be adjusted so we wouldn't do this or that. But every fourth or \nfifth time down here I like to throw out something where people say: \nAre you kidding me? We are actually using our hard-earned tax dollars \nto do this?\n  One that caught the most attention was the grant that amounted to \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to determine whether a massage made \nyou feel better after an expenditure of physical effort. If they were \nasked that question, there is probably no one in America who would not \nconclude that. They would say, yes, that works. I'd prefer a massage \nover no massage at all. But this grant was used to determine that.\n  Rather than take a human subject, they used mechanical massages on \nthe backs of white rabbits. Actually, these rabbits were from New \nZealand. Then they looked at the grin on the rabbit's face--I don't \nknow how they determined it. Rabbits can't turn around and say: Yes, \nthat feels good. Apparently they made some kind of measurement, and \nafter spending about $400,000, came to the conclusion that, yes, it \nreally works. Well, that caught people's attention.\n  There are a lot of people who are outraged at the way we are spending \ntheir money. There are people trying to make their mortgage payment, \ntrying to get to the end of the week for the next check, to buy \ngroceries, or to set aside money for their kids to go to school.\n  This is one of those weeks where I want to bring forward yet another \nissue of ``Can you believe this is how the Federal Government is \nspending your money?''\n  I am told by my staff that there is a new word around called \n``hangry.'' It means that if you are hungry, you tend to get a little \nbit disjointed, and you are more angry than you would be if you were \nnot hungry. I suppose that is something we could easily prove by all of \nus just asking: What is our disposition when we are hungry? Are we a \nlittle more tense or a little more quick to trigger in terms of getting \nupset about what someone may say to us or something like that--a little \nmore irritable.\n  So this new generation has taken this condition called hangry, which \nis hungry and angry, and turned it into the term ``hangry.'' The \nNational Science Foundation said: Well, we better find out whether this \nis true. So they issued a $331,000 grant for researchers to study \nwhether ``hanger'' actually occurs. If you get hungry, do you end up \nfeeling ``hangry''? That was the question. So researchers issued a \n$331,000 grant for the study on married couples. Listen, you can't make \nthis stuff up. They came up with the idea of giving each spouse a \nvoodoo doll, and if they felt they were angry, they were to take a pin \nand stick it into the voodoo doll. They each had their own voodoo doll. \nLike I said, you can't make this stuff up. It only cost $331,000.\n  So whenever a spouse made the other spouse angry, the other spouse \ngrabbed the voodoo doll and grabbed a pin and stuck it in. The \nconclusion was after a 3-year study and $331,000 spent--yup, we proved \nit. ``Hanger'' occurs when you are hungry.\n  There are some Senate pages who are trying to hold back their \nlaughter. I see a lot of smiles on the faces of people in this Chamber \nsaying: Surely, this can't be true. Surely, this is made up. Surely, \nthis is a spoof to try to prove a point. This actually happened, folks. \nThis actually happened.\n  The serious part of this is that the taxpayer paid for it. At a time \nwhen we are trying to repair roads and bridges, when we are trying to \nput money forward for health care research, when we are dealing with \nterrorist issues to make sure our national security is strong, when our \nmilitary is underfunded, when we are trying to deal with all the issues \nof the day, we are taking this money--and of all things the National \nScience Foundation could do, they do this.\n  We take the $331,000 and add it to our ever-growing accumulation of \ndocumented waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. We have now \nrisen to a position of $157,591 million and change. It is not small \nstuff. It adds up. This is what your Federal Government is doing, and \nwe wonder why the American people are frustrated. We wonder why they \nare angry when they hear issues like this.\n  I am not trying to stoke the flames and make the American people more \n``hangry.'' I am simply trying to expose this so we will be so \nembarrassed with these kinds of things that people will come down to \nthis Chamber and offer legislation to clean up this stuff. We have \nalready made some progress but we can make more.\n\n\n                       Migration Crisis in Europe\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to reserve some time to talk about \nsomething that I think is very serious, to discuss an issue that I \nthink has an impact on all of us, particularly our national security.\n  Last week NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Philip Breedlove, \nwhom I have had the opportunity to talk to a number of times, testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee about how he views the \nthreats facing us today and what the most serious threats are to the \nUnited States. Featured among them was a serious migration crisis that \nis destabilizing our European allies. He said:\n\n       Europe faces the daunting challenge of mass migration \n     spurred by state instability and state collapse. The influx \n     of people is\n\n[[Page S1376]]\n\n     masking the movements of criminals, terrorists, and foreign \n     fighters. Within this mix, ISIS [or ISIL] . . . is spreading \n     like a cancer, taking advantage of paths of least resistance, \n     threatening European nations and our own [nation] with \n     terrorist attacks.\n\n  Each day as we watch on television or read in the papers, this \nmigration crisis continues to grow worse. Efforts by the European Union \nto stem the tide have failed to even slow down the flow of refugees and \nmigrants. These repeated failures, now moving into its second year, are \nthreatening to break the European Union apart as each member country \nresorts to a ``fortress Europe'' mentality, enforced by national means. \nThese include new razor wire barriers along internal EU borders. They \nencourage divergent national policies on refugee admissions that make \nalmost a mockery of EU policy consensus or even common efforts.\n\n  The EU agreement on common borders--described as the Schengen \nAgreement of 1985--has been considered the bedrock of European unity. \nIf this fundamental agreement is crushed by the unsupportable weight of \nhundreds of thousands of desperate migrants, how can the European Union \nitself be saved? That is the question.\n  Many of our European friends are asking that question. I was recently \nin Munich at a security conference, and representatives from all the \nEuropean nations were there. The No. 1 topic was the flow of migration \nand the destabilization of Europe and the unity of Europe, nations not \nabiding by their earlier commitments to receive migrants, nations \nraising barriers and building walls--whether they are razor wire or \nconcrete walls--around their borders. It is creating a major crisis in \nEurope.\n  The political stability and social cohesion of individual European \nstates are clearly under strain. We have seen street riots and police \nsuppression. Growing hostility between citizens and migrant groups is \nspreading like wildfire. Extremist political groups are feeding on this \nchaos and further threatening democratic institutions. Even in Germany, \nan extremist rightwing, basically fascist party has grown its \npopulation from zero 4 years ago to 15 percent to 20 percent today, \ntaking over in many places as the third largest party in Germany. We \nall know that after key state elections this weekend, this may be \ngrowing.\n  The latest EU effort to come to grips with this enormous problem is \ncontinuing at a summit meeting this week in Brussels, with attendance \nby Turkey. The draft agreement on the table shows how desperate the \nEuropeans have become. Without discussing the detailed items here, it \nis sufficient to note that the central proposition under consideration \nis this: a convoluted system to send some migrant refugees from Greece \nback to Turkey in exchange for other migrants to be resettled directly \nfrom Turkey to European countries. The United Nations High Commissioner \nfor Refugees and other refugee organizations have denounced this \nproposal as unworkable and illegal. Some EU countries, such as Hungary, \nhave even promised to veto this scheme.\n  Without entirely prejudging a proposal still under consideration, I \nnevertheless have to guess that even if it is accepted and enacted, it \nis unlikely to address meaningfully the real dimensions of this \nmigration problem. Something else clearly has to be done. The numbers \nthat are coming in show an ever-expanding number of migrants seeking \nrelief by taking treacherous routes--many of them guided by criminal \nelements--into Europe and the European resistance and the instability \nall of that has provided.\n  The draft EU-Turkey agreement does include a commitment to pursue \nanother idea, and that is what I want to talk about on the floor this \nafternoon. I have long advocated this as hopefully a more workable \ncondition; that is, to create conditions in and near Syria that will \npermit people to remain there in humane conditions of relative safety \nnear their home country, within their own culture. To my knowledge, \nEuropean leaders as a group have not before committed to pursue this \nsolution, but I have raised it with European leaders personally. The \nresponse has often considered the caution that Europe would not be \nwilling to commit the resources necessary for such a solution. I agree \nthat the resources required would be considerable and that the \npolitical courage required would be even greater, but, I have argued, \nwhat is the alternative? Until political leaders in Europe, and here as \nwell, see that creating safe areas in and near Syria is the only \npossible solution to this migration crisis, the political courage and \nvision to take it up will be absent. But now, at least, the Europeans, \nhaving failed at a number of other efforts to address this \ndestabilizing problem, are talking about it.\n  It has always been clear to me that such a solution is far beyond the \ncapacity of Europe alone. It will require the United States and other \ncooperating powers to work with our European partners to create areas \nin and near Syria where Syrians can find safety and humanitarian \nrelief.\n  As difficult as this task sounds--and surely it is--it has been done \nbefore. There is a precedent here. The manner in which the \ninternational community eventually came to deal successfully with the \nBosnian war in the 1990s gives us a useful template for how we can \napproach the safe-area task in Syria. That template, derived from our \nBosnia experience, includes two essential components: the U.N. Security \nCouncil and NATO, North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  First, we are going to have to have a clear mandate from the U.N. \nSecurity Council creating U.N.-designated safe areas.\n  Secondly, the U.N. Security Council would have to create a new U.N. \nprotective force. ``UNPROFOR'' is the term that was used in the \nBalkans. In the Balkan example, that force was comprised of 40,000 \ntroops from 42 contributing countries. In Syria, I would suggest that \nsuch a course would include most NATO countries and especially \nneighboring Islamic countries. Russia should also be pressed to \nparticipate. NATO could take on primary planning and organization \ntasks.\n  When I discussed this proposal with Europeans, the first response has \nbeen that no one is willing to put troops in the field to fight this \nwar. It is important to emphasize that this UNPROFOR would not be in \nSyria to fight the war; rather, it would exist to protect the \ndesignated safe areas. The force would have policing functions intended \nto protect and secure the borders and keep radical elements out or \nunder control. That was the model that was put in place in the Balkans. \nIt succeeded. There were some glitches, there were some problems, but \nit succeeded.\n  Third, it is obvious that safe areas in Syria would require rigidly \nenforced no-fly zones authorized by the UNSC.\n\n  Mr. President, I have presided a number of times, and when the clerk \nturns and discusses the timeframe--may I ask whether I am under a time \nlimitation? If so, I ask unanimous consent to extend that for just a \nfew moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, as I said, it is obvious that safe areas in \nSyria would require rigidly enforced no-fly zones authorized by the \nU.N. Security Council. I suggested that with its planning and \nleadership capabilities and massive resources, NATO should take on that \njob, as it did in the Balkans. In this role, too, NATO must work \ncreatively to bring in the regional powers in a broad, coordinated \neffort under NATO leadership.\n  Fourth, as in Bosnia, the U.N. must mobilize a massive relief effort \nwithin Syria led by the UNHCR and similar humanitarian organizations.\n  The international community must be willing to pay for this important \nhumanitarian effort. We should call for major contributions from the \nregional states, European countries, and other traditional donor \ncountries long committed to the humanitarian crisis.\n  Dealing with so many refugees in safe, humane conditions will be \nexpensive, yes, but it cannot be more expensive than the costs already \nbeing borne by those destination countries burdened with uncontrolled \nmigration.\n  In the current discussions of Turkey, the EU has offered 6 billion \neuros to help them deal with refugees, and Turkey has reportedly \ndemanded as much as 20 billion euros. With such sums being discussed--\nand they almost certainly are underestimates--the costs for caring for \nthese desperate people humanely, in conditions of safety, and\n\n[[Page S1377]]\n\nin or near their homeland, are easily justified.\n  Far greater costs will be incurred if this problem is not dealt with \neffectively. For example, a collapse of the Schengen system and \nreimposition of border controls in Europe--a process now underway--\ncould cost as much as 1.4 trillion euros over the next 10 years, \naccording to a recent European Commission report. This is the cost in \nreduced economic outlook for the region, not including the costs for \ninfrastructure and personnel if the Schengen system is abandoned.\n  In returning to where I began, the extra security gained by such a \nsolution is beyond price.\n  I strongly believe the time has now come for us to press vigorously \nfor the safe-area solution to the migrant crisis. The problem is \ngrowing far worse with each passing month. Efforts to identify other \nsolutions have failed, and the safe-area proposal may be the only one \nleft standing. Those who are discouraged by the admitted obstacles and \ngreat difficulties in pursuing this solution must simply be persuaded \nto take it up with creativity, determination, courage, and leadership.\n  I have discussed this proposal directly with Vice President Biden, \nSecretary of State Kerry, Supreme Allied Commander and NATO Commander \nGeneral Breedlove, and senior European leaders. The Vice President, \nbased on his own experience with the Balkan wars, agrees that the \nBosnia precedent could be a useful guide. The general agrees that there \nare sufficient resources if there is sufficient political will. The \nEuropean leaders I have spoken with agree that no other alternative is \nvisible at this time. That they included this idea in the negotiations \nwith Turkey is a positive sign. I intend to keep these discussions \ngoing in coming days.\n  In conclusion, I am under no illusions about how difficult this task \nwould be for either us or our allies. It is an enormous undertaking, \nand even when it does not address the underlying conflict in Syria, \nwhich has so far defied all of our best efforts, it is something we \nmust pursue. However, the continuing flow of millions of refugees and \nmigrants is completely unsustainable, posing serious threats to our \nEuropean friends and ultimately to all of us.\n  I will continue to press for this and talk to European leaders and \nothers in our country to see this as a necessary, viable, and doable \nsolution to a crisis situation that is having enormous impacts on the \nstability of Europe and even on the United States in terms of this \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  With that, I thank my colleague for his patience and allowing me to \nconclude.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am on the floor for the 130th time \nin my ``Time to Wake Up'' series urging us to wake up to the threat of \nclimate change here.\n  Time and time again, peer-reviewed science demonstrates that carbon \npollution from burning fossil fuels is causing unprecedented climate \nand oceanic changes. We see the effects already in our farms, our \nforests, and our fisheries. Yet the Republican-controlled Congress \ncontinues to hit the ``snooze'' button every time an alarm goes off.\n  Every major scientific society in our country, upon examining the \ndata, says climate change is real and it is caused by our carbon \npollution. So do all of our National Laboratories. So do our leading \nhome State universities. The Presiding Officer is from Nebraska, so let \nme read what the University of Nebraska says on its Web site: ``Climate \nchange poses significant risks to Nebraska's economy, environment, and \ncitizens.''\n  Another quote: ``The magnitude and rapidity of the projected changes \nin climate are unprecedented.''\n  The fundamental science of climate change is settled, and the stakes \nof the climate crisis loom large. In poll after poll, Americans \ndemonstrate they understand the connection between climate change and \nthe role humans play in affecting climate. A recent poll shows that 64 \npercent of Americans support enacting policies to address climate \nchange and 78 percent of Americans think Federal Government should curb \nthe release of greenhouse gases.\n  In spite of the overwhelming science demonstrating that climate \nchange is real and the growing awareness and determination of the \nAmerican public to do something about it, Congress continues to \nprevaricate. The reason is simple: the power and threats of the fossil \nfuel industry. But is this strategy, the fossil fuel industry strategy \nof obstruction and denial, actually self-injurious?\n  Let's look at coal. The coal industry--longtime provider of \ninexpensive yet dirty energy--is in economic decline. Between 2008 and \n2014, coal production and consumption have decreased by 15 percent and \n18 percent respectively. Analyses by the U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration suggest 2015 U.S. coal production was likely down a \nfurther 10 percent, the lowest level since 1986. Coal is losing its \nshare of the electricity market to natural gas and to wind power. From \n2002 to 2012, net generation from coal declined by 22 percent and coal-\nfired electricity, which just 15 years ago constituted 50 percent of \nthe electricity on the grid, now makes up only 33 percent, roughly, and \nfalling. Gas-fired powerplants generated more energy than coal in 7 of \nthe 12 months of 2015. Prior to 2015, gas-fired electricity generation \nnever exceeded coal.\n\n  The top four U.S. coal companies--Peabody Energy, Arch Coal, Cloud \nPeak Energy, and Alpha Natural Resources--produce approximately half of \nthe domestic volume of coal in this country. In the past 5 years, all \nfour companies' stock prices have crashed. According to a recent report \nfrom the Niskanen Center, a Libertarian-leaning think tank, the \ncombined total revenue of these top producers between 2010 and 2014 \ndeclined by approximately 18 percent.\n  Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs recently delivered more bad news for \nthe global coal market. According to its analysis, ``the industry does \nnot require new investment given the ability of existing assets to \nsatisfy flat demand, so prices will remain under pressure as the \ndeflationary cycle continues.''\n  The coal industry seems divorced from this reality. Consider what \nPeabody's CEO Gregory Boyce argued in his company's 2014 annual report: \n``[T]hermal coal consumption from the low-cost U.S. regions . . . is \nlikely to increase 50 to 70 million tons over the next 3 years as \nnatural gas prices recover, demand from other regions is displaced, and \nexpected coal plant retirements are offset by higher plant utilization \nrates.''\n  Well, the Energy Information Administration disagrees, projecting \nthermal coal demand growth of just 4 million tons between 2012 and \n2018. And remember, this was Peabody Energy's CEO speaking last week. \nWyoming's Star Tribune reported that Peabody Energy's senior lenders \nare recommending that America's largest coal company file for \nbankruptcy, as Arch Coal, the second largest coal miner in the United \nStates, did in January. Patriot Coal Corporation, Walter Energy, and \nAlpha Natural Resources have also all filed for bankruptcy in the past \nyear.\n  The fossil fuel strategy of political obstruction for coal is looking \nmore and more like economic suicide.\n  In some corners, light is dawning. Appalachian Power president and \nCEO Charles Patton told a meeting of energy executives last fall that \ncoal is losing a long-term contest with natural gas and renewables. He \nsaid this: ``If we believe we can just change administrations and this \nissue is going to go away, we're making a terrible mistake.''\n  Well, what if there is an answer to this terrible mistake that is \nalso an answer to climate change. What if we could reduce the amount of \ncarbon pollution we dump into the atmosphere and oceans while helping \ncommunities to transition from coal-based economies to clean energy \nones, helping coal miners. More and more conservative and libertarian \neconomists are making the case that the ailing coal industry should \nembrace a fee on carbon.\n  The idea is simple. You levy a price on the thing you don't want--\ncarbon pollution--and you use the revenue to pay for things you do \nwant. Greg Ip, chief economics commentator for the Wall Street Journal \nwrote:\n\n       The most reliable way to limit the bushing of fossil fuels \n     is to alter market signals so as\n\n[[Page S1378]]\n\n     to divert demand toward cleaner sources of energy or \n     conservation. We know how to do that: Put a price on carbon \n     dioxide emissions via a tax, or via tradeable emission \n     allowances in a cap-and-trade system. Both incentivize the \n     market to find the least economically harmful way to reduce \n     emissions.\n\n  Dr. Aparna Mathur of the conservative American Enterprise Institute \nconducted an analysis with a colleague from the Brookings Institution \nshowing a carbon fee could reduce emissions, shore up the country's \nfiscal outlook, and play an important role in broader tax reform. Dr. \nMathur points out: ``The fact that we understand better the burden of a \ncarbon tax and how to offset it for low-income households should make \nus more likely to adopt this policy, not less so.''\n  In fact, even the fossil fuel industry knows a carbon tax is an \neffective mechanism to help shift toward a low-carbon energy future. \nSix of the world's major oil and gas companies, including BP Group and \nRoyal Dutch Shell, wrote the United Nations last summer saying they \ncould take faster climate action if governments work together to put a \nproper price on the environmental and economic harms of greenhouse gas \nemissions. Here is what they said:\n\n       [W]e need governments across the world to provide us with \n     clear, stable, long-term ambitious policy frameworks. We \n     believe that a price on carbon should be a key element of \n     these frameworks.\n\n  Harvard Professor N. Gregory Mankiw was chair of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers for President George W. Bush, and he served as an \neconomic adviser to Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney. He \nagrees: ``The best way to curb carbon emissions is to put a price on \ncarbon.''\n  With a robust price on carbon, Congress could help coal mining \ncompanies, help coal mine workers, and help States and communities with \nsignificant coal mining activity. A carbon fee could be used to help \ncoal companies by supplanting current taxes and fees and funding carbon \ncapture for existing operating coal plants. A carbon fee could help \ncoal workers by retraining them for high-paying jobs and providing \npension and health care security not available from bankrupted \nemployers. A carbon fee can provide assistance to coal mining \ncommunities to help them transition through all the challenges I have \ndescribed.\n  A report by David Bookbinder and David Bailey of the Niskanen Center \nsaid this:\n\n       The coal industry is facing terminal decline. . . . An \n     unfettered chaotic decline of the coal industry would create \n     major social and economic issues such as deep regional \n     unemployment and a multitude of unfunded liabilities, \n     particularly for coal-dependent States.\n\n  They point out that there is a way to solve these problems:\n\n       Compensation for the losers from government policy action \n     is an important conservative principle.\n\n  It is in this spirit that I introduced, along with Senator Schatz, \nthe American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act of last year. I call it a \ncarbon fee because none of the revenues would go to fund Big \nGovernment. The bill is a simple proposal to cut emissions while \nraising over $2 trillion in revenue, all of which would be returned to \nthe American people--no bigger government.\n  In addition to slashing the corporate tax rate, which the revenues \nwould let us do, and providing families with tax credits beginning at \n$1,000 per couple, which the revenues also would allow us to do, the \nbill would provide $20 billion of flexible annual funding back to the \npeople through their States to be used to help them through this \ninevitable transition--this inevitable transition. In coal-heavy \nStates, this money could make the difference for communities that have \nbeen reliant on coal jobs.\n  Arthur Laffer, economic adviser to President Reagan, called our bill \na ``game-changer.'' He said of my proposal: ``I applaud Senator \nWhitehouse's efforts to reduce carbon emissions while simultaneously \noffsetting--through pro-growth marginal tax rate decreases--the harm \ndone to the economy by the carbon tax.''\n  I introduced my bill to start a conversation with Republicans on how \nbest to design a carbon fee to help the economy. I would welcome the \nopportunity to sit down with any colleague to discuss ways to improve \nour proposal.\n  The coal industry in particular has a clear choice: either to keep \nfighting climate action, keep obstructing, keep their head in the sand, \ncontinue to be truculent and obtuse until they crash into more \nbankruptcy in that unfettered chaotic decline the Niskanen Center \npredicts or they could embrace a carbon fee and use it to provide for \ncoal communities, to provide for coal workers, to provide for carbon \nrecovery, and to provide for retirees burdened with unfunded pension \nobligations.\n  Mr. President, I have put a ladder into the water, and I urge the \ncoal industry, before it goes under, to grab hold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, our Nation's Founders fought the British \nEmpire to create an independent nation governed by laws. They fought so \ntheir children could be freed from the callous fiats of a monarchy on \nthe other side of the ocean.\n  Our Founders learned from the excesses and mistakes of European \npowers and came together to design a new system of government, a \ncarefully balanced system, one of distributed powers and \nresponsibilities, checks and balances. American schoolchildren learn \nabout the three coequal branches of government and the unique roles \nthey play in maintaining that carefully crafted balance of power.\n  A strong, independent, and fully functioning judiciary is inseparable \nfrom a healthy American democracy. Our Founders wisely reached \nconsensus to create a system wherein the President designates judicial \nnominees and the Senate provides advice and consent. This prevents \nundue influence or control by either the White House or the Congress \nover the Supreme Court. Simply put, the Senate has a constitutional \nduty to provide timely consideration of any President's Supreme Court \nnominees.\n  Today, I would like to focus on three distinct and complementary \nreasons why we must fulfill this obligation. First, we should examine \nthe ample historical records available to determine the intent of our \nNation's Founders. Second, we should look at the actual text of the \nConstitution and the plain meaning of the words in the document we all \nagree represents the highest law in the land. Finally, we can look at \nthe Senate's track record and traditions when it comes to considering \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  As Senators, we raise our hand and take a solemn oath to defend the \nConstitution of the United States and faithfully discharge the duties \nof our office. One of the core constitutionally mandated duties of \nserving as a Senator is to advise and consent on Supreme Court \nnominees, and it is not one we can take lightly.\n  We are fortunate that many of our Nation's forefathers were prolific \nwriters who left us reams of documents that now help us understand the \ndebates and the discussions that led to our current system of \ngovernment.\n  Our Nation's fourth President and the youngest member of the \nConstitutional Convention, James Madison, kept a record of the debates \nthat occurred during those formative months of our Nation in the summer \nof 1787. I urge my colleagues to revisit this record as they consider \nhow to proceed with our Nation's next Supreme Court nominee.\n  On June 4, 1787, James Wilson of Pennsylvania--a signatory of the \nDeclaration of Independence and a member of the Continental Congress--\nargued that justices should be appointed by the executive branch alone \nand strongly opposed appointments made by the Federal legislature. \nMadison disliked the appointment of judges by the legislature but also \nwasn't satisfied with a unilateral Executive appointment. He ultimately \nsuggested that judicial appointments should be made by the Senate. This \nissue of judicial appointments was debated vigorously and continued \nover multiple sessions as delegates traded proposals. Charles Pinckney \nof South Carolina and Roger Sherman of Connecticut opposed Wilson and \npushed for the legislative appointment of Justices.\n\n  Madison, however, moved us closer to our present system by suggesting \nthat only the Senate should have the power to appoint Justices to the \nSupreme Court and not the House of Representatives.\n\n[[Page S1379]]\n\n  Nathaniel Gorham, a delegate from Massachusetts, first introduced the \nconcept of appointment by the President with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate. This balanced approach resolved the concerns of delegates \nwho believed unilateral Presidential appointments bordered on monarchy, \nwhile also addressing the concern that legislative appointments were \nsimply too vulnerable to the fleeting parochial interests that may \ndominate the discussion on any given day.\n  Months later, on September 7, 1787, the delegates unanimously agreed \non the final language that governs the nomination and confirmation of \nSupreme Court Justices to this day. Our Founders' focus on the \nappointment and confirmation of the Supreme Court Justices was not an \nacademic exercise, nor was it an intergovernmental turf war. It was an \niterative, deliberative process with a clear goal: a strong and \nindependent judiciary.\n  Alexander Hamilton, probably the most prolific of our Founders when \nit comes to the written word, directly addressed the independence of \nthe judiciary in The Federalist Papers. He argued: ``Liberty can have \nnothing to fear from the judiciary alone, but would have everything to \nfear from its union with either of the other departments.''\n  Hamilton was concerned that a Supreme Court too heavily influenced by \nCongress or the White House would not adequately protect the rights and \nfreedoms of the American people. He wrote that an independent judiciary \n``will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the \nConstitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure \nthem.''\n  Tying the hands of the Supreme Court by keeping an empty seat on the \nnine-member bench amounts to the union between the departments that \nHamilton warned us about. Refusing to even consider a Supreme Court \nnominee strengthens the Senate to the detriment of the executive and \njudicial branches, throws off a carefully crafted balance of power, and \ncontravenes our Founders' intent. Some legal scholars, Senators, and \nmembers of the judiciary argue that intent is irrelevant and that we \nshould strictly construe the words on the page.\n  Let's look at the plain meaning of the constitutional text. Article \n3, section 1, states that ``The judicial Power of the United States, \nshall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as \nthe Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.''\n  While lower courts could be established by Congress, the Supreme \nCourt resolves issues between and among the States. It is the highest \nCourt in the land, a Court of finality.\n  The Constitution specifically addresses the appointment of Justices \nto the Supreme Court.\n  Article 2, section 2, states the President ``shall nominate''--and I \nrepeat ``shall nominate''--``and by and with the Advice and Consent of \nthe Senate, shall''--and I repeat ``shall''--``appoint Ambassadors, \nother public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  ``Shall'' is not a word that is considered ambiguous. Its meaning \nhasn't evolved over time. It is not open for interpretation. It is not \npermissive in nature. It is instructive, and it is clear.\n  There are many modern-day issues we face that our Founders could have \nnever imagined. We will grapple with novel constitutional questions for \nas long as this Nation exists. But the question of how Supreme Court \nJustices are appointed is something our Founders debated, decided, and \nthey enshrined in the Constitution.\n  The President is required to nominate a Justice, and the Senate has \nthe job of confirming or rejecting that appointment. If the Senate \nattempts to undermine the President's constitutional responsibility to \nnominate a Justice and this body fails to provide advice and consent on \nthat nomination--well, we then have abdicated one of the Senate's most \nimportant and sacred constitutional obligations.\n  The Senate has a longstanding tradition of swiftly considering and \nconfirming judicial nominees. Presidents and the Senate have \nhistorically taken their responsibility to fill the Supreme Court very \nseriously, even when they were at odds over who that nominee may have \nbeen. I am surprised and also disappointed that so many of my \ncolleagues seem to be ignoring their constitutional obligations in a \nstark departure from the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, since \nthe Judiciary Committee's creation 200 years ago, they have typically \nreported Supreme Court nominations that were opposed by a committee \nmajority to allow the full Senate to make the final decision on whether \nthe nominee should be confirmed.\n  Let me repeat this very important fact. Even if a nominee was opposed \nin committee, their nomination was still brought to the floor of the \nSenate for a vote.\n  Let's also consider recent history. Since 1975, the time from a \nPresident's formal nomination to hearing has averaged 42 days. The time \nfrom a nomination to committee vote has averaged 57 days. The time from \na nomination to floor vote has averaged 70 days.\n  The current vacancy we are dealing with occurred 269 days before the \n2016 election and with 342 days remaining in President Obama's term in \noffice. Without doing a whole lot of math, it is safe to say that there \nis more than enough time to nominate, consider, and confirm a Supreme \nCourt Justice before the November election if we move at a deliberate, \naverage pace, on par with what has existed for over four decades.\n  If the Senate waits for a new administration before even considering \na nominee, we will be approaching a full year with an empty seat on the \nhighest Court in the land. Not since the American Civil War has the \nSenate taken longer than a year to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.\n  There is a reason that Presidents and the Senate work together and \nhistorically do not drag out Supreme Court nominations: An eight-member \nSupreme Court simply cannot fully do its job. The cases in which the \nSupreme Court relies on having all nine Justices to break a deadlock \nare often those that are most contested. They involve timely, novel \nlegal issues and resolve splits between Federal circuit courts.\n  Legal scholar Justin Pidot recently cited Chief Justice William \nRehnquist regarding situations where the court of appeals had arrived \nat different conclusions about the resolution of legal issues. \nRehnquist said: ``Affirmance of each of such conflicting results by an \nequally divided Court would lay down `one rule in Athens, and another \nin Rome,' with a vengeance.''\n  Over 30 constitutional law scholars recently echoed that sentiment, \nwriting: ``A vacancy on the Court for a year and a half likely would \nmean many instances where the Court could not resolve a split among the \ncircuits. There would be the very undesirable result that the same \nfederal law would differ in meaning in various parts of the country.''\n  Federal law is just that: It is Federal. We cannot have one \ninterpretation of Federal law in Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky and a \nwhole different interpretation of law in Wisconsin, Illinois, and \nIndiana.\n  Previous Presidents have weighed in on the importance of a fully \noperational Court. President Reagan said: ``Every day that passes with \na Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in \nthat crucially important body.''\n  I know many of my colleagues in the Senate revere President Reagan, \nand I wish to repeat his important words that have so much relevance to \nwhat we are debating here today. He said: ``Every day that passes with \na Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's business in \nthat crucially important body.''\n  In fact, President Reagan was able to make a Supreme Court \nappointment in his final year in office. The Senate fulfilled its \nduties by providing timely consideration of that nominee, Justice \nAnthony Kennedy.\n  Forcing lower courts to serve as the courts of last resort empowers \ncongressionally created courts and weakens the Supreme Court in a way \nthat was never intended by the Framers of the United States \nConstitution.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the Constitution allows Congress \nto decide how to organize the lower courts. But the Constitution \nrequires--it requires--the advice and consent of the Senate for \nconfirmation of Supreme Court Justices. We must do our job so that the \nSupreme Court can do theirs.\n\n[[Page S1380]]\n\n  The American people have elected President Obama to office twice, and \nhe has a constitutional obligation and clear authority to nominate a \ncandidate to succeed Justice Scalia on the Supreme Court.\n  The Senate has previously confirmed six Supreme Court nominees in \nPresidential election years, including most recently under President \nReagan. There is no reason we should not consider any nominee put \nforward by the President with a fair hearing and a vote. Each and every \nMember of this body has the responsibility to thoroughly scrutinize and \ndecide whether or not to confirm the President's nominee.\n  I ran for the U.S. Senate because of my desire to serve the people of \nthe State of Michigan. I took an oath, as did every Member of this \nbody, swearing to defend the Constitution and faithfully discharge the \nduties of our office.\n  The Senate must honor the thoughtfulness of our country's forefathers \nand respect the independence of each of the branches of our Nation's \ngovernment. We must also respect the United States Constitution. The \nrole of the Supreme Court is simply too important to our democracy for \nthe Senate to ignore the Constitution and wait nearly a year to do its \njob.\n  Members of this body must fulfill their obligations. The Members of \nthis body must honor their duty and uphold their constitutional oath. \nAnd the Members of this body must fully consider and evaluate the \nqualifications of any nominee the President submits.\n  I look forward to doing my own thorough review of the President's \nnominee and working with my colleagues to fulfill our essential \nconstitutional duties.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Biomedical Research\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last year the law everybody wanted to \nfix was named No Child Left Behind. Despite many different opinions and \nmany different political attitudes, we got it done. I give great credit \nto the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Patty Murray, and to the members \nof our Education Committee, 22 Senators of widely divergent political \nviews, for their willingness to do that.\n  I often say if all you want to do is announce your opinion, you can \ndo that at home. You can stand on the street corner and preach or you \ncan get your own radio program, but if you want to be a U.S. Senator, \nafter you announce your opinion, you are supposed to get a result, and \nthat means work with other people to identify common areas of interest \nand see if you can, and we were able to do that with the bill that \nfixed No Child Left Behind. Not only did we reach a consensus that \nneeded to be fixed, we reached a consensus on how to fix it. The \nPresident signed it on December 10. He called it a Christmas miracle. \nIt passed broadly in this body and it had the effect of reversing the \ntrend toward a national school board, of repealing the common core \nmandate, and of, according to the Wall Street Journal, being the \nlargest devolution of power from Washington to local control of schools \nin 25 years. So it was a significant bill, and I would argue that no \nbill that the Congress enacted last year was more important.\n  This year, I would suggest that if we are successful, that the most \nimportant bill that passes this body will be a bill to advance \nbiomedical research, a companion bill to the 21st century cures bill \nthe House of Representatives already passed. That is because this is \nthe opportunity that everybody wants us to take. It is the opportunity \nto take advantage of the tremendous advances in scientific discovery \nthat have created an environment where we have opportunities to help \nvirtually every American.\n  We are able to cure some cancers instead of just treat cancers. \nChildren with cystic fibrosis are beginning to be actually cured of \ntheir disease, a disease that was completely debilitating. Remarkable \nadvances are being made because of genomic research. We have \nexceptionally talented people in charge of the agencies in dealing with \nthis; for example, Dr. Francis Collins with the National Institutes of \nHealth and now the recently confirmed Dr. Califf at the Food and Drug \nAdministration. So this is the best opportunity we have to make a mark \nin the Senate this year to help virtually every American, and we have \nsome catching up to do.\n  It is rare that I would admit the House of Representatives is ahead \nof us, but they are. They called their bill the 21st century cures \nbill. We have a common objective; that is, to get cures, drugs, and \ntreatments through the regulatory process and the investment process \nmore rapidly and into the medicine cabinets of the doctors' offices so \nthey can help people. They finished their work last year. The President \nhas taken the lead. He has called for a Precision Medicine Initiative. \nIt is one of his major initiatives. I talked with him about it last \nyear. I said: Mr. President, we will help you do that, and the way to \ndo it is through our Biomedical Innovation Initiative. What he wants to \ndo, to begin with, is to get a million genome sequenced so that when \nthe Senator from Arizona is sick--which he rarely is, he is in such \ngood health--or I am sick, the doctor may prescribe medicine that fits \nour own individual genome and not just a medicine that is, in effect, \none-size-fits-all. That is just part of the excitement of precision \nmedicine. And then more recently the President has announced the Cancer \nMoonshot to try to make further advances in that.\n\n  There is additional interest on both sides of the aisle in a surge of \nnew funding for the National Institutes of Health, possibly including \nmandatory funding, if it is properly done, which means replacing other \nmandatory funding. There is bipartisan interest in that.\n  But none of that will happen unless we move through our committee and \non to the floor and to a conference with the House and on to the \nPresident's desk our biomedical research bill, our companion bill to \nthe 21st century cures.\n  The only way to get support for the President's Precision Medicine \nInitiative, the only way to get the Cancer Moonshot, the only way to \nget a surge of funding that may include mandatory funding for the NIH \nis to pass this bill. Let's be blunt about it.\n  The good news is, we are making good progress. We are making good \nprogress. I wanted to report to the Senate that this morning we had our \nsecond markup, our second meeting of our full committee where we \ndiscussed the measure we have been working on for more than a year for \nour biomedical innovation bill. We have come up with 50 bipartisan \nproposals that Members have been working on to get patients access to \nmore drugs, cures, and treatments in a safe and effective way. We have \nheld 10 bipartisan hearings on our innovation project, and 6 of those \n10 hearings have been on an electronic health care records system. That \nprogram, we found, was in a ditch. The taxpayers have spent $30 million \non it to try to draw into it doctors and hospitals to use electronic \nmedical records so that you could take--so you know what your records \nare and the doctors could prescribe and diagnosis more easily. The \nproblem was, it wasn't done very well. Stage one was helpful, most of \nthe hospitals and doctors said to me. Stage two was difficult, and \nstage three, in their words, was terrifying.\n  Precision medicine will not work unless we have an interoperable \nelectronic health care records system that has as its goal simplifying \nwhat happens in the doctor's office or the patient's bedroom in such a \nway--both with devices and with data--that people can make sense of it. \nIt will improve the practice of medicine. It will reduce the huge \namount of time doctors are spending on documentation. Some doctors say \nthey spend 40 or 50 percent of their time doing that. If they are doing \nthat, either they are doing something wrong or the government is doing \nsomething wrong, and my guess is we are. That is my guess. So we set \nout this year to take several steps to change that.\n\n[[Page S1381]]\n\n  The administration--and I will give them credit--has gotten the \nmessage as well, and they, including Dr. DeSalvo and Secretary Burwell \nand Andy Slavitt, the head of CMS, have made a priority of trying to \ntake this electronic medical records system and get it back on track so \nthat doctors and physicians will see it as an opportunity and not as a \nburden.\n  We have several steps in our legislation that will help make \nelectronic medical records work better. They include giving agencies \nmore flexibility for alliances like the Vanderbilt-Google partnership \nthat was announced the other day. They include dealing with the privacy \nissues that occur when you get a million genomes sequenced. They \ninclude encouraging interoperability and data sharing that is essential \nto doing this. So we are all working together to do that, but it will \nbe necessary to pass our bill for electronic medical records to move \nmore rapidly, and it will be necessary for the electronic medical \nrecords system to work if the President's Precision Medicine Initiative \nis to work.\n  Last month we had a markup in our committee where we considered 15 of \nour bipartisan proposals and 7 bills, and we passed them all. The bills \nwill mean better pacemakers for Americans with heart conditions, better \nrehabilitation for stroke victims, more young researchers entering the \nmedical field, and better access for doctors to their patients' medical \nrecords, as I just described. And for the parents of a child suffering \nfrom a rare disease like cystic fibrosis, the bill from Senators \nBennet, Burr, Warren, and Hatch increases the chances that researchers \nwill find a treatment or cure for your child's disease. That was the \ngood work in the committee last month.\n  Today, we met all morning and we considered 7 more bills, and about \n15 more proposals were incorporated in those bills. Each of those \nbills, the Senators feel, is an important step forward. For example, \nSenators Casey, Isakson, Brown, and Kirk offered a bill, which was \npassed, to create drugs to treat or cure rare diseases in children.\n  Senators Burr, Bennet, Hatch, and Donnelly proposed, and it was \npassed, to create a new system for breakthrough devices that is similar \nto the breakthrough for drugs that Senator Burr and Senator Bennet and \nothers worked on in 2012, and that has shown such promise and such \nresults. Everyone is pleasantly--I wouldn't say surprised, but maybe \nsurprised by how many new drugs have been approved by the FDA using the \nbreakthrough process from 2012. We hope the same will be true with the \nbreakthrough process for devices.\n  Senators Bennet and Hatch offered a bill that will remove the \nuncertainty in the definition of ``medical devices'' that was adopted \nin 1976. Most people didn't even know what software was in 1976.\n  Senators Burr, Casey, Isakson, and Roberts had a bill to spur the \ndevelopment to save the lives of victims of bioterror.\n  Senators Isakson, Casey, Donnelly, and Roberts offered a bill to \nprevent the promising new field of combination products from getting \ncaught in redtape at the FDA. By combination products, I mean devices \nand drugs together.\n  A bill from Senators Wicker, Klobuchar, Bennet, Collins, and Franken \nwould increase the say patients would have in the FDA approval process \nabout treatments received in a clinical trial.\n  Senators Franken, Nelson, Isakson, and Brown had a bill to encourage \ncompanies to develop a treatment, cure, or vaccine for the Zika virus.\n  These were all adopted, but for these to become law, we have to pass \nour bill. We have to bring it to the floor this year, and we have to do \nit in a bipartisan way and pass our bill.\n  At 3 markups--our third one will be in April--we will consider 50 \nproposals, and every single one of them has bipartisan support. There \nare two or three areas where we have a difference of opinion. I am glad \nto see the Senator from Illinois is here because one of the areas we \ndiscussed this morning is one where he has been very important, and \nthat is to have a surge of additional funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. Numbers of us were very proud of the work Senator \nMurray, Senator Blunt, Senator Durbin, and others did to make sure that \nwe had $2 billion more in the regular appropriations last year for the \nNational Institutes of Health--very important.\n  A number of us believe that it would be appropriate in connection \nwith this innovation legislation to have a surge of additional funding \nfor specific projects at the National Institutes of Health but not at \nthe expense of a steady increase in the regular discretionary funding. \nThere are a variety of reasons for that. I won't go into them all today \nbecause the Senator from Illinois may want to speak. But if we are \ntalking about mandatory funding, mandatory funding is already out of \ncontrol, and the President's new budget has $682 billion of mandatory \nfunding in it. It also has new taxes to pay for it, which the Congress \nisn't going to adopt. The more responsible proposal would be to reduce \nmandatory funding by $682 billion.\n  In any event, if we have any mandatory funding, it needs to replace \nother mandatory funding. And we don't want to create a situation where \nanyone gets the idea that mandatory funding is a substitute for steady \nincreases in discretionary funding, which has happened before. As \nSenator Blunt pointed out this week in our appropriations hearing, when \nthe Congress put in the mandatory funding for community health centers \nand the National Health Service Corps, the discretionary funds started \nto dry up.\n  So we have different proposals for how to deal with this. The \nDemocratic Senators on our committee have recommended $50 billion over \nthe next 10 years. I recommended an NIH innovation fund which would \ncreate a surge of funding for high-priority initiatives at NIH, \nincluding the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the Cancer \nMoonshot, the BRAIN Initiative, Big Biothink Awards, and a Young \nInvestigator Corps. It would be in addition to discretionary funds, not \na replacement for them.\n  So my hope is that Senator Murray and I and our committee can work \ntogether over the next 2 or 3 weeks and complete our work on our \nbiomedical research legislation by our markup on April 6. I hope we can \ncome to the floor and present to Senator McConnell, the majority \nleader, along with that, a bipartisan consensus for an additional surge \nof funding, including mandatory funding for medical research in the \nareas I have suggested. I have said that we will need to replace other \nmandatory funding in order for it to be considered. I hope we can work \nthat way in the committee, and I hope the Senate will look forward to \nreceiving this.\n  I will conclude by simply saying that last year I believe no bill was \nmore important that we worked on in the Senate than the bill to fix No \nChild Left Behind. It affected 50 million children, 3.5 million \nteachers, and 100,000 public schools. The only reason it happened was \nbecause we had Senators of very different backgrounds and attitudes and \npolitical differences who agreed that a result was more important. The \nsame here. The opportunity everybody wants us to take this year is to \ntake advantage of this magnificent scientific revolution and encourage \nthe research and the other steps we need to take to move treatments and \ncures and drugs into the medicine cabinets and the doctors' offices \nmore rapidly, in a safe and effective way. I believe we can do that. I \nhope our work is finished by early April. I hope it is bipartisan.\n  I look forward to the opportunity of being able to say later this \nyear that the most important bill the Senate worked on with the House \nand the President is this 21st century cures idea. The House has done \nits job. The President is out front. We need to catch up. I am \nconvinced we can.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, having followed my friend and colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Senator Alexander has spelled out an exciting \npossibility, and I know it won't be easy. It is a heavy political lift. \nBut what he is talking about is coming up with a dramatic commitment of \nfunds for medical research for the next 8, 9, or 10 years, over and \nabove the ordinary budget of the National Institutes of Health.\n  We have sat down and talked about this several times, and I \nwholeheartedly endorse not only his concept\n\n[[Page S1382]]\n\nbut also when he gets down to specifics. Some of the things he wants to \nfocus on, including the Moonshot for Cancer, for example, is one, of \ncourse, the President and the Vice President and the vast majority of \nAmericans would endorse because there isn't a single one of us who \nhasn't been touched by the threat or the actual disease of cancer among \nour families and friends.\n  I won't go through the entire list, but whether we are dealing with \nthe issues involving the brain, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, \nneurological issues--there are so many needs there, and I \nwholeheartedly endorse what he is setting out to do. On a bipartisan \nbasis, I will work with him and Senator Murray and Senator Blunt and \nSenator Lindsey Graham. We all share these feelings, that this is \nsomething that will be a legacy item for this Senate.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership and his \ncooperation in building up the budget for the National Institutes of \nHealth research this year. The $2 billion will make a difference. I \nthank the Senator for being on the floor.\n\n\n                           Lead Contamination\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to address a couple of issues.\n  The contaminated water crisis in Flint, MI, is a wake-up call across \nAmerica. We have to have protections in place when it comes to lead \ncontamination. My heart goes out to people in Flint, MI, dealing with \nthe consequences of this preventable, manmade crisis. The Senate needs \nto do something to help the people of Flint. We must also recognize \nthat children across America are poisoned every day by lead, and we \nneed to do something about it to protect these families.\n  A Chicago Tribune reporter, Michael Hawthorne, recently authored some \narticles on this issue, revealing hundreds of cases of childhood lead \npoisoning stemming from different sources in Flint, such as lead-based \npaint in federally subsidized housing. That's right--housing we own as \ntaxpayers, housing we manage as the Federal Government, and housing \nwhich is dangerous to the children who are living there. Exposure to \nhigh levels of lead poisoning can be devastating to a child, causing \nirreparable damage. Because the children who live in this housing are \nfrom low-income families--many minority families--lead poisoning can \nfurther trap these kids in the cycles of poverty, violence, and \ninequality. Families are often stuck in the homes even after the lead \nis discovered with no place to go.\n  That is why Senator Menendez from New Jersey and I joined together to \noffer the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act, to ensure safe and affordable \nhousing by reducing the threat of lead exposure and lead poisoning. \nCongressional Representatives Keith Ellison, Mike Quigley from my State \nof Illinois, Brenda Lawrence, and Dan Kildee have introduced companion \nlegislation in the House.\n  Since the enactment of Federal lead policies in the early 1990s, lead \npoisoning rates have fallen. This is a big success story. However, the \nrisk of lead poisoning from lead-based paint hazards found in homes \ncontinues to threaten kids who are living in homes built before 1978. \nThis is especially true in Illinois. It is a problem in Cleveland, \nBaltimore, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and many other cities.\n  HUD regulations are outdated, ineffective, and based on old \nscientific discoveries that haven't been updated. Under current HUD \nregulations, a landlord is not required to remediate a home to make it \nsafe where lead-based paint hazards have been found until a child's \nblood lead level is 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter. That standard \nfrom HUD is four times the standard of the Centers for Disease Control. \nWhen I asked Secretary Castro of Housing and Urban Development why \nwould we have such a disparity--why would you allow lead contamination \nin a child four times the level of what the Centers for Disease Control \nsays is acceptable? He said: I have no answer, and we are going to \nchange it. It is just wrong. I salute him for acknowledging that, and I \nhope to help him in any way I can to change this regulation.\n  We also need better inspections. Inspections to qualify to be a part \nof a Federal housing program are cursory visual inspections. There is \nno way to discover lead paint that can be dangerous to household \nmembers or kids unless you have a thorough inspection. In addition to \nthat, once we discover there is lead in the residence, we have to find \nanother place for the family to live unless that lead can be remediated \nquickly.\n  No one knows this better than Lanice Walker. She moved out of public \nhousing in 2012 and into a home with a housing choice voucher. What an \nopportunity for her family--a new home. Less than 5 months after she \nand her family moved in, her 4-year-old daughter was diagnosed with \nlead poisoning. Lanice was aware of the dangers of lead in kids. She \nasked the Chicago Housing Authority for permission to move. They said \nno. Why? Because her daughter's blood level hadn't met the HUD \nstandard. It met the CDC standard, which was one-fourth, but hadn't met \nthe HUD standards. So despite her daughter having a blood lead level \ntwice that of what the CDC considers to be dangerous, they wouldn't \nmove her out of her house. So she stayed. Within the next year, another \nchild in the house was diagnosed with lead poisoning, too, and then \nanother one. Before she moved out, all nine of Lanice's children had \nelevated blood lead levels. Even so, she received permission to move \nonly after legal advocates intervened. This could have been avoided if \nthe home had been properly inspected.\n  Sadly, this isn't an isolated incident. Since 2012, in Chicago alone \nat least 180 kids in section 8 housing have fallen victim to this \nmismatch in the blood level standards. After hearing Lanice's story, \nthe Chicago Housing Authority said it would voluntarily recognize the \nCDC guidelines, even though HUD didn't require them to. That is a good \nstep. However, families all across America need the same relief that \nwill come when HUD standards are changed. That is what this bill is all \nabout. I commend it to my colleagues and hope they would look at it \ncarefully in an effort to ensure that public housing is safe.\n  What did we learn in Flint, MI? We think 9,000 children were exposed \nto the lead in the water that has had an impact on them--for some, \nbrain damage that cannot be reversed. Who will answer for the poisoning \nof 9,000 children? How can we answer to the next generation that faces \nthis hazard if we don't take this important step?\n  We need to ensure that Federal lead standards are updated in \naccordance with the best available science, and adopt primary \nprevention measures to protect children from lead exposure in low-\nincome housing. That means aligning HUD standards with the CDC's \nstandards and requiring a risk assessment before a family moves into a \nhome, and allowing mothers like Lanice Walker to move her family \nwithout the fear of losing assistance when a lead hazard is identified.\n  We all know how destructive lead poisoning is on children and our \nsociety. Yet, our federal policies are actually allowing young children \nto stay in unsafe homes for months after they have been diagnosed with \nlead poisoning. By updating HUD's regulations, we can protect the most \nvulnerable children from the harmful, irreversible effects of lead \npoisoning.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this important effort. American \nchildren are depending on it, and they cannot afford to wait.\n  Mr. President, we have a bill before us to deal with opioids and the \nheroin crisis. It is a crisis that hit Illinois and hit it hard. Across \nIllinois we suffered from over 1,700 drug overdose deaths in 2014--a \n30-percent increase over 2010; 40 percent were associated with heroin.\n  Last October in Chicago, in a weekend, we had 74 people die from \nfentanyl-laced heroin overdoses in 72 hours. The Chicago metro area \nranked first in the country, sadly, for total number of emergency \ndepartment heroin visits. This is higher than New York, which has three \ntimes the population. This epidemic demands our attention. We need a \ncomprehensive solution.\n  First, look at Pharma flooding America with opioids such as \nOxyContin, hydrocodone, and similar opioid products. In the last year, \nthere was a calculation that there were some 14 billion opioid pills \nmanufactured by pharmaceutical companies in America. That is enough to \ngive every adult person in America a 1-month prescription of opioids. \nNaturally, everyone doesn't\n\n[[Page S1383]]\n\nneed it, but they keep generating these volumes because the demand is \nthere--not for medicinal purposes, sadly, but for narcotic purposes. \nThe pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility, and doctors have a \nresponsibility. Those pills don't move from the pharmaceutical \ncompanies to the end user except with a doctor and a pharmacy in most \ninstances.\n  Many doctors are too loose in their prescriptions when it comes to \npainkillers. They prescribe too many pills. I guess somebody makes more \nmoney that way, or maybe doctors are not bothered on weekends that way, \nbut, sadly, it puts into circulation a lot of medications that are not \nneeded for pain. Some pharmacies know exactly what is going on as \npeople walk in with scrip after scrip for opioids. They fill them \nwithout question. Many States don't have laws to monitor these sales.\n  Then comes the devastation of opioid addiction followed by heroin \naddiction. I have seen it across my State. There isn't a city too small \nor a suburb too wealthy or any corner of my State that hasn't been \ntouched by this crisis. It is everywhere. Many of the kids that I have \nseen at these roundtables who have survived it and tell their heroic \nstories of coming back from heroin addiction--you look in their eyes \nand say: I would never have picked that kid out of a high school class \nto be a heroin addict. Some of them have been addicts for years before \nthey finally get the treatment they need.\n  We need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis. We must \nprevent drug companies from flooding the market with excessive amounts \nof addictive pills. We must encourage the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration to use their existing authority to keep unnecessary \ndrugs off the market. We must crack down on doctors who over-prescribe \nand pharmacies that over-dispense. We must remove barriers to substance \nuse disorder treatments, which is why Senator King and I introduced \nlegislation ensuring that lower-income patients suffering from \nsubstance abuse disorders are able to get the care they so desperately \nneed. And we must put our money where our mouth is. We cannot expect \nreal change to come about through good intentions. We can authorize all \nthe programs we want, issue all the directives we want, cite all the \nstatistics we want, but nothing will change unless we give our Federal \nagencies and local governments the resources necessary to tackle this \ncomplex problem head on.\n  This bill before us is a step in the right direction. It requires the \nestablishment of a Federal interagency task force to develop best \npractices for pain management and pain medication prescribing, creates \na national drug awareness campaign on the risks of opioid abuse, and \nauthorizes grants to States, locals, and nonprofits to address opioid \nabuse and fund treatment alternatives.\n  This bill could have a positive impact on communities in need if we \nare able to provide the necessary funding. That is why in addition to \nsupporting the underlying bill I also strongly supported the amendment \nthat Senator Shaheen offered last week. That amendment would have \nprovided $600 million in emergency supplemental appropriations to \naddress the heroin and opioid abuse epidemic. These funds would have \nhelped ramp up law enforcement efforts, drug treatment and enforcement \nprograms, and prevention programs through the Justice Department. They \nwould have enhanced prescription drug monitoring programs. They would \nhave improved access to medication assisted treatment services to high-\nrisk areas as well as support school and community partnerships to \ncreate safe and drug-free environments and provide additional \nassistance to States to help pay for prevention and treatment care.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Shaheen's amendment was defeated when a \nmajority of Republicans decided to vote against it. If we fail to \nprovide the needed resources to help communities and families in need, \nwe may be back here a year from now saying we should have done more. \nFamilies in Illinois and across the country can't wait that long.\n  I support both the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the \nShaheen amendment. But the bill should also address some of the many \nissues I have learned about at roundtable discussions in Illinois while \ntalking to families, doctors, law enforcement, and those who have \novercome substance abuse addiction.\n  That is why I introduced several amendments that would have helped \nimprove the underlying bill, from requiring greater consideration at \nFDA before new opioids can come onto the market, to creating incentives \nfor States to improve their prescription drug monitoring programs, to \nremoving existing barriers to substance abuse treatment for lower-\nincome patients, to requiring greater transparency on how many opioids \nare being manufactured in the United States annually. I am disappointed \nthat many of these amendments will not receive a vote this week, but I \nwill continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to advance these \nimportant proposals.\n  Let me say that one of the things that has helped is the fact that \nyears ago here in the U.S. Senate, two of my colleagues who no longer \nserve really did something historic. One was Paul Wellstone of \nMinnesota, who passed away in an airplane crash, and the other, Pete \nDomenici, a retired Senator from New Mexico. They required that every \nhealth insurance policy in America cover two things that weren't \ncovered by many: one, mental health counseling and the other, substance \nabuse treatment.\n  We built that into ObamaCare, so when you buy a health insurance \npolicy in America today, it covers substance abuse treatment as well as \nmental health counseling. Luckily for many families, when their kids \nend up being addicted, they can turn to their health insurance, and \ntheir health insurance can help pay for substance abuse treatment. We \nneed other sources, as well, when it comes to treatment for Medicaid, \nbut for those who want to repeal ObamaCare and get rid of it, that is \nanother provision to ask them about. Do they really want to get rid of \na requirement that health insurance policies cover mental health \ncounseling and substance abuse treatment? I think it is important that \nwe have it. I am not sure what we would do without it.\n  The opioid abuse and heroin epidemic is a national public health \nemergency that requires a comprehensive response coupled with the \nnecessary funding to actually make a difference. The amendments I have \nfiled, as well as the Shaheen amendment, would make important \nimprovements and provide emergency funding to help families in Illinois \nand across the country. Our communities need us to come together as \npartners to help solve this problem. I hope we do not let them down.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from Oklahoma is here. This is the \nlast statement I want to make, and it relates to the Supreme Court \nvacancy.\n  A group of historians and scholars sent a letter to President Obama \nabout the Supreme Court vacancy occasioned by the death of Justice \nAntonin Scalia. The signers of the letter include Robert Dallek, Doris \nKearns Goodwin, David M. Kennedy, Thomas E. Mann, Norman Ornstein, \nGeoff Stone, and numerous others.\n  The letter provides a helpful historical perspective on the decision \nby the Senate Republican majority to refuse any nominee to fill this \nvacancy a hearing before the U.S. Senate--something that has never \nhappened in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senate Republicans have said to keep that Scalia vacancy right \nwhere it is--a 4-to-4 Supreme Court for at least a year longer. We \nhaven't had a vacancy in the Supreme Court for over a year since the \nCivil War tore this Nation apart over 150 years ago.\n  This letter that has been sent to the President will be shared here. \nIt makes clear that the actions that are being called for by the \nRepublican majority are unprecedented--unprecedented. They have never \nhappened--the fact that they would refuse to have a hearing for a \nnominee to fill the Scalia vacancy or a vote on that nominee.\n  One only has to go back to 1988, not that long ago, when President \nRonald Reagan, a Republican outgoing President in the last year of his \nPresidency sent a name to the U.S. Senate, then in control by a \nDemocratic majority, to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Did the \nDemocrats in the Senate in 1988 say to President Reagan: Oh, you are a \nlameduck. You are going to be\n\n[[Page S1384]]\n\ngone in a year. We will wait until after the election. No. They said \nthe Constitution requires President Reagan to send the Senate a name, \nand it requires the Senate to advise and consent, and they did. They \nhad a hearing and they had a vote and Anthony Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan \nappointee to the Supreme Court, was sent to the Supreme Court by \nPresident Ronald Reagan with the support of the Democratic Senate \nmajority. That is consistent with the Constitution.\n  I hope we can return to that, and I hope that future generations will \njudge that this Senate under the control of the Senate majority party \nis going to live by the words of our Constitution.\n  As I mentioned, a number of prominent historians and scholars from \nacross the political spectrum sent a letter to President Obama about \nthe current vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  This letter provides a helpful historical perspective on the decision \nby Senate Republicans not to give any consideration to the forthcoming \nSupreme Court nominee.\n  The letter begins by saying:\n\n       We express our dismay at the unprecedented breach of norms \n     by the Senate majority in refusing to consider a nomination \n     for the Supreme Court made by a president with 11 months to \n     serve in the position. . . .\n       It is standard practice when a vacancy occurs on the \n     Supreme Court to have a president, whatever the stage in his \n     term, nominate a successor and have the Senate consider it. \n     And standard practice (with limited exception) has been for \n     the Senate, after hearings and deliberation, to confirm the \n     president's choice, regardless of party control, when that \n     choice is deemed acceptable to a Senate majority.\n\n  The letter notes that history is, ``replete with instances where a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court was filled during a presidential election \nyear.''\n  This includes 1988 under President Reagan; 1940 under President \nRoosevelt; 1932 under President Hoover; 1916 for two nominees named by \nPresident Wilson; and 1912 under President Taft.\n  The letter also discusses how President Eisenhower used his recess \nappointment power in the presidential election year of 1956 to appoint \nJustice William Brennan. Eisenhower, a Republican, made that recess \nappointment on October 16 while the Senate was under Democratic \ncontrol.\n  The letter says, ``there was no objection to Eisenhower's use of the \nrecess appointment--there was instead a widespread recognition that it \nwas bad to have a Supreme Court operate for months without its full \ncomplement of nine members.''\n  The letter then shifts from the lessons of history to the logical \nfallacies of the Republicans' position that a nominee of a so-called \nlameduck President should not be considered. Here's what it says:\n\n       If we accept the logic that decisions made by ``lame duck'' \n     presidents are illegitimate or are to be disregarded until \n     voters make their choice in the upcoming election, that begs \n     both the questions of when lame duck status begins (after \n     all, a president is technically a `lame duck' from the day of \n     inauguration), and why senators up for reelection at the same \n     time should not recuse themselves from decisions until the \n     voters have decided whether to keep them or their partisans \n     in office.\n\n  The letter ultimately concludes that, ``the refusal to hold hearings \nand deliberate on a nominee at this level is truly unprecedented and, \nin our view, dangerous.''\n  I hope my Republican colleagues heed the words of these preeminent \nhistorians.\n  There will be real consequences if the Senate fails to do its job and \nleaves a Supreme Court vacancy open for an extended time.\n  As President Ronald Reagan said in 1987, quote, ``Every day that \npasses with a Supreme Court below full strength impairs the people's \nbusiness in that crucially important body.''\n  Major legal and constitutional questions are constantly brought \nbefore the Supreme Court for national resolution. When a case ends up \nwith a tie vote among the Justices, the Supreme Court's ruling has no \nprecedential impact and important questions go unresolved.\n  As Gregory Garre, former Solicitor General under President George W. \nBush, recently said, ``the prospect of numerous 4-4 ties or dismissals \nwould be undesirable to the Court.''\n  Millions of Americans are awaiting resolution of the questions that \nare before the Court. It is not fair to leave them twisting in the \nwind.\n  Consider the impact on the efforts of law enforcement to protect our \ncommunities.\n  On February 23, four former United States Attorneys wrote an op-ed in \nthe Cincinnati Enquirer.\n  They said:\n\n       For federal prosecutors, agents and criminal \n     investigations, a year is a lifetime. We have seen real \n     threats, whether it is the heroin epidemic or the threat of \n     ISIS recruitment, facing the people in our communities each \n     day. While law enforcement stands ready to protect the public \n     from those threats, they need to know the rules of the road.\n\n  The op-ed continues:\n\n       The Supreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of the hardest \n     and most important questions facing law enforcement and our \n     nation. Even as we write today, unsettled legal questions \n     regarding search and seizure, digital privacy and federal \n     sentencing are either pending before the Supreme Court or \n     headed there. It is unfair and unsafe to expect good federal \n     agents, police and prosecutors to spend more than a year \n     guessing whether their actions will hold up in court. And it \n     is just as unfair to expect citizens whose rights and \n     liberties are at stake to wait for answers while their homes, \n     emails, cell phones, records and activities are investigated.\n\n  We expect our law enforcement agents and prosecutors to do their job \nevery day, even in election years. We should expect Senators to do \ntheir jobs as well and fill this Supreme Court vacancy.\n  Earlier this week, 356 constitutional law scholars wrote a letter to \nthe Senate, explaining that ``a long term vacancy jeopardizes the \nSupreme Court's ability to resolve disputed questions of federal law, \ncausing uncertainty and hampering the administration of justice across \nthe country.''\n  Justice Scalia, in a 2004 memorandum discussing the Supreme Court's \nrecusal policy, noted the problems the Court faces when only eight \nJustices hear a case. He said that when the Court proceeds to hear a \ncase with eight Justices, it ``rais[es] the possibility that, by reason \nof a tie vote, it will find itself unable to resolve the significant \nlegal issue presented by the case.'' He then went on to note that under \nthe Supreme Court's Statement of Recusal Policy, ``even one unnecessary \nrecusal impairs the functioning of the Court.''\n  Why would the Senate purposefully try to impair the functioning of \nthe Supreme Court by leaving it with only eight Justices?\n  The Senate should do its job and consider a Supreme Court nominee so \nthe Court can function like it's supposed to. I urge my Republican \ncolleagues to do their job. Give the President's nominee a hearing and \na vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in light of recognition of Rare Disease \nDay, I wish to speak about orphan drug exclusivity and trade promotion \nauthority.\n  Congress enacted the bipartisan Orphan Drug Act, ``ODA'', of 1983, \nPub. L. 97-414, to address a longstanding unmet need to develop new \ntreatments, diagnostics, and cures for rare diseases and disorders. I \nam proud to be one of the lead Senate sponsors of the ODA, which was \npassed with overwhelming bipartisan support. This act and the Rare \nDiseases Act of 2002--which I also championed--created financial \nincentives for the research and production of orphan drugs, including 7 \nyears of market exclusivity, tax credits, and research grants, and also \nestablished the Orphan Products Board at FDA and the Office of Rare \nDiseases under the National Institutes of Health.\n  The purpose of these acts was to encourage the development of new \n``orphan'' treatments, diagnostics, and cures for the millions of \nAmericans with rare disease who lacked access to effective medicines \nbecause the existing incentives were insufficient to develop and market \ndrugs for such small groups of patients.\n\n[[Page S1385]]\n\n  The ODA has been enormously successful. Before Congress enacted the \nODA in 1983, the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, approved only 38 \ndrugs in the United States specifically to treat orphan diseases. From \nthe passage of the ODA in 1983 until May 2010, the FDA approved 353 \norphan drugs and granted orphan designations to 2,116 compounds. As of \n2010, 200 of the roughly 7,000 officially designated orphan diseases \nhave become treatable.\n  Yet, despite the benefits of these policies, the incentives and \naccess guarantees found in the ODA are not yet part of any free trade \nagreement negotiations.\n  The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act \nof 2015, or TPA, contain a number of negotiating objectives for the \nadministration to follow. For example, the TPA law's negotiating \nobjectives require that U.S. trade agreements provide a standard of \nintellectual property rights protection that is similar to that found \nin the United States, which includes providing incentives for \nbiopharmaceutical innovation that are similar to those in the United \nStates. The language in the TPA law is necessarily broad, and although \nit does not explicitly reference critical incentives for orphan drug \ndevelopment, I want to make it clear that these incentives, including \nthe 7-year market exclusivity at the heart of the ODA, are consistent \nwith the TPA law's requirement that U.S. trade agreements provide a \nstandard of intellectual property protection that is similar to U.S. \nlaw.\n  This is especially important because vital incentives for orphan drug \ndevelopment are lacking in many markets outside the United States, \nhindering the development of treatments, diagnostics, and cures for \nrare diseases--particularly diseases endemic to those markets. A lack \nof incentives for orphan drug development in any one country can have a \nvery real impact on the likelihood of investment into a research or \ncure for a given disease. Particularly in the case of ultra-rare \ndiseases, those affecting fewer than 1 in 50,000 individuals, there may \nonly be a handful of patients around the world who would benefit from a \nparticular treatment or cure, and removing a number of them from the \npool of potential patients may render investments in these therapies \nuntenable and could drive up costs for rare disease patients in the \nUnited States.\n  Therefore, I want to make it clear that I believe it is appropriate \nfor the administration to negotiate ODA incentives and access \nguarantees, including the 7-year market exclusivity period, in future \nU.S. trade agreements and that the intent of Congress is that TPA's \nnegotiating objectives are consistent with that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1385-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

He will be \nretiring from his post on July 31, 2016.\n  Dr. Foley came to the University of Mobile during a critical \ntransitional time and led the school through a period of significant \ngrowth. Under his guidance, the university has flourished. Facilities \nhave been updated, the school is on more solid financial footing, and \nprograms and the stature of the university have improved.\n  During his time at the University of Mobile, Dr. Foley led the \nuniversity to invest $44.8 million in capital projects, including a \nrecent $7 million campus enhancement program that thoroughly \nrevitalized the campus. Under Dr. Foley's leadership, the university \ngained national recognition from U.S. News & World Report, America's \nBest Christian Colleges, America's Best College Buys, and many more.\n  Dr. Foley helped to integrate a Christian worldview into all aspects \nof academics, campus life, and university operations at this quality \nBaptist-affiliated institution. The university now has more than 1,500 \nstudents enrolled in over 40 undergraduate and graduate programs.\n  A former truckstop operator, Dr. Foley was ordained as a Baptist \nminister in 1990 after receiving his master of divinity degree from the \nNew Orleans seminary. He received his doctorate from that same \ninstitution in 1992 and completed postdoctoral studies in education. \nThough the university was struggling with a variety of financial \nproblems when Dr. Foley took over in 1998, he turned the school around. \nThe University of Mobile has continued to thrive under Dr. Foley's \ntenure.\n  As a native of Mobile, AL, it has been my honor to work with Dr. \nFoley and witness the great accomplishments he has achieved at the \nUniversity of Mobile. His hard work and genuine passion for higher \neducation is apparent and the students of the University of Mobile will \nmiss his leadership. I would like to take this opportunity to thank him \nfor all he has done for the university, for Mobile, and for Alabama.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1386-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1386-S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING SHILOH FOREST SUNDSTROM\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncontribution of a young Oregonian whose life was cut far too short, but \nwhose impact will stay with my State forever.\n  Shiloh Forest Sundstrom, a young leader in the field of conservation-\nbased rural development, was tragically killed by a hit-and-run driver \nin November at age 34.\n  Shiloh was a child of Oregon. He was born in the coastal mountains of \nwestern Lane County and lived much of his life enjoying all that rural \nupbringing had to offer. He loved the horses and cows on his parents' \nranch and attended school in the small town of Mapleton.\n  A gifted student, Shiloh was his high school class valedictorian in \n2000 and was accepted to Brandeis University. As an undergraduate, he \nspent a semester abroad at the School for Field Studies in Kenya, where \nhe saw that the struggles of rural communities in Kenya paralleled the \nproblems facing rural Oregon communities.\n  Studying the ways in which the Maasai people of Kenya struggled to \nbalance their efforts to maintain a traditional resource-based economy \nwhile benefiting from wildlife conservation and tourism, Shiloh saw \nthat the positive lessons being learned there could be applied back \nhome in Oregon.\n  After graduating with honors from Brandeis, Shiloh came back to his \nbeloved Oregon for his master's degree in forestry at Oregon State \nUniversity. He then moved to the geography department to work toward a \ndoctorate and returned to Kenya several times to pursue his research.\n  However, Shiloh was much more than a gifted student. He had the rare \nability to take his research out of the classroom and work to implement \npositive change in the broader world. His work with the Siuslaw \nInstitute, founded by his father John Sundstrom, and with the Siuslaw \nWatershed Council, injected a reasonable approach to often contentious \nnatural resource issues, always with a focus on positive outcomes.\n  Shiloh always strived for success through collaboration--what I like \nto call the Oregon way. He was involved\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\nin the Rural Voices for Conservation Coalition, RVCC, a network that \nseeks common ground between diverse interests on conservation-based \nchallenges facing rural areas in the West.\n  Shiloh's deep ties to rural Oregon, his stellar scholarship, and his \nworldwide experience gave him a uniquely powerful voice in \ndemonstrating that conservation and economic development can go hand in \nhand.\n  The powerful outpouring of sadness at his death shows how deeply \nShiloh impacted his community. The lessons that he taught and his \nleadership will not be forgotten. Shiloh's thoughtful, collaborative \napproach, his love of the land, and his dreams of a better world will \nlive on in everyone he touched in the short time we were blessed to \nknow him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1387-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-4664.

Res. 394\n\n       Whereas the people of ancient Greece developed the concept \n     of democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested \n     in the people;\n       Whereas the founding fathers of the United States, many of \n     whom read Greek political philosophy in the original Greek \n     language, drew heavily on the political experience and \n     philosophy of ancient Greece in forming the representative \n     democracy of the United States;\n       Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former Commander in Chief \n     of Greece and a founder of the modern Greek state, said to \n     the citizens of the United States in 1821, ``It is in your \n     land that liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating \n     you, we shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of \n     them if we succeed in resembling you.'';\n       Whereas the Greek national anthem, the ``Hymn to Liberty'', \n     includes the words, ``most heartily was gladdened George \n     Washington's brave land'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States generously offered \n     humanitarian assistance to the people of Greece during their \n     struggle for independence;\n       Whereas Greece heroically resisted Axis forces at a crucial \n     moment in World War II, forcing Adolf Hitler to change his \n     timeline and delaying the attack on Russia;\n       Whereas Winston Churchill said, ``if there had not been the \n     virtue and courage of the Greeks, we do not know which the \n     outcome of World War II would have been'' and ``no longer \n     will we say that Greeks fight like heroes, but that heroes \n     fight like Greeks'';\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of the people of Greece were \n     killed during World War II;\n       Whereas Greece consistently allied with the United States \n     in major international conflicts throughout the 20th century;\n       Whereas Greece is a strategic partner and ally of the \n     United States in bringing political stability and economic \n     development to the volatile Balkan region, having invested \n     billions of dollars in the countries of the region and having \n     contributed more than $750,000,000 in development aid for the \n     region;\n       Whereas the Government and people of Greece actively \n     participate in peacekeeping and peace-building operations \n     conducted by international organizations, including the \n     United Nations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the \n     European Union, and the Organization for Security and Co-\n     operation in Europe;\n       Whereas Greece received worldwide praise for its \n     extraordinary handling during the 2004 Olympic Games of more \n     than 14,000 athletes and more than 2,000,000 spectators and \n     journalists, a feat the government and people of Greece \n     handled efficiently, securely, and with hospitality;\n       Whereas Greece, located in a region where Christianity \n     meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent relations with \n     Muslim countries and Israel;\n       Whereas European Council President Donald Tusk stated \n     during a press conference in Athens on February 16, 2016, \n     ``The migratory crisis we are currently witnessing is testing \n     our Union to its limits. And Greece is among the most \n     affected countries. It is no coincidence that the Greek \n     citizens on the islands have been nominated to the Nobel \n     Peace Prize for their generosity in helping people in \n     need.'';\n       Whereas the Government of Greece has taken important steps \n     in recent years to further cross-cultural understanding, \n     rapprochement, and cooperation in various fields with Turkey, \n     and has also improved its relations with other countries in \n     the region, including Israel, thus enhancing the stability of \n     the wider region;\n       Whereas the governments and people of Greece and the United \n     States are at the forefront of efforts to advance freedom, \n     democracy, peace, stability, and human rights;\n       Whereas those efforts and similar ideals have forged a \n     close bond between the people of Greece and the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable for the United States to \n     celebrate March 25, 2016, Greek Independence Day, with the \n     people of Greece and to reaffirm the democratic principles \n     from which those two great countries were founded: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends warm congratulations and best wishes to the \n     people of Greece as they celebrate the 195th anniversary of \n     the independence of Greece;\n       (2) expresses support for the principles of democratic \n     governance to which the people of Greece are committed; and\n       (3) notes the important role that Greece has played in the \n     wider European region and in the community of nations since \n     gaining its independence 195 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1389-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 395--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF MARCH 2016, AS \n             ``NATIONAL COLORECTAL CANCER AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Menendez, and Ms. Ayotte) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 395\n\n       Whereas colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of \n     cancer death among men and women combined in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, in 2016, more than 134,000 individuals in the \n     United States will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and \n     approximately 49,000 more will die from it;\n       Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the most preventable \n     forms of cancer because screening tests can find polyps that \n     can be removed before becoming cancerous;\n       Whereas screening tests can detect colorectal cancer early, \n     which is when treatment works best;\n       Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     estimates that if every individual aged 50 or older had \n     regular screening tests, as many as 60 percent of deaths from \n     colorectal cancer could be prevented;\n       Whereas the 5-year survival rate for patients with \n     localized colorectal cancer is 90 percent, but only 39 \n     percent of all diagnoses occur at that stage;\n       Whereas colorectal cancer screenings can effectively reduce \n     the incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality, but 1 in 3 \n     adults between the ages of 50 and 75 are not up to date with \n     recommended colorectal cancer screening;\n       Whereas public awareness and education campaigns on \n     colorectal cancer prevention, screening, and symptoms are \n     held during the month of March each year; and\n       Whereas educational efforts can help provide to the public \n     information on methods of prevention and screening, as well \n     as symptoms for early detection: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of March 2016, as ``National \n     Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month'' and the goals and ideals \n     of that Month; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month with appropriate \n     awareness and educational activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1389-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3449.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Justice and \n     Mental Health Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 902. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals with serious mental \n     illnesses are booked into jails each year, resulting in \n     prevalence rates of serious mental illness in jails that are \n     3 to 6 times higher than in the general population. An even \n     greater number of individuals who are detained in jails each \n     year have mental health problems that do not rise to the \n     level of a serious mental illness but may still require a \n     resource-intensive response.\n\n[[Page S1390]]\n\n       (2) Adults with mental illnesses cycle through jails more \n     often than individuals without mental illnesses, and tend to \n     stay longer (including before trial, during trial, and after \n     sentencing).\n       (3) According to estimates, almost \\3/4\\ of jail detainees \n     with serious mental illnesses have co-occurring substance use \n     disorders, and individuals with mental illnesses are also \n     much more likely to have serious physical health needs.\n       (4) Among individuals under probation supervision, \n     individuals with mental disorders are nearly twice as likely \n     as other individuals to have their community sentence \n     revoked, furthering their involvement in the criminal justice \n     system. Reasons for revocation may be directly or indirectly \n     related to an individual's mental disorder.\n\n     SEC. 903.

Mr. President, I am rising now to respond to a statement \nthat was made by our good friend from Illinois a few minutes ago, to \nclarify. It is kind of interesting that we look back and we find that \nwhen the Republicans had someone in the White House and the Democrats \nwere trying to block a nomination, it was just the opposite as it is \ntoday. In fact, at that time, the Senators in the leadership of the \nDemocrats--Obama, Biden, Clinton, Schumer, and Reid--all made the \nstatement, a joint statement that the Senate does not have to confirm \nPresidential nominations and urged that the Senate refuse to do so, \nespecially in an election year.\n  Now, it is just the opposite of what the Senator said, but I don't \nblame them. I don't blame any Democrat for trying their best to get a \nnominee from this President because, as a Democrat, they are more \nliberal than Republicans are, and they would like very much to have a \nchance to change the balance of the U.S. Supreme Court, which has been \nconsistent in recent years in objecting to some of the extremist left \nprograms. So I can't blame them for trying, but nonetheless that is not \ngoing to work.\n  I applaud the leader. At the time the death--the sad death--of Scalia \ntook place, he was in a position where we were in recess and so he had \nto make a decision and the decision was the right decision.\n  Anyway, I wish to share a couple of letters with you that came from \nmy State of Oklahoma.\n  I will give the names and addresses, if anyone wants to check. This \nis what real people--you get outside the beltway, get out of \nWashington, DC, and get back to States such as Oklahoma, these are the \nconcerns they have.\n  I want to read the first one. This is from a guy named Robert from \nTulsa, OK. It came right after the sad death of Justice Scalia. He \nsaid:\n\n       Dear Senator Inhofe,\n       I have just learned of the death of Justice Scalia. I \n     should only be feeling sadness at the death of this great \n     patriot and man of the law. I am terrified of what I am sure \n     is now already in the works, his replacement by President \n     Barack Obama.\n       The person who replaces Justice Scalia will have the \n     potential to change the balance of power on the bench for \n     decades and may have the possibility to reshape the political \n     landscape immediately and unalterably.\n       I, therefore, beg you and all of your fellow Senators to \n     not vote to affirm any candidate put forward by President \n     Obama. This is an election year and the people should be \n     given a chance to choose which direction this country will go \n     and not have it decided by President Obama as he leaves the \n     White House.\n       Please, do not vote for any candidate offered by this \n     administration.\n\n  Another letter just came from Chickasha, OK, from Donald. He says:\n\n       Dear Senator Inhofe,\n       I have just received word of the death of Supreme Court \n     Justice Scalia. His death is a loss for the conservative \n     movement, but I fear it also puts our country in peril.\n       With Scalia gone, President Obama will certainly present a \n     nominee for his seat. If it is a justice that holds to \n     Obama's progressive ideals and agenda, it could mean grave \n     danger for our Constitution.\n       I urge you to hold fast and refuse to confirm ANY Obama \n     appointee to the Court. Hold out until he is out of office. I \n     feel the future of our nation depends on it.\n\n  That is from Donald of Chickasha, OK.\n  Next is a letter from Matthew of Claremore, OK. Claremore is one of \nthe towns where our famous Will Rogers spent his childhood. Everyone \nhas heard of Will Rogers--a great guy. Matthew said:\n\n       Senator Inhofe,\n       I am contacting you in regards to the loss of Justice \n     Scalia and his replacement. Justice Scalia was a brilliant \n     man and a true patriot. Unfortunately, I do not feel any \n     appointee by the President would follow the Constitution and \n     serve with the same virtue as Justice Scalia. I am asking \n     that you and the other members of the Senate do not confirm a \n     new Justice until after the election, when the newly elected \n     President can make the appointment. We have sent you to \n     Washington to stop the agenda of the President that runs \n     contrary to the wishes of the country. Please stand on your \n     principles and do not allow the President to appoint another \n     Justice that may be detrimental to our freedoms for decades \n     to come. Thank you.\n\n  That is Matthew from Claremore, OK. Let me assure you, of the \nhundreds of letters we have received, I have read them. I have no \nintention of changing the pattern that has been in existence since 1888 \nand allow a President, during an election year, to make such a \nnomination.\n  So I think we did the right thing. I think it would have been \ninappropriate to say we are going to have hearings, knowing that we \nwere not going to confirm a nominee. I don't think that would be fair \nto the nominee.\n  So these are just a few examples of the hundreds of letters and calls \nfrom constituents that I have received, asking that the Senate wait to \nconfirm the next Supreme Court nominee until we have a new President.\n  We have heard from our colleagues and pundits on the other side--the \nDemocrats, the other side of the aisle--that it is our constitutional \nduty to confirm President Obama's nominations.\n  The Constitution says, and it says very clearly, that the President \n``. . . shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.''\n  The Senate clearly has a role in this process, and the Senate can \neither give its consent or it can withhold its consent and completely \nfulfill its constitutional duties. So it doesn't make any difference. \nWe have the latitude of making a determination, and we are\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\ngoing to do it. It wasn't long ago when the Democrats were singing a \ndifferent tune when the Republican was in the White House, and that \nwould have been President Bush at that time. Some of the Democrats on \nthe floor said that the Senate does not have to confirm Presidential \nnominations and urged that the Senate refuse to do so, especially in an \nelection year.\n  The Democrats were saying that, so it is just the opposite of what \nthey are saying today. In fact, the leadership who was saying that at \nthe time was none other than Senators Obama, he was a Senator at that \ntime; Biden, he was a Senator at that time; Clinton, she was a Senator \nat that time; and Senators Schumer and Reid. They all made the same \nstatement. They said the Senate does not have to confirm Presidential \nnominations and urged that the Senate refuse to do so, especially in an \nelection year.\n  Now, that is where there is a difference of opinion because actually \nthe last time it was done in an election year was 1888. You have to go \nall the way back to 1888--128 years before you find a similar situation \nto the one we are in today. That is the last time a vacancy arose \nduring an election year and was filled by the Senate from a party on \nthe opposite side of the President. That is the last time that \nhappened, 1888, and we are not about to change that now.\n  Furthermore, even if this were not true, this President hasn't worked \nwith Congress on much of anything. So why should we work with him on \nthis?\n  That is not the point. The point is, we don't have to do that, and \nwhen the Democrats were in control of the Senate and the Republicans \nhad the White House, they made it very clear the leadership said the \nSenate does not have to confirm a Presidential nomination, and they \nurged us not to do it. And so the tables are turned now.\n\n  Now why is this important? We have seen time and again when President \nObama is not able to get his liberal agenda through Congress, he has \nturned to Executive action and to agency rulemaking to implement \npriorities. These regulations are actually making their way through our \ncourts and are either going to be heard by the Supreme Court or have \nalready been heard by the Supreme Court.\n  President Obama's Executive amnesty was stayed by the lower courts, \nand the Supreme Court will decide this term if that injunction will \nstand or not.\n  What we are saying is this: The President has a very liberal agenda \non almost every social issue, every fiscal issue, every military issue. \nIt is a very liberal agenda. So when the President can't get things \ndone through legislation, he then turns around and tries to do it \nthrough regulation.\n  I will give an example. If you talk to the American Farm Bureau right \nnow, they will tell you the greatest problem farmers and ranchers \nhave--I know this because I am from the farm State of Oklahoma--is not \nanything in the Agriculture bill. It is the overregulation of the EPA. \nOf all the regulations that are damaging to farmers and ranchers in \nAmerica, the one they single out as being the worst is the WOTUS rule; \nthat is, the waters of the United States.\n  Historically, it has always been in the jurisdiction of the States as \nto how to control and manage the waters of the United States, except in \ncases where it is navigable waters. Well, we understand that. We \nunderstand that is where the Federal Government should be involved. But \n6 years ago there was a lot of legislation and one bill in particular \nthat was offered in the House and the Senate that would take the word \n``navigable'' out. That being the case, that would mean all the waters \nin a jurisdiction would go from the States to the Federal Government, \nand we weren't going to let that happen. But this is what is going on \nright now. Things they have tried to get passed through legislation and \nhaven't been able to do, they are trying to do through regulation.\n  If the Supreme Court is split 4 to 4 in these two cases I just \nmentioned, the injunctions of the lower courts will stand until the \nunderlying issues are fully litigated. That is what they are waiting \nfor right now. The Court has said that until the litigation is cleared \nup, we are not going to act on this rule. Well, as you know, that is \ngoing to take a long time for that to happen.\n  The Clean Power Plan is the other one. You might remember--to give a \nlittle background--that going back to the year 2000, which is when all \nthis global warming started and the end of the world was coming, they \nwere introducing legislation at that time to have cap and trade and \nregulate the emissions of CO2 throughout America.\n  When people realized how much that would cost and the fact that the \nscience was not yet settled, it was defeated. Every time they brought \nit to the Senate, it was defeated. I am talking about through \nlegislation trying to do a cap and trade in America.\n  One of the interesting things was that the first Director of the EPA \nthat was appointed by this President was Lisa Jackson. I asked her a \nquestion in a hearing that was on the record and live on TV. I said: If \nwe were to pass either this legislation or cap and trade or do it by \nregulation in the United States, would that have the effect of lowering \nthe emissions of CO2 worldwide? She said: No, because this \nisn't where the problem is. The problem is in China. The problem is in \nIndia. The problem is in Mexico.\n  So we went through that whole thing, and the President, when he came \ninto office, decided: Well, they are never going to pass this by the \nelected representatives of the people, so we will do it by regulation. \nSo he came out with the Clean Power Plan.\n  The Clean Power Plan is what President Obama came up with, and it \nessentially does the same thing as legislation would do when it would \nperform cap and trade for the States. We remember the trip to Paris. \nWhen he got to Paris, he was unable to get anyone to do anything.\n  The deal they came up with was kind of humorous because China said: \nNo, we are going to continue our emissions until 2025; at that time, we \nwill start lowering our emissions. They were not going to do it, and \nthey are not going to do it. But nonetheless, that was the Clean Power \nPlan that came up, and it was essentially the same thing that was \nkilled by legislation.\n  The Clean Power Plan would cost about $292 billion, and it mandates \ncarbon dioxide cuts from the power sector to meet the President's \nstandards. President Obama said in Paris that we are going to lower our \nCO2 emissions between 26 and 28 percent by 2025. Now, he \nnever said how we would do that--never. He never did say how we were \ngoing to comply with that. But nonetheless, he was going to try to do \nthat and, obviously, that was something that would not have worked.\n  These and other Executive actions and regulations will have a big \nimpact on our people and our economy and will all likely be decided by \nthe Supreme Court. That is where I get back to the Supreme Court. The \nClean Power Plan would then be decided. Right now on the Clean Power \nPlan there is a stay in the U.S. Supreme Court on the Clean Power Plan \nuntil all of the litigation that is pending right now can be settled. \nThat could be a long time--certainly way past this particular \nPresidency.\n  It is not just the Executive actions he has taken but the moral \ndirection of our country too. Just last week, the Supreme Court heard a \ncase challenging the State of Texas on its new abortion regulations \nthat require that clinics meet the standard of other outpatient \nsurgical clinics and mandate that abortion doctors have admitting \nprivileges at nearby hospitals. That is the Supreme Court. That is the \ntype of thing you would see if the liberals would have their way and if \nthe Supreme Court would change its direction.\n  Many of these decisions are 5-to-4 decisions, and that is why I say \nthis is an important decision. It is the American people who will bear \nthe burden of these decisions and, therefore, they should have a say in \nwho would fill Justice Scalia's vacancy. So this decision should be \nmade by the next President. Let a new President decide who should \nreplace Justice Scalia. That is exactly what is going to happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1395]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1395-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1395-S1396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICAN LEADERSHIP\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I know today we have been focusing on a \nreally important bill, the CARA bill, which has been led by Senator \nPortman, Senator Ayotte, and many others. It is a very important bill \nfor our country, for States like Alaska that are seeing this explosion \nof opioid use, heroin use, and drug addiction that is impacting so many \nfamilies. I had the opportunity to talk about this, when I was home in \nAlaska last week down in Juneau, in front of our State legislature.\n  This legislation is showing bipartisan work, which is very important \nto the country and very important to States like Alaska. I am certainly \nproud to be a cosponsor of that bill. We are going to continue to try \nto get that over the goal line.\n  I think it is important to focus on issues not only domestically, of \ncourse, but issues beyond our borders as well. What I want to talk \nabout in terms of these kinds of issues this afternoon is the issue of \nAmerican leadership in the world today.\n  A lot of us in the Senate have experience in foreign policy and \nnational security issues. There have been Members who have served in \nthe State Department, decades in the military--the Presiding Officer \nhas a lot of experience in international business--and so we have a \nfair amount of experience here. Certainly, it is part of our \nresponsibilities under the Constitution, as Senators, to be very \nfocused on these issues--these important issues of national security, \nof foreign policy. Attending hearings, codels, and meetings with \nforeign leaders are all part of our responsibilities.\n  One thing is very clear. Foreign policy and national security issues \nare almost always messy, complicated, never really have easy solutions, \nand are often very opaque in terms of what is happening in the world \nand how it impacts the United States. We recognize that. That is \nusually the case. But sometimes in the world of foreign policy, \nsometimes in the world of national security, there are moments of \nclarity when big issues come into focus. It doesn't happen often. It is \nrare. But when it happens, you know it. When it happens, you sense it.\n  I was recently part of a bipartisan congressional delegation led by \none of the foremost experts on foreign policy and national security in \nthe Senate, Senator John McCain. We all went to the Munich Security \nConference in Munich, Germany. For over 50 years, this has been where \nleaders have come together--Americans, certainly, Prime Ministers, \nForeign Ministers, Defense Ministers, international affairs experts--to \ndiscuss national security and foreign policy issues, usually as it \nrelates to the Atlantic partnership--NATO, the EU.\n  My experience there led to one of these clarifying moments, and I \nthink I am speaking for many of the people who were at Munich about 3 \nweeks ago. Here is the clarifying moment: The United States is \nwithdrawing from its traditional leadership role in the world. Our \nallies know it, they feel it, and they are desperately worried about \nit.\n  In meeting after meeting, in speech after speech, if you were in \nMunich a month ago, listening, paying attention, discussing the state \nof the world's security with our allies, you heard it. You heard it. \nSometimes it was subtle, sometimes it was direct, and, occasionally, it \nwas even pleading--pleading from our allies, pleading for American \nleadership in the world again. We saw that.\n  One of the meetings we had was with an important leader of an \nimportant country in Europe. The Presiding Officer and I were there. At \nthe end of the meeting, this leader was asked: What can the United \nStates do to help your country in terms of security--aid, military \ncooperation? What can we do? This leader looked at a group of several \nSenators, bipartisan, and said: The United States has to lead in the \nworld again. You are not leading, and the world is becoming a much more \ndangerous place because of the lack of American leadership. Whoever the \nnext leader of your great country is, please tell that person that the \nUnited States has to lead again.\n  Think about that. That was the message. That was the message from \nMunich. Our friends are worried. They have certainly lost confidence in \nus, and our adversaries are taking advantage of the vacuum that we have \nleft all around the world. That was the message of Munich, and anyone \nwho went there heard it.\n  Now, I know some of my colleagues might be thinking: Well, this is a \nRepublican Senator on the floor of the Senate, criticizing the Obama \nadministration. That is probably a partisan criticism. But there were \nmany people at Munich. There were Republicans and Democrats at Munich. \nJust a perusal of newspaper articles from those who went--and some who \nweren't there--shows that all are writing about the same issue--that \none of the principal foreign policy issues facing the world, facing the \nUnited States right now, is what the lack of U.S. leadership globally \nis doing to the national security of our country and to that of our \nallies.\n  Let me just provide a few examples. Senator Joe Lieberman, who graced \nthis body with his knowledge and expertise and wisdom for many, many \nyears--a Democrat--was in Munich. Not too long after coming back, he \nwrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       The world has never seemed as dangerous and leaderless as \n     it does now. Only the extremists and bullies act badly, and \n     therefore have seized the initiative.\n       It's a moment in history that invokes the haunting words of \n     W.B. Yeats: ``The best lack all conviction, while the worst \n     are full of passionate intensity.''\n\n  That was Senator Lieberman, who was with us in Munich just a couple \nof weeks ago.\n  Former Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns, who has worked for \nDemocrats and Republicans, was also there. I served under Secretary of \nState Condoleezza Rice with Under Secretary Burns--a great career \nforeign service officer. He also stated: ``We are being humiliated. \nWe've lost our strategic foothold''--he is talking about the Middle \nEast--``and we've abdicated our leadership.'' That is not a Republican \npartisan saying that.\n  GEN John Abizaid--in my view one of the premier military leaders our \ncountry has seen in a generation, whom I had the honor of serving with \nas a marine major--recently stated: ``Without American leadership, \nwe're not going to move in a direction that's going to produce \neffective results.''\n  There was another recent article in the Washington Post by another \nobserver, an expert on foreign policy issues, Fred Hiatt, who wrote \nabout what he saw at Munich. What he stated was that the endless \nnegotiation by our Secretary of State ``that perpetually, and falsely, \nholds out the prospect of imminent progress'' on so many different \nissues ends up ``providing cover'' and ``is an excuse for inaction,'' \nan ``anesthetic,'' he said, where the Congress and the American people \ndon't even have to feel about focusing on these issues, what is going \non in the Middle East or the South China Sea or North Korea or the \nKorean Peninsula because we have endless diplomacy that covers it.\n  Finally, another participant in Munich, former Senator Bill Cohen, \nwho worked as the Secretary of Defense for President Clinton, stated: \n``We no longer seem to know what our role should be in the new \ncentury.''\n  He was interviewed on the radio a couple of weeks ago right after \nMunich:\n\n       Are we going to lead from behind? The truth is that \n     President Putin has been bombing and the United States has \n     been dithering.\n\n  That is former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, former U.S. Senator \nBill Cohen.\n  It is very clear, whether you are Democratic or Republican, that \nanyone who spent time at the Munich security conference a few weeks ago \ncame away with a similar conclusion: Our allies are extremely worried \nabout what is clearly happening--the withdrawal of U.S. leadership from \nthe world. They are seeing it, and we are seeing it in almost every \nregion of the world. It is leaving a vacuum. Other countries that don't \nshare our interests and don't share our values are filling that vacuum. \nWe know the list. We have been debating it on this floor. Russia, \ncertainly. Whether it is in the Middle East, Syria, Ukraine, the \nArctic, Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism--our \ndiplomats and Secretary of\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nState seem to spend more time with their diplomats and their Foreign \nMinister than almost any other country in the world--China and the \nSouth China Sea.\n  In the face of these challenges, we are also starting to see \nsomething that is truly alarming. The postwar structure, the national \nsecurity structure of the world that the United States was instrumental \nin building, is beginning to crumble in different parts of the world.\n  So what should we do? What can we do? I think there is a lot we can \ndo. We can certainly bolster the American-led order that was \nestablished after World War II. It certainly does not have to crumble. \nThis is what our colleague Senator McCain laid out in his outstanding \nspeech in Munich. He talked about how this is one of our most important \ninheritances, this world order, this American-led order, and how we \nneed to focus on it--not with speeches but with action.\n  What else can we do? We can look at the changing landscape of the \nworld and see if we need to devise new political structures that \naddress new challenges in places such as the Middle East, where borders \nseem to be being erased on a daily basis by terrorist groups like ISIS. \nThis is something General Abizaid has written about recently.\n  Both of these alternatives require American leadership. They are not \ngoing to happen without the United States in the lead. If you went to \nMunich, you realize their allies want us to lead.\n  What can we do in the Senate? Well, we can certainly press for a more \nassertive and leading role for the United States of America from this \nbody. The Constitution gives the U.S. Senate significant power in \nnational security matters and foreign affairs, and we should be using \nthat. We are using that.\n  Under the new leadership of the Senate, we have been moving forward \nin many areas of foreign policy and national security. There are the \nNorth Korea sanctions that were passed by this body 2 weeks ago, and \nnow the world is following our lead on that. Senators Gardner and \nCorker did an outstanding job in that regard. There is the bipartisan \napproach to Ukraine that we see on the Armed Services Committee. Every \nMember of that body, Democratic and Republican, thinks we should be \ndoing more to help the Ukrainians defend themselves against Russian \naggression. Afghanistan, the same thing--bolstering the need for troops \nthere to guard America's security. The President has seemingly wanted \nto take all our troops out of there, as he wanted to do in Iraq, but \nagain a bipartisan group of Senators have been questioning that \nstrategy on a daily basis. In the South China Sea, we have been \nencouraging the administration to do what we have been doing for 70 \nyears--conducting freedom of navigation operations to keep the sea-\nlanes of the world open. These are all things the Senate has been \ndoing--in essence, trying to give this administration backbone, to \nassert the leadership we know is so important to our security and the \nsecurity of the world.\n  But there is another thing, another option that might be out there. \nWe can ignore the problem of what is happening in the world.\n  I hate to say this, but if you saw Secretary of State Kerry's speech \nin Munich, certainly compared to Senator McCain's keynote address, what \nthe Secretary of State seemed to be doing was that fourth option. He \nseemed to be saying: Hey, things aren't going that badly. Things in \nSyria aren't that bad.\n  He cautioned against pessimism and said that we have good reasons to \nbe optimistic about what is happening. He talked about how fewer people \nare dying in conflict today than ever before. You literally heard a \ngasp in the audience in Munich when that was stated. That is not true.\n  What this does when you have the Secretary of State making these \nkinds of statements at important security conferences with all our \nallies, it further undermines the credibility of the United States in \nterms of foreign policy and national security.\n  We need to lead again. Our allies want us to. Most importantly, I \nbelieve the American people want us to.\n  Why? Why shouldn't we just withdraw from the world and let everything \ncatch on fire? Bring the troops home and have the two oceans protect \nus--the Atlantic and Pacific.\n  We need to lead, and I believe the American people want the United \nStates to lead because they know that when the United States leads in \nthe world, it is a safer place abroad and it is a safer place at home. \nThey know what Senator Lieberman said recently in his op-ed after \nMunich: ``The absence of American leadership has certainly not caused \nall the instability, but it has encouraged and exacerbated it.'' The \nAmerican people also know that when there is a lack of U.S. leadership \nin the world, it not only turns to undermining our national security \ninterests, but it turns to humiliation for our own citizens. Just think \nof the photos that we saw recently of U.S. sailors on their knees at \nIranian gunpoint with their hands raised in surrender and what that \ndoes in terms of how Americans are thinking about our role in the \nworld, the security of the world, and what is happening with regard to \nU.S. leadership. We have to change these policies of leading from \nbehind.\n  I will conclude by mentioning in terms of this lack of U.S. \nleadership what I fear the most. I started by saying that we were at a \nconference where our allies directly, indirectly were asking for \nAmerican leadership once again. But what I fear the most is the day \nthat a group of bipartisan Senators goes to another conference like \nMunich or the Shangri-la Dialogue and we don't hear from our allies, we \ndon't hear them asking for us to lead once again, because such silence \nwill truly be dangerous indeed because that is when we will know that \nour traditional allies have given up on the United States; that is when \nwe will know that our traditional allies have lost faith in America and \nhave begun the process of making accommodations with our adversaries. \nWe in the Senate must do all in our power to make sure that situation \nwhere we lose our allies, where they don't ask for our leadership, does \nnot happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/09/senate-section/article/S1396-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
