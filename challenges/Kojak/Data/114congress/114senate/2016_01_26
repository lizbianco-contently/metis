Madam President, before I complete the following \ncloseout here, I want to make a comment this morning. What we have just \ndone is move consideration of the energy bill--the Energy Policy \nModernization Act--from today to tomorrow. It is a little bit unusual, \nbut given what we have seen here, not only in Washington, DC, but all \naround the East\n\n[[Page S168]]\n\nCoast with the weather, the blizzard of 2016, it is understandable that \nwe would allow for a period of time for our colleagues to return to the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I think it is more than an understatement to say that it has been \nchallenging to travel, challenging to move. I think it is worth noting, \nhowever, that the Acting President pro tempore, the Senator from Maine, \nand myself, the Senator from Alaska--both kind of the bookends of the \ncountry, arctic States, if you will; certainly Alaska is, and Maine is \nright up there--are here braving the elements.\n  I might also note for a little historical perspective that as we \nconvene this morning, and you look around the Chamber, the Acting \nPresident pro tempore is female, our Parliamentarian and all of our \nclerks are female, our floor managers are female, and all of our pages \nare female. This was not orchestrated in any way, shape or form. We \ncame in this morning, looked around and thought: something is different \nthis morning--different in a good way, I might add. But something is \ngenuinely different, and I think it is genuinely fabulous. Perhaps it \nspeaks to the hardiness of women who put on their boots and put on \ntheir hat and get out and slog through the mess that is out there.\n  I don't know about you all, but I spent a good portion of my weekend \nshoveling. I feel stronger today, but I am ready to be back at work \nwhere it is a little less rigorous. It has been an interesting weekend \nwith, again, the extent of the blizzard. I have been asked numerous \ntimes: Well, this must just be a normal day for you in Alaska. We \nhaven't had the snow that we would like back home. In fact, we got as \nmuch snowfall here in the D.C. metropolitan area as Anchorage, my \nhometown, has had accumulated over the course of this season.\n  We have been feeling a little left out of the weather events. I was \nlooking at Facebook over the weekend. There is one post out there that \nI thought was pretty Alaskan. It said: ``Not to be outdone in winter, \n#Alaska sees East Coast blizzard and raises it with major \n#earthquake.''\n  We had a little bit of excitement back home with a 7.1 earthquake. \nBut the good news for us throughout the State is that while it \ncertainly got everyone's attention at 1 o'clock in the morning, it did \nnot cause significant damage. We are thankful for that.\n  We are also thankful that as we are digging out of the snowstorms \nhere and throughout the East, people are making it through. But our \nthoughts and our prayers are for those who have suffered as a \nconsequence of this weather-related tragedy in many, many cases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/26/senate-section/article/S168-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S168-S169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID GRANNIS\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute \nand offer my heartfelt thanks to one of my most trusted advisers, David \nGrannis. David has served me on the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence for over a decade, beginning as my designee in March of \n2005, then as my staff director from January of 2009 when I took over \nas chairman of the Committee. Over this decade, I have grown to trust \nhis expertise and advice on all aspects of our oversight of the \nIntelligence Community and to rely on David's keen abilities to manage \nthe committee in a fair and bipartisan manner, while shepherding \nthrough some of the Nation's most important and sometimes controversial \nlegislation.\n  Prior to joining the Intelligence Committee in 2005, David worked on \nthe House Select Committee on Homeland Security and was the senior \npolicy adviser to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national \nsecurity. Before coming to Congress, David worked for 2 years at the \nNational Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology \non projects studying the ability to make explosives more detectable and \nidentifiable. He has a master's of public policy from the Kennedy \nSchool of Government at Harvard University, where he worked for now-\nSecretary of Defense Ash Carter, who I understand recommended him to \nRepresentative Harman. David is a proven expert on both process and \nsubstance, which I am certain he developed by applying his \ncharacteristic analytic approach to everything, a skill he developed \nwhile a student in chemistry at Cornell University.\n  David's accomplishments on the Intelligence Committee are extensive, \nso I will mention only a few of the highlights today. As staff \ndirector, David played a central role in assisting and guiding me and \nthe committee through all stages of the committee's study of the CIA's \ndetention and interrogation program, where a deft hand was required to \nnegotiate numerous aspects of the review with the CIA and the \nadministration. He played a significant role in prodding the \nadministration to provide information and access to critically \nimportant material. He worked with the committee study team to \ndeclassify and secure release of a 500-page executive summary of the \nfull 6,700-page report, a process that required months of \nexcruciatingly detailed negotiations. The report is believed to be the \nlargest review in congressional history. After the release of the \ndeclassified summary, David helped me and Senator McCain draft and pass \nlegislation that will help ensure these types of harsh interrogation \ntechniques will never be used again by the CIA or any other agency or \nrepresentative of the U.S. Government.\n  David also managed the bipartisan committee staff as it helped pass \nseven straight intelligence authorization bills from 2009 to the most \nrecent one, which was signed by the President last month under the \nleadership of Chairman Burr. This effort, which helps ensure proper \noversight of the intelligence community, was a significant achievement \nas no legislative guidance had been provided to the intelligence \ncommunity during the previous 5 years prior to 2009. I thank David for \nleading the staff development of these bills and helping to \nsuccessfully push them through Senate passage to bring them to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Another recent significant accomplishment in which David's steady \nhand and expert advice helped achieve success is his work on the \nCybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. This act, which was \nsigned by the President last month, will help this Nation defend itself \nfrom cyber attacks by encouraging increased information sharing on \ncyber intrusions between private industry and the government.\n  As staff director, David also oversaw the completion of two important \ncommittee reviews. The first one was a committee report on the 2009 \nChristmas Day attempted bombing of flight 253 over Detroit, and the \nsecond one was a bipartisan report on the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Each \nunflinchingly laid out the facts and helped determine what changes \nshould be made as an appropriate response. David also worked to improve \noversight of counterterrorism operations that helped assure the \nAmerican public that Congress knew the details of what was being done \nby the executive branch, as well as provided recommendations for \nimprovements.\n  In 2007, David worked on the committee's investigation into prewar \nintelligence regarding Iraq. David served as the co-lead for the \ncommittee's sixth and final report on this topic, which dealt with the \nsubject of prewar statements by senior policymakers. This was an \nimportant and sensitive subject, and David and his staff colleagues \nhandled it with objectivity and professionalism. The report, approved \nby a bipartisan majority of the committee in June 2008, helped resolve \na number of important questions regarding the run-up to the Iraq War. \nThe great work that David and his colleagues did on this project \nensured that the public finally received the facts and helped conclude \nwhat had at times been a contentious chapter in the committee's \nhistory.\n  I also want to echo many of the comments that our committee staff has \nmade about David including one that was passed onto me where a \ncolleague said that he ``has been the rock upon which the staff's \nfoundation is built.'' He has been a solid and stable leader that has \nprovided the confidence that the staff needs to flourish. David's \nintellect and knowledge of the intelligence community and his \ncommunication skills in conveying that knowledge to committee members \nhas gained him the respect and admiration of the entire committee. \nFinally, his demeanor and behavior in dealing with people, both inside \nand outside the committee, on both sides of the aisle and in both \nbodies of Congress, as well\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\nas with leaders of the intelligence community and the executive branch, \nis an example to be emulated.\n  As I mentioned earlier, these are just a few of David's traits and \naccomplishments that I have come to rely upon while he served on the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence. And I thank him for them. I \nalso want to thank David's wife, Kerry Searle Grannis, for enduring the \nlong hours and time away from home that is often a part of life in the \nSenate; and to acknowledge their three beautiful children--Owen, \nAmelia, and Nathaniel--who I hope now will have more time with their \nfather, who can help them achieve more Boy Scout badges, excel in drama \nclasses, and perfect that high board dive and soccer goal. Kerry has \nmentioned how wonderful a husband and father David has been, supporting \nher as she completed her Ph.D. and sharing all household chores, \ndriving duties, and doctors' appointments for his busy crew.\n  I know David will thrive as he begins a new set of challenges as the \nPrincipal Deputy Under Secretary at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's Office of Intelligence and Analysis. I wish him the very \nbest and thank him for his many years of service and dedication to this \ncountry and to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/26/senate-section/article/S169-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2464.
