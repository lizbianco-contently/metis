Mr. President, the junior Senator from New Hampshire \ndelivered a powerful address to our Nation this weekend. She spoke \nabout the need to tackle a heroin and prescription opioid epidemic that \nis impacting not just her State, not just my State, but communities all \nacross our country.\n  Senator Ayotte correctly called this a ``life or death issue'' and \ntalked about what she has been doing to address it. She also talked \nabout important legislation the Senate is considering that would help \naddress the problem.\n  I was proud to see the Senate vote yesterday to advance the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. It is bipartisan legislation \nthat colleagues in both parties--like the junior Senator from New \nHampshire, her colleague from Minnesota, and, of course, the lead \nsponsors from Ohio and Rhode Island--have worked hard to advance.\n  I want to especially thank the lead Republican sponsor of this bill, \nthe junior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, for all the work he has done \non this critical legislation. The same is true for the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley, who worked to move this bill quickly through \nthe committee that he chairs.\n  Let's not forget the Senators in both parties who worked with the \nbill managers to process the kind of amendments both sides agree would \nmake a good bill even better. Because of the dedicated leadership of \nSenators from both sides of the aisle, we will soon have the \nopportunity to actually pass this important legislation.\n  I urge colleagues to join me in voting to do so. The Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act is important legislation that will help \ntackle this crisis at every level. It is a good bill, it enjoys strong \nbipartisan support, and it builds upon a foundation we laid just a few \nmonths ago when we appropriated $400 million to opioid-specific \nprograms--money that still remains available to be spent.\n  This bipartisan legislation also comes at a time when our Nation \nneeds it most. My home State of Kentucky has been among the hardest hit \nby this epidemic, with more people dying from drug overdoses than car \ncrashes.\n  As the junior Senator from New Hampshire reminded us in her address \nthis weekend, these are not just numbers. ``Behind every statistic and \nbehind every headline is a life that has been lost,'' Senator Ayotte \nsaid. ``This is not a Republican or Democratic issue--it affects all of \nus.''\n  I want to thank her and the lead Republican sponsor from Ohio for \ntheir important work. I thank their colleagues across the aisle from \nRhode Island and Minnesota and the Judiciary Committee chairman from \nIowa as well. Let's keep working together to pass the bipartisan CARA \nbill and take\n\n[[Page S1324]]\n\nanother step towards ending this devastating epidemic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1324-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the Republican leader's direction, \nthis Senate continues to make history for all the wrong reasons. \nDespite proclaiming that the Senate is back to work, the Republican \nmajority is on pace to become one of the least productive Senates ever.\n  By now, most Americans are aware of the Republican leader's decision \nto block consideration of the Supreme Court nomination that President \nObama will soon make. But the historic obstruction of a Supreme Court \nnominee is the most recent and prolific example of the Republican \nleader's abdication of his constitutional duties and that of the whole \nRepublican caucus. What is that? To provide advice and consent to \nPresidential nominations.\n  Since his party assumed the majority in the Senate last January, the \nRepublican leader and his colleagues have ground the nominations to a \nhalt. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the \npace of judicial nominations being confirmed this Congress is the \nworst. To date, this Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed a total \nof 16 judicial nominations. That is about one a month. Since the \nbeginning of the year, we have confirmed just five judges.\n  We have 11 judges pending on the Senate calendar, and there would be \na lot more, but the chairman of the committee simply is not holding any \nhearings. He canceled the meeting last week. Maybe they will have one \nthe day after tomorrow. They are not even holding hearings for the \npeople in the pipeline whom the President has nominated. The 11 judges \npending on the Senate calendar is not definitive of the real problem we \nhave in this country. But even on the 11, the Republicans refuse to \nschedule votes--even on judges such as Waverly Crenshaw from Tennessee, \nwho is supported by the two Republican Senators from Tennessee.\n  If the Republican leader will not even schedule votes on consensus \njudges recommended by Republican Senators, how can Democrats expect a \nvote on their recommendations?\n  While the Republican leader and the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee seem content not to do their jobs, the American people are \nbeing robbed of justice. There has been a spike in judicial \nemergencies. If there aren't enough judges to hear the cases that \narise, it is deemed to be an emergency because the judges there are \nunable to do the work because there are too few judges.\n  When the Republicans assumed control of the Senate last year, there \nwere 12 judicial emergencies nationwide. Now there are 31--1 year \nlater, 31. They are going up almost by the week. As I have indicated, \nthat number will only grow as Republicans continue to refuse to process \nimportant judicial nominations. But the obstruction isn't limited to \nSupreme Court nominees or judges to fill these judicial emergencies. \nThere are other matters that we should be concerned about.\n  Take, for example, the Banking Committee. It is setting records for \ndoing nothing. The committee has been operating under the leadership of \nthe senior Senator from Alabama. In that time, the committee has not \nyet reported a single nomination. This is unprecedented.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, which is a \nnonpartisan group, the Banking Committee has reported out at least one \nnomination every year for the past 50 years--not now. It is the only \nSenate committee not to consider a single nomination last year. When \nasked why, he said he had other things to do.\n  What are those nominations that the Senator has put a hold on? What \npositions have gone unfilled as the chairman pursued his political \ncareer with the primary election just having been completed? The Under \nSecretary of Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence is \nreally important and two seats on the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. We know that Wall Street needs to be monitored very \nclosely. We have two seats that need to be filled. There are two seats \non the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and we know how important \nthat is. There are the Director of the U.S. Mint and the Export-Import \nBank Board of Directors. They can't do their work now because we need \nto fill those spots. There are the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, \nthe inspector general, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \nand others.\n  From the Republican leader to his committee chairs and the rank and \nfile, we continue to hear that the Senate is working again. This is a \nfigment of the Republicans' imagination. It is not working again. It \nappears the Republican Senate isn't interested in doing its job. There \nno longer seems to be a voice of reason coming from the Republican \nside.\n  Isn't there a single Republican who will stand against the Republican \nleader's nominations blockade? Isn't there a single Republican willing \nto put an end to this historic obstruction? Providing advice and \nconsent on the President's nominees is a constitutional duty. I say: Do \nyour job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1324-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1324-S1325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an article here from CNN. It is quite \nilluminating.\n  When I was a boy growing up in the town of Searchlight, we didn't \nhave people of color--no one, ever. When I went away to high school, we \ndid have people of color. There were not many, but certainly we had \nAfrican Americans, and we had Hispanics. It wasn't until then, when I \nwent to high school, that I had a wonderful Spanish teacher, Marlan \nWalker. I was able to visit with him when I went home last time to see \nhim. He had lost his wife Colleen. He made such a difference in my \nlife. But he is a fine man and was a great Spanish teacher. It was the \nfirst time I had ever heard anything about pinatas. What is a pinata? \nTraditionally, they have them in Mexico, where they have a figure. It \ncan be all kinds of things, but let's say it is a horse. You blindfold \nyoung people. They have a stick in their hand, and they can't see. They \nknow it is hung there; they saw it before they were blindfolded. They \ntry to find the pinata so they can hit it because presents come out of \nit. Things come out of the pinata. But, boy, the pinata gets beaten \nuntil it starts dumping little presents on everyone's head.\n  This article, which came from what happened on CNN, would be \nilluminating for people to read. It is written by Ted Barrett, dated \nyesterday. When asked about Presidential nominees to the Supreme Court, \nthe assistant Republican leader said: ``I think they will bear some \nresemblance to a pinata.''\n  Think about that. They don't know who the nominee is. They don't know \nanything about the person, but they already have in their mind that \nthey are going to beat this person like a pinata. These are his words, \nnot mine. Direct quote: ``I think they will bear some resemblance to a \npinata.''\n  Think about that. He is saying Republicans are going to do all they \ncan to hurt this person's reputation, to beat on them, like a pinata. \nHe went on to say: ``Because there is no guarantee, certainly, after \nthat time they're going to look as good as they did going in.'' Think \nabout that: to say to the American people that they refuse to meet with \nsomebody they don't know, refuse to have a committee hearing on someone \nthey don't know, refuse to have a vote in the committee, and refuse to \nhave a vote on this floor.\n\n  Now the assistant Republican leader has told us that it doesn't \nmatter who it is. It doesn't matter if the nominee is a man, woman, \nold, or young. It doesn't matter what their education is or what their \nexperience is, they are going to beat that person like a pinata. I \nthink they have been listening to Donald Trump too much. The \nRepublicans need to stop and listen to the disgusting rhetoric they are \nspewing. They are going to treat someone they don't even know like a \npinata?\n  Now the Republicans are reduced to acting like big, tough people and \nthreatening to destroy the reputation of someone they don't even know. \nThey\n\n[[Page S1325]]\n\nhaven't even seen them yet. This is vile behavior that is beneath the \ndignity of this institution. If Republicans continue down this path of \ndestruction while working on this process, it is going to reverberate \nin the wrong direction for decades to come. They have to get their \nsenses back.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CNN article written \nby Ted Barrett, to which I referred, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From CNN, Mar. 7, 2016]\n\n         Supreme Court Nominee Would Be a `Pinata,' Cornyn Says\n\n                            (By Ted Barrett)\n\n       The No. 2 Senate Republican warned Monday that potential \n     nominees to the Supreme Court should consider the battle they \n     will be forced to endure if they are picked for the post, \n     suggesting a high-stakes slugfest could damage their \n     reputations in a fruitless pursuit of the top court.\n       ``I think they will bear some resemblance to a pinata,'' \n     said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas.\n       ``What I don't understand is how someone who actually wants \n     to be confirmed to the Supreme Court would actually allow \n     themselves to be used by the administration in a political \n     fight that's going to last from now until the end of the \n     year,'' Cornyn told a small group of reporters in the \n     Capitol.\n       He added: ``Because there is no guarantee, certainly, after \n     that time they're going to look as good as they did going \n     in.''\n       Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary Committee, adamantly \n     opposes confirming President Barack Obama's Supreme Court \n     pick to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, a \n     conservative stalwart on the bench who died last month.\n       Obama is expected to name a replacement any day.\n       ``There is no question Democrats would do the same thing if \n     the shoe was on the other foot based on their prior conduct \n     and I don't think the voters are really interested in seeing \n     the ideological balance of the court changed for the next 30 \n     years by a lame duck president,'' Cornyn said.\n       The tension between the parties was on full display on the \n     Senate floor when Democratic Leader Harry Reid continued his \n     weeks-long tirade against the Republican chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, for vowing not \n     to schedule a confirmation hearing for an eventual nominee.\n       ``He is allowing himself and his committee to be \n     manipulated by the Republican leader for narrow, partisan \n     warfare. He is taking his orders from the Republican leader \n     and, sadly, Donald Trump,'' Reid said. ``Donald Trump on this \n     issue, when asked about it, his words were three: `Delay, \n     delay, delay.' Grassley must have been listening.''\n       Democrats believe that under enough pressure Grassley, who \n     is up for re-election, could crumble and open the door to a \n     hearing and a vote for a nominee. But Grassley didn't sound \n     like he was ready to fold when he responded to Reid.\n       ``The tantrums on the other side continue,'' said Grassley. \n     ``But I guess it shouldn't surprise anybody as everyone knows \n     around here nothing makes the minority leader more mad than \n     when his side is forced to play by its own rules.''\n       Grassley also compared Obama to King George III for \n     ``executive overreach,'' which he said frustrated the \n     founding fathers then and frustrates the Senate Republicans \n     now.\n       Also Monday, Reid met in his Capitol office with Patty \n     Judge, a Democrat and former lieutenant governor of Iowa who \n     just announced she will challenge Grassley this fall.\n       Cornyn said he has no doubts about the 82-year-old \n     Grassley's ability to withstand political pressure from \n     Democrats.\n       ``They don't know Chuck Grassley,'' Cornyn said. ``He's \n     like a rock.''\n       Interest groups on the left and right are lined up to \n     champion their causes in what is expected to be an expensive \n     and protracted battle that could undermine the candidate, no \n     matter how well qualified or liked he or she is.\n       ``As a practical matter, there would be no requirement on \n     the part of a Democratic president to reappoint the same \n     person. So I think they need to realize we're serious about \n     the position we've taken,'' Cornyn said.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, several weeks ago, the untimely passing of \nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia created a vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt, which now has only eight Justices. It called into question the \nconstitutional responsibility of the President of the United States \nwhen such a vacancy exists and the constitutional responsibility of \nthis Senate.\n  This morning in the Washington Post, there was speculation about six \npossible nominees the President could send to the Senate. It was \nspeculation in the paper, and we don't know if any one of those would \nactually be the nominee suggested by the President, but it is very \nobvious--and having spoken with the President personally on this issue, \nI know he is carefully weighing the options.\n  Why will the President move forward on this nomination? Because the \nConstitution requires it. In article II, section 2, it says the \nPresident shall appoint a nominee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt--shall; not may, shall appoint--and the Senate shall perform its \nadvice and consent duties with respect to that nomination. So there are \ntwo constitutional responsibilities: for the President to suggest a \nnominee and for the Senate to act on that nominee.\n  There have been instances in American history where argument could be \nmade that that constitutional responsibility should be ignored or at \nleast delayed. One that comes to mind dates back to 1942. On October 3, \n1942, a vacancy arose on the Supreme Court of the United States. On \nthat day, Justice James Byrnes on the Supreme Court resigned his seat \nto become Director of the Office of Economic Stabilization in the \nRoosevelt administration.\n  On January 11, 1943, President Roosevelt nominated Wiley Rutledge, a \nKentucky native and former dean of the University of Iowa College of \nLaw, to fill that vacancy. At this point in 1943, the United States was \nfully engaged in the Second World War. When the President sent up this \nnomination, battles were raging in Europe, Asia, Africa, and in the \nAtlantic and the Pacific. It was unclear whether we would prevail or \nthe enemy would prevail. Each day brought alarming, stunning news about \ndevelopments in the war.\n  Three days after making his Supreme Court nomination, President \nRoosevelt flew to Morocco to join Churchill and de Gaulle at a \nCasablanca conference on the future of the war. At this conference, the \nAllies coordinated their strategy against the Axis powers and decided \nto launch an offensive in Sicily and in Italy.\n  On January 27, 1943, American bombers from the Eighth Air Force \nconducted the first American air raid over Germany. On January 30, \nJapanese aircraft torpedoed and sank a cruiser named the USS Chicago in \nthe South Pacific. Sixty-two men lost their lives. Over a thousand \nsurvived due to a daring and swift rescue.\n  The Nation was clearly engaged in war. There was every reason in the \nworld for the President and even the Senate to say: This is no time to \ntalk about a Supreme Court vacancy. Instead, the President and the \nSenate, even in the midst of World War II, understood their obligation \nunder the Constitution. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing \nfor Rutledge on January 22, 11 days after his nomination had been sent \nto the Hill by President Roosevelt. The committee reported Rutledge's \nnomination to the floor on February 1, and he was confirmed by the full \nSenate on February 8, 1943, 28 days after his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to put this set of facts on the record to \nmake it clear that there is absolutely no excuse for what the Senate \nRepublicans are doing with this vacancy. There is no excuse for the \nSenate Republicans to\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\nignore their constitutional responsibility, a Constitution which they \nhave sworn to uphold and defend. We are not in the midst of a world \nwar; we are in the midst of a Presidential campaign. And that in and of \nitself explains why Senator McConnell, just hours after the \nannouncement of the death of Antonin Scalia, made it clear that the \nSenate would not accept its responsibility under the Constitution to \nfill this vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  It is a sad reality that the Republicans have made this decision to \nleave the Supreme Court for over a year with this vacancy. When was the \nlast time the Senate left the Supreme Court with a vacancy for over a \nyear? It goes back to the Civil War, when we were at war with \nourselves, with thousands being killed on a daily basis. It was in that \nturmoil that we left a vacancy on the Supreme Court for over a year.\n  Now the Senate Republicans point to the turmoil of a Presidential \nelection campaign as their reason for not accepting their \nconstitutional responsibility. They make a vacuous argument that we \nshould wait and pick a new President and let this new President, in his \nnext term or her next term, fill this vacancy. Well, that is an empty \nargument because in the year 2012, in November of 2012, there was a \nPresidential election. The two major party nominees were, of course, \nPresident Obama running for reelection and Mitt Romney running on the \nRepublican side. In that election, the American people made a clear \nchoice. By a margin of 5 million votes, they reelected President Barack \nObama, and they reelected him for a 4-year term. So it turns out that \neven in this year of 2016, Barack Obama is still the President of the \nUnited States. This may come as news to those on the Republican side of \nthe aisle, but he was reelected for 4 years by a 5 million-vote margin, \nand their refusal to give this President due consideration of his \nnominee is a rejection of that verdict of the American people in that \nelection.\n  So for the first time in history, we find a nominee presented by the \nPresident about to come to Capitol Hill, and the promise of the Senate \nRepublicans? They will not even hold a hearing, will not even consider \nthis nominee, and won't bring it to a vote. In fact, Senator McConnell \nwent further. He said he would refuse to even meet with any nominee \nsent by the President. That is unheard of, unprecedented, uncalled for, \nand an embarrassment to this institution of the United States Senate.\n  I call on the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I \nam proud to serve, to step back and reassess the letter they signed 2 \nweeks ago. It was a letter accepting Senator McConnell's strategy, \nsaying they would not do their job. They would, in fact, walk away from \ntheir job, walk away from their constitutional responsibility. I would \nhope they would realize they are leaving a mark in history which is \nindefensible, a mark in history which is unprecedented, and one which \nsadly will leave the Supreme Court with only eight Justices.\n  The American people have spoken. They have chosen the President. The \nPresident has accepted his constitutional responsibility. The Senate, \nunder Republican leadership, can do no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1326-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1326-S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMPREHENSIVE ADDICTION AND RECOVERY BILL\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor to \nspeak again in support of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, \nwhich the Senate will consider and I hope approve this week. It is a \nlong overdue measure to address the public health hurricane, a crisis \nwe face in this country. It is every bit as real and threatening as \nthreats from abroad. In fact, I have just now come from a hearing of \nthe Armed Services Committee, where I had the opportunity to question \nsome of our Nation's leading military experts, including the head of \nour Special Operations Command, General Votel, about the threat posed \nby illicit substances, such as heroin, to this country. The testimony \nwas that those substances, when they come to this country, follow the \nsame route as terrorists, illicit arms, and other military threats to \nthis Nation.\n  The bipartisan support for the measure before us is a sign of the \nmeaningful strides that this Nation has taken, but more is necessary to \nbe done toward ending the epidemic of heroin addiction and prescription \ndrug abuse. It is a danger to every community across the country, big \ncities and towns in Connecticut, suburban and urban. Every race and \nreligion, ethnic group, and demographic is potentially a victim.\n  I have heard from our colleagues across the country that this crisis \ntruly has proportions on a par with any of the tornadoes, floods or \nhurricanes we have seen as natural disasters. Abuse and addiction are \ncrippling communities around the country, shattering families, and \nimposing enormous financial and human costs.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, overdose deaths have steadily \nincreased, as they have throughout the Nation, and they now surpass \nautomobile crashes as the leading cause of injury-related death for \nAmericans between the ages of 25 and 64. Connecticut saw more than 700 \noverdose deaths in 2015. Without a doubt, we must act.\n  Many communities across Connecticut and our country already have \ntaken steps and have dedicated resources to stopping the epidemic of \nheroin addiction and prescription drug overuse. I am very privileged to \nwelcome a number of those communities to the Senate today. They are \nrepresented by mayors from major cities in Connecticut: Mayor Joe Ganim \nof Bridgeport, Mayor O'Leary of Waterbury, Mayor Moran of Manchester, \nalong with local officials from Bridgeport, Groton, Manchester, New \nHaven, South Windsor, and the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of officials I just referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                        Bridgeport City Council\n\n       Joe Ganim (mayor), Evette Brantley, Scott Burns, Milita \n     Feliciano, Tom Caudett, Jeanette Herron, Michelle Lyons, Gina \n     Malheiro, Tom McCarthy, Aides Nieves, John Olson, Anthony \n     Paoletto, Richard Salter, Neenah Smith, AmyMarie Vizzo-\n     Paniccia.\n\n\n                                 Groton\n\n       Bonnie Nault, Harry Watson.\n\n\n                        Manchester Town Council\n\n       Jay Moran (mayor), Margaret Hackett, Patrick Greene.\n\n\n                         New Haven City Council\n\n       Delphine Clyburn, Frank Douglass, Alberta Gibbs, Rosa \n     Ferraro Santana, Brian Wingate.\n\n\n                       South Windsor Town Manager\n\n       Matt Galligan.\n\n\n                Connecticut Conference of Municipalities\n\n       Ron Thomas, Kevin Maloney.\n\n\n                               Waterbury\n\n       Neil O'Leary (mayor).\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. They have shown by their actions they are willing to \nnot only talk the talk but actually walk the walk. I participated with \nMayor Ganim over the weekend in a public press conference, noting the \ntruly extraordinary and excellent work by their drug task force to \nstop, apprehend, arrest, and prosecute a major drug ring in the city of \nBridgeport.\n  I have talked to Mayor O'Leary about efforts in Waterbury and \nthroughout his region--a very responsible and effective action he took \nas police chief of Waterbury--but we know we are not going to arrest \nour way out of this crisis. Law enforcement needs more effective \nsupport and resources. There is no way around the need for supporting \nand enhancing the operations of our local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement officials--in fact, increasing the partnership and \ncooperation among them, as was so dramatically shown by the successful \nlaw enforcement in the city of Bridgeport against this drug ring last \nweek. All have a role and all of their cooperation is necessary.\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\n  All of us have a responsibility to support their work, but the bill \nbefore us also recognizes that we are not going to arrest or jail our \nway out of this crisis. In fact, it provides resources for treatment \nand services and a more effective means of delivering Narcan, which can \nliterally be a lifesaver, bringing overdose victims back from the brink \nof death.\n  What I have heard in roundtables I have conducted around the State of \nConnecticut is the need for those additional steps, not focusing on any \none of them but a multifaceted effort, as this bill reflects. In the \nroundtables I have conducted, I have heard from law enforcement \nprofessionals, first responders, doctors, addiction specialists, \nelected officials, and many others, including recovering addicts and \ntheir families. Their stories are riveting and heartbreaking about the \neffects of addiction, beginning with powerful prescription painkillers \nfor routine surgery, broken ankles or wrists, and wisdom teeth that \nhave been removed. There was overprescription of 20 pills, 30 pills, \nwhen 2 pills or 3 pills would have been sufficient, and those pills are \nthe gateway to more serious addiction or they find their way onto the \nstreet where they fuel the addiction of others and lead to addiction to \nheroin, which often is cheaper than the prescription pills.\n  Those stories I have heard from around our State, stories from people \nstruggling with addiction or who have lost a loved one to this disease, \nadd to the public record that exists. That record includes a story that \nappeared within the past week or so in the New London Day. It talks \nabout two childhood friends, Nat and Joe. Both of them struggled with \nheroin addiction, but they are now in recovery. Between them, they have \nlost several friends, a former girlfriend, and a stepbrother to \noverdoses, and each has a sibling who has also become an addict. Nat is \nnow 27 and the father of two. He said:\n\n       I started taking pills when I was 19 or 20 and was stressed \n     out when I was going through a custody battle over my son. \n     Somebody said to try one, and then I was taking them a couple \n     of times a week and then every day I was buying off the \n     street. It was out of control. It got so that I couldn't work \n     without drugs.\n\n  The same happened to Nat's friend Joe with Percocet. He described how \nhe took a few pills, liked the feeling, and rapidly began to take drugs \nwith other friends, including OxyContin and heroin.\n  Another article in the Waterbury Republican American told the story \nof Thomas Obst, who was prescribed OxyContin for an eye injury. When he \nlater suffered from withdrawal symptoms, he turned to heroin to keep \nhimself from suffering. He explained:\n\n       You never know what a street drug is mixed with, but it's \n     less expensive . . . someone mentioned heroin. I thought I \n     could control it.\n\n  Thomas eventually overdosed, but his life was saved by a brave State \nTrooper named Josh Sawyer, who was able to administer naloxone. This \ndrug can be a lifesaver if it is available to police--as it was in this \ninstance--and first responders and firefighters. Unfortunately, its \nprice has skyrocketed, and it is increasingly in short supply.\n  These stories from Connecticut are hardly unique. Our colleagues know \nthey are happening in their communities. They know overdose deaths are \nskyrocketing, that addiction is increasing, and that the toll taken on \ntheir States and our communities is absolutely horrendous.\n  During our roundtable in Bridgeport last Friday, a manager of the \nBridgeport Recovery Community Center explained the obstacles that \npeople afflicted with addiction face in trying to obtain treatment this \nway:\n\n       Insurers will dictate what they will and will not pay for. \n     You have to continually prove that this person is allowed to \n     stay. You must make daily phone calls to plead your case.\n\n  When treatment is made available, there should be no wrong door; \nthere should be no harassing need to demonstrate the problem and the \nneed for treatment. We need more availability of insurance and \nincreasing recognition that addiction is not a stigma, it is an \naffliction, a disease, every bit as much so as any other disease. And \nsupplies of the drugs that can help treat that addiction--SUBOXONE, for \nexample--have to be made available.\n  The legislation before us would provide more treatment, more beds, \nbut it is only a down payment, only a beginning. There is truly a need \nfor recognition that we face a public health hurricane and that this \ncrisis, a spreading epidemic, will only become worse if we fail to \nprovide more assistance.\n  This bill strengthens State programs like Connecticut's that are \nalready in place, including State prescription drug monitoring programs \nas well as training for law enforcement and emergency responders in the \nuse of Narcan. It provides important recovery support services for \nthose struggling with addiction, and it would strengthen existing \nFederal programs, such as the DEA's drug take-back program.\n  The bill also provides more support for substance abuse treatment \nservices for incarcerated individuals. We know a lot of people in \nprison today are there because of their addiction. If they are to \nemerge successfully from incarceration, they need that support and \nassistance to break the grip of addiction.\n  As important as this bill is, I agree with many of my colleagues--and \nthey have spoken on the floor--that it is far less effective than it \ncould be without the $600 million supplemental appropriations that I \nhave advocated and fought to pass. I am disappointed the amendment of \nSenator Shaheen, which I spearheaded and cosponsored, was not included \nin this measure, and I look forward to continuing to fight for the \nresources necessary to make this fight real.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues, including Senator Whitehouse \nand others, for incorporating a bipartisan provision I wrote with \nSenator Coats called the Expanding Access to Prescription Drug \nMonitoring Programs Act. This provision will allow nurse practitioners \nand physician assistants to access the information they need. \nSpecifically, they would be able to access State prescription drug \nmonitoring programs to consult a patient's prescription opioid history \nand thereby determine if a patient has a history of addiction or \nreceiving multiple prescriptions from multiple sources.\n  I know from my decade and a half of work in this area how doctor \nshopping and other abuses can in fact exacerbate this problem of \naddiction and prescription drug abuse. Although nurse practitioners and \nphysician assistants wrote over 7 million opioid prescriptions in 2013, \nfew States permit them to consult and submit prescribing data to these \nimportant State databases. Allowing these providers to access more \ninformation about patient history enables them to address potential \naddiction before--and I stress ``before''--it becomes a serious \nproblem.\n  I hope this body will adopt a number of other amendments that I have \nproposed, including the one Senator Markey and I have spearheaded, \namendment No. 3382, prescriber education. Prescriber education is \ncrucial.\n  In a roundtable I held at the Yale medical school, a number of the \ndocs told me that now--only recently--are there sufficient education \nand training and specific courses devoted to pain management and \nprescription discipline. Many doctors now lack that education, and our \namendment would require that training as a condition for continued--Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent for a few more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. It would provide as a condition that this training be \nconducted before any doctor receives a renewal of his or her license by \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration.\n  To help our veterans, an amendment that I have offered, No. 3438, \nwould eliminate naloxone copays for our veterans. As ranking member of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have seen how the opioid epidemic \nhas affected our veterans. It is truly devastating. Safe prescribing of \nopioids is vital because many veterans, especially those returning from \ncombat, have serious pain issues that must be addressed, but they must \nbe addressed safely, with care and caution about the dangers of \naddiction.\n  I appreciate our dedication to addressing this problem. I hope that \nit will be bipartisan and that our approval this week will match the \nurgency of this problem in communities around the State of Connecticut \nand around this country. The solution to this problem is long overdue \nfor action,\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\nand I look forward to this next step--only one of many that have to be \ntaken--in aiding our law enforcers, our health care providers, our \npublic officials, such as our representatives today on the Hill, in \nmoving forward and addressing this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1328-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican whip.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as the entire country knows, it was about \n1 month ago that we lost Justice Antonin Scalia. Our country is still \ndealing with the loss of this man, whose contribution to our highest \nCourt and the health of our Constitution cannot be overstated.\n  Justice Scalia understood the actual words in the Constitution were \nimportant. He famously said that if the American people realized what \nthe Supreme Court did on occasion, which was to substitute their value \njudgments instead of interpreting the Constitution and laws--rather to \nsubstitute their value judgments for those of the people and their \nelected representatives--they might well feel their values were \nsuperior and preferable to those of an unelected life-tenured member of \nthe United States Supreme Court. That is an important reminder.\n  Justice Scalia was known for expressing himself very colorfully and \nclearly, and he clearly was no fan of making it up as you go along, \nwhich, unfortunately, can happen when the Supreme Court chooses to \nsubstitute their values for those of the American people rather than \ninterpret the law and the Constitution.\n  Justice Scalia was also a key figure when it came to making sure the \nCourt policed the check of Executive power on legislative power. In \nother words, he believed in the separation of powers and checks and \nbalances. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that Justice \nScalia helped resuscitate our constitutional principles and inspired \nthe next generation of lawyers and legal scholars and judges to care \ndeeply about our Constitution as originally written. Because of Justice \nScalia, our Republic is stronger.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to and read about comments made by our \nfriends across the aisle who are questioning our intention to allow the \nAmerican people to help choose who the next Justice on the Supreme \nCourt is going to be by selecting the next President who will make that \nappointment. It is abundantly clear that the Constitution gives the \nPresident the authority to make a nomination, but it is just as clear \nthat the Constitution gives the U.S. Senate the authority to determine \nhow or whether to move forward with any nominee proposed by President \nObama. There is ample precedent to support the decision made by Senate \nRepublicans to withhold consent on the President's nominee and to allow \nthe American people's voices to be heard.\n  That is not to say it will not be a Democratic President making that \nappointment or it could be a Republican President. We don't know at \nthis early stage in the Presidential election. But we do know it would \nbe improper to allow a lameduck President to forever change the balance \non the Supreme Court for perhaps the next 30 years as he is heading out \nthe door.\n  There is a lot of precedent for what we have decided to do. Not since \n1932 has the Senate, in a Presidential election year, confirmed a \nSupreme Court nominee to a vacancy arising in that same year--1932. One \nwould have to go back even further--to 1888--to find an election-year \nnominee who was nominated and confirmed under a divided government, as \nwe have today. So what Senate Democrats are actually insisting on, and \nthe President is insisting on, is that we do something we haven't done \nfor 130 years.\n  Of course, the position being taken by Senate Republicans is not a \nnew idea either. As a matter of fact, the Democratic leader in 2005 \nsaid this--of course, this was when President George W. Bush was \nPresident. Senator Reid said:\n\n       The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. \n     Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate \n     has a duty to give presidential appointees a vote.\n\n  Senator Reid was entirely correct. That is what the Constitution \nsays. As I mentioned earlier, the President can nominate anybody he \nwants, but the Constitution does not say the Senate is obligated to \ngive a vote to that nominee.\n  I would note that I read some of the remarks of the Democratic leader \nthis morning, and I just want to say he was apparently critical of a \nstory written that included my name and the word ``pinata'' included in \nthe story, suggesting this was somehow a threat.\n  I would be surprised if any person who actually aspired to be on the \nU.S. Supreme Court--a current judge or a legal scholar or lawyer--would \nallow themselves to be used by this administration in making a \nnomination to the Supreme Court for a seat that will not be filled \nduring the remainder of President Obama's term, knowing they will not \nbe confirmed. And even if a member of the same political party as the \nPresident is elected President next year, there is no guarantee that \nsame person will be renominated. So I likened the nomination process \nand confirmation process to a pinata, which is only to say the \nconfirmation process around here has gotten pretty tough.\n  But I am not going to be preached to by the Democratic leader, by the \nDemocrats who have been responsible for filibustering judges, creating \na new verb in the English language--``Borked''--when they blocked \nRobert Bork's appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, when the \nDemocratic leader invokes the nuclear option, breaking the Senate rules \nfor the sole purpose of packing the DC Circuit Court of Appeals with \nlike-minded judges so that the President wouldn't have to worry about \njudges who might question overreaching his authority under the \nConstitution by issuing Executive orders or otherwise circumventing the \nrole of Congress. This is a playbook that has been written by the \nDemocratic leader and our colleagues across the aisle. Do they expect \nus to operate under a different set of rules than they themselves \nadvocated for?\n  Here is what Senator Reid's successor in the Democratic caucus said \nin 2007. This was 18 months before President George W. Bush left \noffice. Senator Schumer, the Senator for New York, said: ``For the rest \nof this President's term [18 months] we should reverse the presumption \nof confirmation.''\n  I don't really know what he is talking about. There never was a \npresumption of confirmation. But I guess he is assuming the deference \nsome people show when a President does nominate a Supreme Court \nJustice. We haven't seen much of that deference lately, I might add. \nBut this is what Senator Schumer goes on to say: I will ``recommend to \nmy colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except \nin extraordinary circumstances.''\n  Essentially, what Senator Schumer was saying is that 18 months before \nPresident George W. Bush left office, if there were a vacancy created, \nthey would presume not to confirm that nominee.\n  Of course, we know that back in 1992 when he was chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Vice President Biden said: ``The Senate \nJudiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling \nconfirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political \ncampaign season is over.'' That is what Vice President Joe Biden said \nin 1992.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee here on \nthe\n\n[[Page S1329]]\n\nfloor, and I want to tell him how much I appreciate his steadfastness \nin supporting the decision we have made collectively to allow the \nvoters in November, who choose the next President, a voice in who is \nactually nominated to fill this important vacancy.\n  I wasn't in the room when Chairman Grassley and Majority Leader \nMcConnell were there with the Vice President and the President; Senator \nLeahy, the ranking member; and Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, but I \nhave heard that the question came up: How can you do this? How can you \nnot allow President Obama to fill this vacancy?\n  I heard that it was pointed out to the President, to the Vice \nPresident, to the ranking member, and to the Democratic leader that \nthey were the ones who filibustered judicial nominees by a Republican \nPresident. They are the ones who created this environment in which what \nused to be fairly routine confirmation hearings have become so \npolarized.\n  Again, I believe it would be foolish of us to say, ``Well, these are \nthe policies the Democrats, when they are in the majority, will employ \nwhen there is a Republican President'' but somehow to act aghast or \nsurprised when we say, ``Well, if the rules are going to apply to you \nlike this, then they ought to apply when Republicans are in the \nmajority and we have a Democratic President.''\n  At the end of a lameduck Democratic President's time in the White \nHouse, all three of these individuals--the Vice President; the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid; the heir apparent to the Democratic \nleadership, Senator Schumer--all three of them are quick to criticize \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee, insisting that different \nprinciples ought to apply. But that is hypocritical. It is the height \nof hypocrisy to say: Well, one set of rules applies to us and a \ndifferent set of rules applies to you.\n  This is more than just about hypocrisy; this is really about an \nimportant principle. It is important to allow the voters, in choosing \nthe next President of the United States, to make that decision and make \nsure their voice is heard rather than just 100 Members of the Senate. I \ndon't know why that should be objectionable.\n  So it is pretty clear to me--it is absolutely clear to me that Senate \nRepublicans stand firmly behind the idea that the people should have a \nsay in this critical issue when they vote in November because there is \na lot at stake here--a lot. Depending on who ultimately fills this \nvacancy next year, the next Supreme Court Justice could tip the \nideological direction of the Court for a generation--Justice Scalia \nserved for 30 years--and thus fundamentally reshape American society in \nthe process.\n  Given President Obama's previous Supreme Court nominees, the question \nbefore the American people is whether they want someone with the same \nor similar ideology to dramatically change the current balance on the \nSupreme Court, because if President Obama were allowed to nominate \nsomeone who is confirmed in the same mold as those he has already \nnominated and who have been confirmed, it would for a generation change \nthe ideological balance of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  You have to wonder whether the real goal--much like it was when the \nnuclear option was invoked and we saw nominees to the District of \nColumbia Court of appeals, which some people call the second most \nimportant court in the Nation--when there was literally a packing of \nnominees on that court because they wanted to tip the ideological \nbalance of the DC Court of Appeals because most of the important legal \ndecisions made which ultimately go to the U.S. Supreme Court go through \nthat court.\n  I have no doubt in my mind that the President and his allies wanted \nsomebody who is going to rubberstamp the President's actions. This \nCourt with Justice Scalia I think has rebuked the President on numerous \noccasions when he overreached his authority--for example, on recess \nappointments. We have seen an injunction granted by a district court in \nBrownsville, TX, upheld by the Fifth Court of Circuit Appeals, on the \nPresident's Executive action on immigration. The Court has often--led \nby Justice Scalia--stood strong against attempts by the President to \ngrab power for the executive branch away from Congress and, more \nimportantly, from the American people.\n  So at this critical juncture in our Nation's history, the American \npeople should have a voice in deciding who selects the next Justice on \nthe Supreme Court. I and my colleagues are absolutely committed to \nmaking sure they have that voice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am on the floor today to speak on the \nsame subject, but before I do, I want to very briefly discuss two other \nsubjects.\n\n\n                       Remembering Dylan Hockley\n\n  First, Mr. President, I noticed online today that today would be \nDylan Hockley's 10th birthday. Dylan Hockley was one of the 20 first \ngraders who were gunned down in a flurry of bullets at Sandy Hook \nElementary School in 2012.\n  Dylan's mother Nicole has become a crusader for this body to do \nsomething, anything in the wake of that tragedy to lessen the \npossibility that it might visit another community.\n  Dylan was an amazing little kid, struggling with a fairly severe \nlearning disability but loving every day that he went to school under \nthe care of a great special education professional who died that day as \nwell with Dylan in that classroom.\n  Dylan would have been 10 years old today. In the 3 years since his \ndeath, we have done nothing, absolutely nothing to honor his memory.\n\n\n              Mental Health Legislation and the TREAT Act\n\n  Second, Mr. President, I want to note that we are moving forward in \nthe HELP Committee on a very important markup next week on a mental \nhealth bill Senator Cassidy and I have been working on for over a year, \nand we hope that will eventually find its way to the floor of the \nSenate and in some measure be a very partial answer but an answer \nnonetheless to this epidemic of gun violence. We hope we will be able \nto have that debate this year.\n  I also note that we have a bill in the HELP Committee that I think is \na very important complement to the discussion we are having now on the \nopioid crisis all across the country. As my colleagues know, there is a \nlimit on the number of patients to whom providers can prescribe \nBuprenorphine, which is really the most effective, least addictive of \nthe heroin substitutes. As a physician, you can only prescribe this \ndrug to 100 clients. If you are a physician assistant or a nurse \npractitioner, you are not allowed to prescribe. In Connecticut, that is \nthe biggest obstacle we have--we don't have enough physicians who can \nprescribe this very effective drug.\n  The TREAT Act, which is a bipartisan bill, removes that cap for \nphysicians and allows nurses with higher levels of training and PAs to \nprescribe that drug as well. I hope the HELP Committee will take up \nthis bill as part of our markup next week. If it were up to me, we \nwould include it as part of our mental health initiative and move it to \nthe floor en bloc. The CARA bill is very important this week, but let's \nbe honest: There is no money in it, so there are a bunch of new \nprograms but no new resources for us in Connecticut to try to take on \nthis fight.\n  If we were to pass the TREAT Act next week in the HELP Committee and \nmove it to the floor, that would be real, tangible relief for \ncommunities in Connecticut. It would mean that more addicts coming out \nof detox would have access to true elements of recovery--in particular, \nthis very effective drug.\n  I am hopeful that the HELP Committee will move on this bill next week \nand that we can bring it to the floor perhaps as part of this broader \nmental health package. In one fell swoop, we could have a partial \nanswer to the epidemic of gun violence that plagues this country and a \npassage of the TREAT Act or a version of it that by itself might \nactually be more substantive than anything in the piece of legislation \nthat is before us today.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. President, I do want to spend a few moments talking about this \ncrisis that is gripping the U.S. Senate with respect to a vacancy that \nlooks to remain for the next year on the Supreme Court.\n  I have only been in the Senate for 3 years. This is my first term. I \ncan't\n\n[[Page S1330]]\n\nclaim to hold any special status as a guardian of this institution, \nwhich has stood the test of time for over 200 years, but I am a student \nof history, and I did choose to run to be a Member of this body because \nof the enormous respect I have for it and its unique role in the unique \nsystem of U.S. Federal governance. That is why I do believe we are at a \nmoment of crisis right now in which the Republican majority is blocking \nPresident Obama's constitutional responsibility to name a Supreme Court \nnominee, a ninth Justice.\n  I think this is a watershed moment for the U.S. Senate. I say that \nwith a connection to a State that has had a particularly important role \nin the creation of this body. Right outside this Chamber, there is a \nrelatively new painting above the door leading into the Reception Room \nof Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman, who were delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention. They were the authors of what is referred to \ntoday as the Connecticut Compromise. Roger Sherman was the primary \nauthor of it; it is sometimes called Sherman's Compromise. This was the \ncompromise that established the U.S. Senate, established the premise \nthat this body would be made up of two Members from each State and that \nbecause of its 6-year term would be much more immune to the political \ntempest of the moment that often grips the Chamber down the road, that \nwe would have a unique ability to rise above the partisan fray and make \ndecisions that are in the best long-term interests of this country.\n  Frankly, those have been the best traditions of this body going back \nto the fifties and sixties when this Senate led the fight to expand \ncivil rights laws or just 2 years ago when we were able to come \ntogether and pass an immigration reform bill, with the Presiding \nOfficer's leadership, that I think will set the platform for resolving \nthat issue in a commonsense way down the road. But the crisis that is \ngripping this place today, I fear, has no end because of the new rule \nthat is being established. I just heard Senator Cornyn talk about the \nillegitimacy of a lameduck President making a nomination to the Supreme \nCourt. Once something like that is established, it will be difficult to \nunravel.\n\n  If you accept that argument, then this Senate will never again act on \nthe nomination of a President in his second term. I suppose a second-\nterm President will be perceived by his lameduck status to be \nillegitimate for the purposes of nominating Justices to the Supreme \nCourt, and by that argument, likely illegitimate for the purposes of \nnominating anyone to the Court because he is a lameduck, and thus the \npeople need to have their say in the next election.\n  That is a radical transformation of the U.S. Constitution, and it \nsets up perpetual crises in which there could be long stretches of time \nequaling 4 years where we will have eight, seven or six Justices.\n  Just simply accepting the assistant leader at his word, we would be \nestablishing a new precedent in which the Supreme Court would have less \nthan nine individuals for enormous stretches of time. But I think this \nis about something more. This is about an unwillingness to allow this \nPresident, a Democratic President, to replace a Justice on the Supreme \nCourt while Republicans are in charge. They say it is because it is the \nlast year of his term--or perhaps the last 4 years of his term. But if \nthis is simply about a Democratic President replacing a Justice on the \nSupreme Court who tended to be more conservative, then that precedent \nhas no end either. I think Republicans are naive to believe that \nDemocrats wouldn't avail themselves of the same precedent at some point \nin the future and hold up nominees being offered by Republican \nPresidents. That is certainly not our hope nor is it the stated \nintention of anyone on this side of the aisle. But once you cross that \nRubicon, I think it would be very hard to come back. All of a sudden we \nwill have entered an era in which no Senate will want to take up the \nnomination of a President of the opposite party.\n  Senator Cornyn talked about how there is very little precedent for \nthis. Well, there is very little precedent because there are very few \ninstances over the course of the last 100 years in which there has been \na vacancy created in an election year. It is not because there is a \nhistory of past Senates blocking the replacement of a Supreme Court \nJustice when a vacancy occurs in an election year. It is because the \nvery scenario we are faced with today has not happened. In fact, over \nthe course of the last 100 years, the only time in which the Senate has \nnot acted on a vacancy created in an election year was, A, very late in \nan election year and, B, with respect to the elevation to the position \nof Chief Justice. The reality is that in the last 100 years the Senate \nhas taken action on every pending Supreme Court nominee to fill a \nvacancy, regardless of whether the nomination was made in a \nPresidential election year.\n  Over the course of our Nation's history, there have been 17 Justices \nconfirmed in a Presidential election year. Not since the Civil War has \nit ever taken more than a year to confirm a nominee for a Supreme Court \nvacancy. The average, of course--we heard it over and over--has been 67 \ndays from nomination to the final Senate vote.\n  But what Senate Republicans are proposing is that this President--\nwith over 300 days left in his term--will not even get the courtesy of \na vote in the Judiciary Committee, never mind a vote on the Senate \nfloor. They contend that this nominee will be rejected sight unseen, \nwhich is why we think all America is saying to Senate Republicans: Just \ndo your job. Go through the hearing process, meet with the nominee, and \nbring that nominee to a vote on the Senate floor.\n  There were lots of Democratic Senators who opposed Clarence Thomas \nwhen he was nominated, but that didn't stop them from allowing a vote \non the Senate floor. You can oppose this nominee once you take a look \nat their credentials and assess their suitability for the Court, but do \nyour job and show the respect for the institution of the Presidency \nsuch that his choice will at least get a fair hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the floor of the Senate.\n  I hope that for my sons' sake the effect of our actions over the next \nyear doesn't effectively rewrite the Constitution and that pages don't \nneed to be added to their textbooks in order to place caveats on the \nobligations of the President and the responsibilities of this body. I \nhope we don't all of a sudden create a new rule in which you only get a \nvacancy filled if the Senate and the Presidency happen to be of the \nsame party or you only get a vacancy filled, as Senator Cornyn would \nsuggest, when you have a nomination in the first 4 years of your \npotential 8-year tenure.\n  Lastly, what I worry about most greatly is the effect of this \ndecision giving credence to the belief among some that this President \nis illegitimate. I don't think that is held by Members of this body, \nbut I do know there are many in this country who don't recognize the \nlegitimacy of this President, and the way in which we treat this office \noften gives purchase to those arguments. There is a standard of review \nthat we have created for diplomatic agreements that we never held \nprevious Presidents to. There is a furor over the Executive actions \ntaken by this President even though previous Presidents have taken \nsimilar Executive actions--such as with the issue of immigration--and \nhave taken far more Executive actions than this President has. I worry \nthat, by disrespecting the institution and not even allowing for \nmeetings to be held between this nominee and Members of the Republican \nmajority, we feed this belief that this particular President doesn't \nshare the legitimacy of previous Presidents.\n  For all of those reasons, I hope we can just make a commitment to do \nour jobs and begin the process of considering the Supreme Court nominee \nonce the President makes this nomination.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the prescription \ndrug crisis. Every day someone in our Nation dies--a son, daughter, a \nparent--from a drug overdose. Most overdoses are from prescription \ndrugs, such as opioid painkillers. Too often drugs that were intended \nto bring comfort end up bringing tragedy. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, \nOxyContin--we have an epidemic of these prescription drugs and the \nabuse of them. These drugs wreck lives, wreck families, and wreck \nentire communities.\n\n[[Page S1331]]\n\n  In my home State of New Mexico, we know this all too well. We have \nthe second highest rate of drug overdose deaths. We are in a crisis, \nand it is getting worse. More New Mexicans are dying from drug \noverdoses than ever before. It touches home and it hits hard.\n  One of those we lost was a young man named Cameron Weiss. According \nto the Albuquerque Journal, Cameron was 18 years old, an athlete, a \npoet, and then became addicted to painkillers for the treatment of \nsports injuries. That led, as it often does, to heroin. Within 2 years \nthis promising young man with his whole life ahead of him was dead from \na heroin overdose.\n  His mom, Jennifer Weiss, took her grief and put it to work to help \nothers. After Cameron's death, she founded a group called Healing \nAddiction in Our Community so she could help other young people \nstruggling with addiction. She told the Albuquerque Journal the \nfollowing:\n\n       Something tragic has to happen before change happens. \n     Unfortunately, when it comes to heroin, that tragedy happens \n     all the time.\n\n  Most of us know young people like Cameron. A similar story of another \nyoung life that was lost to a heroin overdose was shared with me last \nweek. This young man's father who visited my office is a medical \nprofessional in New Mexico. With all of the resources and knowledge \navailable to him, he was still not able to prevent his son's tragic \ndeath last year at the age of 22.\n  One of my own staff members who was raised in Albuquerque lost four \nof his friends at Cibola High School. All four turned to heroin after \nabusing prescription drugs. One was his best friend, Michael, whose \nlife was cut short at 30 years old.\n  We see this pattern time and again. A person becomes addicted to \npainkillers and then turns to another prescription or to heroin, which \nis cheaper and easier to get. It is a lethal combination and a downward \nspiral.\n  We have all heard the numbers, and they are chilling. Opioid-related \ndeaths quadrupled nationally from 2002 to 2013. In 2014, nearly 30,000 \nAmericans died from prescription opioid and heroin overdose. More \nAmericans die each year from drug overdoses than from car crashes. \nAddiction knows no boundaries of race, gender or background, but our \nHispanic and tribal communities in places such as Rio Arriba County, \nNM, are ground zero. Year after year, Rio Arriba County has the highest \nrate of overdoses in the Nation, more than five times the national \naverage.\n  Just a few weeks ago KOB-TV reported on the toll that this has taken, \ngeneration after generation casting a long shadow over the beautiful \nEspanola Valley.\n  A young man named Rufus Billy said: ``Growing up here, they'd say \nthis was the heroin capital of the world.''\n  For many, prescription painkillers come first and heroin comes later. \nAccording to KOB, prevention groups report that 2 million opioid \nprescriptions were filled in New Mexico in 2014, double the number from \n10 years ago.\n  The abuse is so severe, according to Rio Arriba County Sheriff James \nLujan, that ``6 and 7-year-olds are talking about grandma and grandpa \nbeing addicts. . . . It's like a never-ending cycle.''\n  New Mexico is on the ropes and so many other States are as well. I \nlistened to my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. The stories are \nheartbreaking, and, sadly, we are losing the fight.\n  This is not just about numbers. It is about families and communities \ntorn apart. Too often it is a story of those looking for help and not \nfinding it. We can change that, but it will take more than words, more \nthan handwringing. It will take a real commitment, and, let's be clear, \nreal money.\n  Rehab saves lives--not always, and that is a tragedy all its own for \nsome families. But treatment certainly can't help when you can't get \nit. People are desperate and trying to get treatment and help. We see \nthis every day, especially in rural States like New Mexico. That is why \nwe need to pass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, because \nthis isn't just about addiction. It is about recovery and giving hope \nto those who feel hopeless.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I thank Senators Whitehouse \nand Shaheen for their leadership. CARA will help States and local \ncommunities fight this battle for prevention, education, treatment, and \nlaw enforcement efforts. CARA is a step forward, and we urgently need \nto move forward. We can't keep falling behind.\n  In Spanish, C-A-R-A, ``cara,'' means face. We should remember the \nfaces and remember our loved ones. These are not just statistics. That \nis why I have also introduced legislation to improve monitoring of \nprescriptions and to have a better referral for addicts to treatment \nservices. It also directs the FDA to review naloxone, which is an \nimportant lifesaving medication for over-the-counter use.\n\n  There is no doubt we have a crisis. We can't just say what works. We \nneed to pay for what works. Our commitment has to be equal to the \nchallenge, so I am quite disappointed that last week we did not adopt a \nkey amendment for additional emergency funding. Let us step up to the \nplate and get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a couple of weeks ago, a small agency in \nNew York State took a very big step that I think is very dangerous. The \nState Board of Regents said it will start giving some illegal \nimmigrants a license to practice medicine in the State of New York. \nThis is a State agency that grants certificates and licenses for more \nthan 50 different professions. You need this board's permission if you \nwant to be a nurse in New York, a pharmacist, a dentist or a doctor. I \nthink it is a terrible idea to grant licenses to illegal immigrants \nbecause doctors, dentists, and others are entrusted to prescribe \npowerful medications. That is the point of the bill we are on right \nnow. These include these very opioid painkillers we have been talking \nabout for the past few weeks.\n  Right now the Senate is debating what we can do to help communities \nand families who are struggling with abuse of these drugs. I think a \nbig part of the problem is that these powerful medications are just too \nwidely available. I can tell you that, as somebody who practiced \nmedicine in Wyoming for 25 years, I worry that there are physicians and \ndentists who may be too free in prescribing opioids, very addictive \nmedicines.\n  There are pharmacists who maybe haven't been as careful as they could \nbe about making sure the drugs are used appropriately by the people who \ncome to pick up prescriptions, and families across the country have \nbeen hurt by this abuse of these opioids, including many in New York \nState itself. Senator Gillibrand came to the floor last week to talk \nabout it. She talked about the problem of opioids being overprescribed \nin New York.\n  So then the question is: Why is New York State so eager to allow \nthese drugs to be prescribed and dispensed by people who we know have \nalready broken the law? The legislation we are debating today tries to \nreduce the flow of opioids, to reduce the ways that they might be \nprescribed improperly. It includes language that would help States \nmonitor and track prescriptions. That is a very important part of this \nlegislation which I support.\n  Senator Markey of Massachusetts has actually offered an amendment \nthat would do even more. It would tighten the process for registering \npeople to dispense powerful drugs like these opioids. Under the rules \ntoday, the Drug Enforcement Administration registers doctors before it \nallows them to write these prescriptions. Senator Markey's amendment \nsays that before anyone could even get this registration, they would \nhave to complete additional training.\n  We all want to make sure people who have been handing out these \nmedications can be trusted to do it responsibly. We all should have to \nbe very careful about giving a prescription pad to someone who, by \nhistory and maybe even their identity, may be unclear. So I am \nsubmitting an amendment to this Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery \nAct that will help us do this. This\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\namendment actually takes the same approach as Senator Markey's does. It \nadds a simple requirement, a requirement that before the Drug \nEnforcement Administration can register someone to prescribe or \ndispense these powerful addictive medications, that this applicant must \nbe able to prove that they are either a U.S. citizen or a legal \nresident. That is it.\n  There is actually a Federal law already on the books that requires \nthis. It was signed into law and passed by Congress and signed by Bill \nClinton in 1996, but there was a loophole in the law that allowed \nStates--like what New York is doing--States to come around later and \nexempt illegal immigrants from the requirement in their State.\n  New York is doing that right now through its board. It is not the \nState legislature that is doing it in New York. It is not the citizens \nof New York who are doing it. They are not the ones saying they are \nwilling to take a chance and loosen the standards of those who can \nprescribe these powerful, addictive medications. This is being done, \nand this decision is being made by a very small State agency acting on \nits own authority. I think this decision is much too important to be \nleft to a small group of people in Albany, NY.\n  I want to be clear. This is not about immigrants. This is about the \nthreat that comes from the misuse of opioid painkillers. It is about \nmaintaining the standards of the law. My grandfather came to this \ncountry. He did it legally like millions of others. He followed the \nrules. He worked hard. He continued to obey the law. We all know this \nis a country of immigrants, and we know America still proudly welcomes \nlegal immigrants today.\n  We also know that being a doctor is not like other jobs. When a \npatient goes to her doctor, she may literally be placing her own life \nin that doctor's hands. People need to have complete confidence that \ntheir doctor is ethical, honest, and can be trusted with life-and-death \ndecisions. How can a patient have this kind of faith in someone who \nbroke the law and is in the country illegally at this time? This action \nby the New York Board of Regents could seriously undermine the doctor-\npatient relationship and the trust that needs to be there.\n  Doctors are held to the highest possible standards. They need to be \noutstanding members of their community. In the State of New York, a \ndoctor can actually lose their license if convicted of a crime. What is \nit being in the country illegally? Why would we then give a license to \nsomeone who already knows they have committed a crime by being in the \ncountry illegally? It makes no sense.\n  As a doctor, I will tell you these opioid medications are very \npowerful. They can be abused, and they have been abused, especially if \nthey fall into the hands of someone who is not up to the highest moral \nprofessional and legal standards who is writing the prescription in the \nfirst place.\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to make sure such dangerous \nmedications can be given out only by people who meet the standards. I \nthink it would set a terrible precedent if we allow people who are in \nthis country illegally to begin prescribing these highly addictive \ndrugs, but that is what New York wants to do. I don't think we can \nallow someone who has broken the law to serve as the gatekeeper for \nthose potentially dangerous medications. We owe every American the \npeace of mind that the doctor treating their sick child is who that \ndoctor claims to be and that their doctor is in the country legally.\n  The New York Board of Regents is ignoring, absolutely ignoring, this \nimportant public health and public safety concern. If New York will not \nact to protect its people, then Congress must.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate continues to work on \nlegislation that addresses the heroin epidemic affecting our \ncommunities all over the country. Every State represented by a Senator \nin this Chamber is affected by it. I am pleased to see that yesterday \nwe had a strong vote on an important step forward to consider more \namendments, with the hope we will consider them today or tomorrow and \nthen have a vote on this legislation before the end of the week and \nsend it over to the House of Representatives, where there is similar \nlegislation, a companion bill that has already been drafted and is also \nbipartisan.\n  I thank Sheldon Whitehouse, who is on the floor now, my coauthor, and \nalso Senators Amy Klobuchar, Kelly Ayotte, and the 42 other bipartisan \ncoauthors of our legislation. This is bipartisan, but it is also \ncomprehensive and evidence based. It is not just supported by a lot of \nSenators, but it is also supported by a lot of groups. That is very \nimportant.\n  Over the past few years, Senator Whitehouse and I have worked with \ngroups around the country and in our own States to come up with the \nright answers; in other words, evidence-based solutions to prevention \nand education to help people not make the mistake and get into the \nfunnel of addiction but also, once those people are addicted, to help \nthem more with better treatment, better recovery, and to ensure we are \ntreating addiction like a disease, which it is. We are also helping law \nenforcement and helping to keep prescription drugs off the bathroom \nshelves and helping to monitor people's prescription drug use because a \nlot of this comes from the overprescribing of prescription drugs for \npain medication.\n  I am pleased to see we are making progress, and I want to talk about \none specific issue that is included in the legislation but which we \nhave yet to talk about, at least at length on the floor.\n  Over the last few years, we have had five forums in Washington, DC, \nto talk about issues related to addiction. Some have been with regard \nto the science of addiction, some about our youth, some about \nprevention, and some about better treatment options, but we had one \nthat was particularly interesting, I thought. It was about a very \nspecial issue; that is, how to treat substance abuse impacting our \nveterans and servicemembers and how to prevent our veterans and \nservicemembers from becoming subject to this addiction.\n  In the legislation we are considering on the floor, we focus on this \nissue. This came out of the expert testimony we had and the work that \nhas been done around the country on this issue. CARA allows veterans \nwho were discharged for a substance abuse disorder to use drug courts \nas they recover.\n  Too often our men and women come home from serving our country with \nuntreated trauma and PTSD, which often manifests itself in an \naddiction. We know from the research that has been done that more than \n20 percent of veterans with PTSD also suffer from an addiction or \ndependence on drugs like heroin or a dependence on alcohol. So post-\ntraumatic stress disorder is related very much to this addiction issue.\n  A few weeks ago, I was in Columbus, OH, and met with our veterans \ncourt there. We had a roundtable discussion with some of the veterans \nwho had been through it. It was actually a very inspiring experience \nhearing from veterans, many of whom had been serving\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\nour military in combat roles and had come home, gotten into some \ntrouble. They were in and out of the court system, and then they found \nthese veterans courts. These courts actually helped divert these \nveterans from prison, into treatment, and then into a support network \nwith other veterans.\n  For veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, going to \njail can be a major hurdle in their recovery. Yet for many who turn to \ndrugs and alcohol in an attempt to self-medicate, that is exactly where \nthey end up.\n  Ryan is a combat veteran. He served in Iraq. He had a distinguished \ncareer. He got home and found himself in a situation where he had \ntrouble readjusting to life back at home outside of the military. He \ngot into some trouble and ended up in jail. That didn't work for him. \nHis quote was this:\n\n       You send me to jail and all you're doing is sending me back \n     to the jungle. All those coping skills I've learned, they go \n     out the window. I'm the type of person that you put me in \n     there and all hell breaks loose.\n\n  That is Ryan. Fortunately for Ryan, he was able to participate in a \nveterans treatment court and get on the path to recovery. I am very \nproud of him today. He is a student at a major university in Ohio and \nabout to graduate. He has his life back together and his family back \ntogether. Again, it was an inspirational story because he has taken it \nupon himself to focus on his addiction and get the help he needed \nthrough this veterans court.\n  There are 17 veterans treatment courts in the State of Ohio. The \nprogram Ryan went through is a 2-year program that offers mental health \nand substance abuse treatment to veterans as an alternative to \nincarceration. These veterans also have to make regular court \nappearances, so it is not as though they are not connected to the \ncriminal justice system. They are. They know if they test positive for \ndrugs, they will end up back in that system. They are subject to random \ndrug testing.\n  As Ryan and the other veterans I talked to told me that day in \nColumbus, OH, this combination of accountability and support--\naccountability and support--was the right combination for them to get \nback on the right track. It made a difference for them in getting their \nlives back together, their families back together, and to once again be \ncontributing to their country.\n  CARA will expand veterans treatment courts and will also ensure \nveterans who are discharged for substance abuse issues are also \neligible to go through these programs. This is a critical change that \nwill help allow more veterans to get the help they need and again get \nat the root cause of their addiction.\n  CARA--the legislation we are considering right now--has the support, \nas I said, of a lot of groups--130 national stakeholders in public \nhealth, law enforcement, criminal justice and drug policy fields, \ndoctors, nurses, and others working in the trenches on prevention and \ntreatment. It is designed to fight prescription drug opioid abuse and \nheroin use holistically, from expanding prevention to supporting \nrecovery.\n  In addition to the specific provisions I discussed that help our \nveterans, CARA also expands prevention and educational efforts to \nprevent prescription opioid abuse and the use of heroin. It increases \ndrug disposal sites to keep medications out of the hands of young \npeople. It helps with regard to drug monitoring to know when people are \nbeing prescribed drugs, even if they cross State lines, by having an \ninterstate drug monitoring system.\n\n  The legislation also authorizes law enforcement task forces in some \nof our toughest areas around the country to combat heroin and \nmethamphetamine and expands the availability of the overdose reversal \ndrug naloxone--really a miracle drug--so that our law enforcement \nagencies and other first responders--our firefighters--have the \ntraining for using this drug but also have access to it.\n  In the criminal justice system, CARA will help to promptly identify \nand treat individuals suffering from substance abuse disorders and \nexpand these diversion efforts and these education efforts to give \nthese people a second chance.\n  CARA also authorizes resources to expand treatment, including \nmedication-assisted treatment, based on the evidence that it supports \nwhat has worked around the country. So we are trying to hold up some of \nthe best treatment programs in the country where there has been success \non a very tough issue, which is taking people through this process of \ngetting back on their feet and recovered.\n  CARA supports those recovery programs that are strictly focused on \nyouth and building communities of recovery, including at our colleges \nand universities. It also creates a national task force on recovery to \nimprove ways to address the collateral consequences imposed by \naddiction.\n  So this is a comprehensive bill that will help to reverse this tide. \nAgain, this is something that is affecting us all. The numbers are \noverwhelming. In the United States of America today, there will be \nabout 20 people who will die from overdoses. In Ohio, this happens \nevery week. About 25 people are now dying from overdoses, but that is \njust part of the problem. Many are not dying from the overdose. \nNaloxone is working in many cases, for instance. Others aren't \noverdosing. Yet their lives are ruined, their families are torn apart, \nand the communities are bearing the brunt of it. Many more crimes are \nbeing committed. I was with a prosecutor in Ohio last weekend, and he \ntold me 80 percent of the crime in his county is related now to this \nissue of heroin and prescription drug abuse.\n  We need to pass this bill and get it signed into law so it can help \nreverse this tide, help our State and local governments and our \nnonprofits that are doing a great job trying to address this issue, and \nhelp individuals who are suffering from this addiction, which is a \ndisease, to get the treatment they need and the recovery efforts that \nare needed to truly make a difference. This is an epidemic. It has now \nreached that kind of level--this kind of crisis level.\n  I am hopeful we will again have a series of amendments that can be \nincluded and voted on in the next 24 hours; that we can move forward \nwith this legislation and get a strong vote. We can then send it over \nto the House with a strong message that it is time for us to do what we \ncan to address this issue and make a difference in the lives of our \nconstituents.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto complete these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Constitution is the primary way the \nAmerican people set rules for government. America's Founders made sure \nthose were also written down so that as the Supreme Court said more \nthan two centuries ago, they may be neither mistaken nor forgotten.\n  The U.S. Constitution is one of the shortest and currently the oldest \nnational charter in the world, but while public officials, including \nevery Member of this body, swear an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution, it appears some are paying very little attention to it.\n  One of the most popular slogans in the debate over filling the \nvacancy left by the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is \n``Do your job.''\n  Never have so few words been so misleading for so many. Those who use \nthis slogan insist that the Senate's job is to conduct the confirmation \nprocess, including hearings and confirmation votes, in a certain way \nwhenever the President makes a nomination. In other words, the Senate \nshould be at the President's beck and call, configuring the \nconfirmation process around a particular timeline that he prefers.\n  There is some irony here, Mr. President. A few years ago, President \nObama wanted to stall certain members of the National Labor Relations \nBoard. The Senate was unlikely to confirm his nominee so the President \nbypassed the Senate altogether and made so-called recess appointments. \nThe Supreme Court eventually, and unanimously, ruled those appointments \nwere unconstitutional.\n  Now that the President intends to send a nominee to the Senate, he \nfeels he can dictate how the Senate evaluates that nominee. The \nPresident would, no doubt, be the first to say the Senate cannot tell \nhim whom to nominate but apparently feels he can insist\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\non whatever Senate confirmation process that will suit his purpose.\n  Colleagues on the other side of the aisle insist the Constitution \nrequires timely hearings and prompt floor votes for every nominee. I \ndon't know what Constitution they are using because the real one says \nnothing of the kind. The real Constitution gives to the President the \npower to nominate and to the Senate the separate power of advice and \nconsent, leaving to each the judgment of how to exercise their \nrespective power.\n\n  Actually, I should say that my Democratic colleagues are currently \ninsisting that the Constitution requires timely hearings and votes, \nbecause they were singing a very different tune only a few years ago.\n  The minority leader, the minority whip, and the Judiciary Committee \nranking member each voted dozens of times to deny any confirmation vote \nwhatsoever for President George W. Bush's judicial nominees--dozens of \ntimes. Were they voting to defy the Constitution then, or are they \nreferring to a made-up, fictional Constitution now?\n  When they served in this body, Vice President Biden and former \nSecretary Hillary Clinton voted, respectively, 29 and 24 times to deny \nthe very confirmation votes they now say the Constitution itself \nrequires. The shape-shifting Constitution they use apparently means \nwhatever then suits their political objectives. A coincidence, I am \nsure, but a very convenient coincidence.\n  The President himself, when he was a Senator, tried to deny \nconfirmation votes to multiple nominees, including Supreme Court \nJustice Samuel Alito. While President Obama recently said he now \nregrets voting to filibuster Justice Alito, he did not explain why it \ntook him 3,670 days to reach that conclusion. Cynics might even suggest \nthat his desire now to appoint another Supreme Court Justice may have \ncontributed in some small way to this epiphany.\n  So when Democrats in this body and their equally confused liberal \nallies call on the Senate to do its job, they really mean that the \nSenate should do what they want. I, too, want the Senate to do its job, \nbut I don't find our job description in anyone's political agenda. The \nSenate's job is to determine the best way to exercise its advice and \nconsent power in each particular situation, and the Senate has done so \nin different ways, at different times, under different circumstances.\n  When he was Judiciary Committee chairman in the 107th and 110th \nCongress, for example, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, denied a hearing to nearly 60 judicial nominees. Yet those are \nthe hearings he now says the Constitution requires. I don't think he \ncan have it both ways.\n  On May 19, 2005, the minority leader said that nowhere in the \nConstitution does it say the Senate must vote on Presidential nominees. \nHe called that notion rewriting the Constitution and reinventing \nhistory. Today, he says the opposite: that the Constitution actually \ndoes require a vote. Was he wrong in 2005, or is he, in his own words, \nrewriting the Constitution and reinventing history today?\n  No, Mr. President, the Constitution does not dictate how the Senate \nmust exercise its power of advice and consent; the Constitution leaves \nthat up to us in each situation.\n  The Senate has never allowed a term-limited President to fill a \nSupreme Court vacancy that opened up this late in his term. In fact, \nthis vacancy is only the third in the last century to occur after \nPresidential election voting has started. In 1956 and 1968, the Senate \ndid not confirm the nominee until after the next inauguration.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee for 39 years and a chairman \nfor 8 of those years--I am now in my 40th year--I have watched the \njudicial confirmation process disintegrate. Conservatives and liberals \nhave very different views about the kinds of judges America needs. \nSeveral Supreme Court nominees in the last few decades have been \nsubject to intense, confrontational campaigns. In addition, the current \nPresidential election cycle is already more hostile and divisive than \nin the past. These are among the circumstances we face today and must \nconsider when deciding how to exercise our power of advice and consent. \nIt would be irresponsible to follow a process suitable for a different \nsituation or, worse, a process designed only to produce a desirable \npolitical outcome.\n  Combining a high-stakes confirmation fight with a no-holds-barred \nPresidential campaign will produce a storm that will do more harm than \ngood. The better course would be to defer the appointment process until \nthe next President takes office and let the people make this \ndetermination. We are not without guidance in making this decision. In \nJune 1992, then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden argued that \nif a Supreme Court vacancy occurred in that Presidential election year, \nthe appointment process should be deferred until the election season \nwas over. By combining an increasingly divisive appointment process and \na Presidential election that is already underway, he said, ``partisan \nbickering and political posturing'' would overwhelm the serious debate \nnecessary to make such an important decision. He could have been \ntalking about 2016 instead of 1992.\n  This vacancy also presents the American people with a rare \nopportunity to address the direction of the judiciary. The percentage \nof Americans concerned about that direction has risen steadily for \nyears, and while voters do not appoint judges, they do elect the \nPresident who nominates and the Senate that gives advice and consent.\n  Elections, after all, have consequences. The 2012 election had \nconsequences for the President's power to nominate, and the 2014 \nelection had consequences for the Senate's power of advice and consent. \nWith this Supreme Court vacancy on the table, the 2016 election can \nsimilarly have consequences for the American people's voice on this \nimportant issue. Deferring the appointment process also minimizes \npartisanship and maximizes fairness.\n  No one knows the party of the next President, the makeup of the next \nSenate, or the identity of the nominee the Senate will eventually \nconsider. Choosing the appropriate process for the current \ncircumstances, rather than for partisan advantage, can prevent a \nnominee from being perceived as a political pawn.\n  The Constitution leaves nominations to the President and leaves \nadvice and consent to the Senate. That division of responsibility is \nwritten down for all to see and, hopefully, for none to forget.\n  Deferring the process for filling the Scalia vacancy until the next \nPresident takes office and leaving it up to the American people is the \nbest approach for the Senate, the judiciary, and the country.\n  Before I close, I have to say a word about the disgraceful attacks on \nmy friend and colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I \nhave served with him on the Finance Committee for nearly 25 years and \non the Judiciary Committee for 35 years. I have served 40 years on the \nJudiciary Committee but 35 of them have been served with Senator \nGrassley. If anyone knows his own mind, it is Senator Chuck Grassley. \nHe has served on the Judiciary Committee longer than all but four \nSenators in the committee's history. No one is more dedicated to the \nJudiciary Committee and to the Senate than Chuck Grassley is.\n  Each of us is entitled to our own opinions or positions on issues \nthat come before this body, even controversial ones. Each of us can \nfeel as strongly as we want about those issues. But I want to \ncategorically reject the notion that a difference of opinion means that \nsomeone such as Senator Grassley is compromising the integrity or \nindependence of the Judiciary Committee. That comes very close to \nimpugning his character, and that sort of attack is beneath the dignity \nof this body because everybody in this body knows that Chuck Grassley \nis a man of great character, great honesty, great service, hard work, \nand cares for this wonderful country.\n  It is irritating to me to see the personal attacks that have been \nmade. I don't think we should be personally attacking each other. We \ncan find fault with each other. We can criticize each other on the \nissues. We can differ with each other. We can be politically different \nfrom each other, as we are. But to personally attack somebody with the \nprestige of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is beneath the \ndignity of this body, and it is beneath the\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\ndignity of the attackers. It really bothers me.\n  We have had wide differences of opinion on the Judiciary Committee. \nLet's face it: It is a tough committee. It is a very partisan \ncommittee. The Democrats on that side in the committee are extremely \npartisan, and the Republicans on our side of the committee are \nextremely partisan too. That is not necessarily bad as long as people \nare honest and people respect the opinions of others.\n  We can have downright bitter battles and bitter exchanges, but we \ndon't have to malign each other in doing that. It is a tough committee. \nThese are tough issues the Judiciary Committee handles. I know, I was \nchairman of this committee. I have to say it is a wonderful committee, \nand it is probably good that it is a diverse committee where you have a \nlot of liberal Democrats on one side and you have a lot of conservative \nRepublicans on the other. We can bat up against each other, and \nsometimes we even come up with very good legislation.\n  Most of the time, everybody on that committee is concerned about \nhaving the best judges we can possibly get. Even though there have been \nsome pains between various members of the committee from time to time--\nthis naturally occurs when you have people who feel very deeply about \nthese subjects--there is still no excuse for maligning the current \nchairman of this committee, Charles Grassley.\n  I don't think you are winning a debate when you challenge somebody as \na person of the highest integrity that this body has to offer. Senator \nGrassley is one of those persons. There are others here too. I hope I \nam one. The fact is, Chuck Grassley is one of the best people we have \nin the Senate, he is one of the most noble people in the Senate, and he \nis one of the most honest people in the Senate. He is one of the people \nwho are more at ease around the common people in this country and in \nthe State of Iowa than many of us in the Senate, and he is a person of \ndignity and capacity. He is also a person who doesn't forget, and I \nwould prefer to have people treat him with dignity so that he can \nforget.\n  All I can say is that there is not a better person on the committee \nthan Chuck Grassley, and I call on my colleagues on the other side to \nbe gentlemen and to treat him with the respect he certainly deserves. \nThe fact that they disagree with his position on the Supreme Court \nright now is irrelevant in some ways when it comes to characterizing \nhim as somebody less than who he is.\n  That committee is a committee of deep feelings on both sides, and \nthank God it is because that is what makes it a great committee. That \nis what makes it so people really want to be on it. We have really good \ndebates in that committee, and we have really good people on both \nsides, not the least of whom is Chuck Grassley, and I want him treated \nwith dignity and respect. I want people to know that he doesn't take \npositions he doesn't believe in. There are some who do in this body, \nbut he doesn't.\n  I expect people in this body to show the proper decorum, to show \nfriendship even when we have deep differences. Show respect for \nsomebody who certainly deserves it. I hope we don't have any more of \nthis idle chatter that can destroy any kind of rapport we have in the \nSenate, and that goes for both sides. Senator Grassley is being \nmaligned unfairly, and I don't like it and neither would anybody else \nwho has any brains or any thought about what is decent and honorable.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I rise today to share my support for the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2015.\n  This legislation, of course, that we have been debating for well over \na week now aims to address the growing drug addiction crisis facing our \ncountry by not only promoting prevention and education, but by \nincreasing efforts to improve treatment and recovery for those who have \nfallen to this growing epidemic.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that from 2002 \nto 2013, the number of heroin-related overdose deaths nearly \nquadrupled, with approximately 8,200 deaths in 2013. The CDC \nfurthermore found that 44 people die every day due to prescription drug \noverdoses.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that the abuse of \nalcohol, illegal drugs, and tobacco costs the United States roughly \n$700 billion every year because of increased criminal activity, loss of \nemployment, and health care costs associated with drug use.\n  Colorado, unfortunately, is no exception to the increase in drug \noverdose deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports \nthat drug overdose deaths in Colorado have risen in every single county \nexcept for one over the last 12 years. The Colorado Health Institute \nfound that Colorado's 2014 rate of 16.3 drug-related deaths per 100,000 \npeople exceeded the U.S. average of 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people. \nThis same study by the Colorado Health Institute found that drug \noverdose deaths climbed 68 percent in Colorado between 2002 and 2014--a \n68-percent increase in drug overdose deaths in 12 years.\n  The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism found that \nnearly 23 million adults in the United States have struggled with drug \nuse. However, the National Institutes of Health found that only 10 \npercent of U.S. adults who need treatment are receiving it. So only 2.3 \nmillion people out of the 23 million they have identified with some \nkind of a drug use problem--only 10 percent, 2.3 million out of the 23 \nmillion--are receiving some kind of treatment.\n  So what are we going to do to move forward from here? We are on an \nunsustainable path when it comes to addiction and when it comes to its \ntreatment.\n  It is imperative that States are empowered with the resources needed \nto address the unique needs of each individual State, and the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act does just that. The bill \nleaves behind the idea that the one-size-fits-all program out of \nWashington, DC, can fix everything. It encourages States to develop \ntheir own strategies because what works in Colorado may not work in New \nJersey and what works in New York may not work in Texas or California.\n  It encourages these strategies to prevent, treat, and reduce the \ngrowing addiction epidemic by, No. 1, creating an interagency task \nforce to develop best practices for prescribing pain medication and \npain management. The CDC found in a National Survey on Drug Use and \nHealth conducted from 2011 to 2013 that individuals addicted to opiate \npainkillers are 40 times more likely to be addicted to heroin. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2012, health \ncare providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid pain \nrelievers. That is nearly one bottle of pills for every single \nAmerican--certainly every single American adult.\n  It is absolutely imperative that best practices are established to \nensure health professionals are being trained properly to identify \npatients who require prescription pain relievers for chronic pain \nmanagement and those who do not, in an effort to treat this system and \nto better identify.\n  The consequences of this addiction, we have seen in our communities, \nare devastating to individuals and their families. It is vital that \nStates establish best practices to minimize the devastating effects \nthat our communities have seen and our families have seen.\n  No. 2, this bill expands disposal sites for unwanted prescription \nmedications. Community pharmaceutical drug take-back programs, as they \nare called, allow individuals to dispose of unwanted or expired \nmedications in a safe and responsible way. Many households in our \ncountry don't safely and securely store unused pharmaceutical \nmedications, leaving open the door for abuse by teenagers and young \nadults who might find the prescription drugs, the unused or expired \npharmaceuticals--they might find them in the household.\n  According to the CDC, the abuse of prescription drugs has become the \nsecond leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 25 \nto 64.\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\nFurthermore, the abuse is strongly linked to heroin addiction.\n  According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, four out of five \nnew heroin users started with prescription medications. Unfortunately, \nthe vast majority of medication take-back programs in Colorado are in \nthe Denver metro area, but we are not simply dealing with a metro \nproblem. Getting unused drugs out of the communities eliminates the \npotential for misuse and decreases drastically the potential for \naddiction. The expansion of these programs is a step in the right \ndirection to reduce the accessibility of dangerous prescription \nmedication, especially in rural Colorado.\n  Third, this legislation also aims to identify and to treat \nincarcerated individuals who suffer from addiction by implementing \nmedication-assisted treatment programs for use by criminal justice \nagencies. Statistics show that imprisonment has a small impact on \nfuture drug use when addiction goes untreated. The National Association \nof Drug Court Professionals found that 95 percent of those who \ncommitted drug-related crimes returned to drug abuse after release from \nprison. We know that addiction is treatable, and it is important that \nthese individuals have access to addiction and recovery services so \nthat they don't continue to cycle in and out of our Nation's prisons.\n  I would like to share a success story from an adult recovery program \nin the Denver area about a young woman who went to a treatment facility \nto turn her life around. I am not using her real name.\n  Sarah was admitted to our program in Denver in September of 2015. \nOutside of the first week, she has been clean and sober. Sarah found a \njob and has received positive performance reports, and she also \nreceived a raise at the place of employment she sought out after \ntreatment. She has begun to do additional volunteer work in her spare \ntime as a way to give back to her community that took care of her \nthrough these programs. She has reconnected with her family. \nRemembering every holiday since she started this program, Sarah reports \nthat it is the first time she can remember being sober for that \nholiday. She reports that she is loving her life and that there is no \nturning back for her.\n  This bill will create more of these success stories to help people \nget back on their feet, to reconnect with their families, to engage in \ncommunity service, and to receive raises at work because they do a good \njob when they make sure their addiction is broken.\n  Fourth, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act takes a step in \nthe right direction by strengthening prescription drug monitoring \nprograms aimed to identify and treat drug-seeking individuals. State \nelectronic databases that collect data on substances dispensed \nthroughout the State have been incredibly effective in tracking the \nmovement of prescription opiates throughout the country. Utilizing \nthese programs allows States to identify drug diversion, prescription \ndrug fraud, doctor shopping, and forgery. Prescription drug monitoring \nprograms also identify drug-seeking individuals more easily to get them \ninto treatment facilities so they can receive the care they need, just \nas Sarah did in Denver. Tracking and minimizing drug diversion is \nabsolutely vital, and this legislation takes a step in the right \ndirection to strengthen this policy.\n  As we talk about this legislation, I think it is important that we \nhave these stories that have been told on the Senate floor about what \nhas happened to friends and family members, about drug overdose and \nopioid abuse, about heroin addiction, the fact that we had doctor \nshopping, and the fact that we had forgery of prescriptions or perhaps \nunused drugs sitting around somebody's house without a take-back \nprogram. Improper ways to dispose of it mean that teenagers and young \nadults are getting their hands on it. We recognize in these stories \nthat it is not just the metro area, not just our urban centers that are \nfacing these challenges. In fact, it was recently reported in the \nDenver Post under this headline: ``Drug overdose deaths hit record \nlevels in rural southern Colorado.'' There is a comment from the San \nLuis Valley Behavioral Health Group. The San Luis Valley is in \nsouthwestern Colorado, in the Western Slope of Colorado.\n  ``We are getting more referrals for heroin, along with prescription \ndrug abuse,'' said Kristina Daniel, chief operating officer of the San \nLuis Valley Behavioral Health Group. ``We have a need for services in \nour area for sure.''\n  Among Colorado counties, the most striking increase in drug deaths \noccurred in Baca County in the southeast part of the State, an \nagriculture community bordering the Presiding Officer's home State of \nOklahoma. They are talking about the death rate having quintupled in 12 \nyears. This is a small rural community bordering both Kansas and \nOklahoma in the corner of our State--a rural community that has seen \nits death rates quintuple in 12 years. The amount of hardship that has \nbeen placed on families and friends is unimaginable and unacceptable. \nWith this legislation we can help work through these challenges to \novercome them and to start putting an end to the tragedies that we have \ntalked about now for this past week, because this is an epidemic in our \ncountry. Drug overdose and heroin opioid abuse don't discriminate \nagainst race, gender, or economic status. It has hit some of the most \nunsuspecting in our country.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues to support this broadly bipartisan \nlegislation. I heard overwhelming support from my constituency in \nColorado. Everyone from local law enforcement, families, victims of \naddiction, recovery specialists, and mental health providers have \njoined together to voice their support.\n  I would like to commend my colleagues Senators Portman and Ayotte for \ntheir extensive efforts to advocate on behalf of those who do not have \na voice. I am proud to join my colleagues, and I urge the Senate to \nsupport this legislation.\n\n\n                    Honoring Corporal Nate Carrigan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Corporal Nate \nCarrigan and the work of Master Patrol Deputy Kolby Martin and Captain \nMark Hancock of the Park County Sheriff's Office.\n  On the morning of February 24, while serving an eviction notice, the \nresident of the home they were serving the eviction notice to opened \nfire on the officers. Master Patrol Deputy Martin and Captain Hancock \nsuffered injuries from the exchange and Corporal Carrigan tragically \nlost his life. Combined, these three men had served the citizens of \nPark County for over 35 years.\n  Corporal Carrigan was a pillar of the Park County community. His work \nled to the successful conclusion of many cases during his time with the \nsheriff's office. Park County was always home for him, growing up among \nthe green hills and blue skies of Colorado, where he took on the role \nof serving his community.\n  As a teenager, he was a wrestler and the catcher for the Platte \nCanyon High School baseball team. Twenty years later he was coaching \nthe same baseball team he had played on, and he was the assistant coach \nfor the high school football team. It was the future of his community \nthat he cared so deeply for and that he stood ready on that thin blue \nline to protect.\n  Residents of this small town recognize the value and importance of a \nclose-knit community. It provides a source of comfort and strength \nduring a difficult time such as this. In this quiet mountain town, \ncolleagues, store owners, and schoolmates are often friends and \nneighbors as well. They come together to lift one another up as they \nhonor a member who has fallen in service. It is a place where those \nsurrounding you naturally feel like family.\n  The officers who were dispatched with Corporal Carrigan were not only \ncoworkers but friends and even coaches of the very same sporting teams. \nThis loss reminds us of the difficult and dangerous situations that our \nfirst responders are placed into each and every day.\n  My deepest sympathy is with those at the Park County Sheriff's Office \nwho not only lost a team member but a comrade as well and to Corporal \nCarrigan's loved ones who are mourning the loss of a friend and family \nmember so near and dear to their hearts. We honor law enforcement, who, \nin the spirit of selfless sacrifice, honor their communities through \ntheir service. Their work to protect our State never finishes, their \nbravery never waivers, and our gratitude will never cease.\n\n[[Page S1337]]\n\n  This is the second time in a week that I have come down to the floor \nand mourned the loss of a brave law enforcement officer in Colorado, \nand I pray that we never have to do this again.\n  Our prayers go to Corporal Carrigan's family.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I wish to speak for 5 to 10 minutes \nabout an important matter, and so I appreciate being recognized.\n  Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is postcloture on the substitute \namendment to the CARA bill.\n  Mr. WICKER. We will let the time run on that issue.\n\n\n                          Alzheimer's Disease\n\n  Madam President, at this point I wish to talk about Alzheimer's and \nan opportunity that we have to cure this most serious disease. We could \nfind a cure for Alzheimer's, Madam President and my colleagues, and we \ncould do it through American ingenuity.\n  No obstacle has ever been too great for American ingenuity. We have \ndefied seemingly impossible odds in the past. We have eradicated polio \nfrom the entire North American Continent and from most of the globe. We \nhave mapped the human genome. We have been to the Moon. We are going to \nsend somebody to Mars. We can conquer Alzheimer's.\n  Alzheimer's was first discovered more than a century ago. When you \nthink about it, we only began human flight about 100 years ago. Think \nof what we have done in human flight. It just boggles the imagination.\n  We need to cure Alzheimer's here at the beginning of the second \ncentury of this disease. We have made progress in understanding the \ndisease. Yet we still do not know how to stop it. We don't know how to \nslow it, and we certainly don't know how to prevent it from happening.\n  Alzheimer's continues to cause profound human suffering. It affects 5 \nmillion Americans who have the disease, but not only them. It takes a \ntoll on family and friends forced to watch their loved ones slip away. \nI could tell you from personal experience I know what I am talking \nabout.\n  Last month Time magazine featured Alzheimer's on the cover: ``A \nradical new drug could change old age,'' ``The Longevity Issue.'' There \nis an article in here entitled ``Alzheimer's from a New Angle.'' I \nthink we need a new angle to address Alzheimer's in using innovative \ndrug trials, as the magazine indicates, but also in a new angle \nconcerning the use of prize competitions. I propose that Congress \nshould look at Alzheimer's from the angle of using the XPRIZE \nFoundation and using a suggestion that has been endorsed by a number of \norganizations that have thought long and hard about this.\n  I introduced the EUREKA Act last fall as a way to reinvigorate the \nfight against Alzheimer's and related dementias. EUREKA stands for \nEnsuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for Alzheimer's--EUREKA. \nWe have found it, and we can find a cure for Alzheimer's. This bill \ncould be the beginning of finding a cure.\n  Finding a cure is our ultimate goal, but it will take steps to get \nthere. My bill would create prize competitions to reward breakthroughs \nin Alzheimer's research. I want to assure my colleagues who are very \ninterested in NIH funding that EUREKA would not be a substitute for any \ndollars that are going to current research funding for Alzheimer's. \nThat would continue, it ought to continue, and we ought to do whatever \nwe can to expand that.\n  EUREKA would be in addition to what we are doing at the National \nInstitutes of Health. Prizes would be awarded for a number of \nadvancements, perhaps drug treatments to early detection methods. The \nbest part is there would be nothing for us to lose because with a prize \ncompetition you pay only for success. Without success, the American \ntaxpayer pays nothing when it comes to the EUREKA bill.\n  I am grateful for the bipartisan support that my bill has already \nreceived in the Senate. Thirty-five of our colleagues have sponsored \nthe bill. I believe by the end of the day I will be able to announce \n36. I hope even more will lend their support. Alzheimer's is certainly \nnot a partisan issue. It is a national issue and one of the great \nchallenges of our time, not only from a human standpoint but from a \nbudget standpoint.\n  Alzheimer's is a major spending issue. It is responsible for $226 \nbillion a year. The estimates are that by the year 2050, those costs \nwill be $1 trillion per year. We have a $19 trillion debt right now. \nThink of the additional debt that will be piled up unless we tackle \nthis issue and get to a cure. Think of the savings. Think of the other \nareas we would be able to address if we didn't spend so much of our \nMedicaid budget on Alzheimer's patients, so much of our Medicare budget \non Alzheimer's patients.\n  Experts say $2 billion in research funding is needed to prevent and \ntreat Alzheimer's by the year 2025. This remains the goal of the \nAlzheimer's plan, and it remains my goal, but that is a much higher \nnumber than we can afford at the NIH level right now.\n  However, by fostering public-private partnerships, as the EUREKA bill \nwould do, we could build on current resources in new and exciting ways. \nThese partnerships would help unleash the power of American innovation \nand the power of American competition to encourage people from \ndifferent backgrounds and sectors to work together in pursuit of a \nlife-changing discovery. This could work. Prize competitions have \nworked in the past. When Charles Lindbergh achieved a nonstop flight \nbetween New York and Paris, he won a $25,000 prize and helped inspire \nthe aviation industry that we know today.\n  Another example of success in this concept is the XPRIZE. The \ncompetition is currently sponsored by the XPRIZE Foundation. The XPRIZE \nFoundation has been promoting technological breakthroughs for more than \ntwo decades. In 2004 it offered $10 million for the first reusable \nmanned spacecraft. This XPRIZE competition generated $100 million in \ninvestments by competitors. A $10 million prize generated $100 million \nin investments by competitors. In 2011, a skimmer that accelerates the \ncleanup of oilspills was awarded a $1 million XPRIZE.\n  So this can work and it will work if we give it a chance. The bottom \nline is that we need America's best and brightest minds working on \nAlzheimer's right away. We need a way to reward success. Deaths from \nAlzheimer's are on the rise. Its costs already exceed those for cancer \nand heart disease. Think about that. The costs for Alzheimer's per year \nexceeds the cost for heart disease and cancer put together. So we need \nto put our emphasis where the need is.\n  I thank all of the organizations that have come together and endorsed \nthis concept. I thank my friends at the XPRIZE Foundation. They stood \nwith me last fall and endorsed this concept. This legislation was \ndesigned with the help of the XPRIZE Foundation, in consultation with \nthe XPRIZE Foundation, and they know what they are talking about. I \nthank the foundation for doing that.\n  I also thank the following organizations that have endorsed this \nconcept and specifically endorsed the EUREKA bill: a group called \nUsAgainstAlzheimer's, the Alzheimer's Association, the Alzheimer's \nFoundation of America, the BrightFocus Foundation, the MIND Center at \nthe University of Mississippi Medical Center in my capital city of \nJackson, and also a group called Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's \nDisease. They all agree that by unleashing this--the concept of a prize \ncompetition--we can cure Alzheimer's disease and I hope we will try. \nThis bill is generating support and dialogue for finally putting an end \nto this devastating disease.\n  Let's pass this bipartisan legislation.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, as we consider the CARA bill on the \nfloor at this time--the bill that deals with the opioid epidemic in our \ncountry--I\n\n[[Page S1338]]\n\nthought it might be useful to bring a few statistics forward so we can \nconsider the nature of the epidemic we are dealing with.\n  In 2014, 29,267 people died from prescription opioid and heroin \noverdoses in our country, with 10,574 of those people dying from \nheroin. That is a 28-percent increase from 2013. Can I say that again? \nThere was a 28-percent increase in heroin deaths in our country in 1 \nyear. That is the trendline we are talking about with this epidemic.\n  Deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl increased 79 percent from \n2013 to 2014. Can I say that again? A synthetic opioid, fentanyl, had \nan increase of 79 percent in deaths from 2013 to 2014.\n  Here is another statistic: Today's young White adults age 25 to 34 \nare experiencing the highest death rates since the Vietnam war. Can I \nsay that again? White adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are \nexperiencing the highest death rates since the Vietnam war.\n  In 2014, an estimated 1.9 million people had an opioid use disorder \nrelated to prescription pain relievers and an estimated 586,000 had an \nopioid use disorder related to heroin use.\n  This is the profile of the epidemic we have in our country right now.\n  In the 5-year period between 2008 and 2013, overdose deaths from \nprescription painkillers and heroin combined increased 37 percent.\n  In 2010, enough opioid painkillers were sold to medicate every \nAmerican adult with a typical dose of hydrocodone every 4 hours for 1 \nmonth.\n  In 2012, health care providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for \nopioid painkillers--enough for every American adult in our country to \nhave a bottle of opioid painkillers in 2012. Can I say that again? \nEnough of these opioid painkillers were prescribed so that every adult \ncould have a bottle on their shelf in 2012.\n  Pick a number of how many 10-milligram opioid painkillers were \napproved by the Drug Enforcement Agency in the year 2014. Just pick a \nnumber in your brain of how many pills were authorized to be \nmanufactured in our country in 2014. Just pick a number in your brain \nof 10-milligram pills, of opioids. Here is the answer. You were wrong. \nThe number is 14 billion 10 milligram-equivalent pills that were \nauthorized to be manufactured in our country by the Federal \nGovernment--by the Drug Enforcement Agency--in the year 2014.\n  Again, all this is part of the recipe. Stir well, ignore it for about \n15 years, and let our country finally recognize that there is an \nepidemic in their house, on their street, with their relative, with \ntheir friend that should never have happened because we know what the \ncause of this issue is.\n  This unparalleled rise in overdose deaths in the United States \nparallels a fourfold increase from 1999 to 2010 in the sale of opioid \npainkillers. We know there has been a tripling in the number of \noverdose deaths from 1999 to 2012 in our country, but we also know \nthis: America is only 5 percent of the world's population, and yet we \nnow consume 80 percent of all of the opioid painkillers on the planet.\n  Again, this is not some big puzzle in terms of what has caused this \nproblem. This is all very simple, easy-to-understand stuff that \nordinary families have been grappling with, especially over the last 10 \nyears, beginning with their understanding that OxyContin and Percocet \nand all these other drugs that are allegedly ``abuse-deterrent'' in \nfact, when they are swallowed pursuant to a prescription, if done on an \nextended basis, can cause an addiction that is worse than the \nunderlying problem of the individual taking these painkillers.\n  Roughly 480,000 emergency room visits in 2011 were attributable to \nthe misuse and abuse of opioid painkillers in our country--488,000 \nemergency room visits on that one issue.\n  The prescription painkiller epidemic is killing more women than ever \nbefore, and it is estimated that about 18 women die every day from a \nprescription painkiller overdose.\n  The numbers are staggering.\n  We should create a requirement that if the DEA is going to license \nphysicians to prescribe opioids--and every physician in America must go \nto the DEA to get a license--if they are going to be allowed to \nprescribe, the physician must prove he or she has been educated to do \nso.\n  Two years ago, the FDA authorized their voluntary education program \nfor physicians. Pick a number in your mind of what percentage of all \nphysicians in America have taken advantage of a voluntary education \nprogram for opioids. You are wrong, whatever number you just picked. \nOnly 12 percent of all physicians have actually taken the voluntary \neducation program.\n  The FDA continues to authorize new opioids on the market without even \nhaving an expert advisory panel to deal with the issue, even as the DEA \ncontinues to authorize 14 billion 10-milligram pills per year.\n  This issue is one that we have to deal with. We should have physician \neducation. We should have tighter standards for what the FDA does in \nallowing for new drugs to go out on the market. We have to ensure that \nthey are safe, and we have to ensure there is a proper understanding of \ntheir abuse potential. We have to have a day of reckoning with the \ncosts of all of this.\n  We have to make sure that the funding level is there for families who \nare already suffering. We have to provide the help for them. We just \nhave to. This is an epidemic that was largely created at the Federal \nlevel, largely created by physicians and pharmaceutical companies. It \nis time for us to finally begin to provide the help these families so \ndesperately need.\n  Here is what I know most: It will not even be those who have the \nproblem right now, although those families will get the help they need; \nit is all the families who will never need the help because we did put \nthe right recipe on the books. We did put the right prevention measures \non the books. We did put the preventative measures on the books so that \ntheir families never even knew this day arrived in their history.\n  I hope as we go through this whole process that we can keep those \nthoughts in mind. That is what we can do from the Federal Government. \nWe should strive to do this. We should try our best to stand up and \nprovide the help that these families need at the local level.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am in strong support of the \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and its supplemental funding \namendment. I have to say I wish we weren't in this position today. I \nwish we didn't have a persistent and growing drug epidemic in this \ncountry that is ravaging our communities and tearing apart our \nfamilies.\n  The issue of opioid abuse and heroin addiction is not a Republican or \nDemocratic issue. It is an American issue. It touches every corner of \nour society: wealthy, middle class, and poor; rural, urban, and \nsuburban; moms, dads, children, and grandchildren; our friends and our \nneighbors.\n  It is devastating that today more Americans are dying from drug \noverdoses than from car accidents. In looking at the facts, there are \ntwo things we can point our finger to: prescription opioid painkillers \nand heroin. Prescription opioids are increasingly to blame for overdose \ndeaths. These drugs include hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine, to \nname a few. Their numbers are hard to believe--in 2014, 6.5 million \nAmericans over the age of 12 abused controlled substance medications. \nThe second factor, heroin, is even worse in what it has done to our \nNation. Heroin use has increased 79 percent nationwide in just 5 years.\n  These two factors are connected. When people are injured and \nprescribed painkillers, what is given as help for pain can easily \nbecome an addiction. These painkillers are frequently and liberally \ndistributed by medical practitioners for all kinds of issues--acute \npain, PTSD, recovery from surgery, recovery from accidents, the list \ngoes on.\n  However, when those prescriptions run out but the addiction has \nalready set in, people turn to heroin for their fix. Why heroin? Heroin \nprovides similar effects to the drugs they are already taking, is \nhighly addictive, and readily available on the street. It is also \nincredibly inexpensive--$10 or less for a hit. When you have something \nlike that at your disposal, it is not hard to see how people can \ncontinue their addictions to the point of dying.\n  Every day, 120 Americans are dying as a result of drug overdoses. It \nis time to take a hard look at what we can do to fight back and stop \nthese drugs from\n\n[[Page S1339]]\n\ntaking over our communities. I look to my home State as a prime \nexample.\n  In my home State, we recognize that heroin and opioid abuse are \nserious problems that must be addressed. In recent years, deaths from \nheroin have risen 88 percent. In 2014 alone in Maryland, we had 578 \nheroin-related deaths and 1,070 drug-overdose deaths. This problem \nreaches to the far ends of my State.\n  I met a woman on the Eastern Shore of Maryland who lost everything \nwhen one of her family members became addicted to opioids. He resorted \nto stealing from his family and their family store, and they ended up \ndeclaring for bankruptcy because of his addiction and the consequences \nof it. They lost everything due to one member's addiction, and I can't \nimagine the strength it took to try to put their family back together \nafter all that.\n  We have all heard stories of friends, neighbors, and family that have \nfaced addiction. Some have lost that battle; some have made it to \nrecovery and continue to fight every day. There are examples everywhere \nin our community of both those who have lost their fight and those who, \nwith the help of family and community, have put their lives back \ntogether.\n  When thinking of this problem in Maryland, many people's minds go \ndirectly to Baltimore. I can understand why--Baltimore was once \ncharacterized as the ``heroin capital'' of the U.S. It, too, has \nbattled this problem for too many years, with insufficient results to \nshow. In 2014 alone in Baltimore, 303 people died from drug and alcohol \noverdose. That is more than the number of people who died from \nhomicide.\n  Today in Baltimore, we have 60,000 people addicted to opioids. That \nis 1 in every 10 residents of the city. Baltimore has the highest rate \nof heroin addiction in the country and many more who are abusing \nprescription opioid medication. While people like Dr. Leana Wen, the \ndirector of the Baltimore City Department of Health, have been actively \ntaking steps to turn the tide, there are many more out there who would \nsee this problem continue so they can profit off of it.\n  But this problem is not just about Baltimore, nor is it just about \ndrug addiction. Widespread addiction leads to other problems in \nsociety. Addicts commit crime to get money in order to get drugs, like \ntheft and fraud. Gangs are trafficking and selling these drugs to those \nwho haven't been able to quit. The worst of our society is brought out \nbecause of these drugs and their effects, and those effects are being \nseen in every corner of my State and every level of society.\n  As I have traveled around Maryland meeting with county executives, \nevery single one talked about the problem of heroin and opioid abuse. \nBoth Republicans and Democrats have told me time and time again, they \ncan't solve this problem themselves. They have asked me to help. They \nneed multiple resources to fight. They need everyone standing up \nsaying, ``enough is enough.'' It is time to take back our communities, \nand we can start with this bill and its supplemental funding.\n  This bill does five things that I think will really help us start \ngoing in a more positive direction. First, it expands prevention and \neducational efforts to prevent opioid abuse and promote treatment and \nrecovery. Second, it expands the availability of lifesaving options to \nprovide for first responders and law enforcement to save lives and \nreverse overdoses. Third, the bill expands the resources to treat those \nalready in prison who are suffering from addiction and look at \nalternatives to incarceration for those arrested with substance abuse \nissues. Fourth, it strengthens programs to monitor prescription drugs \nto cut down their widespread misuse and expands disposal sites for \nunwanted medication to keep it out of the hands of our children. Last, \nit creates an interagency task force with experts in all fields to look \nat the best practices for prescribing painkillers.\n  I would like to add that I also support the Shaheen supplemental \nfunding amendment. The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is the \nauthorizing bill here. It makes the promises for services to help \nAmericans in need through education, prevention, and treatment across \ngeographical and economic lines. The Shaheen supplemental amendment is \nthe appropriations that cuts the check for the services. It is tailored \nto the bill, providing $240 million to the Department of Justice and \n$360 million to the Department of Health and Human Services. Both the \nbill and its amendment are needed to get help to Americans and to \nMarylanders who don't have the resources to solve these problems on \ntheir own.\n  We can't enforce our way out of this, and this bill recognizes that. \nWe must look at it from the standpoint of addiction and mental health \nservices as well. The impact that addiction has had on our society has \ncreated an urgent and desperate situation. Both this bill and its \nfunding need to be passed immediately.\n  As chair and vice-chair of the Appropriations Committee, I have \nfought very hard to get funding in the Federal checkbook to help combat \nthis epidemic. Through a bipartisan effort in the fiscal year 2016 \nomnibus, we were able to secure record funds to combat drug abuse and \nprovide services to Americans.\n  As vice chair of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee, \ncracking down was a priority in the omnibus bill. We provided $2.45 \nbillion for the Drug Enforcement Agency, who targets and dismantles \ncriminal narcotics activities and regulates and combats prescription \ndrug abuse. This was a $52 million increase over fiscal year 2015.\n  The Department of Justice received $7 million for anti-heroin task \nforces, $12 million for residential drug treatment grants, $13 million \nfor prescription drug monitoring grants, and $42 million for drug \ncourts.\n  Additionally, we were able to allocate significant funds for \ntreatment and recovery of substance abuse disorders, including \ninstituting some new programs. Funds include: $70 million for the CDC \nPrescription Drug Overdose Prevention program, more than triple the \nFiscal Year 15 level; $12 million for new Substance Abuse & Mental \nHealth Services Administration, SAMHSA, grants to equip first \nresponders with overdose-prevention drugs; $5.6 million for new CDC \nfunding for heroin surveillance; $10 million for new SAMHSA funding to \npromote prevention strategies; and $25 million for SAMHSA medication-\nassisted treatment programs.\n  We recognize that our veterans can suffer more than most in opioid \nabuse, whether from injuries sustained in combat or mental health \nissues when they return. In further protecting our veterans, we added \nreforms at the Veterans Administration. These include adopting the CDC \nguidelines for safe opioid prescriptions for chronic pain, protections \nagainst double-prescribing, establishing a working group focused on \nopioid therapy, ensuring all facilities are prepared with opioid \nblocking drugs, and providing training to all employees that prescribe \ncontrolled substances.\n  Lastly, we required a multiagency report on heroin from the \nDepartment of Justice and 25 other Federal agencies. This report \nincluded recommendations and best practices for combating this crisis \nin our country. These experts said that there is hope to mitigate the \nissue, but that law enforcement and public health must work together to \neducate and intervene with effective treatments. They gave us a road \nmap to take action, and several of their recommendations can be found \nin this bill.\n  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is a first step toward \nstemming the tide of the harm that opioids and heroin have wreaked on \nour country. Along with the appropriations supplemental from Senator \nShaheen, it will provide immediate action and a comprehensive response. \nUnfortunately, my colleagues voted against this amendment, meaning we \nhave to wait another day to put money for these expanded services in \nthe Federal checkbook.\n  This bill recognizes that the problem won't be solved just by the \nFederal Government or local governments acting alone. We must come \ntogether with a multipronged solution working on all levels of \ngovernment and including our allies in the public and private sector.\n  We all share the same goal in this instance. We must do more and do \nbetter to reduce prescription drug abuse, to help those struggling with \naddiction, to keep heroin and opioids out of the hands of children, to \nstop those who are trafficking and selling these dangerous drugs, and \nto better train and\n\n[[Page S1340]]\n\nequip those on the front lines of this battle to save lives. I urge the \nadoption of this bill and I pledge to do my best to provide the Federal \nfunding needed in the appropriations bills for fiscal year 2017.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I was necessarily absent for yesterday's \nvote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Grassley-Leahy amendment \nNo. 3378 to S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Bill. I \nwould have voted yea.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I was necessarily absent for \nyesterday's cloture vote on the Grassley-Leahy amendment No. 3378 in \nthe nature of a substitute to S. 524, the Comprehensive Addiction and \nRecovery Act of 2015. I would have voted yea.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO ZAK BAIG\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today with enormous pride, but \nalso real sadness, to honor one of my most talented and longest serving \nstaff members, Zak Baig, as he departs the Senate and starts an \nexciting new career.\n  Zak has worked his way up the ranks in my office. He started working \nfor me on the House side and in the process has filled almost every \nrole in sight, starting with chief bottle washer and going up from \nthere. He actually started in 2001, shortly after I was elected to the \nU.S. House, as an intern back in Hammond, LA. He did a great job there.\n  In 2002, he was an intern in DC and showed even greater progress and \npromise, and then he came on full time as a legislative correspondent \nat the end of 2002.\n  In 2004, I ran for the U.S. Senate. It was a big undertaking and an \nenormous challenge to take on a statewide campaign. Zak moved onto the \ncampaign side and was in charge of the grassroots effort, which was \nenormously important and helped lead to our success. He truly helped \nguide us to victory that year.\n  After that, as we started working in the Senate, he became an \nintegral member of the Senate staff. In those first 3 years, he served \nas our projects director and then in 2008 became legislative director.\n  In 2013, Zak served as a Republican staff director for the EPW \nCommittee, while I was the ranking Republican.\n  In 2015, after we took the majority and I became chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Zak became the full staff director there, as well \nas acting chief of staff for a period of time.\n  As I said, he has absolutely worked his way up the ranks and merited \neach and every step of the way, doing a better and better job as he \nprogressed. You can tell that in his body of work, which is very \nimpressive and which, of course, I benefited from.\n  At the EPW Committee, as a Republican staff director, Zak helped \nnavigate the legislative waters and shepherd through some major \ninfrastructure legislation in the Senate.\n  At the staff level, he was able to lead the negotiations of the Water \nResources Reform and Development Act of 2014, starting from drafting \nbipartisan legislation with Senator Barbara Boxer and her staff--the \nchair of the committee--to negotiating with the House of \nRepresentatives in conference, to ultimately getting the bill signed \ninto law. It was a major legislative accomplishment. Shortly after \nthat, he turned around and helped do the same thing with the highway \nbill reauthorization.\n  Under his leadership, we also conducted some really important \noversight of the administration, particularly the EPA, the Department \nof Transportation, and other agencies under the jurisdiction of the EPW \nCommittee. When we moved to the majority and chairmanship of the Small \nBusiness Committee, Zak served as staff director, just as, if not more, \neffectively. He helped lead the way as we passed 22 bipartisan bills \nout of the committee in just 1 year, 8 of which have become law. To put \nthat in some perspective, our predecessor on the committee only passed \n10 bills out of the committee over 5 years. So it really was making the \ncommittee work in an effective, bipartisan way--as it should. And just \nin general, in the office Zak was behind a lot of our major efforts and \nachievements and was always effective at whatever he put his mind to.\n  A lot of that success is directly attributed to his never-ending \nenergy, his drive to see things through from start to finish, and, \nmaybe even more importantly, his personality, his attitude, his sense \nof humor, his being able to do tough things and always getting along \nwith those he was occasionally battling with because he always did it \nwith a smile and a friendly attitude, and he probably had a friendly \njoke or two mixed in.\n  It is at that personal level that I am most saddened to say goodbye \nto Zak--at least working with him day to day professionally--although \nwe will obviously keep in close touch.\n  I have been honored to have been a mentor to so many younger folks \nwho have worked in the Senate office. I have been honored to mentor Zak \nthrough the years, and it really has been a personal privilege and \nhonor. Through those years, I have literally seen him grow up from a \nyoung student--a boy, really--to a consummate professional, a wonderful \nhusband, and a great father. I like to think I had a little bit to do \nwith that as well, because Zak met his wonderful wife Wendy when they \nboth worked for me in the Senate office. In fact, their marriage is one \nof four that came out of our Senate office, which, as I look back at my \nservice in the Senate, is probably the statistic and fact I will be \nmost proud of--the young people I helped mentor and served with and \nthose marriages that directly came out of the office.\n  In that sense--through that mentoring and through those years--I \ngained not just a great staff leader but a true and dedicated friend, \nand for that I will always be grateful. It is at that personal level \nthat I will think back about fights, struggles, work, challenges, and a \nlot of jokes and fun we had along the way.\n  In that spirit, I want to leave Zak with three parting gifts. One has \nto do with a day when I carried something with me from committee \nhearing to floor activity and then to actually giving a speech on the \nfloor with it next to me. It is a funny photograph which will not be \ndescribed in more detail. It is perfectly PG-rated, but it is an inside \njoke. After that day, Zak got a hold of that framed photograph, and I \nthink it has been completely destroyed. But there was a file of the \noriginals involved, and so I will hand that to him as a parting gift as \npart of the inside joke.\n  On another occasion, commemorating his enormous devotion to Syracuse \nsports--he went to Syracuse as an undergraduate--a prized basketball of \nhis was hijacked. This was a basketball signed by Coach Jim Boeheim \nafter their national championship season in 2003. It was hijacked and \nmoved locations. It sent ransom notes from all around the country for \nquite a protracted period before Zak got it back.\n  I was going to have the basketball with me to help tell the story \ntoday only to find out that it has been hijacked again. So my second \nparting gift to Zak is to get in contact with the abductors and return \nthe prized basketball for yet a second time.\n  The third, and probably the most important parting gift, is to give \nZak the true credit he deserves. One fight I took on in the last \nseveral years is to have Members and staff health care handled \nappropriately as was intended under ObamaCare--the so-called Washington \nexemption of ObamaCare--ending that. I just want to give Zak full and \npublic credit that that crusade and idea was really his and his alone--\nnot.

Madam President, Antonin Scalia entered the world \nas the son and grandson of Italian immigrants in 1936. When he \nunexpectedly departed this life last month, he was the patriarch of a \nlarge American family and the intellectual father of the most important \nlegal movement in generations. Between those points, he lived an \nextraordinarily full life that helped shaped the course of our country.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1341, March 8, 2016, in the middle of the first column, \nthe following language appears: REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA \nMr. RUBIO. Madam President, . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: REMEMBERING \nJUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  By 1980, Scalia had already accomplished more at the age of 44 than \nmost can ever hope to in a lifetime. He had been a distinguished \nlawyer, served at the highest levels of the government, and taught at \nthe country's best law schools. He might have continued to develop a \nreputation as the Nation's brightest law professor and scholar, but \nprovidence had still more to ask of him.\n  Upon his election, President Ronald Reagan came to Washington with a \nmission to restore a country that seemed divided and in decline. He \npromised to rebuild our military, revive our economy, and restore our \nsense of purpose. Just as critical as these efforts, Reagan was \ndetermined to bring new life to our Founders' vision of our \nConstitution, which provided for carefully limited government, \nseparation of powers, and the rule of law. In accordance with that \ndetermination, Reagan appointed Scalia first to the critical D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals and then to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. The three-decade judicial career that followed would establish \nJustice Scalia as one of the most influential American jurists--and one \nof the most consequential Americans--in our Nation's history.\n  The Federal judiciary that Scalia joined in 1982 had, for too long, \nboth abused and shirked its proper role. It had stripped the American \npeople and their elected representatives of their legitimate powers by \ninventing brand-new ``constitutional rights'' practically out of thin \nair. Just as troubling, it had failed to uphold the very real \nconstitutional limits on government. The courts too often treated the \ntext of statutes as mere suggestions and often appointed themselves as \na kind of super-legislature.\n  Scalia would not stand for this. He saw this prevailing approach of \njudges as an abuse of power and a threat to a free and self-governing \npeople. For Scalia, the rule of law was the touchstone of liberty, and \njudges had an important role in upholding it. He understood that \nAmerica has a written Constitution for clear reasons: to restrict \ngovernment and preserve liberty. As a judge, Scalia insisted that the \nConstitution be applied as written and originally understood, not \nfreely interpreted by unelected judges. If the Constitution must \nchange, as it has needed to throughout our history, the document itself \noffers an amendment process.\n  Justice Scalia had a sharp and well-articulated legal philosophy that \nput the text and meaning of the Constitution and law front and center. \nA judge, Scalia believed, must put aside his policy preferences in \norder to say what the law is. ``The judge who always likes the results \nhe reaches is a bad judge,'' he said.\n  Justice Scalia lived out this approach on the bench. His majority \nopinions established clear and well-articulated precedents. His sharp \nand colorful dissents brilliantly exposed moments when too many of his \ncolleagues preferred to put policy preferences and outcomes above the \nConstitution and the rule of law. For conservatives, the words ``Scalia \ndissents'' always offered a silver lining--they meant that a likely \ndamaging legal precedent would at least come prepackaged with a \nwonderfully readable corrective.\n  Whether he was on the majority or minority side of a decision, the \nforceful logic and clear phrasing of Scalia's opinions commanded \nattention and engagement. Over time, his most reliable intellectual \nadversaries found themselves increasingly forced to fight on the ground \nhe established. While Justice Scalia did not win every argument, he \nchanged the conversation forever. Judicial activism no longer has a \nfree hand because Scalia challenged it and inspired an entire \ngeneration of legal minds to follow his example.\n  His judicial writing alone would have changed American law and \nadvanced the cause of liberty, but Justice Scalia went further than \nthat. He wrote books, lectured, and mentored students. He traveled \naround the country, engaged the media, and debated colleagues and \ncritics. His many law clerks now distinguish themselves throughout the \nlegal profession. The Federalist Society, which he helped nurture in \nits fledgling years, now provides a lively forum for a variety of \nconservative and libertarian perspectives on law. Antonin Scalia has \nleft us a legal culture absolutely transformed from the one he found.\n  Justice Scalia's judicial opinions, legal philosophy, and forceful \nadvocacy for the rule of law inspired me as a law student and continue \nto inspire me to this day. While a wide array of life experiences and \nvalues have shaped the way I see America and the world, Antonin Scalia \nhas been the single most important influence on my view of the \nConstitution and the proper role of judges in our Republic as men and \nwomen who should put the original meaning of our Constitution ahead of \ntheir policy preferences.\n  Justice Scalia's life is a testimony to the fact that ideas matter. \nIt is proof that a person of principle, with the willingness to invest \nin debate and persuasion, can change history. His life also reminds us \nof another important truth. Particularly in these sharply divided \npartisan times, we can lose sight of the fact that the things that \nunite us are more important than the things that divide us. Justice \nScalia never did. He knew the Constitution was his sole guide in his \nprofessional life, but he was also a devout Catholic who accepted that \nGod has a plan for all of us. He took evident joy in living out his \nfaith, in loving his family, and in nurturing countless friendships, \neven with his ideological foes. We should all be grateful that God's \nplan for our Nation, especially the people whose paths he crossed, \nincluded having Justice Scalia on the Court for the past 30 years. He \nwas a role model for all of us and particularly for Christians in \npublic life.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I led a bipartisan group of colleagues in filing \nan amicus brief in the Supreme Court. The brief, submitted in the case \nof Town of Greece v. Galloway, defended the practice of legislative \nprayer. It argued that the original meaning of the First Amendment \nclearly did not require the purging of religious expression from the \npublic square. I attended the oral argument in the case and will \nforever be grateful for having had the opportunity to watch Justice \nScalia's sharp and incisive questioning from the bench.\n  Although I did not have the good fortune to get to know Justice \nScalia personally, he had a profound impact on me. All those who \ncherish the Constitution and limited government mourn this great loss. \nJustice Scalia was a brilliant legal mind who served with honor, \ndistinction, and only one legal objective: to interpret and defend the \nConstitution as written. He is a model for exactly what his successor \nand all future Justices should strive to be on the highest Court in the \nland.\n\n[[Page S1342]]\n\n  Antonin Scalia left us far too soon, but his legacy will remain with \nus as long as we remain a republic under law.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S1342, March 8, 2016, at the top of the first column, \nthe following language appears: REMEMBERING JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA \n. . . a republic under law.\n  \nThe online Record has been corrected to read: . . . a republic under \nlaw.\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, it is an honor to pay tribute to the \nlate Justice Antonin Scalia. Justice Scalia was a staunch defender of \nthe Constitution who, above all, sought to uphold the original meaning \nof its text. He steadfastly adhered to his oath of office, which \ndirected him to ``administer justice without respect to persons, [to] \ndo equal right to the poor and to the rich, and [to] faithfully and \nimpartially discharge and perform all [his] duties . . . under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.'' In doing so, he \nrecognized this approach to judicial interpretation might conflict with \npopular opinion. As Justice Scalia once stated: ``If you're going to be \na good and faithful judge, you have to resign yourself to the fact that \nyou're not always going to like the conclusions you reach. If you like \nthem all the time, you're probably doing something wrong.''\n  A few years ago, I had the privilege of visiting the Supreme Court to \nlisten to oral arguments in the case of National Labor Relations Board \nv. Noel Canning, which concerned the scope of the President's authority \nto make recess appointments. I recall being struck by Justice Scalia's \nprobing questions and his ability to immediately get to the crux of an \nissue; yet Justice Scalia never lacked civility when making an \nargument. As he once said, ``I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And \nsome very good people have some very bad ideas.''\n  Justice Scalia was known for more than his jurisprudence. The son of \nimmigrants and the first Italian American to serve on the Supreme \nCourt, he is remembered by many for his strong belief in the American \ndream. A former law clerk recalled how he introduced Justice Scalia to \nhis grandfather, a Holocaust survivor. The clerk's grandfather was \nnervous to meet a member of the Court, but Scalia embraced the man. He \nsaid he was honored to meet a man who represented everything that made \nhim proud to be an American.\n  Justice Scalia was also a loving husband to Maureen, his wife of 56 \nyears, and the father of nine children and many grandchildren. Scalia \noften noted that his wife deserved all the credit for their children's \naccomplishments. Each year, the ranks of Scalia alumni would grow, and \nhe would visit with each of them and their families, even nicknaming \ntheir children as his ``grandclerks.'' Justice Scalia was also a man of \nfaith and looked to the Roman Catholic Church as a guiding force in his \nlife. One of the Justice's former law clerks recalled that Scalia's \nfaith inspired the clerk to deepen his own embrace of religion.\n  Scalia loved hunting, the opera, anchovy pizza, and red wine. He was \nknown for taking law clerks to lunch at A.V. Ristorante, an Italian \nrestaurant in Washington that has since closed down. He insisted they \norder anchovy pizza and red wine, and he was said to be dismayed when a \nclerk declined one or the other. After A.V. Ristorante closed, he would \nlead clerks in a hunt for a worthy replacement.\n  Of course, as Justice Breyer once noted, Justice Scalia ``loved \nnothing better than a great argument.'' Although he frequently \ndisagreed with his colleagues on the Court, Justice Scalia formed deep \nbonds and friendships with his fellow Justices and respected their \nviews. As Justice Breyer recalled:\n\n       We both would hope that the audience of students or \n     senators would leave not with a better sense of who was \n     right, but with a greater respect for the institution we \n     represented. They would see that sometimes we disagreed, that \n     we nonetheless understood and paid attention to each other's \n     points of view, that those views were serious views, and that \n     we were friends. And we were good friends.\n\n  When Justice Elena Kagan joined the Supreme Court the two became \nhunting buddies. A few times a year, they would go hunting together to \nenjoy a shared appreciation for this sport. But it was his deep \nfriendship with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that was well known to \nmany. She stated recently: ``How blessed I was to have a friend of such \nbrilliance, high spirits, and quick wit . . . we were different, yes, \nyet one in our reverence for the court and its place in the U.S. system \nof governance.''\n  Justice Scalia will be remembered for his brilliant legal mind and \nfaithful dedication to the Constitution. We will also remember his \nhumor, his spirituality, his love for his family, and his ability to \nfind common ground even in the face of disagreement. Let us pray for \nhis family and friends as we proudly celebrate his service to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, on February 13, 2016, the Supreme \nCourt not only lost one of its Justices, our Nation lost a true legal \ngiant.\n  Justice Antonin Scalia was described by his colleagues as \n``extraordinary,'' ``treasured,'' and ``a stylistic genius.'' Beyond \nhis unwavering dedication to upholding the originalist viewpoint of the \nConstitution, Justice Scalia was also whole-heartedly committed to his \nfamily. He was a husband, father of nine, and grandfather to 36 \ngrandchildren. His son Paul said of him during his homily that ``God \nblessed Dad with a love for his family . . . He was the father that God \ngave us for the great adventure of family life . . . He loved us, and \nsought to show that love. And sought to share the blessing of the faith \nhe treasured. And he gave us one another, to have each other for \nsupport. That's the greatest wealth parents can bestow, and right now \nwe are particularly grateful for it.''\n  Justice Scalia was nominated to the United States Supreme Court in \n1986 by President Reagan and was confirmed by the Senate in a unanimous \nvote. While his time on the Court often led to criticism of his legal \nopinions and colorful dissents, he remained respected by his \ncolleagues, even those at the opposite end of the judicial spectrum. \nThis is a sign of true character--to have the ability to have an open, \nhonest debate about a particular issue, while respecting the individual \nperson holding an opinion different from your own.\n  Justice Scalia said, ``I attack ideas. I don't attack people. And \nsome very good people have some very bad ideas. And if you can't \nseparate the two, you gotta get another day job.''\n  This sentiment was best portrayed through his friendship with Justice \nGinsburg. Of her friend, she said, ``We are different, we are one. \nDifferent in our interpretation of written texts, one in our reverence \nfor the Constitution and the institution we serve. From our years \ntogether at the D.C. Circuit, we were best buddies. We disagreed now \nand then, but when I wrote for the Court and received a Scalia dissent, \nthe opinion ultimately released was notably better than my initial \ncirculation.''\n  Justice Scalia was known for his wit and sarcasm in his writings, \nfamously referring to the legal interpretations of his colleagues as \n``jiggery-pokery,'' ``pure applesauce,'' and ``a ghoul in a late horror \nmovie.'' Yet it was these same criticisms that Justice Ginsburg said \nnailed the weak spots in her opinions and gave her what she needed to \nstrengthen her writings.\n  Justice Scalia represented a consistent, constitutional voice on the \nCourt. Just as the Constitution is a pillar of our legal system, so too \nwas his affirmation to this foundational document of our Nation.\n  He said, ``It is an enduring Constitution that I want to \ndefend...It's what did the words mean to the people who ratified the \nBill of Rights or who ratified the Constitution, as opposed to what \npeople today would like.''\n  As Justice Kennedy said, ``In years to come any history of the \nSupreme Court will, and must, recount the wisdom, scholarship, and \ntechnical brilliance that Justice Scalia brought to the Court. His \ninsistence on demanding standards shaped the work of the Court in its \nprivate discussions, its oral arguments, and its written opinions. Yet \nthese historic achievements are all the more impressive and compelling \nbecause the foundations of Justice Scalia's jurisprudence, the driving \nforce in all his work, and his powerful personality were shaped by an \nunyielding commitment to the Constitution of the United States and to \nthe highest ethical and moral standards.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1342-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1342-S1343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CASEY FAMILY PROGRAMS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today I wish to acknowledge the \n50th anniversary of Casey Family Programs, the Nation's largest \noperating\n\n[[Page S1343]]\n\nfoundation focused on safely reducing the need for foster care and \nbuilding communities of hope for children and families across America. \nCasey Family Programs works to influence long-lasting improvements in \nthe safety and success of children, families, and the communities where \nthey live. I am proud that Casey is based in Seattle, WA.\n  March 15 is Casey's Founders Day, a time for its leaders to reflect \non the history of Jim Casey and his vision for the foundation and its \nmission.\n  Jim Casey, the founder of United Parcel Service, saw a critical need \n50 years ago to ensure that our Nation's most vulnerable children had \nsafe and stable families who would provide the opportunities and \nsupport they needed to succeed in life. After Jim's father died when he \nwas just 14, he felt responsible for taking care of his mother and \nthree younger siblings. As he was building the bicycle messenger \nservice he started in 1907 into the world's largest delivery and \nlogistics company, Jim also noticed that his most effective workers \ncame from strong families, while those who did not thrive came from \nunstable backgrounds.\n  Those experiences and his vision led him to generously invest his \nresources to create Casey Family Programs in 1966 to provide direct \nservices to vulnerable children and families. The foundation now works \nwith all 50 States, as well as tribal, county, and other child welfare \njurisdictions, to safely reduce the need for foster care and help \ncreate and sustain safe and stable families. It also educates \npolicymakers at all levels of government about effective policies and \nevidence-based interventions that improve the lives of families and \nchildren.\n  From 2009 to 2015, Casey Family Programs invested $45 million in \nWashington State. It has helped support the child welfare system, \ncourts, tribes, policymakers, and other organizations to improve \nstability for children and build communities of hope.\n  Casey Family Programs provides education, research, and information \nthat is valuable in policy discussions as well as for Washington State \nand other States participating in the Federal IV-Waiver Program. For \ninstance, Casey Family Programs has provided specific research to track \nwhich evidence-based programs States are using under their Federal \nwaivers so that States can learn from and replicate these practices.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions, I am committed to supporting policies to improve the \nlives of children and families. In particular, I was proud to include \nprovisions in the Every Student Succeeds Act to increase educational \nstability for foster children and homeless youth. I appreciate Casey's \ncommitment to these important issues as well.\n  I truly value the contributions of Casey Family Programs to \nWashington State and our country. Jim Casey once said that \n``inspiration and enthusiasm are of little value unless they move us to \naction and accomplishments.'' I believe that the current leadership of \nCasey Family Programs has embraced the vision of their founder. I look \nforward to working with Casey Family Programs in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1343-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1343-S1344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n        EC-4630.

This \nbill would ensure that America rewards the sacrifice and hard work of \nTeam USA by exempting from Federal tax the medals and cash prizes they \nwin at the Olympics and Paralympics.\n  Our Olympians and Paralympians represent America with distinction \nbecause they epitomize our greatest values--determination, hard work \nand a competitive spirit. These athletes and their families sacrifice \nyears of their lives for the opportunity to represent the United States \non the world's greatest stage--the Olympics and Paralympics games. Most \ncountries not only compensate their Olympic and Paralympic athletes, \nbut also subsidize their training expenses with taxpayer dollars. Our \nathletes make considerable financial sacrifices to train for the \nOlympics and Paralympics, and as amateurs, receive no compensation for \ntheir training. Unfortunately, America's athletes are penalized with a \ntax burden for the medals and awards they receive at these games. That \nshouldn't be the case. We should be celebrating their achievements \nrather than taxing their success.\n  I want to thank Senator Schumer, Senator Gardner, Senator Gillibrand, \nand Senator Isakson for working with me on this legislation. I urge all \nof my colleagues to join me in supporting the USA Olympians and \nParalympians Act to protect and encourage the success of our athletes \ncompeting in the upcoming Rio Games as well as future Olympic and \nParalympic Games. I look forward to watching Team USA compete and win \nlater this year, and I wish all of our Olympians and Paralympians the \nbest of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1346-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1346-S1347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 391--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE TO OPPOSE THE \n TRANSFER OF FOREIGN ENEMY COMBATANTS FROM THE DETENTION FACILITIES AT \nUNITED STATES NAVAL STATION, GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA, TO THE UNITED STATES \n                                HOMELAND\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Gardner, Mr. Scott, Mr. Blunt, and Mr. \nMoran) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Armed Services:\n\n                              S. Res. 391\n\n       Whereas, on January 22, 2009, President Barack Obama issued \n     Executive Order 13492, requiring that the detention \n     facilities housing foreign enemy combatants at United States \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, ``shall be closed as \n     soon as practicable, and no later than 1 year from the date \n     of this order'';\n       Whereas Executive Order 13492 states that ``[t]his order \n     shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and \n     subject to the availability of appropriations'';\n       Whereas the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing \n     Appropriations Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10), the \n     Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 \n     (Public Law 112-55), the Consolidated

prohibit the transfer, \n     release, or assisting in the transfer or release, of \n     detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, to \n     the United States homeland;\n       Whereas the detention facilities at United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, are legal, safe, and humane, and \n     have been found consistent with international conventions \n     regarding the laws of war;\n       Whereas, on February 23, 2009, a Department of Defense \n     review found that the detention facilities at United States \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, complied with the requirements \n     of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 \n     regarding the treatment of prisoners of war;\n       Whereas in 2015, teams from the Department of Defense \n     visited Federal, military, and State-owned prisons in Kansas, \n     Colorado, and South Carolina for the express purpose of \n     relocating detainees at United States Naval Station, \n     Guantanamo Bay, to the United States homeland;\n       Whereas Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, serves as the \n     intellectual center of the United States Army as home to the \n     Army University, the Command and General Staff College, and \n     the Combined Arms Center;\n       Whereas Fort Leavenworth operates the United States \n     Disciplinary Barracks and Midwest Joint Regional Corrections \n     Facility, which holds convicted members of the Armed Forces;\n       Whereas section 812 of title 10, United States Code \n     (article 12 of the Uniform Code of Military

Colorado Springs, \n     Colorado;\n       Whereas Colorado Springs is home to the United States Air \n     Force Academy, Peterson Air Force Base, Schriever Air Force \n     Base, and Fort Carson Army Post;\n       Whereas Peterson Air Force Base hosts the United States \n     Northern Command (NORTHCOM) and the North American Aerospace \n     Defense Command (NORAD), which are strategic military \n     installations, vital to our national defense and military \n     readiness;\n       Whereas Pueblo is home to the United States Army Pueblo \n     Chemical Weapons Depot;\n       Whereas the Consolidated Naval Brig, Hanahan, South \n     Carolina, has been visited by Department of Defense teams for \n     consideration as a potential site to relocate dangerous \n     international terrorists currently held in the detention \n     facilities at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay;\n       Whereas the Consolidated Naval Brig is located less than a \n     mile from an elementary school, and is near other schools and \n     residential neighborhoods;\n       Whereas the Consolidated Naval Brig is also in close \n     proximity to one of the busiest ports in the United States, \n     the Port of Charleston, as well as the City of Charleston, \n     one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country;\n       Whereas the Consolidated Naval Brig is also located near \n     the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) Systems \n     Center Atlantic and the Navy Nuclear Power Training Command, \n     which are strategic military installations, vital to our \n     national defense and military readiness;\n       Whereas Department of Defense efforts to scout locations \n     for the express purpose of transferring detainees at United \n     States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, to the States of \n     Kansas, Colorado, or South Carolina are in violation of \n     current law, which explicitly prohibit the transfer, release, \n     or assisting in the transfer or release, of such detainees to \n     the United States homeland;\n       Whereas, on November 17, 2015, Attorney General Loretta \n     Lynch stated to Congress that ``[w]ith respect to individuals \n     being transferred to the United States, the law currently \n     does not allow that'';\n       Whereas, on January 26, 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton \n     Carter stated in an interview that ``it's against the law now \n     to establish another detention facility [in the U.S.], so \n     therefore we have to get the support of Congress'';\n       Whereas, on February 23, 2016, the Department of Defense \n     issued a report pursuant to section 1035 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, entitled \n     ``Plan for Closing of the Guantanamo Bay Detention \n     Facility'';\n\n[[Page S1347]]\n\n       Whereas the report states that ``the Administration will \n     work with Congress to relocate [detainees] from the \n     Guantanamo Bay detention facility to a secure detention \n     facility in the United States''; and\n       Whereas the report does not address or attempt to mitigate \n     the risks posed to local communities by the potential \n     transfer of foreign enemy combatants from United States Naval \n     Station, Guantanamo Bay, to United States soil, including to \n     communities in Kansas, Colorado, and South Carolina: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) rejects the ``Plan to Close Guantanamo Bay Detention \n     Facility'', presented by the President on February 23, 2016, \n     to transfer, release, or assist in the transfer or release of \n     detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, \n     Cuba, to the United States homeland;\n       (2) determines that any attempt by the President to \n     transfer, release, or assist in the transfer or release of \n     detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, to \n     the United States homeland is in direct violation of the \n     Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations \n     Act, 2011 (Public Law 112-10), the Consolidated and Further \n     Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-55), the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (Public Law 112-74), \n     the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, \n     2013 (Public Law 113-6), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n     2014 (Public Law 113-76), the Continuing Appropriations \n     Resolution, 2015 (Public Law 113-164), the Consolidated and \n     Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Public Law 113-\n     235), the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, \n     2015 (Public Law 114-4), and the Continuing Appropriations \n     Act, 2016 (Public Law 114-53);\n       (3) finds that the detention facility at United States \n     Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, is the optimal location to \n     house dangerous foreign enemy combatants and should not be \n     closed;\n       (4) asserts that any potential transfer or release of \n     detainees at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, to \n     the United States homeland represents a threat to United \n     States national security due to the risk of providing law of \n     war detainees with rights and protections under the United \n     States Constitution, including the potential for release into \n     the United States, and, particularly, a threat to the safety \n     and security of local communities in the States of Kansas, \n     Colorado, and South Carolina; and\n       (5) demands that the President immediately abandon any ill-\n     conceived and illegal plans to transfer detainees at United \n     States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, to the United States \n     homeland without explicit authorization from Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

Res. 393\n\n       Whereas multiple sclerosis (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``MS'') can impact individuals of all ages, races, and \n     ethnicities but is at least 2 to 3 times more common in women \n     than in men;\n       Whereas there are approximately 2,300,000 individuals \n     worldwide who have been diagnosed with MS;\n       Whereas MS is typically diagnosed in individuals between \n     the ages of 20 and 50, but it is estimated that between 8,000 \n     and 10,000 children and adolescents are living with MS in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas MS is an unpredictable neurological disease that \n     interrupts the flow of information both within the brain and \n     between the brain and the rest of the body;\n       Whereas symptoms of MS range from numbness and tingling in \n     the extremities to blindness and paralysis, and the progress, \n     severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any 1 person cannot \n     yet be predicted;\n       Whereas there is no laboratory test available that can \n     definitively diagnose MS;\n       Whereas, while MS is not directly inherited, studies show \n     that there are genetic and, most likely, environmental \n     factors that make certain individuals, such as Caucasians of \n     Northern European ancestry, more susceptible to the disease \n     than others;\n       Whereas the exact cause of MS is still unknown and there is \n     no cure;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, a national \n     network of independent MS organizations dedicated to the \n     enhancement of the quality of life for all those affected by \n     MS, recognizes and supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness \n     Week;\n       Whereas the mission of the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition is \n     to increase opportunities for cooperation among MS \n     organizations and to provide greater opportunity for the \n     effective use and development of resources for the benefit of \n     individuals and families affected by MS;\n       Whereas the United States plays a critical role in \n     coordinating MS research globally and amplifies the impact of \n     research in the United States through which results are \n     delivered to MS patients;\n       Whereas, in 2012, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society \n     was a founding member of the Progressive MS Alliance, which \n     coordinates research to accelerate the development of \n     treatments for progressive MS by removing international \n     scientific and technological barriers and which now includes \n     MS societies from 15 countries;\n       Whereas the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition recognizes and \n     supports Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week during March of \n     every calendar year;\n       Whereas the goals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week are \n     to invite people to join the movement to end MS, encourage \n     everyone to do something to demonstrate a commitment to \n     moving toward a world free of MS, and acknowledge those who \n     have dedicated time and talent to help promote MS research \n     and programs;

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2426) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL \n                   CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Safety, security and peace is important to every \n     citizen of the world, and shared information ensuring wide \n     assistance among police authorities of nations for \n     expeditious dissemination of information regarding criminal \n     activities greatly assists in these efforts.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in the \n     International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) is \n     beneficial for all nations and their police authorities. \n     Internationally shared information with authorized police \n     authorities is vital to peacekeeping efforts.\n       (3) With a history dating back to 1914, the role of \n     INTERPOL is defined in its constitution: ``To ensure and \n     promote the widest possible mutual assistance between all \n     criminal police authorities within the limits of the laws \n     existing in the different countries and in the spirit of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.''.\n       (4) Ongoing international threats, including international \n     networks of terrorism, show the ongoing necessity to be ever \n     inclusive of nations willing to work together to combat \n     criminal activity. The ability of police authorities to \n     coordinate, preempt, and act swiftly and in unison is an \n     essential element of crisis prevention and response.\n       (5) Taiwan maintained full membership in INTERPOL starting \n     in 1964 through its National Police Administration but was \n     ejected in 1984 when the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n     applied for membership.\n       (6) Nonmembership prevents Taiwan from gaining access to \n     INTERPOL's I-24/7 global police communications system, which \n     provides real-time information on criminals and global \n     criminal activities. Taiwan is relegated to second-hand \n     information from friendly nations, including the United \n     States.\n       (7) Taiwan is unable to swiftly share information on \n     criminals and suspicious activity with the international \n     community, leaving a huge void in the global crime-fighting \n     efforts and leaving the entire world at risk.\n       (8) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations and has consistently \n     reiterated that support.\n       (9) Following the enactment of Public Law 108-235, a law \n     authorizing the Secretary of State to initiate and implement \n     a plan to endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at \n     the annual summit of the World Health\n\n[[Page S1349]]\n\n     Assembly and subsequent advocacy by the United States, Taiwan \n     was granted observer status to the World Health Assembly for \n     six consecutive years since 2009. Both prior to and in its \n     capacity as an observer, Taiwan has contributed significantly \n     to the international community's collective efforts in \n     pandemic control, monitoring, early warning, and other \n     related matters.\n       (10) INTERPOL's constitution allows for observers at its \n     meetings by ``police bodies which are not members of the \n     Organization''.\n       (b) Taiwan's Participation in INTERPOL.--The Secretary of \n     State shall--\n       (1) develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan \n     in INTERPOL and at other related meetings, activities, and \n     mechanisms thereafter; and\n       (2) instruct INTERPOL Washington to officially request \n     observer status for Taiwan in INTERPOL and to actively urge \n     INTERPOL member states to support such observer status and \n     participation for Taiwan.\n       (c) Report Concerning Observer Status for Taiwan in \n     INTERPOL.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall transmit to \n     Congress a report, in unclassified form, describing the \n     United States strategy to endorse and obtain observer status \n     for Taiwan in appropriate international organizations, \n     including INTERPOL, and at other related meetings, \n     activities, and mechanisms thereafter. The report shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) A description of the efforts the Secretary has made to \n     encourage member states to promote Taiwan's bid to obtain \n     observer status in appropriate international organizations, \n     including INTERPOL.\n       (2) A description of the actions the Secretary will take to \n     endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan in appropriate \n     international organizations, including INTERPOL, and at other \n     related meetings, activities, and mechanisms thereafter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/08/senate-section/article/S1349-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPETITIVE SERVICE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
