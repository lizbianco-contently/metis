Mr. President, let me begin this morning by \ncongratulating Kentucky's Governor-elect and the entire Republican \nticket on a big win at home last night. I remember when the Republican \nnomination was hardly worth having in Kentucky. We used to have to beg \npeople to run. So it says something when we see spirited competition \nfor it, which we had in the primary back in May.\n  The Governor-elect and I certainly are no strangers to spirited \ncompetition, but we are also conservative Kentuckians happy to see some \nchange coming to Frankfort.\n  Yesterday's election was a statement about where the people of my \nState want to see us headed, and it is not down the road of government \ncontrol and Big Labor. They want fresh ideas, growth, innovation, \nopportunity, and greater control over their lives and destinies. They \nwant a change in direction. Here is something they certainly don't \nwant: more of this administration's top-down, Washington-knows-best \napproach to everything from health care to how best to use our natural \nresources.\n  Washington overreach is just what I will discuss further right now. \nThe administration's so-called waters of the United States regulation \nwould grant Federal bureaucrats domination over nearly every piece of \nland that has ever touched a pothole, ditch or puddle at some point. It \nwould force the Americans who live there to ask Federal bureaucrats for \npermission to do just about anything on their own property. We are not \ntalking about just a few acres falling under bureaucratic control here \nand there. According to analysis by the American Farm Bureau, we are \ntalking about centralized Federal control extending to nearly 92 \npercent of Wisconsin, 95 percent of California, 98 percent of New York, \n99 percent of Pennsylvania, and, if you can believe this, 100 percent \nof Virginia--the entire State. This isn't some clean water regulation. \nIt is an unprecedented Federal power grab that clumsily and poorly \npretends to masquerade as one.\n  It is obvious why waters of the United States would be a leftwinger's \ndream. It is equally obvious why Democratic leaders would want to \npretend this rule is about clean water rather than admit what it is \nreally about, because the true purpose and scope of this regulation is \nbasically indefensible. So 31 States have already filed suit against \nit, 2 Federal courts have already ruled that it is likely illegal, and \n1 court found that the rule was so flawed that it had to be the result \nof ``a process that is inexplicable, arbitrary, and devoid of a \nreasoned process.'' That is why we considered the bipartisan Federal \nWater Quality Protection Act yesterday.\n  The legislation is bipartisan, and it is simple. It says that the \nEPA's resources should be used to actually protect the lakes and rivers \nwe all cherish rather than for the administration to launch arbitrary \nideological attacks on middle-class homeowners and family farms. This \nbipartisan legislation would have required America's clean water rules \nto be based on the kind of scientific, collaborative process the \nAmerican people expect, not some arbitrary or inflexible process that \nis devoid of reason such as we had with WOTUS but a balanced process \nthat actually takes the views of those it affects into serious \nconsideration.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, for his impressive \nwork on the bill. A bipartisan majority of the Senate voted to support \nit, but most Democrats chose an ideological power grab over sensible \nclean water rules yesterday. To many Kentuckians, this regulation feels \na lot like the latest in a sustained Obama administration regulatory \nassault on their families.\n  The Senate is going to pursue another avenue today to protect the \nmiddle class from this unfair regulatory attack. Our colleague from \nIowa, Senator Ernst, has introduced a measure that would allow Congress \nto move forward despite the Democratic filibuster. It would overturn \nthe regulation in its entirety. A majority of the Senate\n\n[[Page S7734]]\n\nvoted to support this bill just yesterday. We will vote on final \npassage later today. And because this measure cannot be filibustered, \nwe expect it to pass.\n  I ask my colleagues who voted against bipartisan commonsense clean \nwater legislation yesterday to think differently today. Work with us to \nprotect the middle class instead of defending ``inexplicable, \narbitrary'' regulation that is probably illegal and almost certainly \nviolates the Clean Water Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7734-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPPORTING OUR TROOPS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, on another matter, Mr. President, we live in a \ntime of diverse and challenging global threats. It is a time when we \nsee ISIL consolidating its gains in both Iraq and Syria. It is a time \nwhen we see the forces of Assad marching alongside Iranian soldiers and \nHezbollah militias. It is a time when we see Russian aircraft flying \nabove them in support, and it is a time when commanders tell us that \nadditional resources are required to ensure the safety and preparedness \nof our troops. I think it is time to finally support the men and women \nwho volunteer to protect us. The last excuse not to do so--the setting \nof a top-line budget number--has been cleared away. We fixed that. \nThere is no reason that our colleagues shouldn't join us in moving \nforward now.\n  These brave men and women aren't poker chips in some Washington \npolitical game. They are the sisters, fathers, daughters, and neighbors \nwho voluntarily and selflessly put themselves in harm's way so that we \nmight live free. These are the men and women we will salute this month \non Veterans Day. It is not enough just to support those who defend us \nthen; we need to support them right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7734-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 2232\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This is another example of the Republican leader \nwasting the Senate's time on repeated cloture votes that he knows will \nfail. Republicans have tried this piecemeal approach already, and it \ndidn't work. We came within hours of defaulting and not extending the \nfull faith and credit of the United States and came within days of \nshutting down the government.\n  Even though two-thirds of Republicans in the House and Senate voted \nto close the government and default on our debt, we were able to craft \na budget agreement that funds both the middle class and the Pentagon. \nNow it is time to move on and pass an omnibus appropriations bill that \naddresses both defense and the needs of the middle class in keeping \nwith the budget agreement that passed last week.\n  There is no reason we can't get an omnibus bill to fund all the \ngovernment by December 11, which is the deadline. If the Republicans \nbalk, the government will close. Again, remember, two-thirds of the \nRepublicans in Congress already voted no. They voted to default on the \ndebt of this country and to close the government. That should give \neveryone pause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7734-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7734-S7735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE KOCH BROTHERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the last several months, the Koch \nbrothers have been on a public relations campaign. This Koch propaganda \ncampaign has accelerated over the past few weeks. Charles and David \nKoch have been going to great lengths to convince the American people \nthat they are not just a couple of billionaires who are trying to \ndismantle Social Security and who closed the Export-Import Bank, \nputting 165,000 Americans out of work and costing the government \nbillions of dollars. These two men fought a zoo in Ohio, and they \nfought a Republican mayor of Colorado Springs, CO, as he tried to fix \nthe city's potholes. They stopped both from happening.\n  The Kochs want everyone to believe they are not the ones rigging the \nsystem to benefit themselves and their wealthy friends. The Koch \nbrothers are spending their vast wealth holding newspaper and \ntelevision interviews on their propaganda campaign. In spite of all \ntheir efforts, this Koch media tour has failed to bury the one simple \ntruth: The Koch brothers are trying to buy America.\n  During an interview yesterday, the scales fell away once again and \nrevealed the Koch brothers' true intentions. In justifying his and his \nbrother's efforts to inject hundreds of millions of dollars into \nconservative political campaigns, Charles Koch said: ``I expect \nsomething in return.''\n  The Koch brothers are getting plenty in return. So far they have \nbought a Republican House, a Republican Senate, a government shutdown, \nan ousted Speaker of the House, a shuttered Export-Import Bank, and a \nRepublican Presidential field where nearly every candidate kowtows to \nthese billionaires. But that is not all. The Kochs have procured a \nmedia that is intimidated by their billions--too intimidated to hold \nthem accountable.\n  Consider yesterday's interview on MSNBC's ``Morning Joe'' show. This \nis classic. Here are some of the questions that Joe and Mika asked the \nKoch brothers.\n  Joe Scarborough asked: ``It's hard to find people in New York, \nliberals, we were talking about this before, liberals or conservative \nalike, who haven't been touched by your graciousness, whether it is \ntowards the arts or cancer research. Do you think you got that instinct \nfrom your mom?''\n  Mika asked: ``Sitting here in your childhood home''--they were doing \nthis interview in Topeka, KS--``we have the Koch brothers. Which was \nthe good brother?'' That was another tough question.\n  Joe then asked: ``You guys both play rugby together, right?''\n  Sometimes--most of the time--they weren't even questions; they were \njust compliments.\n  At one point, here is what he said: ``You sound like my dad. That's \nvery diplomatic. That's very good.''\n  Wow. Those were some really tough questions asked by the host of \n``Morning Joe.'' That is tough journalism.\n  Those questions are so easy; they may even qualify them to moderate \nthe next Republican Presidential debate.\n  It seems that some journalists are determined not to get on the wrong \nside of the Koch brothers and their billions. After all, we have seen \nhow the Koch empire targets people, cities, and States that do anything \nthat conflicts with the Koch brothers' radical agenda. When the media \nrolls over for these modern-day robber barons, as it is doing now, our \ncountry is in trouble.\n  As Charles Koch himself said, he and his brother are not spending \nthis money for altruistic reasons; they are doing it for one reason and \none reason only--for the profits of themselves and fellow billionaires \nwho have rigged the system against the middle class. They said it \nthemselves. They want something in return, and what they want is profit \nfor their corporations. Their own publicist once explained why the Koch\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nbrothers are trying to buy a new government: ``It's because we can make \nmore profit, OK?''\n  That is what this is all about for Charles and David Koch: bigger \nprofits, more money because $100 billion or more isn't enough for them.\n  By their own admission, the Kochs will spend and spend and spend \nuntil they get the government they want--a government that lets Koch \nIndustries do what it wants, a government whose sole goal is to make \nthese billionaires even richer.\n  Unfortunately for the United States, the Supreme Court has \nconstructed a political system that allows them to do just that. The \nCitizens United case, decided in January 2010, has effectively put the \nU.S. Government up for sale to the highest bidder, and right now the \nKoch brothers are the highest bidder. Right now our country has no real \nrestrictions on how much money a billionaire or a millionaire can spend \nto buy the government they want. All the power is with the wealthy, and \nthat puts middle-class Americans at a significant disadvantage.\n  So we can't stand idly by while the government sits on an auction \nblock and neither should any American sit idly by. Instead, we should \nbe working to rid the system of the Koch brothers' dark money, but this \ncannot and will not happen if reporters and journalists refuse to ask \nCharles and David Koch questions--maybe even probing questions. \nOtherwise no one is holding these two oil barons accountable for their \nnefarious actions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7735-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon will be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HELLER. I will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Nevada I be recognized, \nunless an intervening minority Member should come in, in which case \nthat I be recognized after that minority Member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue that will \nimpact every single one of my constituents and probably all of the \nconstituents of my colleagues in this body; namely, the Environmental \nProtection Agency's and the Army Corps of Engineers' new definition for \n``navigable waters.''\n  Also known as waters of the United States, this overreaching and \nburdensome regulation is bad for Nevada and frankly it is bad for the \nNation. My home State of Nevada is one of the driest in the Nation, and \nthe water of course is a very precious resource. The only thing more \nscarce than water in the Silver State is probably private property, and \nthe implementation of this waters of the United States rule will only \ndo more harm for both of these.\n  Since coming to Congress, one of my primary goals has been to promote \njob-creating policies that grow Nevada's economy, and the key to \npromoting these types of policies is to cut redtape regulations handed \ndown by Washington bureaucrats. Unfortunately, time and time again, \nthis administration is bound and determined to issue overly burdensome \nregulations that damage the economy and stifle job creation. The latest \nedict from Washington bureaucrats is no different.\n  After years of failed legislative attempts to change the scope of \nregulatory authority over water, this administration has overturned \nboth congressional intent and multiple Supreme Court decisions to \nfurther overregulate hard-working Nevadans. I have long been an \noutspoken advocate and a cosponsor of Senator Barrasso's legislation, \nthe Federal Water Quality Protection Act, that would make the EPA and \nthe Army Corps of Engineers redo this rule and consider stakeholder \ninput--something they completely ignored the last time around. \nConsidering that nearly 87 percent of my home State is managed by the \nFederal Government--which I often refer to as our Federal landlords--it \nis easy to see why this rule is thought of by many back home as yet \nanother Federal land grab.\n  I have heard from many of my constituents who have shared with me \ntheir staunch opposition to this rule, like Marlow from Ruby Valley and \nDarryl from Yerington. They write about the rule that it ``creates \nconfusion and risk by providing the Agencies with almost unlimited \nauthority to regulate, at their discretion, any low spot where \nrainwater collects, including farm ditches, ephemeral drainages, \nagricultural ponds and isolated wetlands found in and near farms and \nranching.''\n  The EPA may tell us that farmers and ranchers are protected from this \nregulation by exemptions under the Clean Water Act. The problem with \nthis so-called exemption is that if a landowner made any changes on \ntheir farmland or their ranch since 1977 that impacts any land or any \nwater on their property, they do not qualify for an exemption. Think \nabout it again. Since 1977, if a landowner made any changes on their \nranch land or on their farm that impacts water or land, they don't \nqualify for this exemption. So under this new rule, almost everyone \nwould be regulated.\n  Ranching is the backbone of Nevada's rural economy. Implementation of \nthis rule will devastate Nevada's landowners and businesses. Like \nMarlow and Darryl, I believe this rule needs to be redone with \nsignificant input from local stakeholders and in a way that will not \nimpact the ability of Nevada ranchers to provide food for Americans.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate was not even able to proceed to this \nmeasure and debate legislation to exert some much needed oversight over \nthe EPA due to the left's circle-the-wagon mentality of the Obama \nagenda. Although I was sad to see this vote fail, today I am proud to \nstand in support of Senator Ernst's resolution of disapproval, which \nwill send this regulation back to the administration and send a clear \nmessage that Congress doesn't accept overreaching regulations created \nby Washington bureaucrats.\n  The fact is, the implementation of this rule has already been halted \nby the Federal courts. I strongly believe that at the end of the day, \nthe courts will decide to overturn this onerous regulation. That is why \nI stand here today to urge my colleagues to support this resolution of \ndisapproval. Instead of waiting years for the courts to decide, \nCongress needs to take immediate action to show this administration \nthat we will not stand for any more regulations that kill jobs and \nstifle economic growth.\n  Good stewardship of our natural resources is part of Nevada's \ncharacter that makes it so unique. This is not about dirty water or a \nrollback of the Clean Water Act. This is about Federal regulations that \nseverely limit land use, infringe on property rights, and diminish \neconomic activity in Nevada and nationwide. This is about Federal \nregulatory overreach by an agency that is using the Clean Water Act as \na means to greatly increase its authority. At a time when the American \npublic is still waiting for answers on the Animas River spill in \nColorado, I find it greatly disturbing that this Agency is using clean \ndrinking water as an excuse to gain authority over all waters of the \nUnited States. Enough is enough with these power trips.\n  Should we really trust the ``Environmental Pollution Agency'' with \nthis?\n  As a sportsman, I grew up understanding the importance of being a\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\ngood steward of our environment. I support efforts that balance \nconservation and economic growth, and that is why I urge my colleagues \nto stand with me against this administration's heavyhanded mandates.\n  Mr. President, thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yesterday 41 Senators refused to have a \nsubstantive debate on an issue that is critically important to all of \nour constituents--the scope of Federal authority under the Clean Water \nAct--and voted against a motion to proceed to Senator Barrasso's \nbipartisan Federal Water Quality Protection Act, S. 1140.\n  Later in the day I was extremely disappointed to learn that 11 of \nthose 41 Senators agreed that the EPA's rule is flawed, but instead of \ndoing their job to provide legislative clarity to the EPA on the \nregulation of our Nation's waters, they wrote a letter. In this letter \nthey told the EPA that they have concerns with the rule, but instead of \nacting now they reserve the right to do their jobs simply at a later \ntime.\n  If only 3--only 3--of these 11 Senators who signed this letter would \nhave voted to proceed to the bill, we could have worked with them to \nresolve their concerns and ours about the WOTUS rule disapproval.\n  As Senator Sasse so eloquently reminded us yesterday in his maiden \nspeech, what are we here for if not to have a substantive debate on \nissues? No wonder the American people think Congress is not looking out \nfor their interests.\n  Instead of doing their jobs, 11 Senators asked the EPA to change the \nfinal rule through guidance. That can't happen. EPA can't do that. That \nwould be a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, and I think \nmost of us know that. These 11 Senators also asked the EPA to enforce \nthe rule in a way that will protect people who are not regulated today. \nThat also will not happen. The WOTUS rule is on the books. Even if the \nEPA doesn't bring enforcement action against someone, some activist, \nenvironmentalist community is going to file a lawsuit, and we know what \nthe result of that would be.\n  In the letter I am referring to, the 11 Democrats agreed that the EPA \ndid not provide clarity in its final WOTUS rule to protect American \nlandowners, but instead of voting to debate a bipartisan bill that \nwould have forced EPA to provide that clarity and to offer perfecting \namendments, if they wished to do so, they wrote a letter. I know I am \nsounding very critical, and in a minute I will tell my colleagues why, \nbecause this happens to be the No. 1 issue of the farmers and ranchers \nin my rural State of Oklahoma. It is a big deal.\n  The EPA's entire rulemaking process, and now the lack of debate in \nthe Senate, is an example of Washington at its worst. This is a long \nand sordid story that dates back to 2009. EPA wanted to be able to \ncontrol isolated ponds, wetlands, and dry channels water only when it \nrains, but they were blocked because the Supreme Court said the Clean \nWater Act is based on the authority over navigable waters. I think \neverybody understands that the State has always had the authority, but \ncertainly if they are navigable waters, I agree, the Federal Government \nshould be involved.\n  First, the EPA backed legislation--and this is the legislation I \nreferred to yesterday by Senator Feingold, 5 years ago, and Congressman \nOberstar in the House--to take the word ``navigable'' out. If we take \nthe word ``navigable'' out, everything is then in the authority of the \nFederal Government.\n  To support this legislation, EPA created a propaganda message that \naction was needed to protect drinking water. The EPA spread this \npropaganda, even though they know that all sources of drinking water \nare already regulated. That is already done. That is a done deal. It \nshould have been done and it was done, but the American people were not \nfooled. The bills were so unpopular with the American people that even \nthough Senator Feingold's party held the Senate, the White House, and \nthe House--everything was on their side--the bill never reached the \nSenate floor and Congressman Oberstar did not even try to move his bill \nthrough the committee he chaired.\n  So the American people held them accountable. Both of them, I might \nadd, lost their elections for reelection to office in 2010. After that \nelection, EPA changed its strategy. Even though in 2009 the EPA said \nthey needed legislation to expand Federal control after Congress \nrejected their attempt to take the word ``navigable'' out of the clean \nClean Water Act, they tried to do the same thing through regulation.\n  This is exactly what this administration has been doing. Every time \nthey try to pass something legislatively and they can't do it, they get \na regulation. That is what they are doing. How many times did we vote \non the global warming and the cap-and-trade bills, and each time it \nwent down resoundingly in the Senate. Well, it happened over and over \nagain. So what did they do? They said if we can't do it legislatively, \nwe will do it through regulation.\n\n  In this new regulation, EPA tried to dodge the Supreme Court rulings \nby pretending that all water has a connection to navigable water. EPA \nalso cranked up its propaganda machine. On May 19, the New York Times \nsaid: ``In a campaign that tests the limits of federal lobbying law, \nthe agency orchestrated a drive to counter political opposition from \nRepublicans and enlist public support in concert with liberal \nenvironmental groups and a grass-roots organization aligned with \nPresident Obama.''\n  That was in the New York Times. They created social media messages \nand asked people to send these EPA-directed messages of support back to \nEPA--a true echo chamber going back and forth.\n  After soliciting comments using its propaganda machine, the EPA \nclaimed that 90 percent of the comments supported the rule and that \nevery comment is meaningful to the EPA. However, the Corps of Engineers \ntold my committee--the committee that I chair, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee--that only 39 percent of unique comments \nsupported the rule, and 60 percent were opposed.\n  The difference is that EPA is counting each email address on a list \nas a separate meaningful comment. For example, EPA counts a list of \nnearly 70,000 email addresses sent in by Organizing for Action, \nPresident Obama's political campaign arm, as 70,000 comments. It is \nactually only one. Apparently the EPA considers an email address more \nmeaningful than substantive comments submitted by States and by local \ngovernments, by farmers, ranchers, and property owners. The EPA has \nignored the significant concerns raised by these groups, and they \nshould not have.\n  I am sure that every Member of this body has heard from someone \ncomparable to Tom Buchanan in my State of Oklahoma. Tom Buchanan is the \npresident of the Oklahoma Farm Bureau. He speaks for a lot of farmers \nand ranchers, and we are a rural State. He says of all the problems \nthat farmers and ranchers have in Oklahoma, these issues are not found \nin the farm bill, and they are not in the ag bill. They are the \noverregulations of the EPA. He is talking about endangered species, \nwhere you can plow your fields and where you can't. But of all the \nregulations of the EPA, the most onerous are the water regulations \nbecause they will allow the Federal Government to have an army of \nbureaucrats crawling over every farm and every ranch, not just in my \nState of Oklahoma but throughout America.\n  Two courts have already said it is illegal. It will be overturned. We \ndon't have to stand for this. We don't have to endure years of \nconfusion before the courts act. They are going to act, but it could \ntake a long, long time. In the meantime they will go forward, and the \noverregulations will continue.\n  We have only one way to stop the rule right now, and that is coming \nup. It is through the CRA offered by Senator Ernst. A lot of people \ndon't know what a CRA is, but it forces responsibility on Members of \nthe Senate. There are a lot of Senators who want overregulation; the \nliberal ones do. So they would rather go ahead and go home, and when \npeople complain, they can say: Hey, it wasn't us who did that; it was \nan unelected bureaucracy that did that. A CRA will not let them get by \nwith that.\n  The President can veto it, which he will, and it will come back for a \nvote to override the veto, and we will know and our constituents \nthroughout America will know just how their Senator is\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\nvoting. Senator Ernst's CRA would do that. I certainly urge a ``yes'' \nvote, not just for me but for all my farmers and ranchers in Oklahoma.\n  After vacating this rule, if any Senator wants to work with my \ncommittee on substantive issues around the scope of Federal authority \nunder the Clean Water Act, I stand ready to work with them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time spent in a \nquorum call before the 12 noon vote be charged equally against both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa who has \nled the effort this morning as we speak about the waters of the United \nStates rule that would lead to a resolution of disapproval on this very \nwrong-headed rule.\n  I also want to acknowledge the good work of my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Barrasso, who had the opportunity yesterday to discuss \nthe devastating impact of the WOTUS rule, as we lovingly refer to it. \nIt was a combined effort to address the concerns that so many of us \nhave across the country about the waters of the United States rule that \nhas stemmed from the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers.\n  This WOTUS rule that so many of us speak to is not only an overreach, \nit is a significant overreach that will allow for a dramatic expansion \nof the Federal Government's ability to regulate our land and regulate \nour waters and will harm the people in the State of Alaska and other \nStates across the Nation. They have said in no uncertain terms that \nthis rule could have as damaging an impact on our State and our State's \nability to engage in any level of development--this rule would have \ngreater impact than most anything we have seen before.\n\n  So I am here to urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the \nresolution of disapproval that we now have pending, which we will have \nan opportunity to vote on in just a little over an hour.\n  I have had dozens of meetings--meetings with constituents, meetings \nwith people across the country who have raised this as an issue. We \nhave sent letters, and we have questioned the EPA Administrator about \nthe impact of the rule.\n  I had an opportunity to have a field hearing in Alaska earlier this \nyear, joined by Senator Sullivan, focusing on those areas we would \nconsider to be Federal overreach, those areas that hold our State back \nfrom any level of economic activity and development. Time after time, \nthe concern was whether this waters of the United States--again, this \nexpansive interpretation of the Clean Water Act literally designed by \nthe EPA, a concern about how its negative impact on our State will be \nfelt.\n  In addition to many of the legislative efforts that are out there, as \nchairman of the Appropriations interior subcommittee, I included a \nprovision within the Interior appropriations bill to halt the \nimplementation of the waters of the United States rule. I am a \ncosponsor of the bill we tried to advance yesterday. Unfortunately, it \nwas blocked. I am also a cosponsor of the disapproval resolution that \nis being offered by our colleague from Iowa.\n  My position on this is pretty simple: The WOTUS rule cannot be \nallowed to stand. The agencies have to go back to the drawing board. I \nam not alone in this view. It is a highly controversial rule. It stands \nout among many of the rules we have seen finalized by this \nadministration. Of the controversial ones that are out there, I would \nargue that if this is not in the top tier, if it is not the top, it is \ncertainly No. 2.\n  It is a rule that is controversial enough that it draws bipartisan \nopposition as well. We have a large majority, a bipartisan majority of \nthe House that opposes it. When we look to how this has been addressed \nby the States, some 31 States, including the State of Alaska, have sued \nto block it. A wide range of local governments and business groups have \ndone the same. Just last month, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \nissued a nationwide injunction to prevent the implementation of this \nrule.\n  I welcome what the courts have done so far, but I do not think \nCongress should sit back on this and hope we get the right legal \noutcome. We should not just be sitting back because that right legal \noutcome may come. It may come in months, it may come years from now, or \nit may not be the right outcome. Our opinions here in the Congress are \nnot based solely on what the courts say. We have to look to the reach, \nto the impact of this rule, and then determine whether it is \nappropriate. Again, my answer to this is pretty simple: It is no. It is \njust not appropriate.\n  The agencies are claiming the WOTUS rule is somehow or other just a \nclarification. They have gone one step further and they renamed it. \nThey are calling it the clean water rule because who out there is going \nto oppose clean water? Nobody opposes clean water. We all strive for \ncleaner water, cleaner air. This is something we all should be working \nto. But just changing the name on this rule does not make it so. In \nfact, this rule is really just muddying the waters. Excuse the pun, but \nthat is what EPA is doing. They are creating confusion. They are \ncertainly creating greater uncertainty. It opens the door to higher \nregulatory costs and delays for projects all over the country.\n  There have been many colleagues who have come to the floor and talked \nabout kind of the mechanics of the WOTUS rule. Unfortunately, they are \npretty complicated. When you start talking about ``categorically \njurisdictional waters,'' when you try to explain the ``significant \nnexus'' analysis, the only people in the room who are really captivated \nby what you are talking about are the lawyers who might be in a \nposition to gain some benefit because they are working these cases. But \nmost farmers in Iowa and most miners in Alaska are not thinking about \nwhat a categorically jurisdictional water is and whether there is a \nsignificant nexus from my little plaster mining operation to a body of \nwater. That is not what people are thinking about.\n  I want to use a little bit of my time this morning to speak to how, \nin the State of Alaska, people will be harmed by application of this \nrule.\n  To understand the reach of the rule in the State, take a look at this \nmap of the State of Alaska. It is so big, we cannot even fit it all on \none floor chart because really we need to go all of the way out to the \nAleutian Chain and we do not have all of the southeastern part of the \nState in it, but we have the bulk here. Alaska, plain and short, is \ncovered in water. It is just wet. According to our State government, \nAlaska has more than 40 percent of the Nation's surface water \nresources. Think about that. Think about the entire United States of \nAmerica, and then appreciate that in one State, in my State, we have \nmore than 40 percent of the Nation's entire surface water resources. So \nwe are talking over 3 million lakes, over 12,000 rivers. We have \napproximately 174 million acres of wetlands. There are more wetlands in \nthe State of Alaska than in the entire rest of the country combined.\n  So all you colleagues, all you folks in the 49 other States who are \nconcerned about the impact of this rule, I don't mean to diminish your \nproblems, but think about what this rule would do in Alaska.\n  We have more wetlands in the State of Alaska than in all of the rest \nof the country combined. Out of 283 communities in the State, 215 of \nthese communities are located within either 2 miles of the coast or a \nnavigable waterway. We live on the water, even in the inland part of \nthe state, where I was raised and went to high school--the lakes, the \nrivers, up in the north country here, where you have just a small lake. \nOut in the whole southwest of Alaska--when you fly over it, you look at \nit, and it is dotted with small lakes and bodies of water. Plainly \nsaid, it is wet in Alaska.\n  Surprise--if it is not wet, it is frozen. Think about the permafrost \nwe have there. How do you deal with the permafrost? How is that \nconsidered in this proposed rule, in this waters of the United States? \nIf it is frozen, is it\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nwaters of the United States? Well, you know, we don't know because the \nrule is unclear, but we are going to go ahead and just assume that it \nis going to be covered.\n  We have a map here where what you see is blue. The reason it is blue \nis because all of it is water.\n  This is the National Hydrography Dataset, Streams, Rivers and Bodies \nfor the State of Alaska, September 2015.\n  EPA has produced maps of the waters and wetlands in each of our 50 \nStates. Our colleagues in the House actually had to force the Agency to \nrelease these maps last year. Almost the full State of Alaska is shaded \nin. That is what the EPA wants to be able to regulate under this rule. \nSo what exactly could that cover? What are we talking about?\n  It could be out here in Bristol Bay, where it is all about fishing. \nIt could be a new runway project there that would be subject to \nregulation or a seafood processing plant out there in Bristol Bay.\n  Up here in the interior of Alaska, in Fairbanks, it could be a new \nneighborhood they want to accommodate to deal with the growing \npopulation there that would be subject to regulation.\n  It could be a parcel of land awarded under the Native Land Claims \nSettlement Act that just so happens to be in a wetlands area or have a \nsmall river present. But the fact that it was a conveyance of land \nunder the Native Claims Settlement Act does not get you beyond \nregulation through the EPA.\n  It could be the new industrial park in Anchorage that wants to \ndiversify, wants to help expand the economy there.\n  It could be an energy project up on the North Slope that the Arctic \nSlope Regional Corporation wants to pursue. But, again, it is either \nwetlands or it is clearly permafrost up there.\n  It could be Alaska's proposed gas line. We are hoping to run a gas \nline from the Slope all of the way down to tidewater in Valdez. This is \na major project our State's legislature is working on. Right now they \nare in the midst of a special session. It is going to run across--if \nyou want to talk about wetlands and rivers and areas that will be \nsubject to this permitting requirement, it could be any of those. It \ncould be many more.\n  That brings us to the potential impact under the WOTUS rule. I am not \ncertain that the agencies will try to stop every project in the State--\nthat is too much even for them--but I recognize that they could use \nthis rule to stop any project that they want, whenever they want, and \nfor as long as they may want. So maybe not every project will be \naffected, but any project could be targeted. Think about that. If you \nare trying to make an investment decision, if you are a business that \nis seeking to expand but you have that level of uncertainty because you \ndon't know if you are going to be targeted, that is tough. It is tough \nto make these decisions.\n  We know these agencies have cast an extremely wide net with this \nrule. We know from Keystone XL and from our experiences in Alaska that \nregulatory decisions are not always fair or impartial or even logical \nwithin this administration. We know that almost everything in Alaska is \neither near water, it is wetlands, or it is permafrost. You add it all \nup, folks, and almost every project in Alaska could suddenly be subject \nto Federal permitting under the Clean Water Act. That, in turn, means \nmost projects in our State will end up costing more, taking longer, or \nbeing indefinitely delayed.\n  I would remind friends that the cost of securing a section 404 permit \ncan easily run $300,000 and take over 2 years to do. So you are adding \ncost and you are adding delay. The delay adds to further cost. Some \ndevelopers just give up. They raise the white flag and they say: I am \ntired. I am frustrated. I just cannot run this regulatory gauntlet.\n  They give up. All of this would be in addition to the significant \nregulatory burdens Alaska is already facing.\n  One last example I will leave you with comes from Craig, AK, down \nhere in the southeast. This is a small town of about 1,200 people. We \nhave a local tribal organization that wants to construct a 16-unit \naffordable housing project. The Army Corps required a $46,000 \ndownpayment to a mitigation bank prior to permitting. Again, this is \nfor a small project in a community of 1,200 people. It is a tribal \norganization trying to bring in some low-income housing units, and they \nare going to have to spend $46,000 just to get started. Think about \nwhat they could have done if they could have put those dollars toward \nthat project. Imagine then--a town like Craig--when you scale this up \nto communities such as Anchorage and Fairbanks, what do those costs \nmean to you? There is just too much at stake.\n\n  Again, I strongly oppose the WOTUS rule because of the uncertainty it \nwill create, the delays it will deliver, the costs it will impose, \nbecause Alaska is the only State that has permafrost and we still have \nno idea whether or under what circumstances these areas will be \nregulated and, further, because this rule could dampen our efforts to \nbegin new resource-extraction projects, which we depend upon for a \nmajority of our State's budget.\n  Finally, I oppose the WOTUS rule because it is yet another regulatory \nburden for Alaskans, for people all over the country. This is on top of \nall of the other regulations we have seen in our State and from the \nInterior Department's anti-energy decisions to EPA's quest for project \nveto authority before, during, and after the permitting process. It \ngets to a point where it is just too much. It is just too much, and \nthis is where we must come together and stand to stop it.\n  I thank my colleagues for their leadership and look forward to the \nopportunity to support the disapproval resolution that is pending \nbefore the body.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, just a week ago the American people were \nable to breathe a collective sigh of relief--and I think all of us did \nin this Chamber as well--as Republicans and Democrats in the House and \nSenate finally pulled back from what would have been a financial \ncatastrophe. We had a potential default of our country's bills. There \nwas a potential government shutdown, but that was averted, and we \npassed a budget with no time to spare. It was a good thing to do on a \nbipartisan basis, to be able to show that we could work together, \ndevelop a bipartisan budget.\n  I believe it was 3 a.m. when we had the final vote on early Friday \nmorning, but we put that in place and had some confidence at that \nmoment that we were going to be moving forward with a comprehensive \nbudget--a comprehensive appropriations process--that would allow us to \nsay to the American people that we were addressing all of the needs \nthey care about: security, growing the economy, making sure we are \ninvesting in middle-class families, strengthening our defense, and so \non.\n  Now, not even a week later, Republican leaders are back to their old \ntricks again. We are quite shocked to see that rather than giving the \nappropriators the opportunity to put together a comprehensive \nappropriations process, a comprehensive budget to be able to move \nforward on all of the needs of the country, what we are seeing is \npotentially a trick to undo the bipartisan budget agreement through the \nbackdoor. We have seen this movie before, a few years ago, passing the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations and then forcing everything else \ninto a long-term continuing resolution.\n  We are not going down this road again. We are operating under the \nbasis that we have a bipartisan agreement. A lot of folks on both sides \nof the aisle deserve credit for that, but we want to stick to that and \na comprehensive budget moving forward--no tricks to undo the bipartisan \nbudget agreement.\n  Frankly, our families deserve a budget that grows the economy and \ninvests in our middle-class families. How many of us have said the \nissue is that folks don't have money in their pocket, good-paying jobs, \nand can't do what they need to do to be able to put food on the table, \nsend the kids to school, pay the mortgage, be able to support their \nfamilies in a way that we always have in America, and be able to grow \nthe economy with a strong, vibrant middle class.\n  We also need to strengthen our national defense--our national \nsecurity--broadly. If we only move forward on Department of Defense, as \nwe know, we\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\nare leaving out a whole range of things that are part of our national \nsecurity.\n  I can say that as a border State in Michigan, we need to be \nconcerned. We hear a lot of debate and discussion about border \nsecurity. We need to make sure we are adequately funding border \nsecurity. Cyber security, for us it means things such as the Coast \nGuard. When we look at other areas of security, it includes food \nsecurity efforts that people care about. It includes first responders, \npolice, and firefighters. It includes airports--a whole range of things \nthat need to be looked at comprehensively.\n  We want to see the whole budget, not just the Department of Defense. \nWe want to see the agreement on the whole budget so we know there \naren't going to be any tricks. If there aren't going to be any tricks, \nwhat are folks trying to hide? Let's just develop the whole budget and \nthen move the whole budget.\n  We also know people care deeply about growing the economy and jobs, \nand that means supporting small business. It means investing, making \nthings, and growing things, which I talk a lot about in Michigan. That \nis what we do; we make things and grow things. There are efforts to \nsupport that that we need to do.\n  Frankly, some of that is in critical partnerships with the private \nsector and job training. The No. 1 thing I hear from manufacturers \ntoday--in fact, the National Association of Manufacturers tells us \nthere are 600,000 unfilled jobs today because we don't have people with \nthe right skills for the right job. That is something we need to \naddress in our budget: job training, education, and college \naffordability.\n  How many times have we heard about young people or in our own \nfamilies know people who have come out of college, they did everything \nwe told them to do: Go to college, get good grades. They graduate, and \nthen they come out with more debt than if they were trying to buy a big \nhouse. In fact, the realtors tell us now they can't qualify young \ncouples to buy a house because of their college debt. That is part of \nthis debate on the budget: education, access to college, job training, \nsupport for small businesses, and support for our manufacturers and our \nfarmers, large and small.\n  Another critical area in our budget that we want to make sure is \nadequately funded is our ability to save lives through medical \nresearch, such as new treatments, new cures that we all have heard so \nmuch about that we are excited about. The whole effort now--finally, we \nare doing research on the brain, the least researched organ in the \nbody. That impacts Alzheimer's; $1 out of every $5 Medicare dollars is \nspent on Alzheimer's disease and dementias, Parkinson's, mental \nillness, and addictions. That doesn't count what needs to happen with \ncancers. It doesn't count how close we are if we were to double down on \nour medical research in this country. Juvenile diabetes--we could go on \nand on. That is part of this budget.\n  We want to see what is being funded on medical research in the \nNational Institutes of Health before we move forward on only one piece \nof this, as we are very late in the game to debate this. This might \nhave been a strategy we could do last spring. Now what we need to have \nis a look at the entire budget: mental health, substance abuse, \nservices for veterans. Whether it is veterans and job training, whether \nit is providing veterans an opportunity to have a home and live in \ndignity, whether it is mental health substance abuse services, that is \nin this budget. We need a comprehensive budget. We need to know, the \nAmerican people need to know the whole budget and that there are not \ngoing to be tricks in this process.\n  Protecting our natural resources. For us around the Great Lakes, 20 \npercent of the world's freshwater, it is incredibly important for us \nthat we know how the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is funded; how \nwe are supporting our clean air, clean water, and land initiatives.\n  We have new challenges in outrageous things such as what is happening \nin Flint, MI, where there is very high lead found in the water and we \nneed pipes changed. We need to be supporting infrastructure around not \nonly roads and bridges, which are critically important, but aging pipes \nthat have been there for 60 years, 70 years, 80 years, 100 years that \nwe are now seeing--and multiplied by a series of errors and incredibly \nbad misjudgments at the State level, at the minimum. We are seeing \nsituations where we are going to need to support efforts on making sure \nwe can upgrade our pipes, our water pipes, water and sewer, and so on. \nThat is all part of this budget.\n  So when we look at moving forward, last week at the end of the week \nwas a good time because it was an opportunity to come together in a \nbipartisan way, avert disaster, and actually come together as the \nAmerican people want us to do every day. People in Michigan ask: Can't \nyou guys just get something done? Can't you just work together?\n  Well, at the end of last week we actually did that. We actually came \ntogether and developed a plan, a 2-year overall budget process, and now \nit is implementing it through appropriations. What we as Democrats are \ncommitted to doing is implementing the agreement in total. We are not \ngoing to support going back to where we were before, where we move one \nbudget--the budget that has the most interest among Republican \ncolleagues, the Department of Defense--and then potentially see all of \nthese other needs go unaddressed in a fair and responsible way in terms \nof what American families are asking us to do. We just want to know \nthat we are truly working to implement a bipartisan budget that we \nvoted on--no backdoor tricks. Unfortunately, we have seen this movie \nbefore--no backdoor tricks to undermine critical needs for jobs, the \neconomy, quality of life, protecting our natural resources, our broad \nsecurity needs as a country. Let's put that strategy aside rather than \ntrying to have a vote on only moving forward on the Defense \nappropriations.\n  I urge that Republican leadership put that strategy aside, give the \nappropriators the time they need--we have good people on both sides of \nthe aisle who can work together as appropriators--and provide us a \nbalanced, responsible budget for the United States of America that will \nin fact grow the economy, invest in our middle-class families, and \nstrengthen our national defense. I am hopeful that in the end that is \nwhat will happen.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I had a few minutes yesterday before the \nvote--the Congressional Review Act vote on this truly terrible EPA rule \non water--to talk about the reasons EPA shouldn't do this, the long-\nterm understanding of what ``navigable waters'' meant, the ability for \nEPA--if they wanted to change the law--to come and ask the Congress to \nchange the law, but of course they don't want to do any of that. In \nfact, I had a small version of this map yesterday that shows the Farm \nBureau projection--that I believe other projections agree with--of how \nmuch of our State is covered by this new jurisdiction by the Federal \nGovernment over essentially all the waters of the country. If you will \nnotice, the only part of Missouri that would be covered under the so-\ncalled waters of the United States rule is just the part in red. Only \n99.7 percent of the State would be under this new jurisdiction that the \nEPA would ask for. Surely, nobody believes the EPA could ever exercise \nthis jurisdiction. And uniquely, as it relates to this rule--I think \n``uniquely'' is the right word to say here--Federal agency after \nFederal agency opposed the EPA going forward with this rule. This is \nbasically not just the EPA versus a few people who are concerned about \nit. It is the EPA versus anybody who has looked at it.\n\n  According to the Small Business Administration--by the way, another \nagency of the Federal Government headed by someone else who is \nappointed by the President--they have a number of concerns. One is that \nutility companies would have a hard time complying with the law in a \nway that allowed the power grid to continue to be utilized. Of course, \nanything that raises utility company power costs raises the cost to the \nconsumer. There is no mythical way anybody else pays for that except \nthe people who get utility bills, which almost every person in America \nor at least the family of almost every person in America does.\n  The Home Builders Association of St. Louis believes that if this rule \ngoes\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\ninto effect, on average, the increased cost for permitting to build a \nhome would go from a little under $30,000--right now the average cost, \nat least for St. Louis home builders to get all the permitting \nnecessary, is $28,915--and would increase by 10 times. So the average \npermit to build a home, if this silly waters of the United States thing \nis allowed to happen, would go from a little under $30,000 to $271,596, \nand the wait time would go from a little less than 1 year to more than \n2 years, just to get the permitting you need to build a home.\n  Now, the SBA also says the rule will increase permitting costs \ngenerally by $52 million in the country, just for permitting costs \ngenerally, and environmental mitigation costs by $113 million every \nyear. With the addition of the power rule the EPA also has out, I think \nyou would be hard pressed to come up with a third rule that would do \nanywhere as much damage as the two rules they already have out there do \nto the American economy.\n  In April of 2015, a memo from MG John Peabody to Assistant Secretary \nDarcy of the Corps of Engineers, states that ``in the Corps' judgment, \nthe documents contain numerous inappropriate assumptions with no \nconnection to the data provided .  .  . and logical inconsistencies.'' \nThis is the view of the Corps of Engineers--not necessarily my favorite \nFederal agency--on the EPA rule.\n  This rule would also mean that Federal bureaucrats, assuming you \ncould ever assemble enough of them to do the job the EPA says they like \nhere, can decide what falls under the jurisdiction, and they would be \ndeciding from a long way away. This kind of authority is barely able to \nbe exercised by the local city or county. It becomes even more \ncomplicated when the State department of natural resources gets \ninvolved. It would be impossible to do and will slow down both the \neconomy and add cost to families.\n  Thirty-one States, including mine--including this State here, where \nagain only the red part is covered by the waters of the United States \nrule--have sued the EPA to overturn the rule, and the courts appear to \nbe listening. The district court that covers our district and North \nDakota issued an injunction for 13 States. Then in early October, the \nSixth Circuit issued a nationwide stay on the rule.\n  So not only is the Congress concerned and involved, or a majority of \nthe Congress--unfortunately, only 59 Senators were concerned with \nsomething that 60 Senators could have solved--but so is Federal agency \nafter Federal agency, and the courts themselves are saying this should \nnot be allowed to happen.\n  I hope we see the Congressional Review Act put this issue exactly \nwhere it deserves to be--on the President's desk. He appointed the head \nof the EPA. The Senate confirmed the head of the EPA. I didn't vote to \nconfirm the head of the EPA. In fact, I held that nomination back as \nlong as I could possibly hold the nomination back, hoping the new \nnominee would suggest they were going to be better than the person who \nhad been holding the job before. This rule indicates the EPA doesn't \nreally have the best interest of the country at heart. They do not have \na reasonable way to enforce the authority they say they would like to \nhave. So I look forward to the President having to deal directly with \nthis issue and that the American people will pay attention, as we all \ndo, to the job we are sent here to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from \nMichigan for her outstanding remarks. I too want to talk about the \nbudget. We have agreed to a bipartisan budget framework, and that has \nbeen very good. We have avoided a shutdown, and we have avoided \ndefaulting on our debt. I am glad the brinkmanship that some on the \nother side of the aisle wanted to play did not prevail. That is a very \ngood thing.\n  Now we have to move forward. I want to join my colleagues to ask our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle to engage in a fair process on \nthe omnibus that must follow. The budget, after all, is only a \nblueprint. Now it is up to Democrats and Republicans to fill in all the \ndetails and honor the agreements that both sides worked to pass \ntogether. Already we have some on the other side of the aisle \nthreatening to insert policy riders that should have no business in an \nappropriations process, particularly a delicate one like this.\n  So first things first--let us be crystal clear. If folks on the other \nside of the aisle insist on inserting poison pill riders into the \nomnibus bill and the Republican leadership on either the House or \nSenate side goes along, they will be dragging us into another \ngovernment shutdown. We are happy to debate any of these so-called \npoison pill riders but not to use the whole budget process as a \nhostage.\n  The only reason that our colleagues who want these riders want to use \nthe budget process and hold, in fact, the whole rest of the American \npeople hostage is because they know they can't win on their own. They \ncan only do it by hostage-taking, by saying we won't fund the \ngovernment or this part of the government unless we get our way on \nthese nonrelated riders. Well, we Democrats, on both sides of the \nCapitol, at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, are totally united on \npreventing poison pill riders in riding along on an omnibus.\n  Yesterday, I was disappointed to hear Speaker Ryan, who I think is a \nfair man--and I have worked with him on a number of issues--say that he \nexpects to use the power of the purse to push riders. Again, the power \nof the purse does not give anyone the right to jam through ideological \nriders that can't stand on their own merits. The power of the purse \ndoesn't give anyone the right to hold government hostage until we \nrepeal parts of Dodd-Frank or defund Planned Parenthood. That doesn't \nmake any sense.\n  The power of the purse means, and has always meant in this grand \nRepublic in our history, that Democrats and Republicans, House and \nSenate, work together to produce a fair budget that strengthens our \nnational and economic security, free of poison pill riders.\n  Second, with respect to the timetable for these bills, I want to echo \nmy friend Senator Stabenow in saying we have to see the whole funding \npicture up front before we move to any comprehensive funding \nlegislation.\n  I understand our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to do \nDefense first--sure. Then what about the rest of the budget? In 2010, \nwe did Defense and then did a CR for the rest of the budget. And then \nit leaves the fight on riders undone.\n  Now, they say they need a vehicle. It is true. There are lots of \nvehicles. You don't need the Defense bill for a vehicle, No. 1, and, \nNo. 2, you don't have to do that vehicle now. What should be happening \nnow is the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans, should be \nnegotiating the whole picture, the whole omnibus. When they come to an \nagreement, we can then move them on the floor of the House and the \nSenate.\n  So we all agree the Nation breathed a sigh of relief when we agreed \nto a balanced framework that would see us lift the sequester caps for \ndomestic as well as defense spending. We can't be goaded into passing \nan increase in defense spending without seeing the rest of the omnibus \nto make sure both sides are part of it, because 50-50 was always part \nof the deal. Let us see the 50-50, and let us see the details.\n  What we also believe has to be part of the deal is no poison pill \nriders, whether they be Democratic or Republican. Those should be for \nanother day and not risk a government shutdown, which is still a very \nreal possibility if some of the ideologues have their way and say it is \nmy way or no way.\n  So for this budget agreement to work, we need to see each piece of \nthe appropriations puzzle before we move forward on defense spending. \nThat is not too much to ask. Democrats want a simple, fair process to \nfill in the blueprint we agreed on in the budget--no poison pill, no \nsleight of hand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S.J. Res. 22.\n  Mr. WICKER. And that deals with the waters of the United States rule; \nis that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. WICKER. If I could, I would also like to ask that Senator Blunt's \nposter be placed back on the easel, because I agree with what the \nSenator from Missouri had to say about the so-called waters of the \nUnited States rule. It is a massive Federal overreach, a massive \nFederal land grab with hardly any environmental benefit, if at all. The \nmap behind me of my neighboring State of Missouri points this out. \nEverything in red would be subject to regulation under the Clean Water \nAct. Almost every square inch of the State of Missouri and other States \nwould be subject to this massive overreach of a statute that was never \nintended to do that.\n  So I was pleased just a few weeks ago when the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Sixth Circuit pretty much agreed with us, on a temporary basis \nat least. They ordered a nationwide stay of the Obama administration's \nwholly unnecessary waters of the United States rule. I agree with the \ncourt's action. I agree with the 31 States that have filed lawsuits \nagainst this rule. I agree with the efforts in this Chamber to overturn \nit.\n  I appreciate Senator Barrasso's legislation entitled the Federal \nWater Quality Protection Act, and I certainly appreciate the efforts of \nthe junior Senator from Iowa, Senator Ernst, and will be supporting her \nefforts when we vote at the top of the hour.\n  The waters rule is an unlawful--unlawful--attempt by the EPA and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to wield enormous power over our Nation's land \nmass, as this chart points out very dramatically. Americans are \nconcerned--and Americans are right to be concerned--by this Federal \noverreach. The rule could have far-reaching effects on our lives and on \nour private property.\n  I am particularly concerned about what this rule could mean to our \nNation's farmers and ranchers, especially in States such as \nMississippi, where agriculture is one of the leading industries. The \nadministration's attempt to expand the scope of waters of the United \nStates under the Clean Water Act would lead to unprecedented regulatory \nauthority--unprecedented regulatory authority--and everything from \nproperty rights to economic development could be affected. Small ponds, \neven ditches would be subject to the decisions of Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  This expansion of Federal regulation could also adversely affect \nconservation efforts that are working at the State level in States such \nas Mississippi. We have begun considerable work with farm drainage \nditches to enhance conservation. The waters rule threatens to undermine \nthis important work. So it actually puts us back a step in terms of \nconservation.\n  Moreover, this rule makes States, cities, counties, and private \ncitizens vulnerable to confusing and expensive legal challenges.\n  Just get ready for the Federal Government to come in with legal \nchallenges. Because of the regulation's lack of clarity, the Federal \nGovernment could declare jurisdiction over almost any kind of land or \nwater, as this map of Missouri points out. Even areas that may have \nbeen streams or wetlands more than a century ago could come under the \nrule of this expansive regulation. The rule's exemptions do not make \nclear whether water in tile drains, for example, or erosion features on \nfarmlands could fall under Federal control. At the very least, these \nflaws should be fixed before the rule is fully implemented, and I do \nappreciate the efforts of the Senator from Iowa in challenging this.\n  Americans should worry and Americans should be concerned that the \nObama administration has pushed forward with this rule despite these \nlegitimate concerns being voiced over and over again by 31 States. \nState and local governments, farmers, small business owners, and \nlandowners are worried about how this unilateral expansion could lead \nto substantial compliance costs, fines, legal battles, and permitting \nrequirements--very expensive to job-creating agriculture and \nagribusiness.\n  As they do with many of the administration's other onerous rules, \nAmericans are asking: What is the benefit? What is the environmental \nbenefit here? No one is arguing that our waters should not be \nprotected, but water sources such as isolated ponds and ditches that do \nnot threaten to pollute navigable waters should not become a regulatory \nburden for States, for municipalities, or for private citizens.\n  I am a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee. I \nparticipated in a number of hearings on the WOTUS rule this year. It is \nclear the rule should be revised in a way that protects the rights of \nfarmers, ranchers, and landowners--and the American public, for that \nmatter.\n  Senator Ernst is absolutely correct. Her resolution of disapproval \nwould allow us to send this message to the EPA and the administration: \nAmericans do not deserve this unnecessary confusion and job-killing \nredtape.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in a few moments we will have an \nopportunity to vote on the Congressional Review Act, on the final rule \nunder the Clean Water Act on waters of the United States. Yesterday, I \nthought we had a rather robust discussion and debate about this, the \nBarrasso bill, which would have not only prevented the final rule from \ngoing forward but also would have changed the underlying bill. Cloture \nwas not invoked.\n  Now we are on the CRA--the Congressional Review Act--that would stop \nthe rule from going forward. Yesterday on the floor of the Senate, I \nexplained to my colleagues why I hope they will reject this motion and \nallow this rule to go forward. My main reason for saying that is that \nsince 1972, Congress has had a proud record on behalf of public health, \non behalf of our environment and protecting the people of this country \nfrom the dangers of dirty water. Before the Clean Water Act, we saw \nrivers that caught fire. In the Chesapeake Bay, we had the first marine \ndead zones reported. We made a commitment as a nation that we were \ngoing to do something about clean water, and Congress in a very \nbipartisan way passed the Clean Water Act as a commitment to the people \nof this country that we would take steps to protect their drinking \nwater, to protect their public health, and to protect their environment \nso that the legacy would be cleaner water for future generations.\n  This Clean Water Act--the reason why we have this rule is because of \na couple of Supreme Court decisions which basically unsettled what most \npeople understood to be regulated waters. By a 5-to-4 decision in \nRapanos, the Supreme Court's ruling sent it back to EPA to come up with \nadditional regulatory guidance, throwing into question the well-\nestablished thoughts that waters generally that flow into our streams, \ninto our wetlands, and into our water supply were regulated waters. So \nthis final rule is a response to the Supreme Court decisions in order \nto give clarity to those who are affected by the Clean Water Act. So if \nwe reject the rule, we are, in fact, removing clarity and we will go \nback to the stage where people don't know whether a particular water is \nregulated under the Clean Water Act.\n  I was listening to my colleagues on the floor give examples of where \nthey say regulation will take place, when, in fact, in agriculture, \nthere is basically no change in the regulatory structure. There are no \nnew permitting requirements for agricultural activities.\n  If we don't go forward with the regulation, the risk factor is that \napproximately one-half of the stream miles in this country will not be \nfully protected. That is a huge risk to the public health of the people \nof this country.\n  Approximately 20 million acres of wetlands will not be regulated. \nWetlands are the last frontier to filter water before it enters our \nwater systems, our streams, our drinking water supplies. Do we really \nwant to call into question that type of deregulation of clean water, \nwhich is critically important to public health and the drinking water \nsupplies of Americans?\n  If this rule does not go forward, the source of the drinking water of \napproximately 117 million Americans will be compromised. One-third of \nthe people of this country will see that we are not fully protecting \ntheir drinking water, and if we have an episode, they will be asking \nwhat did we do in order to protect their basic health. They expect us \nto make sure that when they turn their tap on, they get safe drinking \nwater, and that when they bathe, they have safe water in order to \nbathe, and we are not doing everything we can\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\nto do that if, in fact, we block this rule from going forward.\n  In reality, what we are doing is saying: No, we are not going to let \nscience guide what goes forward; Congress is going to tell us whether \nthe EPA can regulate our water based upon science. I don't think we \nwant this to be a political decision; I think we want this to be a \nscientific decision.\n  As I said earlier, agriculture practices are not changed under this \nfinal rule. Many have mentioned the court challenge. Any regulation \ncoming up by EPA is going to be subject to court challenge. We know \nthat. And the courts have not been helpful. The 5-to-4 decision left a \nlot in question. Ultimately, we are going to have to rely upon a court \ndecision. Let's get there sooner rather than later and not go back to \nthe drawing board and delay the necessary regulations for our country.\n  Yesterday on the floor, I quoted from business leaders, environment \nleaders, small business leaders. Let me share a couple other quotes \nabout why it is important for us to allow this rule to go forward. Let \nme talk about a business concern. This is a quote from Travis Campbell, \npresident and CEO of Far Banks Enterprises, an integrated manufacturer \nand distributor of fly fishing products. He says:\n\n       My company depends on people enjoying their time recreating \n     outside, especially in or near watersheds. Clarifying which \n     waterways are protected under Clean Water Act isn't a nice-\n     to-have, it is a business imperative.\n\n  Allowing this rule to go forward helps America's businesses, helps \nour economy.\n  I will give two quotes on the health issue.\n  This is from Dr. Alan Peterson, a family physician in Lancaster \nCounty, PA. He said:\n\n       Because it would protect the streams that are the \n     headwaters of drinking water supplies for 1 in 3 U.S. \n     residents, this rule is a health imperative.\n\n  Lastly, a person who used to be our health secretary in Maryland, Dr. \nGeorges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health \nAssociation, stated:\n\n       Our nation relies on clean water for basic survival--it's \n     essential for daily activities including drinking, cooking, \n     bathing, and recreational use. When that water is polluted, \n     Americans are at risk of exposure to a number of harmful \n     contaminants. We are pleased that EPA has moved forward with \n     this strong, evidence-based rule that will be vital to \n     protecting the public from water pollution and keeping our \n     nation healthy.\n\n  For the sake of our public health and the sake of our environment, \nfor the sake of our economy, and for the legacy of this Congress to \nprotect the people of this Nation, I urge my colleagues to reject the \nmotion that would stop the final waters of the United States rule from \ngoing into effect.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. ERNST. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes on the \njoint resolution that is before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, we have a choice today to stand with our \nfarmers, ranchers, small businesses, manufacturers, and homebuilders, \nor stand with an overreaching Federal agency pushing an illegal rule \ngreatly expanding its power. That is an easy choice for me. I am \nstanding with my constituents. I am standing with Iowans.\n  Rolling back this harmful WOTUS rule is hugely important to my State \nand, I know, to many others. I especially wish to thank the junior \nSenator from Wyoming and the senior Senator from Oklahoma for all their \nhard work on this issue. I also wish to thank those from the other side \nof the aisle who recognize the harm this rule will have and are \nsupporting this bipartisan effort to halt an expanded WOTUS.\n  I am proud to stand with them and all of my other colleagues who have \ndecided to act today to push back against yet another power grab by the \nEPA. This is what the American people expect. They expect us to take \nthe votes and debate the issues of the day, not simply put in writing \nhow we may do our job tomorrow when it is more convenient or wait for \nthe courts to solve a clear problem.\n  Every community wants to have clean water and to protect our Nation's \nwaterways. No one is disputing that. I grew up on well water. I \nunderstand that clean water is essential, but that is not what this \nvote today is about.\n  To build on what the junior Senator from North Dakota, my colleague \nfrom across the aisle, said yesterday, to suggest that 31 States, \nagricultural groups, the Association of Counties, our Governors, \nmunicipalities--that we are all wrong is absolutely insulting.\n  Look at this grass waterway behind me. This is from Iowa. This was \ntaken by one of my staff members as he was out on RAGBRAI, the \nRegister's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa. This is what we are \ndebating. This is what the rule is about. Should Washington, DC, \nbureaucrats control the land in this farmer's field? The clear answer \nis no, they should not.\n  As so many of my colleagues mentioned yesterday and this morning, \nthis confusing WOTUS rule threatens the livelihoods of rural \ncommunities and middle-class Americans. It threatens to impede small \nbusinesses and manufacturing. It impacts middle-class Americans. These \npeople are the backbone of this country. How can these industries \nflourish when under this rule they will be faced with excessive \npermitting requirements that will delay future projects and \nconservation efforts? They can't.\n  Yesterday we saw many of our colleagues across the aisle block a \ncommonsense bipartisan measure designed to stop the harmful impacts of \nthis rule. They claimed this rule is grounded in science and the law. \nScience and the law? Really? The Army Corps' memos show that the \nscience was blatantly ignored by the EPA in favor of politics, and two \nFederal courts have already called into serious question the legality \nof this WOTUS rule and the science behind it.\n  This claim is in spite of the fact that Members on the other side \nvoted for Senator Barrasso's legislation yesterday. This is in spite of \nthe fact that Members of the other side also support this legislation, \nand this is in spite of the fact that 11 Democrats sent a letter to the \nEPA yesterday stating their concern over serious issues with this rule. \nYet this administration continues to unilaterally enforce its harmful \nagenda on the American people.\n  We must take a stand, put our constituents first, put American jobs \nfirst, and say: No more, Mr. President. It is time to put politics and \nideology aside and start listening to the commonsense voices of the \nAmerican people. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I haven't talked about the popularity of \nthe Clean Water Act, but every poll has shown that the overwhelming \nmajority of Americans support what EPA is doing in protecting our water \nsupply. They are for this rule. They are for a commonsense, science-\nbased way to protect their drinking water. They are for a \nscientifically based, commonsense way to make sure that their rivers \nare clean. Whether it is because of their concern for the environment \nand their children and grandchildren's health or whether it is their \nconcern about our economy, recognizing that clean water is necessary \nfor agriculture and for our activities--recreational activities along \nour waterways which are critical to our economy--for all of those \nreasons they support the Clean Water Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the rule. It doesn't regulate new \nactivities in agriculture. It doesn't require anything different than \nhas been historically the role of the Clean Water Act in protecting our \nwaters. It deals with waters that are affecting our water supply. It \ndoesn't deal with isolated ponds. It doesn't deal with ditches. They \nare not regulated under this law any differently than they were in the \npast.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at what is in this regulation, not the \nclaims that have been made. The EPA listened to the different interest \ngroups. There were over 400 meetings with stakeholders across the \ncountry to provide information, hear concerns, and answer their \nquestions. EPA officials visited\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nfarms in Arizona, Colorado, my home State of Maryland, Mississippi, \nMissouri, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont.\n  The 207-day public comment period on the proposed rule resulted in \nmore than 1 million comments. All of this public input helped to shape \nthe final clean water rule. The act does not require any new permitting \nfrom the agricultural community. There is an exemption under the \nexisting Clean Water Act, which is preserved by this final rule. Normal \nfarming, silviculture, and ranching practices--those activities that \ninclude plowing, seeding, cultivating, minor drainage, and harvesting \nfor production of food, fiber, and forest products--are exempt. They \nare not covered under this final Clean Water Act. Soil and water \nconservation practices and dry land are exempt. Agricultural storm \nwater discharges are exempt. Return flows from irrigated agriculture, \nconstruction, and maintenance of farm or stock ponds or irrigation \nditches on dry land are not covered under the rule. Maintenance of \ndraining ditches is not covered under the rule. Construction or \nmaintenance of farm, forest, and temporary mining roads are not \ncovered.\n  When my colleagues come in and say that this ditch is being regulated \nunder the Clean Water Act, it is not the case. Only those flows of \nwater that directly impact our streams, impact our wetlands--those you \nwant to make sure we cover because they affect our drinking water \nsupply for one out of every three Americans, because they affect our \npublic health for those of us who swim in our streams and our lakes, \nand because they affect those of us who enjoy the recreation of clean \nwater. That is why we have small business owners. That is why we have \nthe businesses that depend upon clean water. That is why we have a lot \nof people around the country saying: Look, it is in our economic \ninterest to make sure this rule goes forward.\n  The bottom line is, the stakeholders need clarity. This rule will \nallow that process to go forward so that we can get clarity in the \nimplementation of the Clean Water Act, which was jeopardized not by \nCongress and not by EPA but by the Supreme Court's decisions. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure that clarity exists.\n  If Congress blocks this clean water rule from going forward, we are \nadding to the uncertainty that is in no one's interest, whether it is a \nperson who depends upon safe drinking water or the safe environment or \na farmer who wants to know what is regulated and what is not. All of \nthat very much depends upon clarity moving forward.\n  EPA listened to all the stakeholders, and it is important to allow \nthis rule to go forward. I urge my colleagues to reject this effort to \nstop the final act from going forward. Let our legacy to our children \nand grandchildren be safe, clean water for drinking and recreational \npurposes for our economy. Since 1972, we have had a proud history of \nallowing and building upon safe and clean water. I urge my colleagues \nto reject this effort to stop this rule from going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The joint resolution having been \nread the third time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 2685.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 118, H.R. 2685, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2193\n\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, our country does many things well, but our \ngovernment in Washington often fails the people whom it exists to \nprotect. One of the best examples is the Obama administration's failure \nto enforce our Nation's immigration laws, despite the American people's \ncontinued demands that the Federal Government follow its duty to do so.\n  It is worth noting that just yesterday the voters of San Francisco \nvoted to replace the sheriff who had defended the sanctuary city \npolicy. That is a striking statement of where the American people are \non this issue.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrats in the Nation's Capitol refuse to listen \nto the American people. Just 2 weeks ago, Senate Democrats blocked a \nbill that would have imposed a 5-year minimum mandatory sentence on \ncriminal aliens who have illegally reentered the country. This issue is \ntoo important to give up and this fight is far from over. That is why I \nintend to call up Kate's Law for its urgent and immediate passage in \nthe Senate. This bill is named in honor of Kate Steinle, who died \ntragically in the arms of her father on a San Francisco pier after \nbeing fatally shot by an illegal alien who had been deported from the \nUnited States multiple times.\n  When it comes to stopping sanctuary cities and protecting our safety, \nwe need governing, we need leadership, and we need elected officials in \nWashington to listen to the people we are elected to represent. We need \nto actually fix the problem. Enough hot air, let's demonstrate we can \ncome together and solve this problem. This ought to be a clear choice. \nWith whom do you stand? Do you stand with violent criminal illegal \naliens or do you stand with American citizens? Do you stand with our \nsons and daughters and those at risk of violent crime? I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will come together and stand in bipartisan \nsupport that we stand with the American people.\n  I will note that Bill O'Reilly has been tremendous, calling over and \nover again on leaders of this body simply to pass Kate's Law. This is \nnot a partisan\n\n[[Page S7744]]\n\nissue, at least it should not be. We should stand with American \ncitizens. I am reminded of the heartbreaking words of Kate Steinle as \nshe lay in her father's arms. She simply said: ``Dad, help me.'' Well, \nwe have an opportunity to determine if we are willing to listen to her \ndying words, if we are willing to stand with her. I would note, by the \nway, this should not be a red State-blue State issue.\n  For the people of San Francisco to throw out of office the sheriff \nresponsible for the policies that led directly to Kate Steinle's murder \nindicates that even in the bluest of blue cities and the bluest of blue \nStates, the American people are tired of politicians standing with \nviolent criminal illegal aliens. This should bring us together. We \nshould stand together and say we will protect the American citizens.\n  I will tell you, the Obama administration's record on this is \nshocking. In 2013, the Obama administration released from detention \nroughly 36,000 convicted criminal aliens who were awaiting the outcomes \nof deportation proceedings. These criminal aliens were responsible for \n193 homicide convictions. They were responsible for 426 sexual assault \nconvictions. They were responsible for 303 kidnapping convictions. They \nwere responsible for 1,075 aggravated assault convictions. They were \nresponsible for 16,070 drunk driving convictions.\n  On top of that, the Obama administration had another 68,000 illegal \nimmigrants with criminal convictions whom the Federal Government \nencountered but never even bothered to take into custody for \ndeportation. That is over 104,000 criminal illegal aliens the Obama \nadministration is responsible for releasing to the public.\n  I ask my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle how you look in \nthe eyes of a father or mother who has lost their loved one because of \na violent criminal illegal alien, who has murdered, who has raped, who \nhas assaulted, who has kidnapped, who has brutalized your child? We are \nresponsible for the consequences of our actions. Kate's Law is \ncommonsense legislation. It is legislation that says: If a criminal \nillegal alien who is an aggravated felon--who is the worst of the \nworst--illegally reenters this country, comes in a second time, that \ncriminal illegal alien will face a mandatory minimum of 5 years in \nprison.\n  If Kate's Law had been passed 5 years ago, Kate Steinle would still \nbe alive. That means every Democrat who stands up and blocks Kate's Law \nneeds to be prepared to explain why standing with violent criminal \nillegal aliens is more important than protecting American citizens.\n  I am proud to have joining me as cosponsors of Kate's Law Senator \nGrassley, Senator Vitter, Senator Rubio, and Senator Perdue. They are \nall coming together in what should be bipartisan leadership to protect \nthe American citizens.\n  Mr. President, accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2193; further, that the \nbill be read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nmade and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  A unanimous consent request is pending before the body. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the new mandatory minimum sentences this \nbill would create would have a crippling financial effect--that is an \nunderstatement--with no evidence that they would actually deter future \nviolations of law. This legislation would require about 20,000 new \nprison beds--20,000--12 new prisons and cost over $3 billion.\n  This is yet another attack on the immigrant. The reason this bill did \nnot go through the Judiciary Committee is because Republican Senators \nobjected to it going through the committee. In the House, Speaker Ryan \nsaid he cannot trust the President to do immigration reform. In the \nSenate, after passing a bipartisan bill in 2013, all we have seen from \nRepublican leaders and their caucus are bills to attack immigrants and \nto tear families apart. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, you know I will tell you it is sad that the \nDemocratic leader chooses to stand with violent criminal illegal aliens \ninstead of American citizens, but even sadder is that he impugns legal \nimmigrants. When the Democratic leader suggests that incarcerating \naggravated felons, murderers, and rapists who illegally enter the \ncountry is somehow a slight to immigrants--I am the son of an immigrant \nwho came legally from Cuba. There is no one in this Chamber who will \nstand and fight harder for legal immigrants than I will. For the \nDemocratic leader to cynically suggest that somehow immigrants should \nbe lumped into the same bucket as murderers and rapists, it \ndemonstrates the cynicism of the modern Democratic Party, it \ndemonstrates just how out of touch the modern Democratic Party is.\n  You know who does not agree with the Democratic leader? The voters of \nSan Francisco--I would venture to say almost all of whom consider \nthemselves Democrats. Yet they just voted out the sheriff for saying \nbasically the same thing the Democratic leader did, for saying that the \nDemocratic Party stands with violent felon illegal immigrants instead \nof the American citizens.\n  Let's listen to what the Democratic leader just said: Gosh, it would \ncost too much to incarcerate aggravated felons who illegally reenter \nthe country. If it costs too much to lock up murderers, rapists, \nkidnappers, then you know what, we need to spend the money it needs to \nlock up every single murderer we can. I am sorry the Democratic Party \ndoes not want to spend the money to lock up murderers, and instead \napparently it is cheaper to lose our sons and daughters. I think we \nhave the resources to lock up murderers. There should be no confusion \nwhere the parties stand.\n  The Democratic leader suggested that locking up aggravated felons is \nsomehow disrespectful to immigrants. With all respect, as the son of an \nimmigrant, I believe immigrants who come here legally, who are not \ncriminals, should be treated markedly different from murderers and \nrapists. Yet the Democratic Party chooses to stand with the murderers, \nrapists, and violent criminals. That is unfortunate, indeed.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 224\n\n  Mr. President, I would now like to turn to a second matter. This is a \nmatter I have raised a number of times on the Senate floor and intend \nto continue raising. It is the matter of the human rights abuses in the \nPeople's Republic of China. I would like to talk about some specific \nexamples, starting with the one-child policy. I want to talk to you \nabout Feng Jianmei.\n  PRC officials forced Feng Jianmei, who was 7 months pregnant with her \nsecond daughter, to undergo an abortion. While her husband Deng Jiyuan \nwas at work, five family planning officials abducted Ms. Feng on June \n2, 2012. When she could not pay the fine of 40,000 RMB, they restrained \nher and forcibly aborted her daughter.\n  As her husband recounted, ``At the hospital, they held her down. They \ncovered her head with a pillowcase. She could not do anything because \nthey were restraining her.'' The so-called ``medics'' forced her to \n``sign'' an abortion consent form by inking her thumb and pressing it \nagainst the paper. Then they proceeded to inject toxins into the brain \nof her unborn daughter.\n  After the injection, Jianmei suffered excruciating contractions until \n3 a.m. on June 4. Then, having received no anesthesia, she gave birth \nto her deceased child. Jianmei said:\n\n       I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the \n     time, but then she went still. It was much more painful than \n     my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless. She was all \n     purple and blue.\n\n  In an act of heartlessness that is difficult to comprehend, the so-\ncalled doctors who performed this abortion left the lifeless body of \nFeng's 7-month-old\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nbaby on her bed beside her, leaving a bereaved mother with nothing but \nthe sight of what could have been. Feng Jianmei's father-in-law rushed \nto the hospital, but family planning officials prevented him from \nseeing Jianmei until after the abortion.\n  After seeing her mother for the first time after her forced abortion, \nFeng's elder daughter innocently inquired, ``What happened to your \ntummy? Where did the baby go?''\n  Reggie Littlejohn, a world-renowned human rights activist who broke \nthis story in the United States, stated in the wake of this tragic \nstory: ``This is an outrage. No legitimate government would commit or \ntolerate such an act.''\n  China is among the leading nations in suicide rates. It is the only \nnation where more women commit suicide than men. A large contributing \nfactor to this morose distinction is the totalitarian one-child policy.\n  Another example is the crackdown on lawyers. When the United States \nengages with China in any sort of bilateral negotiation or agreement, \nwe have to understand that the rule of law is not a reality in the PRC. \nDespite laws duly passed by the National People's Congress, and a \nsupposed Constitution, the reality since 1949 remains unchanged: China \nhas a ``rule of the party''--the Communist Party--and it is ready to \npunish anyone who challenges its violation of the law within the legal \nsystem.\n  The latest example is human rights lawyer Pu Zhiquiang. In early May \n2014, Pu attended a small, private seminar where the participants \ndiscussed the Tiananmen Square Massacre and the party's violent \nsuppression of students. Pu was a student leader during the infamous \n1989 protests, so marking the auspicious occasion was no doubt of \npersonal importance to him.\n  The following month Pu was arrested and charged with ``illegally \nobtaining personal information of citizens'' and ``picking quarrels and \nprovoking trouble.'' As the year progressed, PRC authorities added \nadditional charges ``inciting splittism'' and ``inciting ethnic \nhatred.'' In May 2015, a Beijing court officially indicted Pu on two of \nthese charges, and he remains in custody today.\n  While legal officials cited Pu's criticisms of the PRC's treatment of \nthe Uighur ethnic minorities, his real offenses were taking cases and \nrepresenting victims of forced eviction and shining a light on China's \nlabor camps. His defendants included a who's who of China's prominent \npolitical dissidents, including Liu Xiaobo--a brave, selfless action \nthat undoubtedly painted a target on Pu's back.\n  Prior to his arrest, the PRC praised Pu as a paragon of social \njustice. The state-run China Newsweek magazine named Mr. Pu the most \ninfluential person in promoting the rule of law in 2013. This is a \nmicrocosm of life in authoritarian China: Compliance with the party and \ncompliance with the law are often at odds, and the party always wins.\n  In the past year, Beijing has detained and jailed hundreds of \nactivists standing for the rule of law, ideals the party ostensibly \nespouses. Words are one thing; public embarrassment of public officials \nis quite another. Xi Jinping and his cohorts cannot abide the erosion \nof their credibility or anything that would threaten their legitimacy.\n  A third example is Pastor Zhang Shaojie. Under President Xi, the \natheist Communist Party of China has targeted Christianity for special \noppression. Using a campaign in Zhejiang--a province which President Xi \nran earlier in his career--to forcibly remove crosses from churches, in \nsome cases, the PRC has gone on to bulldoze entire churches and to \narrest pastors and congregants for standing boldly for their faith.\n  Persecution of Christianity is not confined to Zhejiang. One such \nvictim of this crackdown is Pastor Zhang Shaojie. On July 24, 2014, the \nNanle County People's Court, ignoring domestic and international due \nprocess provisions, sentenced Pastor Zhang Shaojie to 12 years in \nprison on a count of ``fraud'' and ``gathering a crowd to disrupt \npublic order.''\n  Again, arrest charges in China do not reflect reality. Prior to his \narrest, Pastor Zhang was defending the rights of his church in regard \nto the land they had purchased. Pastor Zhang and his parishioners \ntraveled to Beijing three times in November 2013 seeking resolution of \nthe land dispute. Maybe this is what the People's Court meant by \n``fraud.'' According to his congregants, the minister also had a \nministry of helping victims of legal injustice seek restitution. \nPerhaps this is what the Communist Party referred to in its charge of \n``disrupting public order.''\n  The following month, the Puyang Municipality Intermediate People's \nCourt rejected Zhang's appeal.\n  In October, the Nanle County Court threatened to auction off Zhang's \nhouse to pay for a court-ordered fine, ordering Zhang's family to leave \nthe house by October 26. In response, Zhang's mother physically stood \nbetween the Chinese officials and her home, holding gasoline in one \nhand and a lighter in the other.\n  It is a sad reflection of China's supposed progress on human rights \nwhen a citizen feels her only recourse against a dictatorial regime is \nthe threat of self-immolation.\n  His sister, having been detained, along with several of Pastor \nZhang's parishioners, suffered in one of China's most infamous black \nprisons for 1\\1/2\\ years. Her words, penned in this letter, require no \nsubstitute:\n\n       I am Zhang Cuijian, one of the Nanle County Christian \n     Church members detained in 2013. When my brother was \n     kidnapped, I went with other church members to the public \n     security bureau for information about his detention. \n     Unexpectedly, I became the target of arrest, as well as more \n     than a dozen other church members. We became prisoners who \n     were unprepared and innocent. The prison was hell on earth; \n     no other words can describe it.\n       In prison, I was very grateful. I truly felt that God was \n     with me, even though I suffered punishment in prison. I had a \n     thankful heart; I had joy from God. I deeply know my true and \n     living God. While my body suffered, my heart was free. God \n     let me learn different life lessons. I know that the more \n     persecution I endure, the greater the blessing.\n\n  In America, we should stand with victims of oppression. In America, \nwe should stand with Christians being persecuted by the brutal \nCommunist totalitarian dictatorship. In America, we should stand for \nwomen's rights. Women being forced to have abortions are horrific acts \nof brutality. They are inhumane. They are contrary not only to American \nvalues but to human rights across the globe, and they are carried out \nas a matter of policy in the People's Republic of China.\n  When it comes to Chinese oppression, when it comes to Communist \noppression, this is not an abstract or academic matter for me. My \nfamily has been tortured at the hands of Communists in Cuba. My father \nwas imprisoned and tortured by Batista in Cuba, and my aunt was \nimprisoned and tortured by Castro's Communist goons in Cuba.\n  Communist oppression is real, and we have a powerful example of what \nAmerica could do. When the Soviet Union was in power, this body renamed \nthe street in front of the Soviet Embassy ``Sakharov Plaza.'' Renaming \nthat was done by President Reagan.\n  Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley introduced the resolution in this body. \nEvery day the Soviet officials had to write on the address of their \nEmbassy: ``Sakharov Plaza,'' honoring the imprisoned dissident. This \nresolution is to use the same power of moral clarity, the same power of \nshaming, and the same power of speaking the truth to shine a light on \nthe oppression in China.\n  When Senator Grassley took the lead with Sakharov Plaza, that helped \nshame the Soviet Union into changing their conduct. We should use the \nsame moral authority with respect to the People's Republic of China.\n  My resolution is cosponsored by Senator Rubio, Senator Toomey, and \nSenator Sasse. It was on a path to being unanimously approved in this \nbody. Every Republican had signed off on it and initially every \nDemocrat had as well. Yet moments before it was about to pass the \nSenate, unfortunately the senior Senator from California decided to \ncome to the floor and object.\n  After objecting, after blocking its passage, Senator Feinstein put \nout a press release, a press release with which I agree emphatically. \nSenator Feinstein observed, powerfully, that ``we urgently request the \nChinese government to allow Liu Xia to seek medical treatment abroad \nand release Liu Xiabo, the world's only jailed Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate.''\n  Senator Feinstein was exactly right. If anything should bring us \ntogether in\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\nbipartisan agreement, it should be against the Communist Party's \nwrongful imprisonment and oppression of a Nobel Peace laureate. Yet \nsadly, each time I have attempted to follow the successful pattern of \nSakharov Plaza, to rename the street in front of the Chinese Embassy \n``Liu Xiabo Plaza,'' the senior Senator from California stood and \nobjected.\n  For the life of me I cannot understand why any Member of this body \nwould choose to stand with Communist Party oppressors against \ndissidents, against human rights, against women's rights, against the \nrights of those standing to speak for freedom.\n  Yes, we have to negotiate with the Chinese. Yes, we have to talk to \nthem. Just like in the Cold War, we negotiated at Reykjavik with \nGorbachev, but we did it from moral authority and truth.\n  If we are afraid of even embarrassing the Communist Party, if their \nconduct doesn't embarrass them, we shouldn't shy away from speaking the \ntruth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be discharged from further consideration \nof and the Senate now proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 224. I \nask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be \nagreed to, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and \nthis is the first time I will have objected, I would like--since my \nname was raised and a communication of mine was read--to explain the \ncircumstances.\n  Yes, this is a press release that I wrote, and, yes, I do feel that \nthe wife of this man should be released from house arrest and the man \nhimself, the Nobel laureate, should be released by the Chinese. He has \ncertainly served time for a substantial period, and more than that I do \nnot believe it works to the benefit of China, the family, human rights \nor the progress of the country.\n  Unlike the Senator from Texas, I have had a long experience with the \nChinese, going back more than 30 years. I know what can convince them \nto move toward a goal and I know what will become a real stumbling \nblock and a point of opposition. To change the name of a street on \nwhich the Chinese Embassy in the United States rests will only be a \ngreater stumbling block to achieving this goal, so I will object to \nthat.\n  Since my name was also raised--or San Francisco's name was raised in \nhis prior discussion, I would respectfully ask if I could make a few \nremarks about Kate Steinle and the situation the Senator from Texas has \nraised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Respectfully, Senator, I do not believe that you know much about San \nFrancisco. I am a lifelong San Franciscan. I served the city as a mayor \nfor 9 years, president of the board of supervisors for 7 years, and \nanother 8 years as supervisor. I believe I know something about the \ncity of my birth, my education.\n  The reason for the defeat of the sheriff is multifaceted. It doesn't \njust begin with one thing, and I want you to know that.\n  With respect to the situation we spoke about, which is whether a \nlocal sheriff should in fact respond to a Federal Government request, \nif that request is for a detainer, if that request is for a \ncommunication, I believe very strongly that sheriff should do that. And \nwas that part of the campaign of the sheriff that is going to be the \nsheriff-elect? I can't say with any specificity, but I can say that is \nmy belief.\n\n  I think going overboard and punishing everybody makes very little \nsense. So I am hopeful the Department of Homeland Security, through its \nefforts with the PEP program, will be able to secure cooperation from \nthe city and county of San Francisco. If it does not, then that is \nanother story. But I believe the Department is making headway in \ndiscussions with other communities that are in fact sanctuary cities.\n  Since we are on the subject, in 1985, as mayor of the city, I was the \nfirst person to be sought out by the archbishop who asked for a brief \nreprieve or a reprieve for nuns from El Salvador, and that was the \nfirst piece of legislation. It was small and it was restricted to a \ncountry that was in a civil war with some terrible things happening. \nSince that time, the sanctuary concept has expanded considerably and, \nto some extent, I think far beyond what it should be. But I think the \nway to do this is through hearings and discussion among the Members and \nnot with over-the-top rhetoric that moves visceral impulses--because we \nhave to live, Senator, by the public policy we espouse, and we have to \nknow that it is wise and prudent. I deeply believe that.\n  So I just wanted to clarify the record, and I thank the Senator for \nallowing me to do so.\n  I yield the floor, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I would note with regard to Kate's Law, the \nsenior Senator from California just said that going overboard and \npunishing everyone is not something we should do. This is reprising the \nsame thing the Democratic leader said--that somehow incarcerating \naggravated felons is punishing everybody.\n  As the son of an immigrant, I take offense at the suggestion from the \nDemocratic Party that every immigrant is somehow an aggravated felon. \nIncarcerating murderers and rapists is not punishing everybody.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator allow a question?\n  Mr. CRUZ. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I don't believe there is anything I said that related \nto our letting aggravated murderers and others who would reap great \nharm to our society. I do not favor that, and I would like the record \nto clearly reflect that.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I would note the senior Senator from California \ncharacterized Kate's Law--and this is a verbatim quote--as ``going \noverboard and punishing everyone.'' Kate's Law is targeted only to \naggravated felons. It is only murderers and rapists and other violent \ncriminals--those who have committed aggravated felonies and have \nreentered the country illegally.\n  So what the Democratic Party has attempted to do, what the Democratic \nleader has attempted to do is to suggest that incarcerating illegal \nimmigrants who are murderers and rapists is somehow maligning or \nimpugning immigrants. To the contrary, it is targeting violent \ncriminals. I do not believe the millions of legal immigrants who \nfollowed the rules, like my father did, are in any way swept into a law \nthat is targeting aggravated felons.\n  Aggravated felons is a discreet category. Had Kate's Law passed 5 \nyears ago, Kate Steinle would still be alive today.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I might respond--I think the Senator from Texas is \na member of the Judiciary Committee, I am a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is on the floor. \nIt is something we ought to take a look at. I haven't reviewed the case \nlaw, I don't think ever on this specific point, and I would like an \nopportunity to do so. But what I really bristle to is the extreme \nrhetoric and throwing everybody into the same basket as somebody who is \na violent criminal, because the immigrants whom I know in California by \nand large are not violent criminals. They are family people. They \nsustain the No. 1 agricultural industry in America. They work hard, \nthey pay their taxes, they get in line for legalization, they are good \ncitizens, and our economy is better for them, not worse. So I don't \nwant to impugn everybody, which your broad, sweeping language, \ncandidly, does.\n  Mr. CRUZ. With respect, I would note that the only overreaching \nrhetoric that has been heard on this floor has come from the Democratic \nleader, suggesting somehow that targeting violent criminals is \ntargeting all immigrants.\n  It is worth noting that Kate's Law addresses only aggravated felons. \nSo the suggestion of the senior Senator from California that we should \nnot assume aggravated felons are criminals is a statement that, on its \nface, makes no sense. They are by definition. It is only the violent \ncriminals--the aggravated felons--that this is targeted to.\n  I will say I am encouraged, though, that the senior Senator from \nCalifornia\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nstated she would become interested in the Judiciary Committee taking \nthis up. As she noted, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is here. \nThere is unanimous support on the Republican side of the aisle, and it \nwould truly be significant if the senior Senator from California were \nwilling to join with Republicans in targeting actual aggravated felons, \nwhich is what Kate's Law does.\n  The Senator from California says she doesn't want overheated \nrhetoric. The rhetoric has been coming from the Democratic side. What I \nhave been saying is we should not be releasing violent criminal illegal \naliens. That is a commonsense proposition that the overwhelming \nmajority of the American people agree with.\n  Let me also make a point about the objection of the senior Senator \nfrom California--for the third time now--to my effort to stand up to \nCommunist Chinese oppression. It is one thing for Members of this body \nto give a good speech, to send a letter, and to put out a press \nrelease. That is something Washington does a lot. It is something we \nare really quite good at. It is another thing to act. We should be \nacting. We should be leading.\n  Now, the Senator suggested this would be counterproductive. I would \nnote that the senior Senator from California did not address the fact \nthat when we followed the exact same strategy in the 1980s under \nPresident Reagan, with Senator Grassley's leadership, in renaming the \nstreet in front of the Soviet Embassy Sakharov Plaza, it had a very \npositive effect. Now, the Soviets didn't like it. They howled mightily. \nBut the heat and light and attention of world scrutiny helped to change \ntheir behavior and helped to win the Cold War.\n  To Liu Xiaobo, to Liu Xia, to all the human rights dissidents \nimprisoned in China, to the mothers who faced forcible abortions, I \nhope my words penetrate the dark prisons in which they are sitting. I \nhope my words serve as light and encouragement to each of them.\n  I think back to when my father and my aunt were in Cuban prisons, and \nhow much I would have liked leadership in the United States to shine a \nlight of hope and encouragement.\n  Some months ago, I met with Natan Sharansky in Jerusalem. He \ndescribed how, in the dark of a Soviet gulag, President Ronald Reagan's \nwords shined into that darkness and prisoners passed from cell to cell: \nDid you hear what President Reagan said? Evil empire, ash heap of \nhistory, tear down this wall. Those words, that moral clarity, that \nAmerican leadership for human rights changed the world. If we stand \ntogether, we can do the same thing with regard to China.\n  As much as I hope my words penetrate those cells, I pray the words \nand actions of the senior Senator from California do not penetrate \nthose cells. It saddens me that, in the face of unspeakable brutality \nand evil, the Democratic Senator chooses to align herself with the \nCommunist Party dictators rather than a Nobel Peace laureate.\n  My hope is that time and reflection will cause the senior Senator \nfrom California to recognize that we should be united in a bipartisan \nmanner in support of human rights. It is my hope that we stand \ntogether.\n  I intend to continue to submit this resolution over and over and \nover, because every time the light is shined on the grotesque evil of \nwhat China is doing, we are vindicating our values of who we are as \nAmericans. It is my hope, as I speak out to the Chinese American \ncitizens in California, in Texas, and across this country, that their \nvoices are heard by their senior Senator from California, that the \nChinese American citizens ask their senior Senator: Why is it that you \nare standing and defending the Communist Government in China for its \nhuman rights abuses?\n  That is not a question I would want to answer to my constituents whom \nI am charged with representing. It is my hope that all of us say: \nListen, we can disagree on all sorts of political matters. We can \ndisagree on marginal tax rates. But when it comes to forced abortions, \nwhen it comes to imprisoning and mistreating and torturing political \nprisoners, including a Nobel Peace laureate, the United States Senate \nstands in unanimity, 100 to nothing. That is my hope--that, in time, \ntruth will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I speak on the main subject for which I came to \nthe floor, I want to compliment the Senator from Texas for both of the \npoints he has made about the renaming of the street by the Chinese \nEmbassy and also for what he has done in regard to Kate's Law today.\n  Maybe something good has come out of his presentation on the floor, \neven though he wasn't able to proceed, in that if there is a real \ndesire in the Judiciary Committee, which I chair, for a bipartisan \napproach to getting mandatory sentences for criminal felons who have \nbeen deported and have come back into the country, so that we don't \nhave 121 people murdered in the future, as we have had in the last 5 \nyears--because of mandatory sentencing under Kate's Law--I would be \nglad to pursue that.\n  The reason this bill didn't go through the committee in the first \nplace is that we felt there would be every effort to stop it from \ngetting out of committee.\n\n\n                   Inspector General Empowerment Act\n\n  Before I go to my full prepared remarks, I want to tell my colleagues \nwhy we ought to pass the legislation I am going to refer to. I will \nsummarize by saying that the 1978 inspectors general law says that an \ninspector general is entitled to all material he needs in each agency \nto do the work that he has to do.\n  Well, about 3 months ago, probably at the behest of the FBI, a single \nperson in the Justice Department, in the Office of Legal Counsel, \nissued an opinion that said ``all'' doesn't mean all. So that means an \ninspector general has to go through a lot of redtape in order to get \nthe material he or she needs to do their job.\n  I don't need to tell my colleagues how important inspectors general \nare. They are important because they help us do our congressional job \nof oversight to ferret out waste, fraud, and mismanagement.\n  Americans have a right to know when our government is misbehaving or \nwasting taxpayer dollars. To ensure accountability and transparency in \ngovernment, Congress created inspectors general, sometimes referred to \nas IGs, as their eyes and ears within the executive branch.\n  Those independent watchdogs are uniquely positioned to help Congress \nand the public fight waste, fraud, and abuse in government. But IGs \ncannot do their job without timely and without independent access to \nall agency records. That is why ``all'' means all.\n  Agencies cannot be trusted to restrict the flow of potentially \nembarrassing documents to the IGs who oversee them. Watchdogs need \naccess to those documents to do their job. They are mandated by law to \nkeep Congress fully informed about waste, fraud, and abuse problems. If \nthe agencies can keep IGs in the dark, then this Congress will be kept \nin the dark as well. If given the chance, agencies will almost always \nchoose to hide their problems from scrutiny. In other words, the \npublic's business that ought to be public sometimes does not become \npublic and there is less accountability.\n\n  Getting back to the 1978 act, when Congress passed this act, we very \nexplicitly said that IGs should have access to all agency records. \nLet's get back to what happened. What happened was one person in the \nDepartment of Justice said that ``all'' doesn't mean all. Does it make \nsense to have one person out of the entire bureaucracies of the United \nStates make a ruling that when Congress says ``all'' means all, all of \na sudden ``all'' doesn't mean all?\n  If inspectors general deem a document necessary to do their job, then \nthe agency should turn it over immediately. Inspectors General are \ndesigned to be very independent but also to be a part of the agency. \nThey are inside so they can see when the laws aren't being followed, \nwhen the money isn't being spent according to law. They are there to \nhelp agency leadership identify and correct waste, fraud, and abuse. I \nwould hope every agency head appreciates a person whose main \nresponsibility is to help see that the law is followed.\n  Fights between an agency and its own inspector general over access to \ndocuments are a waste of time and a\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\nwaste of taxpayers' money. The law of 1978 requires that inspectors \ngeneral have access to all agency records precisely to avoid these \ncostly and time-consuming disputes. However, since 2010 a handful of \nagencies--led by the FBI, the law enforcement agency of the U.S. \nGovernment--has refused to comply with this legal obligation that \n``all'' means all. Agencies started to withhold documents and argued \nthat IGs are not entitled to ``all records'' even though that is \nexactly what the law says.\n  In other words, it is pretty simple: ``All'' means all. But on this \nisland of DC, surrounded by reality, maybe common sense doesn't prevail \nand maybe ``all'' doesn't mean all. The law was written to ensure that \nagencies cannot pick and choose when to cooperate with the IGs and when \nto withhold records. Unfortunately, that is precisely what several \nagencies started doing after this single person in the Department of \nJustice made this ruling.\n  The Justice Department claimed that the inspector general could not \naccess certain records until Department leadership gave them \npermission. Requiring prior approval from any agency leadership for \naccess to agency information undermines the inspector general's \nresponsibilities and, most often, his independence. That is bad enough, \nbut it also causes wasteful delays. It effectively thwarts inspector \ngeneral oversight. This is exactly the very opposite of the way the law \nis supposed to work.\n  After this access problem came to light, Congress took action. The \n2015 Department of Justice Appropriations Act declares that ``no funds \nprovided in this Act shall be used to deny the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Justice timely access to all records, documents, and \nother materials. . . . ''\n  The new law also directed the inspector general to report to Congress \nwithin 5 days whenever there was failure to comply with that statutory \nrequirement. In other words, these people take an oath to uphold the \nlaws. The law says ``all'' means all, and somehow they can ignore it.\n  In February alone, the Justice Department's inspector general \nnotified Congress on three separate occasions in which the FBI failed \nto provide access to records requested for oversight investigations. \nIGs for the Environmental Protection Agency, for the Department of \nCommerce, and for the Peace Corps have experienced similar \nstonewalling. Then, in July, the Justice Department's Office of Legal \nCounsel released a memo arguing that we did not really mean all records \nwhen we put those words in the law of the United States of America. \nThat is the one person I am talking about. The Office of Legal Counsel \nreleased this memo that says ``all'' doesn't mean all even though the \nlaw says ``all'' means all. So let me be clear. We meant what we said \nin the IG Act: All records really means, pretty simply, all records.\n  In early August, I chaired a hearing on this opinion and the \ndevastating impact it is already having on the work of inspectors \ngeneral across government. Multiple witnesses described how the opinion \nhandcuffed inspectors general and brought their important work to a \nstandstill. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service had already cited the \nmisguided Office of Legal Counsel opinion in order to justify stiff-\narming its IG access to all records.\n  Even the Justice Department's witness disagreed--get this--we had a \nJustice Department official testify, and that witness disagreed with \nthe results of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and directly told us \nthat we ought to support and initiate legislative action to solve the \nproblem.\n  Now, here is a high-level person, above the Office of Legal Counsel, \nsaying we ought to pass a bill to correct what that agency says had had \nan impact that wasn't surmised would happen--that we ought to pass a \nbill when they could just withdraw the Office of Legal Counsel ruling.\n  As a result of that testimony, following that hearing, 11 of my \ncolleagues and I sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the Department \nof Justice and to the inspector general community of the various \nagencies. In that letter, the chair and ranking member of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction in both the House and Senate asked for \nspecific legislative language to reaffirm that ``all'' means all for \nall inspectors general, every one of them.\n  It took the Justice Department 3 months to respond to that letter for \nthe very same thing they had testified about--that we ought to pass a \nlaw to do it, and we asked them for their help. The language it \nprovided, however, fails to address the negative effects the Office of \nLegal Counsel's opinion is already having on the ability of IGs to \naccess their agency records all across government. However, the \ninspector general community throughout our bureaucracy responded to our \nletter within 2 weeks and provided language that is actually responsive \nto our request.\n  In September, a bipartisan group of Senators and I incorporated the \ncore of this language in S. 579, called the Inspector General \nEmpowerment Act of 2015--a bill we shouldn't even have to pass, if \nJustice would just withdraw this Office of Legal Counsel opinion that \ncauses this problem in the first place.\n  Specifically, I was joined in this effort on this bill by 11 other \nMembers, including Senators McCaskill, Carper, Baldwin, and Mikulski. \nSenator Mikulski serves as vice chair of both the Appropriations \nCommittee and the subcommittee which has jurisdiction over \nappropriations for the Justice Department. She and Chairman Shelby were \nthe authors of the appropriations rider I recently spoke about.\n  In July, 1 week after the Office of Legal Counsel issued its awful \nlegal opinion, Senators Mikulski and Shelby sent a letter to the \nJustice Department correcting the Office of Legal Counsel's misreading \nof that appropriations rider, also known as section 218. I will read a \nfew excerpts from that letter from the two highest people on the \nAppropriations Committee, who are in a pretty good position to tell \nthese bureaucrats where to go and particularly where to go when the law \nis very clear and the Appropriations Committee is very clear that some \nopinion by the Office of Legal Counsel isn't even justified. Quote:\n\n       We write to inform you that Office of Legal Counsel's \n     interpretation of Section 218--and the subsequent conclusion \n     of our Committee's intention--is wrong.\n       Surmising that multiple interpretations of section 218 \n     created uncertainty, Office of Legal Counsel chose one of the \n     three rationales that most suited its own decision to \n     withhold information from the Office of Inspector General.\n       This conclusion was not consistent with the Committee's \n     intention at all. Rather, the Committee had only one goal in \n     drafting section 218. . . . to improve OIG access to \n     Department documents and information.\n       We expect the Department and all of its agencies to fully \n     comply with section 218, and to provide the Office of \n     Inspector General with full and immediate access to all \n     records, documents, and other material in accordance with \n     section 6(a) of the Inspector General Act. End Quote.\n\n  So there we have the appropriators saying what our bill is trying to \ndo, saying that it is wrong for one person in the Office of Legal \nCounsel to overturn 30 years of law that we have had in the inspector \ngeneral's office.\n  I applaud my colleagues on this very important Appropriations \nCommittee for standing up for inspectors general, and I applaud my \ncolleagues who have joined me in sponsoring the legislation entitled \nThe Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015.\n  I especially thank Senators Johnson and McCaskill for working with me \non this legislation from the very beginning and for their work in \ngetting this bill through their committee. Apparently the plain \nlanguage of the IG Act and the 2015 appropriations rider was somehow \nnot clear enough for the Office of Legal Counsel to understand, so the \nInspector General Empowerment Act includes further clarification that \nCongress intended IGs to access all agency records--and these next \nwords are very important--notwithstanding any other provision of law \nunless other laws specifically state that the IGs are not to receive \nsuch access.\n  This ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' language is what \nthe OLC opinion indicates would be necessary before OLC would believe \nthat Congress really means to ensure access to all records. But \noverturning an OLC opinion that was roundly criticized by both sides of \nthe aisle is just the beginning. In addition, the legislation also \nbolsters IG independence by preventing agency heads from placing them \non arbitrary and indefinite administrative leave.\n  The bill would also promote greater transparency by requiring IGs to \npost\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\nmore of their reports online. The bill would increase accountability by \nequipping IGs with tools to require testimony from contractors, \ngrantees, and other employees who have retired from the Government, \noften while under investigation by an IG.\n  In September, we attempted to pass this bill via unanimous consent. \nIt has been more than a month since the leadership asked whether any \nSenator would object. Not one Senator has put a statement in the Record \nor come to the floor to object publicly. At the August Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, there was a clear consensus that Congress needed to \nact legislatively and needed to overturn the Office of Legal Counsel \nopinion as quickly as possible.\n  Senator Cornyn noted that the Office of Legal Counsel opinion is \n``ignoring the mandate of Congress'' and undermining the oversight \nauthority that Congress has under the Constitution.\n  Senator Leahy said that this access problem is ``blocking what was \nonce a free flow of information'' and called for a permanent \nlegislative solution.\n  Senator Tillis stated that the need to fix this access problem was \n``a blinding flash of the obvious'' and that ``we all seem to be in \nviolent agreement that we need to correct this.''\n  However, some have raised concerns about guaranteeing IG access to \ncertain national security information. I wish to explain why this bill \nshould not be held up for that reason.\n  First, this bill is cosponsored by a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding Democrats and Republicans on the Intelligence Committee. \nThese people know something about the protection of national security. \nThese Senators are Senator Mikulski, Senator Lankford, and Senator \nCollins.\n  Second, the inspector general of the intelligence community supports \nthe bill.\n  Third, the bill would not affect intelligence agencies under title \n50, such as the CIA and the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  Fourth, the Executive orders restricting and controlling classified \ninformation are issued under the President's constitutional authority. \nThis bill does not in any way attempt to limit that constitutional \nauthority at all. It clarifies that no law can prevent an IG from \nobtaining documents from the agency it oversees unless the statute \nexplicitly states that IG access should be restricted. No one thinks \nthis statute could supersede the President's constitutional authority.\n  Fifth, there is already a provision in the law that allows the \nSecretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence to halt \nan inspector general review to protect vital national security \ninterests.\n  Nothing in the bill would change that already existing carve-out for \nthe intelligence community. All IGs should have the same level of \naccess to records that their agencies have, and all IGs are subject to \nthe same restrictions and penalties for disclosure of classified \ninformation. No inspector general's office has ever violated those \nrestrictions. They have an unblemished record of protecting national \nsecurity information.\n  If there are changes that can be made to the bill so that it can pass \nby unanimous consent, I am ready to consider those. However, any \nchanges or carve-outs for the intelligence community should not impact \nother IGs. The point of the bill is to overturn the Office of Legal \nCounsel opinion and restore complete, timely, and independent access \nfor IGs to agency records. That goal must be preserved.\n  We all lose when inspectors general are delayed or prevented in doing \ntheir work. Every day that goes by without a fix is another day that \nwatchdogs across the Government can be stonewalled. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters that I mentioned earlier and a letter I received from the \ninspector general community today showing why the Department of \nJustice's proposed language is insufficient to solve the problem at \nhand. I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-\ned that was recently published in the Washington Post in support of \nthis bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2015.\n     Hon. Sally Quillian Yates,\n     Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Deputy Attorney General Yates: This letter is in \n     response to the Department's Office of Legal Counsel's (OLC) \n     memorandum dated July 20, 2015, that provides a legal opinion \n     on the Office of Inspector General's (OIG) access to \n     sensitive information throughout the Department. On July 23, \n     2015, the Department provided our Committee with a copy of \n     the memo, which includes an opinion on Division B, section \n     218 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations \n     Act of 2015 (Public Law 113-235). We write to inform you that \n     OLC's interpretation of section 218--and the subsequent \n     conclusion of our Committee's intention--is wrong.\n       Specifically, OLC erroneously speculated that section 218 \n     held one of three possible interpretations, one of which \n     included the supposed conclusion that Congress intended to \n     permit the Department to withhold information from the OIG. \n     Surmising that multiple interpretations of section 218 \n     created uncertainty, OLC chose one of the three rationales \n     that most suited its own decision to continue to withhold \n     information from the OIG.\n       This conclusion was not consistent with the Committee's \n     intentions at all. Rather, the Committee had only one goal in \n     drafting section 218; therefore, there is only one correct \n     conclusion. As the explanatory statement accompanying the \n     fiscal year 2015 bill simply states, ``The Inspector General \n     shall report to the Committees on Appropriations not later \n     than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act on the \n     impact of section 218 of this Act, which is designed to \n     improve OIG access to Department documents and information,''\n       Throughout this ongoing dispute between the Department and \n     the OIG about access to information, the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations has shown clear concerns about the frequency \n     and abundance of material that the Department has chosen to \n     withhold from the OIG. In addition to the fiscal year 2015 \n     language, the Committee raised concerns with the Attorney \n     General during a fiscal year 2016 hearing, which occurred \n     well in advance of OLC issuing its recent opinion. For OLC to \n     determine our intentions as anything other than supporting \n     the OIG's legal right to gain full access to timely and \n     complete information is disconcerting.\n       While the issue of the Inspector General's access to \n     information covers many areas of the law, and OLC's memo is \n     equally expansive on the matter, we feel compelled to set the \n     record straight regarding section 218. We were not contacted \n     by OLC to solicit our feedback in the formulation of their \n     memo to you. However, should you or anyone in the Department \n     request further information about this section or any other \n     areas of our fiscal year 2015 spending bill, we, and our \n     staff will be glad to assist.\n       Regardless, we expect the Department and all of its \n     agencies to fully comply with section 218, and to provide the \n     OIG with full and immediate access to all records, documents \n     and other material in accordance with section 6(a) of the \n     Inspector General Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard C. Shelby,\n       Chairman, Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science \n     and Related Agencies.\n     Barbara A. Mikulski,\n       Vice Chairwoman, Senate Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, \n     Science and Related Agencies.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 13, 2015.\n     Hon. Sally Quillian Yates,\n     Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Horowitz,\n     Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Deputy Attorney General Yates and Inspector General \n     Horowitz: Last month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) made \n     public an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion that allows \n     DOJ to withhold access to certain records sought by DOJ's \n     Office of Inspector General. Under the OLC opinion, and \n     subsequent guidance provided by the Office of the Deputy \n     Attorney General, the DOJ Inspector General must now obtain \n     agency permission to access certain documents related to \n     grand jury testimony, Title III wiretaps, and the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act. This opinion undermines the long-standing \n     presumption that Inspectors General have access to any and \n     all information that they deem necessary for effective \n     oversight, as specified in the Inspector General Act of 1978.\n       On August 5, 2015, the Senate Judiciary Committee convened \n     a hearing entitled, `` `All' Means `All': The Justice \n     Department's Failure to Comply with Its Legal Obligation to \n     Ensure Inspector General Access to All Records Needed for \n     Independent Oversight.'' This hearing brought to light \n     serious questions about the effect the OLC opinion would have \n     on the independence and effectiveness of the Office of \n     Inspector General, not just at the Department of Justice but \n     also across\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\n     the federal government. The opinion has already been relied \n     on by other federal agencies to prevent their Inspectors \n     General complete and timely access to documents necessary to \n     conduct audits and investigations. It is apparent that \n     Congress needs to act to ensure that Inspectors General have \n     complete and immediate access to all records in the \n     possession of their respective agencies, unless a statute \n     restricting access to documents expressly states that the \n     provision applies to Inspectors General.\n       We understand the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and \n     the Office of Inspector General have been working \n     collaboratively on legislative language to address this \n     issue. Accordingly, by no later than August 28, 2015, please \n     provide your recommended legislative language that would \n     ensure Inspectors General have access to all Department \n     records, notwithstanding limitations contained in any of the \n     potentially hundreds of provisions of law or any common-law \n     privilege that might otherwise arguably limit such \n     disclosure.\n       Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Charles E.

Amy Klobuchar,\n     U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Dear Chairmen, Ranking Members, and distinguished Senators: \n     On behalf of the Council of the Inspectors General on \n     Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), we write to express our \n     strong opposition to the proposal of the Department of \n     Justice (DOJ), sent to you in a letter dated November 3, \n     2015. The DOJ proposal would amend Section 8E of the \n     Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) in response to \n     the July 2015 opinion of the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel \n     (OLC). While the DOJ agrees with CIGIE that legislation is \n     needed and should be passed by Congress to reverse the impact \n     of the OLC opinion, the DOJ's proposal only applies to the \n     DOJ Inspector General's access to records and fails to ensure \n     that all other federal Inspectors General have the same \n     independent access at their respective agencies. As such, \n     DOJ's proposed legislative language is not acceptable. \n     Effective and independent oversight is the mission of all \n     Inspectors General and, therefore, all Inspectors General \n     require timely and independent access to agency information \n     necessary to carry out that responsibility. This is a bedrock \n     principle of the IG Act.\n       Three months ago, an OLC opinion determined that the words \n     ``all records'' in Section 6(a) of the IG Act does not mean \n     ``all records'' and therefore the IG Act did not give the DOJ \n     IG independent access to all records in the DOJ's possession \n     that are necessary to perform its oversight work. Section \n     6(a) is the cornerstone of the IG Act for federal Inspectors \n     General, and an opinion that undercuts its broad access \n     provision places our collective ability to have timely and \n     independent access to agency records and information at risk. \n     Yet the DOJ's proposal would restore access authority to only \n     one Office of Inspector General. The DOJ's proposal is \n     clearly inadequate and would leave in place a threat to the \n     independence of all other Offices of Inspector General. \n     Indeed, we have seen the impact of this threat at both the \n     Peace Corps and the Commerce Department. Inspectors General \n     at both agencies have faced claims by their agency's counsel \n     that they are not entitled to access all records in their \n     agency's possession.\n       We urge you and your colleagues to reject the DOJ's \n     proposal and proceed with the bipartisan substitute amendment \n     to Senate bill S. 579, the ``Inspector General Empowerment \n     Act of 2015.'' This bill amends Section 6 of the IG Act and \n     makes clear that no law or provision restricting access to \n     information applies to any applicable IG unless Congress \n     expressly so states, and that such IG access extends to ``all \n     records'' available to the agency. This is the only way to \n     effectively restore to all IGs the independence that has been \n     the lynchpin to our success for more than 35 years, and \n     ensure that we can continue to conduct effective oversight on \n     behalf of the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael E. Horowitz,\n       Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice; Chair, \n     CIGIE.\n     Kathy A. Buller,\n       Inspector General, The Peace Corps; Chair, CIGIE \n     Legislation Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 31, 2015]\n\n                  Let Inspectors General Do Their Jobs\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       A few years ago, the Justice Department's Office of \n     Inspector General was looking into how the department had \n     handled people detained as material witnesses after the 9/11 \n     attacks. There had been complaints that civil liberties were \n     abused in some detentions. The inspector general made a \n     request for documents from the FBI that included grand jury \n     testimony by those detained--and hit a roadblock. In 2010, \n     the FBI refused to turn over the documents.\n       The Justice Department inspector general, Michael E. \n     Horowitz, has pointed to this refusal in appealing to \n     Congress to rectify a larger problem: Not only at Justice but \n     in other agencies, inspectors general are coming up against \n     hurdles to their independent investigations created by the \n     very departments they are supposed to keep an eye on. \n     Inspectors general, created by a 1976 law to be independent \n     watchdogs over government, are finding it increasingly \n     difficult to carry out their vital mission.\n       The original law said that inspectors general must have \n     access to ``all records, reports, audits, reviews, documents, \n     papers, recommendations or other material available'' for \n     their work. But the ``all'' in this language has been thrown \n     into doubt by the FBI's actions and by a subsequent opinion \n     by the department's Office of Legal Counsel, which suggested \n     that, in certain conditions, the inspector general should not \n     get ``all.'' According to Mr. Horowitz, every time he was \n     blocked, he turned to the attorney general or deputy attorney \n     general and asked for an override, which they provided. But \n     the result has been significant delays in the investigations, \n     including the probe into the use of the material witness \n     statute and another looking at Operation Fast and Furious, \n     the failed weapons sting operation. Mr. Horowitz has pointed \n     out that such objections to the release of documents for \n     investigations were not raised for many years after the \n     creation of his office, only beginning in 2010.\n       The inspector general should not have to pester the \n     attorney general for access that is already provided in the \n     law. As Mr. Horowitz argued recently in these pages, such \n     foot-dragging turns statutory language on its head, so that \n     the words ``all records'' do not mean all. This is \n     ``fundamentally inconsistent with the independence that is \n     necessary for effective and credible oversight,''\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\n     he wrote. In August 2014, 47 inspectors general told Congress \n     that such roadblocks to independent probes had cropped up \n     elsewhere, too, including at the Environmental Protection \n     Agency and the Peace Corps. They said withholding documents \n     ``risks leaving the agencies insulated from scrutiny and \n     unacceptably vulnerable to mismanagement and misconduct.''\n       Legislation pending in both chambers of Congress would \n     clarify this by making clear that all records mean all \n     records--and that inspectors general remain an important \n     mechanism of accountability and oversight. The legislation \n     has bipartisan support and deserves to be passed.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I see Senator Johnson on the floor. I \nthank him very much for his leadership in this area.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to urge passage of S. 579, \nthe Inspector General Empowerment Act of 2015. I want to thank my \nfriend, Senator Grassley, who just spoke, for his work on this bill and \nfor his longstanding commitment and dedicated promotion of \naccountability and transparency for efficient government.\n  It is an unfortunate reality that the executive branch today is more \npowerful, more expansive, and less transparent than it has ever been. \nSenator Grassley and I are privileged to be the chairmen of committees \nthat have expansive authorities and responsibilities to oversee the \nexecutive branch and all of its programs. But we need help in our \nefforts.\n  We are fortunate that Congress in 1978 created crucial partners for \nus: independent watchdogs embedded in each agency, accountable only to \nCongress and the American people. They are the American people's eyes \nand ears, and they are our best partner in rooting out waste, fraud, \nand abuse of taxpayers' hard-earned money.\n  This bill is about increasing agency accountability and transparency. \nIt exempts IGs from time-consuming and independence-threatening \nrequirements such as the computer matching and paperwork reduction \nstatutes.\n  The bill also allows inspectors general, in limited circumstances, to \ncompel the testimony of former agency employees or Federal contractors \nwhose information they need to pursue cases of fraud and abuse. But the \nbill also ensures that inspectors general are made accountable to the \npublic and to Congress.\n  Earlier this year, I issued a subpoena to the inspector general of \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, in part to produce the over 100 \nreports the inspector general had completed but not made public. One \nreport that the VA inspector general kept from the public was a report \non dangerous overprescription of opiates at the Tomah VA Medical Center \nin Tomah, WI--practices that resulted in the death of at least one \nWisconsin veteran.\n  This is how important transparency is. The daughter of the Wisconsin \nveteran who died from substandard care at that facility told me that \nhad she known about the practices at the facility--in other words, if \nthe report had been made public--she never would have taken her father \nthere, and he could be alive today.\n  I want that to sink in. The bottom line is transparency and \naccountability in government can literally be a matter of life and \ndeath. The VA inspector general is not the only offender. In 2013 the \nDepartment of Interior Office of Inspector General closed over 400 \ninvestigations but released only 3 of those to the public. This should \nnot happen. The public deserves transparency and accountability.\n  An amendment that I offered in committee, and that was accepted \nunanimously, requires inspectors general to publicly post their work on \ntheir Web site within 3 days of providing the final report to the \nagency. So this bill will ensure that findings of misconduct, waste, \nand fraud are exposed to the public and to Congress.\n  The public also deserves an inspector general that is independent. \nOne of the greatest threats to inspector general independence is when \nthe President fails to nominate a permanent inspector general and \nleaves an acting IG in place who wants the permanent job.\n  In 2014, when I was ranking member of the Financial and Contracting \nOversight Subcommittee, we found that the former acting inspector \ngeneral for the Department of Homeland Security, Charles Edwards, was \ncompromised because of his desire to curry favor with the \nadministration to get the permanent inspector general's job. We found \nhe changed and delayed findings of reports to protect senior officials. \nThat type of behavior is completely unacceptable.\n  In addition to using our powers as Members of Congress to call upon \nthe President to nominate permanent inspectors general, as I have done \nfor the Veterans Administration, this bill requires an independent \nstudy of problems with acting IGs and recommends ways to address them.\n  We know that many agencies are not in the business of transparency, \nand they often try to restrict their inspector general's work. As \nSenator Grassley already explained so well, we shouldn't have to \nclarify what was meant when we said IGs shall have access to all their \nagency's documents so they can do their work. Nonetheless, this bill \nwill make it even clearer that ``all'' really does mean all.\n  This is a bipartisan cause. We want all inspectors general to be able \nto do their jobs well. That is why the substitute amendment I filed in \nSeptember has 11 bipartisan cosponsors, spanning members of my \ncommittee, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \nthe Judiciary Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I want to thank my ranking member, Senator Tom Carper, for his \nsupport and the other cosponsors for their assistance in getting this \nbill passed. I urge my colleagues to support S. 579 and to support the \nwork our IG partners do every day to try to keep our Nation safe, our \nagencies accountable, and our taxpayer dollars spent efficiently.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n            Justice For Former American Hostages In Iran Act\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, 36 years ago today, 53 Americans in the \nAmerican Embassy in Tehran were captured, beaten, held hostage, and \ntortured. As I speak on the floor of the Senate today, in the streets \nof downtown Tehran, Iranian people are marching in the streets, burning \nAmerican flags, yelling ``Death to America'' and celebrating the \ncapture of our citizens 36 years ago today.\n  From the moment of their release in January of 1981, they have been \npromised justice and compensation. But 5 administrations and 17 \nCongresses have gone by, and there has been no justice and there has \nbeen no compensation. Unfortunately, cynicism has set in, and the \nremaining 38 of the 53 who were originally held hostage wonder when \ntheir justice is coming.\n  Many have suffered. One, a former CIA agent, committed suicide. \nAnother attempted suicide but failed. Many families have been torn \napart and asunder by PTSD and other ramifications of torture and \ncapture. It is a sad chapter in the history of our country, at the \nhands of a tyrannical dictatorship in the nation of Iran. But don't \njust take my word for it. Let me read you the words of two American \ncitizens who were taken hostage in Tehran 36 years ago.\n  William Daugherty from Savannah, GA, said the following:\n\n       I'd like to remind the Congress that the corporations and \n     banks have long ago received their ``compensation'' in \n     whatever form it took. I'd like to remind the Congress that \n     the Carter administration intended for us to be compensated. \n     They told us we would be, and today it's pretty much now or \n     never for many of us.\n\n  Their lives are passing.\n  Or there is Joe Hall of Lenox, GA, who told me:\n\n       35 years after our release from confinement, one fourth of \n     our group has passed away. Those who remain are aging, \n     ailing, and frustrated. Yet, they remain loyal, law-abiding, \n     and patriotic; the very characteristics they took to Iran \n     when they [were captured and] stepped forward to serve their \n     country, so many years ago.\n\n  Still there is no justice, still no reward.\n  Four years ago I introduced the Iranian Hostage Compensation Act. To \nthis date, it has been supported by every Member of the Senate and \nHouse who I have talked to. Minority Leader Harry Reid came to me the \nother day seeking help to make sure we get this bill passed. Ben \nCardin, the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bob \nCorker, the chairman of\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nthe Foreign Relations Committee, the members of the House Foreign \nRelations Committee--everyone I have talked to has said: Yes, it is \nright for us to do this. The money is in the bank in the control of the \nDepartment of Justice--Iranian money that is available to pay the \nhostages the compensation they deserve. The amounts have been \nnegotiated--$6,750 per hostage per day of captivity. They are the only \nAmerican hostages ever held captured and never been recompensed for the \ntragedy they suffered.\n  It is time for America to act now. While the Iranians celebrate in \nthe streets and burn our flag and say ``Death to America,'' we should \nsay to the survivors of the Iranian hostage crisis: We are going to see \nto it that you get the compensation and the justice you deserve.\n  In the weeks ahead before this year ends, I will talk to each Member \nof the Senate and to each Member of the House to find a way--whatever \nway we can and whatever vehicle is necessary--to get that authorization \nout of Congress and in the hands of the Justice Department and the \nadministration so each and every one of those survivors can be \ncompensated because they deserve it. They risked their lives for the \nUnited States of America just as every State Department employee and \nevery Ambassador does around the world. We never need the State \nDepartment employees or our Ambassadors to think that one day America \nmight look the other way if they are ever captured or taken hostage.\n  I appeal to my colleagues in the Senate and the House and to all the \npeople in the United States of America to come together and see to it \nthat those remaining hostages who have survived so far are compensated \nfor the horror and the terror they endured. While the Iranians \ncelebrate the capture and the horror they administered to their victims \nin the streets, let's do what we as Congressmen and as Members of the \nSenate came here to do and see to it that they get their justice and \ncompensation and that we do what America always does: stand by our \ncitizens who went in harm's way to protect our country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Religious Liberty In America\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, freedom of religion is one of the \nfoundational principles of the Republic. It has long been central to \nour identity as a self-governing people, and as a cause, it has long \nenjoyed wide support across partisan and ideological divides for \ngenerations.\n  Recently, however, religious liberty has come under coordinated \nassault by those who would hastily discard one of our founding \nprinciples to serve a narrow, transient political agenda. Given how \ndefending religious liberty has been one of the animating goals in my \npublic life, I feel compelled to speak out against this disturbing \ndevelopment.\n  Since the end of the August recess, I have endeavored to speak \nregularly on the subject to remind my colleagues of the need to \nmaintain our historic allegiance to this most American of values. So \nfar, I have addressed the first principles of why we should protect \nreligious freedom, as well as the legal and political history of the \nconcept. Today I aim to address the role of religion in public life and \nits critical contribution to the preservation of freedom of religion.\n  One particular phrase has come to describe the relationship between \nfaith and public life in this country: ``the separation of church and \nstate.'' Over the years, the invocation of this phrase has become so \nrote that many consider it axiomatic. While the phrase itself is quite \nterse, it has become shorthand for a particular narrative about the \nhistory and status of religion in American life. This narrative traces \nback to Thomas Jefferson, who famously advocated for a ``wall of \nseparation between church and state.'' Under Jefferson's leadership, \nVirginia passed the Law for the Establishment of Religious Freedom in \n1786, which aimed to end state prescription and proscription of any \nparticular religion.\n  Anchored in a cursory reference to Jefferson, generations of \nAmericans have been brought up to believe that our founding principles \ndemand that faith be driven out of government and kept contained to a \nprivate sphere with no role in public life and no semblance of \ninteraction with the state. This narrative is flatly inconsistent with \nour history and our Constitution. Put plainly, the Jeffersonian model \nof strict separation was a novel experiment that constituted a \ndecidedly minority viewpoint in the early Republic.\n  The dominant model at the time was embodied by the 1780 Massachusetts \nConstitution drafted by John Adams, which largely protected religious \nliberty but also instituted a ``mild and equitable establishment of \nreligion'' that enshrined Christian piety and virtue. In Adams' view, \nas articulated by one scholar, ``Every polity must establish by law \nsome form of public religion, some image and ideal of itself, some \ncommon values and beliefs to undergird and support the plurality of \nprotected private religions. The notion that a state could remain \nneutral and purged of any public religion was [neither realistic nor \ndesirable].''\n  Jefferson himself acknowledged that the statute he crafted in \nVirginia was a ``novel experiment'' that broke with practice not only \nin the American colonies but also in the United Kingdom and the wider \nWestern world.\n  At the outbreak of the Revolution, the Anglican Church enjoyed \nofficial established status in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South \nCarolina, Virginia, as well as in the New York City area. In \nConnecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, the system of municipal \ngovernment empowered individual towns to choose a church to establish, \nresulting in Congregationalism as the established religion throughout \nmost of New England. Only Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode \nIsland lacked officially established churches. Nevertheless, even these \nstates without officially established churches--including famous havens \nfor religious dissenters, such as Pennsylvania and Rhode Island--\nmaintained significant ties between church and state, including in \nmatters of church finances, religious tests for public office, and \nblasphemy laws.\n  While the Revolution brought about a number of new state \nconstitutions that officially disestablished a number of state \nchurches--particularly the Church of England after the severing of \npolitical ties to the Crown--the advent of the new Republic did not \nbring about universal disestablishment or adherence to the model of \nstrict separation.\n  At the time of the adoption of the First Amendment in 1791, about \nhalf--depending on one's exact definition--of the 14 States then \nadmitted to the Union had an established church or allowed municipal \ngovernments to establish such a church. Moreover, every single state \nsponsored or supported one or more churches at the time. In the words \nof Notre Dame's Gerard Bradley, even ``Rhode Island, that polar star of \nreligious liberty, maintained'' what would today constitute ``an \nestablishment at the time it ratified the First Amendment.''\n  My purpose for bringing up this history is not to advocate for states \nto return to the era of officially established churches or to advocate \nfor any of the restrictive measures of that time. Indeed, as a Mormon, \nI am keenly aware both of how the machinery of government can be used \nto oppress religious minorities and of how a faith's flourishing comes \nnot from the State's sanction or promotion but rather from the \ndedication and devotion of individuals, families, and communities. \nInstead, my purpose is to note the plain incongruity between the \nconventional wisdom of rigid separation between church and state \nsupposedly commanded since the founding by the establishment clause and \nthe actual history of religion in public life in the days of the early \nRepublic.\n  This apparent disconnect can be resolved by an examination of the \ntext of the Constitution. The text of the First Amendment reads: \n``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof.'' Note the exact formulation: \n``Congress shall make no law regarding the establishment of religion. . \n. .'' On its face, the language\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\naffects only one actor--Congress--not States and local governments and \nnot individual citizens. Put another way, at the time of its adoption, \nthe First Amendment neither created an individual right to be free from \nreligion nor limited the power of the States to establish religion; it \nsimply created a structural limit on Federal power.\n  The debates over the ratification of the Bill of Rights confirmed \nthis interpretation. As a general matter, the Establishment Clause \nreceived relatively little attention in the ratification debates in the \nstate legislatures and among the public. Indeed, it hardly seems \ntenable that States would have adopted a measure at odds with their \nongoing practices with little discussion or dispute. What attention the \nestablishment clause did receive made it clear that its language was \nintended to prevent the Federal Government from choosing a preferred \nreligious secret--a logical move befitting a new nation made up of \nstates with a wide variety of religious traditions and approaches to \nestablished religion.\n  Furthermore, the ratification debates clarify that the ratifiers \nviewed official establishment of a particular church as direct \nfinancial support for a preferred sect, wholly distinct from the \nnondiscriminatory support and establishment of religion in general, \nwhich the Establishment Clause was not thought to limit.\n  For a century and a half, this misunderstanding of the Establishment \nClause endured with little challenge. Before the Civil War, the Supreme \nCourt decided only three Establishment Clause cases of any \nsignificance. Indeed, the major debate on the subject during the \nintervening years revolved around a proposed change to the \nConstitution: the 1875 Blaine amendment that sought to extend the \napplication of the Establishment Clause to the states and to ban \nexplicitly any church's access to public funds. This legislative \neffort, borne largely out of anti-Catholic prejudice, failed--a failure \nthat further underscored the settled nature of the Establishment Clause \nat that time.\n  Unfortunately, religion was not spared from the destructive judicial \nactivism of a Supreme Court that spun wildly out of control in the mid-\n20th century. A new crop of justices, disinclined to follow the \ntraditional judicial role of applying the law as written, instead \nsought to remake the law according to their left-wing worldview. From \ninventing new rights for criminals to mandating nearly unlimited access \nto abortion on demand, the Court in this period left few stones \nunturned in its radical rewriting of the Constitution.\n  The longstanding understanding of the Establishment Clause was one of \nthe mid-century Court's first victims. Abandoning the understanding of \nthe clause I have previously detailed--an understanding that was \nclearly supported by text, structure, history, and precedent--the Court \nturned the Establishment Clause on its head.\n  In the error-filled words of Justice Black, the Court said in Everson \nv. Board of Education that ``the establishment of religion clause of \nthe First Amendment means at least this: Neither a State nor the \nFederal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid \none religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another.'' \nThis pronouncement had no basis in text, history, or law. To the \ncontrary, it was diametrically opposed to the understanding of the \nrelationship between government and religion and between the federal \ngovernment and the states that had endured for much of America's \nhistory. Justice Black justified the Court's entirely novel, \nahistorical view by turning to Jefferson: ``In the words of Jefferson, \nthe clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to \nerect a wall of separation between church and state.'' Thus was born \nthe now-commonplace view that the establishment clause was meant to \ncreate a high wall separating church and state.\n  This decision represents a complete inversion of the previously \nsettled, proper understanding of the establishment clause. The command \nthat Congress should make no law regarding an establishment provision \nis turned from a structural protection against federal power into an \nindividual right to be free from religion. The text protecting the \nstates' power to decide whether and what church to establish is, in the \nwords of one scholar, paradoxically and perversely transformed into a \nlimitation on states' authority to make such a decision. The critical \ndistinction between official establishment of a particular church and \ngeneral support of religion without regard to particular sects is \ncasually discarded in favor of a blanket prohibition on religious \ninvolvement in public life. In the words of two scholars, throughout \nits decision, the Court ``not only ascribed to the establishment clause \nseparationist content; it imagined a past to confirm that \ninterpretation. Both majority and dissent treated the history of the \nUnited States as if it were the history of Virginia. Despite \ndissimilarity of language, the justices equated the establishment \nclause with Virginia's statute on religious freedom, thereby \nappropriating for the federal provision the separationist message and \nrhetoric of the state enactment.''\n  As I have explained, the history of Virginia on the subject of state \nestablishment of religion is not the history of the United States. \nRather, Virginia was, as Jefferson said, a ``novel experiment'' on the \nissue. Other states continued to support state-established churches. \nThe wall-of-separation doctrine, which the Court created out of whole \ncloth in Everson, was not the American tradition. It was an \nidiosyncrasy of Jefferson's.\n  Upon this fundamentally flawed foundation, the federal courts have \nconstructed a jurisprudence that threatens any place for religion in \nthe public sphere. Embracing the demonstrably false notion that ``the \nthree main evils against which the establishment clause was intended to \nafford protection [were] sponsorship, financial support, and active \ninvolvement of the sovereign and religious activity,'' the Supreme \nCourt soon adopted the so-called Lemon test for any law to withstand: \n``First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, \nits principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor \ninhibits religion . . . finally, the statute must not foster an \nexcessive government entanglement with religion.''\n  In announcing this test, the Supreme Court sounded the note of \nmodesty, noting that the justices could ``only dimly perceive the lines \nof demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of Constitutional \nlaw.'' This admission--though ironic, given the Court's ambition to \ncomplete the transformation of the establishment clause away from its \nhistorical and textual foundation--was, if anything, an understatement. \nThe Court's efforts to draw a line between the permissible and the \nimpermissible have completely failed. Justice Rehnquist rightly \ndiagnosed the cause of these bizarre results:\n  These difficulties arise because the Lemon test has no more grounding \nin the history of the First Amendment than does the wall theory upon \nwhich it rests. The . . . test represents a determined effort to craft \na workable rule from a historically faulty doctrine; but the rule can \nonly be as sound as the doctrine it attempts to service.\n  The Court has responded to these acknowledged difficulties not by \nabandoning its flawed establishment clause jurisprudence but by \ninventing new tests while never overturning Lemon or the flawed \nunderstanding that undergirds it. By one scholar's estimation, the \nSupreme Court has employed 9 alternate tests of impermissible \nestablishment of religion; another scholar identified 16. While the \nexact count understandably varies, the result is the same: muddled law \nthat lacks any principled means of application. This lack of clarity \nenables judicial activism. By liberating the judiciary from the \nobligation to apply a clear rule, this muddied framework invites judges \nand justices to implement their own policy views as law.\n  While this framework shows confusion in marginal cases, its overall \neffect is clear: to squeeze religion out of government and to deny \nreligious organizations the opportunities afforded to secular \ncounterparts. While the addition of principled jurists to the Court has \nturned momentum against previous excesses, the thrust of the Court's \nmisguided establishment clause jurisprudence remains dominant.\n  The Court's flawed wall-of-separation jurisprudence has kept religion \nout of the public square and fed the idea that\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\nreligion is a private matter to be practiced within the confines of \none's church or home. Legal and social pressures have taken their toll, \nand the results are stark: no prayer in school; no new Ten Commandments \ndisplays--or even Christmas or Hanukkah displays--unless carefully \nsecularized; a widespread prejudice in many quarters against public \nofficials talking about God or about their beliefs in public; and even \nthe crusade every December to replace the phrase ``Merry Christmas'' \nwith ``Happy Holidays.''\n  The conventional wisdom peddled by advocates for stringent exclusion \nof religion from the public sphere is that aggressive enforcement of \ntheir vision of the establishment clause enhances religious freedom. \nUnfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. The erroneous \nwall-of-separation doctrine has narrowed the role of religion in public \ndiscourse, fueling the view that religion is a private matter rather \nthan a fundamental precept of American civil society. Even members of \nthis esteemed body have fallen prey to the disturbing claim that \nreligious freedom does not extend much further than the church door. \nSuch an approach undermines religious liberty in numerous ways. It \ncounsels government to avoid any perceived entanglement with religion--\neven accommodation of religious practice, at the core of the right to \nfree exercise. It tells the religious believer that in order to \nparticipate fully in public life, he should cabin and hide his \nreligious devotion: Just abandon your religious affiliation, and the \ngovernment will partner with your school or charity. Just muzzle your \nfaith, and you can fully participate in representative government and \nlawmaking. Just keep your religion private, and you won't face a swarm \nof litigation.\n  Indeed, despite the hard-fought progress in recent years both in \nprotecting religious liberty and in restoring sanity to the courts' \napproach to the establishment clause, this notion of strict separation \ncontinues to exert a pernicious influence, shrinking the sphere of \nacceptable religious exercise. In so doing, it undermines religious \nliberty and limits the ways in which faith enriches our society. \nRestoring a proper relationship between faith and public life must \ncontinue to be a top priority as a key component of our broad reference \nto protect religious liberty for future generations.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Waters of the United States Rule\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a strong supporter of the \nresolution of disapproval we passed today. The WOTUS rule is a classic \nexample of overreach. Arkansans understand that we don't need DC \nbureaucracies controlling our lands. That is why I stand with \nhomeowners, small businesses, and family farmers in Arkansas in \nopposition to the WOTUS mandate.\n  Passage of this resolution today reflects the American people's \nrejection of this heavyhanded mandate and shows our commitment to a \nbalanced and thoughtful approach to water quality protection. Congress \nneeds to send this resolution to the President. The President needs to \nunderstand the opposition this power grab is facing is very real. Not \nonly is there strong bipartisan opposition to this mandate in Congress \nbut also in the courts and most importantly with the American people.\n  Last week I got an email from David in North Little Rock. David told \nme that he works in construction, and his email was clear. He supports \nprotecting our Nation's waters, but David believes the Obama \nadministration's rule will create huge problems and uncertainty for the \nconstruction industry. He said costs will increase, the industry will \nlose jobs, and he and others will face unnecessary delays as a result \nof the mandate that has nothing to do with protecting our waters.\n  Legal experts within the executive branch have doubts about this rule \ntoo. At a recent EPW hearing, we heard that many career experts inside \nthe agencies, particularly the Corps of Engineers, believe this rule is \nwrong, but each time the Corps expresses concern that the rule went too \nfar, the EPA and the rest of the administration refuse to make changes.\n  From puddles to irrigation ditches, the EPA wants jurisdiction over \nevery body of water in Arkansas, no matter the size. These are not \nscare tactics, they are very real truths. In fact, the White House and \nthe EPA are the ones engaging in scare tactics to defend this power \ngrab. They falsely claim that this mandate is necessary to protect \ndrinking water.\n  Those protections are already in place with laws like the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. For more than 40 years, the Safe Drinking Water Act \nhas fostered Federal-State cooperation. It has kept our drinking water \nclean. It is an effective law, one I support. It does far more to \nprotect distribution water than anything in the EPA's power grab. In \ncase these false claims don't scare enough people into supporting this \nunjustified power grab, the EPA has invoked rhetoric about rivers \ncatching on fire and claim there is rampant toxic pollution in our \nwaterways. Again, this is simply false.\n  Without waters of the United States, major rivers will continue to \nreceive Federal and State protection just as they have for decades. \nIsolated nonnavigable waters will continue to be protected by State and \nlocal efforts as they have in the past. The courts recognized how \nmisguided this mandate is and have issued a temporary halt to the \nimplementation of WOTUS. That injunction now extends to all 50 States.\n  I applaud the Arkansas attorney general, Leslie Rutledge, for helping \nto lead that challenge in the courts. Senator Cotton and I stand arm in \narm with our State's attorney general in this fight. We are committed \nto fighting this mandate legislatively, while supporting efforts to \nstop it in the courts. That is why today's vote is so very important. \nThe resolution of disapproval will nullify the waters of the United \nStates mandate.\n  Arkansans understand how unnecessary this heavyhanded mandate is. We \nalready go to great lengths to protect our State's natural resources. \nWe must ensure that States, local communities, and private citizens \nremain a vital part of the process instead of giving all of the power \nto Washington. That is what this resolution of disapproval aims to do. \nI am pleased we passed it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 2238 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                    Waters of the United States Rule\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I hate to sound like a broken record, but \nunfortunately that is the scenario the Obama administration and the \nminority leader have led me to today. When I sought this position as a \nSenator from North Carolina, I promised the voters back in my home \nState that I was going to come up here and fix problems, fix \nWashington, and get us back to work.\n  Yesterday an attempt to rein in the President and the EPA failed. It \nfailed along party lines. Today we had another chance to come together \nand help protect Americans from Washington's continual power grab, to \nensure they are not subject to illegal Executive overreach, and to take \ncontrol of a bloated bureaucracy. Today's effort passed but only by a \nslim margin. We must stand up to the President and to the Senate \nminority leader and their efforts to continue implementing policies \nthat destroy our Nation's economy and in this case harm farmers and \nsmall businesses in a variety of ways.\n  I want the voters to remember this day. I want them to remember who \nstood against the illegal expansion of Federal control over their land \nand their livelihood and remember those who did not. The waters of the \nUnited States--we have acronyms for everything, it is called WOTUS--is \njust another Washington power grab that has more to do with controlling \nyour property than ensuring access to clean water.\n  Leaders at the EPA claim that those who oppose WOTUS oppose clean\n\n[[Page S7755]]\n\nwater. That seems like an absurd notion for anybody who is in this \nbody. This is a completely false and elitist claim. I firmly believe \nthat Members on both sides of the aisle can all agree we value clean \nwater. I love nothing more than going out on Lake Norman back in my \nhome State or spending time fly-fishing in the mountains of North \nCarolina or spending time on the rivers near our coast, but under this \nrule virtually every nook and cranny of the country would be subject to \nEPA control. There is a risk that puddles in our backyards and ditches \nand crop fields will be regulated in the same manner our States \nregulate--properly--our beautiful lakes and rivers.\n  One thing is clear under the waters of the United States, WOTUS, \nthere is no clarity. There is complete uncertainty and layer upon layer \nof bureaucratic redtape. Our landowners, our farmers, our ranchers, and \nbusiness owners across the country will be subject to compliance costs, \nnew fines, and the risk of litigation--all at the discretion of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency.\n  In March, the Senate agriculture committee held a hearing on the \nwaters of the United States, inviting stakeholders to discuss their \nconcerns. We were proud to have the secretary of the North Carolina \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources, who told us in regard \nto the rule: ``It's not absolutely clear what in the world it does say, \nother than providing the EPA with a lot of discretion when determining \nnavigable waters.''\n  Navigable waters--not a ditch, not a depression that gets filled up \nwhen it rains but navigable waters. How on Earth are Members of this \nbody, Senators, willing to allow such a horrible policy to plague our \nfarmers, our businesses and, I might add, our cities and towns that on \na bipartisan basis have expressed concern to me in my home State. It is \nclear to me the Obama administration did not consult with our State \nleaders, county leaders, and city leaders when choosing to redefine the \nrule. We are at a moment where we must prevent this policy, putting our \nlandowners and job creators ahead of partisan politics.\n  It is not my goal to focus simply on North Carolina in this speech. I \nknow my colleagues from Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada, North Dakota, a number of States \nhave family and friends who will endure burdens if this bad policy \nstands.\n  My State is a great example of just how detrimental this rule is to \nour farmers and to families in North Carolina. North Carolina has over \n300 miles of coastline, 17 major river basins, and roughly 37,000 miles \nof freshwater streams--all places that North Carolina residents, \nfarmers, and businesses call home. Much of the eastern part of the \nState, which runs along the Atlantic Ocean, is susceptible to flooding, \neven after the lightest rainfall.\n  Earlier this week parts of the State were again hit hard with heavy \nrainfall, compounding the effects of last month's historic flooding \nassociated with the hurricane. If the Environmental Protection Agency \nmoves forward with waters of the United States, it will severely \nrestrict the local government's ability to quickly react when we are \nrecovering from events.\n  Imagine this. Imagine a water event or a hurricane or a rain like we \nhad in South Carolina, which dumps 1 foot or 2 feet of water on an area \nthat has been cropland, cultivated, and harvested by farmers--let us \nsay in North Carolina or South Carolina. This rule is going to make it \nalmost impossible for that farmer to begin recovering immediately \nbecause of the uncertainty of the regulations that come with waters of \nthe United States. Not only will they suffer the ravages of the storm, \nthey will also suffer the ravages of this poorly thought-out policy \noverreach.\n  The policy raises many questions. For example, is a flooded ditch \nconsidered a navigable water under waters of the United States? Many \npeople believe it is. What about a crop field that just had 2 feet of \nrain? A standing pothole may actually be subject to waters of the \nUnited States, which puts a farmer in the position where they may get \npunitive measures imposed upon them by the EPA.\n  Don't get me wrong. I am a firm believer in ensuring clean water. It \nis imperative to a flourishing agriculture industry and our local State \nand national economies. In North Carolina we have a thriving brewery \nindustry out in the beautiful mountains of Asheville. They need access \nto abundant, clean water.\n  In Eastern North Carolina, we have a thriving pharmaceutical \nindustry. They need access to abundant, clean water. There are a \nvariety of reasons why we have to make sure our water resources are \nclean and abundant.\n  How can I tell our farmers that in ensuring clean water, we may fine \nthem for small flood puddles such as the one shown here? We need fair \npractices that will help turn our economy around, not hinder the hard \nwork of our farmers, our ranchers, and small businesses across this \ncountry. We need policies that will help families put food on their \nkitchen tables and not penalize our land and homeowners.\n  Americans need clarity and they need fairness, not vague, ambiguous \nrules such as the WOTUS, waters of the United States, which undercut \nState authority, undercut local authority, and promote what I believe \nis an illegal government overreach.\n  The Supreme Court has tried to rein in the EPA's misinterpretation of \n``navigable water'' several times. Based on the result of our vote \nearlier today, the majority of this Chamber and the House believe the \nEPA has overreached--and the courts agree. Yet the President said he \nwill veto the bipartisan resolution that just passed out of this \nChamber today. This administration continues to disregard the will of \nthe Congress, the warnings of the courts, and the preferences of the \nAmerican people. How long will we continue to let the partisan Obama \nadministration dictate our course of action in the Congress and for the \ncountry? We must stop this unfunded mandate and alleviate the burdens \non our farmers and business owners, not punish them.\n  If we do not stop the implementation of this egregious rule right \nnow, we are setting a dangerous precedent and we are betraying the \ntrust of many Americans. I urge my fellow colleagues today: Let us stay \nstrong on this bill. Let us send a message to the President that he \nshould sign this resolution into law and get back to healing this \neconomy.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cosponsors \nof the resolution I am about to call up and I be allowed to engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 305, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 305) commending and congratulating \n     the Kansas City Royals on their 2015 World Series Victory.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 305) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, it may be obvious that my colleagues and I, \nhere in the back of the room--even during a serious debate--are a \nlittle happier than the Senate usually finds itself. Of course, we are \nvery pleased to be able to commend our baseball team.\n  While Senator McCaskill and I wish to quickly point out that the team \nis located in Kansas City, MO, certainly Kansans and Missourians join \ntogether to support the Royals, support the Royals in the American \nLeague, and in this case support the Royals in the\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\nWorld Series--and what a series it was. What a team it has been to \nwatch the last couple of years.\n  I think maybe my favorite comment from the series that didn't end \nquite so well for us last year was the one game the manager of the \nGiants just said: They kept hitting the ball where we couldn't get to \nit.\n  That is very much the kind of baseball the Royals play, that big ball \npark they play in. Home runs aren't as much a part of the game as just \nhitting the ball where the other side can't get to it and then always \ngetting to the ball that the other side hits anywhere.\n  This is a series that started with a 14-inning classic and ended in a \n12-inning thriller, with 5 Royals' runs being scored in the top of that \n12th inning.\n  If this had been a seventh-inning series, the Royals wouldn't have \nwon. The Royals outscored the Mets 15 to 1 from the seventh inning on \nand won three of the four games after they were behind in the eighth \ninning or later in the World Series. That just doesn't happen. It is a \ngreat record. It has been a great team. Every player on that team \ncontributed to the wins and contributed in significant ways.\n  Christian Colon became the first Major League player in history to \nget a series-clinching hit in his first postseason at bat ever. Raul \nMondesi became the first player in history to make his Major League \ndebut in the World Series. He never played a World Series game before \nbecause he had never played a Major League game of any kind before. Of \ncourse, the manager of the Royals, Ned Yost, had the highest winning \npercentage in Major League Baseball postseason history as he goes right \non to do what he and the Royals have been doing. Salvador Perez hit \n0.364 in the World Series and started 16 consecutive postseason games \nafter catching 139 games in the regular season. It makes my knees hurt \njust to think about it, but he did it.\n  Yesterday 800,000 fans turned out in Kansas City to welcome the \nRoyals home. We are all pleased to be here. I certainly wish to \ncongratulate the owners, the Glass family; the manager, Ned Yost; the \ngeneral manager, Dayton Moore; the players; the coaches; the fans; and \nthe families. What a great series for the Royals, what a great series \nfor Kansas City, but what a great series for baseball. What a great \nseason for baseball. Certainly, we were all pleased to see the Royals \nbring this victory home.\n  We will start by going to Senator Roberts of Kansas and then we will \ngo back to either a Missourian or a Kansan as we talk about this great \nbaseball team and this great victory.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, I have been sitting here thinking about Missouri and \nKansas and our past histories--some differences in politics, some \ndifferences in sports, big time, down through the years. What a great \nthing to happen when, yes, there is the Kansas City Royals in Missouri. \nI might be a little local here and say primarily filled by Kansas fans, \nbut I will not do that, but it is a great day for both of our States \nand for people who live in our area.\n  We are all proud of our Kansas City Royals. It was a hard-fought \nWorld Series victory, but it was celebrated in Kansas from Goodland to \nLiberal, from Parsons to Troy, way up there on Highway 36 and \neverywhere in between.\n  Yesterday we saw something amazing happen: Kansas fans and Missouri \nfans marching in a sea of blue in downtown Kansas City. There were more \nthan one-half million people--no shoving, no pushing, no fires, no \nproblems. There were young and old people from all walks of life, all \nraces, all nationalities, and all Royals fans. The schools were closed. \nWorkers took a break. The streets filled. The windows opened, and it \nwas a gorgeous Royals blue day.\n  Some are celebrating this kind of victory for the first time. Others \nare remembering 1985, George Brett and that team, and seeing that same \nexcitement again, this time in their children's eyes. You see, some of \nus really counted us out--or some counted us out. We are, in fact, a \nsmall market team, a team with young but very talented guys. They said \nwe haven't had what it takes to be World Series champions. We didn't \nhave the big name home run hitters or the big name flamethrower \npitchers or a big park made smaller for home run hitters. What we did \nhave was a team, players who kept the line moving. The stats made the \ndifference, as indicated from my colleague and friend from Missouri, \nwho went through a number of stats that are rather remarkable.\n  In this postseason, the Royals strikeout rate was only 16 percent, \njust 81 strikeouts in 505 plate appearances. The Royals' regular season \naverage was better, just 15 percent. For baseball, that is really \namazing and it was the best in baseball. The league average in the \nregular season was more than 20 percent--20 percent strikeouts, one out \nof five. That is why people keep yawing. They don't yawn when they \nwatch the Royals.\n  These Royals had a manager who let them play as they were: young, \nfast, and aggressive. That is rather remarkable. Ned Yost let them \nchoose whether or not to steal--that is amazing. He let them swing at \nthe first pitch. Alcides Escobar hit that inside-the-park home run in \nthe first pitch in the bottom of the first inning of the first game of \nthe World Series at Kauffman. That is a ball park for playing baseball: \nhitting, running, fielding, and a few home runs.\n  He let them play the game. They were relentless. They kept the lines \nmoving, went against unconventional baseball wisdom--and oh was it fun \nto watch.\n  We won, Kansas City won, and baseball won. Our celebration today is \nabout the Royals, the joy of the game of baseball, but it is also about \nour identity as a city and a region.\n\n  We were told that a small market team from flyover country would not \nbe able to beat the New York Mets. We won because we kept the line \nmoving--just like the Royals fans do in Kansas and Missouri every day--\nthrough a couple of decades of post-season drought, proving our team, \nour fans, our kind of game is the best in baseball.\n  I know I speak for the fans all over our State and the hundreds of \nthousands of fans that gathered to enjoy and celebrate a victory for \nour team and, yes, for our region, too--and I think for our country. \nEverybody adopted the Royals. Thank you, Royals. Thank you for showing \nthe world what fun baseball can be if you play the game, if you keep \nthe lines moving.\n  The Kansas City Royals are the 2015 World Series champions. How about \nthem apples?\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BLUNT. ``Them apples'' as in the Big Apple? Are those the apples \nwe are talking about?\n  I start in the spring going to minor league games and to major league \ngames, but as we go back and forth across the border here, there is no \nbigger, more dedicated baseball fan in the Senate than Senator \nMcCaskill. If you want to know who is playing, what position they are \nplaying, what their batting average is likely to be, this is always a \ngood way to find out, and I look forward to hearing what she has to say \nabout the Royals.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, listen, I am lucky to be from Missouri \nbecause I love baseball. I love sports. I was raised by a great uncle \nwho was like my grandfather and made me go out to the backyard every \nnight in the summer. I even remember he had a small burgundy transistor \nradio. I would lie on a blanket, he would sit in a lawn chair, and he \nwould hush me--hush me--when important parts of the game came on. He \nwas a big Cardinals fan. I was raised as a Cardinals fan. I spent time \nin Kansas City early in my career. In fact, I was in Kansas City during \nthe 1980s, the last time that Kansas City won the World Series.\n  Some people have the nerve to call our part of the world flyover \ncountry but not when it comes to baseball. For 4 of the last 5 years, \nteams who play ball in the middle of America with lower payrolls and \nwith smaller media markets have made it to the World Series, and for 2 \nof those last 5 years, the world has seen a different kind of ball \nteam. In this day and age when it is all about endorsements, and it is \nall about your agent, and it is all about whether you are a free agent \nand how much money you are going to make, they have seen a team that \nplays like a team. From the fun they have with each other to the way \nthey interact with the community, this is a different kind of \nprofessional baseball team. Yesterday, when most teams would have on \nswag that talked just about their team, T-shirts that would say ``World \nSeries Champion'' or hats that would say ``World Series Champion,'' \nwhat did this team have on yesterday in front of those, some say \n800,000 people from Kansas and Missouri who flooded into the city in \nsuch numbers that they abandoned their cars on the interstate so they \nwould be part of it? What did the team have on? Thank you, KC. It \nwasn't about them; it was about the community and how closely knit the \nteam felt with the community.\n  From the fun they had with 1738 to the T-shirts that people wore \nsaying ``Straight Outta Kauffman,'' this was a\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\nteam that took baseball seriously but didn't take themselves too \nseriously. They played the game with intensity, they played the game \nwith immense skill, but always with joy.\n  I have to tell you the truth. I never thought I would be on the floor \nof the Senate quoting the amazing orator Jonny Gomes. Most people in \nAmerica probably don't know who Jonny Gomes is, but the people of \nKansas City know. Just because you are a backup outfielder doesn't mean \nyou are not important on this team. Jonny Gomes stole the show \nyesterday. To paraphrase him--and I have to be careful, because I can't \nexactly paraphrase him. I don't think one of the words he used I am \nallowed to use on the floor of the Senate. But I believe it went \nsomething like this: Cy Young winner? Not on our team. We beat them. \nRookie of the year? Not on our team. We beat them. MVP of the league? \nNo, sorry guys, not on our team. We beat them. We kicked all of their--\nsomething which I can't say on the floor of the United States Senate.\n  So I am proud to quote Jonny Gomes today. I am proud of who he is and \nwhat he represents. I am proud of this team. This is a team that \nunderstands the essence of being an underdog and coming from behind and \nproving to everybody they are wrong.\n  There is a famous poem about baseball, and one of the famous lines \nstarts with the phrase ``there is no joy.'' I have to tell you, there \nis joy; there is unbridled joy in Kansas City for this team and for all \nthe right reasons. I am incredibly proud to represent a State and an \narea of our country that has produced this kind of sportsmanship and \nthis kind of grit and determination. The Royals never say quit.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I will turn it over to my colleague \nfrom the State of Kansas, who is appropriately sporting a very royal \nblue tie.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nyielding to me, and I appreciate both my colleagues from Missouri and \nKansas joining us on the Senate floor this afternoon.\n  I wonder if there are folks out in the country who might not be \nbaseball fans and are wondering, with all the challenges our country \nfaces, why these four Senators have gathered on the Senate floor to \ntalk about baseball. But the reality is that this is an example of what \ncan happen when we work together.\n  We are divided here between Republicans and Democrats in support of \nthis legislation, and that is much easier to overcome than the fact \nthat Missourians and Kansans are working together. There has been a \nlong rivalry between our two States, much of it done with a smile but \nsome done with a little more intensity than just that smile of Kansas \nversus Missouri or Missouri versus Kansas. The good news is the Royals \nand their championship are more evidence that rivalry--when it comes to \nimportant issues, when it comes to the ability to work together for the \nbenefit of Kansas City and Missouri and Kansas, those communities come \ntogether.\n  I guess my colleagues ought to know that there is Kansas City, MO, \nand there is Kansas City, KS, and suburbs of both those cities on both \nsides of the State line. As I have said, as communities they have come \ntogether to make sure good things happen, and the Royals is just one \nmore example. This is something that matters to Kansans, whether they \nlive close to Missouri or they live close to the Royals stadium.\n  The first overnight visit I ever made to Kansas City and actually \nspent the night in this big city--I grew up about 350 miles west of the \nstadium--was to watch the Royals play ball in the old stadium. All my \nlife I have said, ``Come on, Royals.'' You can walk through the room in \nour house, the television is on, the Royals are playing, and that \nexpression out of my mouth is always ``Come on, Royals.'' It is \nsomething we all grew up with, wherever we lived in the State of \nKansas. You can find almost no fan of baseball in our State who is not \na Royals fan.\n  There is something also about this Royals baseball team. Throughout \nmy lifetime, hearing the voice of Denny Matthews and Fred White as they \ncalled the games in Kansas City and around the country gave me a \nsense--and still today gives me a sense--of peace; that there is \nsomething still right in the world; that baseball is still played and \nteams come together.\n  Most of us grew up in our early days being on a softball or a \nbaseball team. Baseball brings us together. So while my colleagues and \nI recognize the importance of the many issues that our country faces \nand that we are dealing with in the Senate and in the Congress in \nWashington, DC, there is something comforting in knowing that America \ncan still come together on a pastime, on a sport, on an activity that \nstill means so much to so many Americans.\n  So we celebrate with this resolution and ask our colleagues to join \nus in approving this effort in honoring the 2015 World Series \nchampions. It was an amazing season. This is something that hasn't \nhappened since 1985. So 30 years ago, in Kansas City, the Royals played \nin the World Series and won.\n  I still envision my wife and her deceased father--her now deceased \nfather. Robba, with her dad, grew up on the Missouri side of the State \nline, in the shadows of Kauffman Stadium. I can still envision what it \nwas like for a little girl to grab hold of her dad's hand and go to a \nRoyals game to watch baseball. Again, it brings families together on an \nalmost weekly basis over a long season in Kansas City, and it has been \ntrue in our family.\n  We are here today to commend the great things that happened during \nthis season. Since the last time the Royals were champions, many \nKansans, many Missourians, many Americans have grown up and gone off to \ncollege, served in our country's military, gotten married, and started \ntheir own families. So there is great pride, and we are here to affirm \nhow good it feels to have that success once again.\n  It is pleasing to be an American where baseball is a way that we live \nour lives, and it brings us together. It is great to be a Kansan who is \nso proud of the Kansas Royals, and it is great to represent many folks \nin Kansas City who know life as something that surrounds them with the \nKansas City Royals.\n  This was a special year, a special team, and they loved playing the \ngame. They exuded confidence. They never lost focus. Having fallen 90 \nfeet short a year ago, the Royals players were relentless this year in \ntheir drive to get back to the World Series, and it was a joy for all \nof us to watch them accomplish that and finish that job last weekend \nagainst the New York Mets.\n  So I join my colleagues in congratulating the Royals team, the Royals \nfans, and Americans who enjoyed this sport and saw great sportsmanship \non a baseball field. We are thankful to Mr. Kauffman, and now Mr. \nGlass, and their families who have invested their efforts and their \ntime and their commitment to the Kansas City Royals. We appreciate the \ngeneral manager Dayton Moore, and the manager Ned Yost, and commend and \ncongratulate them on this amazing accomplishment. We hope we don't have \nto wait another 30 years for another national championship involving \nthe Royals and their crowning again.\n  Once again, I would say, ``Come on, Royals.''\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, my good friend from Kansas mentioned that \ndistance between third base and home plate, and in the ninth inning of \nthe fifth game of the World Series, Hosmer was on third, and I believe \nthere was one out. A ball was hit squarely to the third baseman, who \ncaught it, ready to throw it to first, and then Hosmer did something \nnobody ever does: He decided he was going to steal home. And when you \ndo that kind of thing, people respond in certain ways. They are \nsurprised, you are surprised, and the Royals did that over and over \nagain. He stole home and the game was tied in the 9th and then went to \nthe 12th, but only because somebody did something nobody thought they \nwould do. We could do a little more of that here, but certainly the \nRoyals did that all season.\n  I want to ask Senator McCaskill if there is anything she wants to add \nas we close up here.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Well, I was lucky enough to be a witness to game 5 in \nNew York, surrounded by a lot of apple-eating fans who were in shocked \ndisbelief when it looked like the Mets had it under control and the \nRoyals pulled a patented move out of their\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\nback pocket to tie up the game in the ninth inning.\n  That particular play was one of those that you could tell it was \nalmost instinct on the part of Hoz because he saw the throw and just \nwent. Frankly, a bad throw to home plate was his savior. I am not sure \nhe would have made it had it not been for the throw that went wild at \nhome plate from the first baseman. But that is the thing that is fun \nabout this team. We can go through--Salvi got the hit. It was a \nsacrifice hit, but nonetheless this is a guy who got MVP. And it wasn't \nas if he hit a bunch of home runs in the World Series; he got MVP \nbecause he consistently performed in almost a utilitarian way, getting \na hit when it was really needed, getting banged up consistently behind \nthe plate. At one point he got hit so hard in the clavicle that I am \nsure a lot of players would have said: I need an inning. I need to get \nout. I need to be replaced. But he just kept shaking off every injury. \nIt could get dangerous because he could go on and on.\n\n  There were so many contributors on this team. That is what made it so \nincredibly special. As Senator Roberts said, it is not as if there was \none hero here, like so many teams that have an A-Rod or a Robert \nGriffin. We can name the big players who have been standouts, Ripkin \nand the rest. This is a team in which everybody is a standout because \nit is all about the team.\n  Mr. BLUNT. It was a great season. We have had a great time here on \nthe floor talking about the Royals and the Kansas City spirit that \ndrove those teams. For us Missourians, maybe we will see both of our \nteams in the World Series again next year.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BLUNT. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Just a note of thanks to the Mets for showing up and \nplaying the Royals--they are a great team--and to give them some \nencouragement. The season starts with the Mets and Royals at Kauffman \nStadium, so they can start all over again. It would be a good thing, \nperhaps, if the Mets made it again, and certainly with the Royals, and \ngave it a shot.\n  I am very glad the Senator mentioned the incident where Hosmer \ndecided to steal home. That was like Jackie Robinson back in the day \nwhen he was seeking to steal home. Who did that? And to do that in \ntoday's ball game, where people pitch only a certain amount of innings \nand players look to the manager to steal and do this and do that and \neverything is sort of in a box--the Royals played out of the box and \nthey had fun.\n  The reason they are all great players is because they played as a \nteam, as my distinguished colleague from Missouri just pointed out. It \nwas a lot of fun. It is going to be fun next year. Don't worry, Mets, \nyou will have a chance again.\n  Mr. BLUNT. There are a lot of life lessons watching the Royals. There \nmight even be some lessons for us Senators watching the Royals and the \nway they do what they do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7758-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7758-S7769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Waters of the United States Rule\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this week has been devoted legislatively to \ndiscussing and considering legislation affecting an EPA regulation \ncalled waters of the United States. It is one more example of executive \noverreach by an increasingly unaccountable Federal agency.\n  I want to speak about our efforts here on the Senate floor this week \nand again encourage my colleagues to continue their efforts to make \ncertain this overreach is responded to by Congress. The courts have \nspoken, but we want to make certain we do our job.\n  One of the criticisms I hear regularly from people who support this \nregulation is this: Don't you care about water quality? Don't you care \nabout clean water? I absolutely think it is important to protect our \nNation's waterways. If you are a Kansan, water is life, water is the \nfuture of your community. Water matters greatly. We are not against \nclean water.\n  Agriculture producers--which dominate in my State--across Kansas are \nstrongly opposed to this regulation, but they are certainly not opposed \nto the efforts to keep our water supply safe and clean. Most Kansas \nfarmers and ranchers hope to pass their land and their farming \noperations on to their kids and grandkids. It serves their interests to \npreserve the land and water to which their family farms are tethered. \nIt is not the Washington lobbyists and the environmental radicals who \nare telling Americans ``If you oppose this regulation, you are opposed \nto clean water.'' That is what they say. Kansans care greatly and \nparticularly farmers and landowners who want their children to enjoy \ntheir farm or ranch in the future care greatly about clean water.\n  It is EPA's abusive regulatory path, characterized by fines, \npenalties, and potential civil lawsuits against landowners, that gives \nus major cause for concern. The Federal Government should not dictate \nto citizens how they manage their private lands.\n  I believe there are better ways to promote water quality than with \nthreats of severe fines, penalties, or even jail time. One of the ways \nwe see this effort take place is through the Department of \nAgriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service. NRCS promotes soil \nand water health not by mandates and threats from Washington but \nthrough collaborative, voluntary approaches that encourage conservation \nthrough incentives and on-the-ground technical assistance for those \nlandowners.\n  Unlike the EPA, which seems to view agriculture producers as \nuntrustworthy partners who must be forced into caring for the land, \nNRSC and the USDA Farm Service Agency efforts are successful in large \npart because they operate under the recognition that farmers and \nranchers are devoted stewards to their land.\n  Policies such as the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program and \nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program are examples of voluntary \napproaches that incentivize innovation, provide technical assistance, \nand more broadly promote clean water through localized, cooperative \nefforts. Compare those approaches to what we are debating here on the \nfloor today and earlier this week--an overly broad, overly complex, \noverly ambitious regulation drafted by an agency that has shown a \ncomplete unwillingness to listen to or work with landowners.\n  This regulation is pretty straightforward. If it is water, EPA has \nthe authority to regulate it unless it decides it doesn't want to. \nAgain, what this regulation basically says is that if it is water, EPA \nhas the authority to regulate it unless EPA decides it doesn't want to \ndo it.\n  First, EPA declares that all ``tributaries'' are waters of the United \nStates. Tributaries are defined as anything with a bed, banks, or an \nordinary high-water mark, regardless of the frequency or duration of \nthe water flow. This kind of definition is so broad and all-\nencompassing that the EPA can assert jurisdiction over streams and \nditches that may flow only for a few hours following a rainstorm.\n  This regulation also controls waters that are ``adjacent'' to any \nwater that is under EPA's jurisdiction, including 100-year-old \nfloodplains. And if somehow water could still escape the EPA's long \nshadow, its broad definition, they came up with yet one more way to \nregulate it. The regulation states that if waters aren't adjacent or \nare not tributaries, they can still regulate if there is ``significant \nnexus'' between the waters EPA wants to regulate and navigable or \ninterstate water. What that means is that every drop of rain can be \nregulated because every drop of rain always ends up in a body of water \nthat is navigable. All EPA has to do is establish some connection \nbetween the two, and they have granted themselves the authority to \nregulate the waters.\n  With its significant civil fines and criminal penalties for those not \nin compliance, we can see why so many Americans are concerned.\n  Last year, EPA went on a public relations campaign of sorts to \nconvince stakeholders and to convince people across the country that \nthey only meant to ``clarify,'' not expand, the\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\nregulation. Instead of lecturing, the EPA should have listened to the \noverwhelming feedback they received from constituents, including many \nwho attended a meeting in Kansas City. The EPA should have scrapped the \nrule and started over.\n  Now we have learned that not only did the EPA ignore the outcry of \nthe American people, but they also disregarded the technical experts at \nthe Army Corps of Engineers who described the rule as ``not reflective \nof the Corps' experience or expertise.'' Again, the Corps is the agency \nthat the EPA is to work with to develop rules. They are the experts, \nand they say this rule is not reflective of the Corps' experience or \nexpertise. The Corps says it is not accurate. The Corps says it is not \nsupported by science or law. The Corps says it is inconsistent with the \nSupreme Court's decision. And the Corps says it is regulatory \noverreach.\n  It is obvious that the regulation exceeds the EPA's legal authority \nunder the Clean Water Act. It is equally obvious that the EPA intended \nto run roughshod over anyone who disagreed.\n  The waters of the United States regulation is, in short, a \nbreathtaking abuse of power, and it is something Congress needs to \naddress.\n  For too long, Congress has looked the other way when this Executive \nor any other occupant of the White House exceeds their congressionally \nmandated legal authorities. Republicans perhaps look the other way when \nthere is a Republican President and Democrats look the other way when \nthere is a Democratic President. The reality is that Congress needs to \nplay its constitutional role in determining what the law is and prevent \nthe abuse that comes from a White House that exceeds that legislative \nauthority day after day.\n  The EPA's regulations ignore two Supreme Court opinions. It ignores a \ntime-honored understanding of what the law does and does not permit in \nthe way of regulation, as evidenced by numerous legislative attempts \nrejected by Congress to amend the Clean Water Act that the Obama \nadministration now does by regulatory action. It ignores the serious \nrepercussions for farmers and ranchers, electric cooperatives that \nprovide electricity to my State, the oil and gas industry that provides \njobs across Kansans, the homebuilders that provide homes for Kansans, \nand many other small business owners in our State and across the \ncountry. And it ignores the concerns voiced by so many more, including \nState and local officials across Kansas and our Nation.\n  At the end of the day, if the goal is to promote clean water and \nresponsible land management, there is a much more effective method to \ndo so, as evidenced by the voluntary cooperative efforts within USDA \nthat respect private property rights, incentivize conservation rather \nthan criminalize landowners, and don't threaten to do irreparable harm \nto our country and to the jobs Kansans so desperately need.\n  I urge my colleagues to block this regulation and to force the EPA \nand the Army Corps of Engineers to work with State and local officials \nand those affected by the regulation in protecting real waters of the \nUnited States. We must protect those waters. We should do it much \ndifferently than the Environmental Protection Agency proposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                          Crude Oil Export Ban\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, about a month ago the White House \nannounced that it has reached a deal with 11 other countries along the \nPacific Rim--known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This is a major \ntrade agreement that followed on the approval of trade promotion \nauthority by the Congress.\n  As we might expect, President Obama has been quick to tout his \ncredentials as a pro-trade President, and I think so far, so good. In \nfact, though, you might say he is so pro-trade that he has \nsignificantly not only sought to open up the U.S. economy but also the \nIranian economy, releasing billions of dollars to a hostile regime by \nnegotiating a deal to ease sanctions against them and potentially \nreleasing as much as 1 million barrels of crude oil by Iran onto the \nworld markets. I think it has been well documented that I oppose that \ndeal.\n  I do find the President's position is perplexing at minimum or \nhypocritical at worst. It is hypocritical that despite his self-\nproclaimed pro-trade stance, he refuses to do something that should be \na no-brainer when it comes to any proponent of free trade: opening up \nforeign markets to the things we make and produce here, like lifting \nthe antiquated ban on exporting crude oil.\n  By refusing to revise this outdated policy, the President continues \nto contribute to the flatline of our economy and to deny our potential \nas an energy powerhouse. And, I might add, at the same time, by not \nacting to lift this export ban, the President continues to deny our \nallies the energy they need for their economic security and to improve \ntheir national security.\n  Next month will mark 40 years since the United States put into place \na ban on the export of crude oil. For those who might not be familiar \nwith the history, let me offer a little bit of background.\n  The crude oil export ban was put in place decades ago as a precaution \nto protect the United States from disruptions to global supply of oil \nin the 1970s, at a time when we were importing the majority of the oil \nand gas that we consumed here in the United States. But, fortunately, \nthe world looks a lot different than it did back in the 1970s. For \nexample, in 1970, world production was roughly 48 million barrels of \noil a day. In 2015 that number has doubled to 100 million barrels of \noil a day, and the United States alone is producing about 9.4 million \nbarrels of oil a day.\n  As recently as 2008, 76 percent of Americans believed that the world \nwas somehow running out of oil. Thanks to the remarkable shale \nrevolution, we have come a long way in helping the geopolitical energy \nlandscape turn in our favor here in the United States and have reduced \nour dependency on imported energy from other parts of the country.\n  I should mention that it is because of the commonsense policies of \nStates such as Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and North Dakota that we have \nbeen able to take advantage of the incredible new technology in this \nfield that goes along with horizontal drilling and fracking to produce \na supply of oil and gas that we never would have dreamed of a few short \nyears ago. These developments have been nothing short of revolutionary.\n  We have recently seen an uptick in oil imports in the United States, \nprimarily because overseas energy producers are discounting their crude \nto be able to take advantage of the U.S. market. The downward trend for \nthe past several years of imports of oil showed that the United States \nis importing less than it historically has. Why? Because we are \nproducing more here, so we are less reliant. I think most people would \nthink that would be a good thing.\n  Our country doesn't need to bar our domestically produced energy from \nreaching the global market. We should do away with this antiquated \npolicy and, in so doing, help kick start the U.S. economy in the \nprocess. First, let me talk about what this would do to help our \neconomy. Lifting the ban would mean real job creation right here in \nthis country. These are not minimum wage jobs. These are well-paying \njobs. It is easy to think that lifting the ban would only provide a \nlimited benefit to those who work in the domestic energy sector, but \nthat is actually not the case.\n  Domestic energy production involves many different sectors, from \nconstruction to shipping to technology companies. By allowing our \ncountry to export more crude, the United States has the potential to \ncreate many, many jobs here in the United States at a time when we need \nmore jobs--not only in the domestic energy sector but deep in the \nsupply chain as well.\n  One study estimated that for every new production job, it translates \ninto three additional jobs in the supply chain and another six in the \nbroader economy. It is estimated that in my home State of Texas alone, \nmore than 40,000 jobs could be created in the coming years simply by \nlifting the ban and making available to producers the global benchmark \nprice known as the Brent price. Several studies have suggested that \nhundreds of thousands of jobs in multiple sectors throughout the \ncountry could be created in the coming years if the crude export ban is \nlifted.\n  By the way, I should mention this--because this is probably on \neverybody's mind: What is this going to do to the price of gasoline? \nStudy after study has\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\ndocumented that gasoline prices are going to remain either where they \nare now or go lower should the ban be lifted. By the way, the Energy \nSecretary of the Obama administration, Dr. Moniz, agrees with that. It \nis plain old supply and demand, if you think about it.\n  Lifting the crude oil ban export would strengthen our economy and \ncould actually save Americans money at the pump. But doing away with \nthis outdated, protectionist policy also gives us the opportunity to \npromote stronger relationships with our friends and allies around the \nworld. For example, our NATO allies and other nations in Europe rightly \nquestion why the United States doesn't lift this ban, which would help \nthem achieve a source of energy that they need, instead of having to \ndepend on countries such as Russia that use it as an instrument of \ncoercion and intimidation.\n  Today, many of our allies in Europe rely not only on Russia but on \nIran for their energy needs. Wouldn't it be so much better if we were \nable to enter into contracts to sell our energy to our friends and \nallies to help prop them up and provide them another source of energy, \nrather than leave them dependent on countries such as Russia that want \nto use it as an instrument of intimidation. Because of these countries' \ndependence on our adversaries for their basic needs such as heating, \nelectricity, and fuel, this represents a real vulnerability, not just \nfor them but for us as well because we are part of the North Atlantic \nTreaty Organization.\n  As our world becomes more interconnected, we need to take a more \nlong-term strategic view. That means considering the implications of \nour energy policies for our own national security. By lifting this ban, \nthe United States can offer to help our friends diversify their energy \nsupplies and enhance their energy security and help reduce the revenue \nthat these rogue states take in for nefarious purposes--such as Iran, \nthe No. 1 sponsor of state terrorism.\n  Lifting the crude oil ban represents a rare opportunity to do two \nthings vital for our country: to strengthen our economy and to promote \na safer, more stable world for our allies and partners and ultimately \nfor us.\n  Last month, in a strong bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives \nvoted to overturn this ban. Now it is time for the Senate to do the \nsame. Unfortunately, the White House has already sent a signal that \nwere we to pass such a bill to lift the ban, the President might decide \nto veto this pro-trade legislation. I wish to point out to the White \nHouse and to anybody else who is listening that time and again the \nPresident has relied on Republicans in this Chamber to advance his pro-\ntrade agenda. The reason we have done it is because we agree that a \npro-trade agenda is good for our economy and good for our security.\n  Soon we will have an opportunity to read the full text of the Trans-\nPacific Partnership Agreement that I mentioned earlier. Pro-trade \nRepublicans in this Chamber, myself included, have voted to equip \nCongress with a powerful mechanism with which to consider trade \nagreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement or trade \npromotion authority. Trade promotion authority, or TPA, which passed \nwith strong Republican support and only 13 Democratic votes in the \nSenate, does not guarantee that the President's agreement will pass \nthis Senate or this Congress--far from it. I am going to use all of the \ntools that we have provided for in the trade promotion authority \nlegislation to make sure this proposed deal, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, gets the kind of careful scrutiny it deserves.\n  We know the President, with not much time left in his administration, \nis looking for a legacy accomplishment. But this President's \ninconsistency with respect to free trade gives me great pause. I have \nto say that he can't take my support for granted or, I believe, the \nsupport of others in this Chamber for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nparticularly if he acts so inconsistently on other free trade measures \nsuch as lifting the crude oil export ban.\n  Moving forward, I hope the President will learn to work with those of \nus in Congress who have traditionally supported free trade in every \nrespect. If he were truly the pro-trade President he claims to be, his \nadministration would prioritize lifting the crude oil export ban with \nthe same ferocity with which it supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                    Waters of the United States Rule\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague for what he just \nsaid, and I want to also applaud the colleagues who today took a stand \nagainst the regulatory onslaught and overreach being waged by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. In promulgating the waters of the \nUnited States rule, or WOTUS, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers \nhave teamed up to promulgate one of the most expansive Federal power \ngrabs across the Nation.\n  Recently, I spoke to this body about the threat that the growth and \nexpansion of Federal regulations pose to this country's economic well-\nbeing. The growth of Federal regulation and bureaucracy is a menacing \nthreat to this country's security and success. What America needs now \nis a smaller, less burdensome regulatory framework that will permit our \nNation's economy to thrive. With the $18 trillion of debt, we can only \nafford policies that will serve as a catalyst for economic growth.\n  This waters of the United States rule is a prime example of a Federal \nagency coming up with regulations that do the precisely opposite. In \nthe early 1970s, Congress passed the Clean Water Act and charged the \nEPA with protecting our Nation's navigable waters from pollutants. It \nhas worked. Since then, the EPA and the Corps have been working to ever \nexpand the definition and scope of ``navigable water,'' this time \nstretching the meaning all the way to the limits of common sense.\n  With the waters of the United States rule, the administration has \nonce again demonstrated a willingness to advance its own goal at any \ncost. Under this expansive new rule, the EPA may implement substantial \nadditional permitting and regulatory requirements under the Clean Water \nAct without any thought to the employees who will lose their jobs, to \nthe businesses or industries this rule will cripple.\n  As the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said earlier this week in a letter to \nthis body, business owners and their employees in all sectors of the \neconomy would be affected by the regulatory uncertainty of this rule, \nwhich is ``certain to chill the development and expansion of large and \nsmall projects across the country.''\n  Again, this is not the kind of regulation America can afford. The \nwaters of the United States rule is so expansive that it would redefine \nthe jurisdiction of bodies of water under Federal control all the way \ndown to, for example, all water located within 100 feet of other \njurisdictional water. This is my favorite: The rule further includes \nall waters located within 1,500 feet of any other jurisdictional water, \nif it also is in the 100-year flood plain.\n  I don't know about you, Mr. President, but I won't stand for giving \nany Federal agency--much less the EPA--five football fields worth of \nleeway to enforce any rules or regulations.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I seldom hear any agency talking \nabout having enough resources. The EPA is not an exception. They can't \ntake care of what they already do, and now they want to bite off every \nbody of water in the United States. There is a lot of water that can be \ncleaned up. There is a lot of water that has been cleaned up. You \nalways start with what is worse. I always tell people that Jesse James \nrobbed banks because that is where the money was. You start where the \nmost pollution is, not where the least pollution is.\n  States already know best what makes their waters navigable, and they \ndon't need a Federal rule like waters of the United States to constrain \nthem. This is particularly true for the Western States, where water is \na rare and protected source and is respected accordingly. In Idaho, a \nState which historically relied on streams to support its timber \nindustry, lawmakers consider a stream navigable if it will float timber \nin excess of 6 inches of diameter or if it is capable of being \nnavigated by oar. Six inches--that is not a very big log. If the State \nof Idaho protects streams small enough to float logs that size, they \ndon't need a rule like WOTUS to further constrict what is considered \nnavigable.\n  At some point, the overregulation by the EPA and this administration \nhas to\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\nbe stopped. Today we had an opportunity to do just that. By passing the \nresolution of disapproval, we have sent a message to the President, his \nadministration, and all of its bureaucrats. Earlier this week, the body \nmissed a keen opportunity to pass my friend Senator John Barrasso's \nbill to roll back this regulation. His bill would have sent the EPA and \nthe Corps back to the drawing board to develop a new rule. It would \nhave told them how to do it. It would have required them to conduct a \nthorough economic analysis and consult with States, consult with local \ngovernments, and consult with small businesses. Congress made a mistake \nin 1972 when it passed the Clean Water Act and left too much up to the \nEPA to define. We had a chance to fix that error with Senator \nBarrasso's bill.\n  This rule allows the EPA to regulate any body of water that has a \nsignificant nexus to navigable water. Unfortunately, the rule leaves \nthe definition of ``significant nexus'' open to the EPA's \ninterpretation.\n  Here is something that fascinates me. If you contest, guess who gets \nto make the ruling in the case. The EPA does. Guess how they are going \nto rule. As anyone from Wyoming would attest, never has a Federal \nbureaucrat missed an opportunity to make life a little more complicated \nfor the folks out West. I can't possibly think of why I would give the \nEPA an opportunity to do so here.\n\n  The Clean Water Act recognizes States as having primary \nresponsibility for land and water resources within their boundaries. \nThat is a responsibility taken very seriously in places like my home \nState of Wyoming, where so many farmers, ranchers, and small business \nowners rely on water for their livelihood. In Wyoming, folks know that \nyou have to take care of the land or the land will never take care of \nyou. You won't find better stewards for land and water anywhere, so if \nthe folks in Wyoming tell you a rule governing the use of water is no \ngood, you can take that to the bank.\n  As the State's Governor Matt Mead said, this rule was bad from the \nstart. In his words:\n\n       The EPA failed to properly consult with states or consider \n     states' concerns. The rule unlawfully seeks to expand federal \n     jurisdiction over water, undercuts state primacy and burdens \n     landowners and water users in the West.\n\n  Wyoming has joined 30 other States in suing the EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers to block this rule. If over 60 percent of the States in this \nNation are spending time and money to ask the courts to block this \nrule, then this resolution should pass with flying colors. In fact, if \nthe 2 Senators from each of the 31 States that are suing were to vote \nfor either the resolution before or this resolution, the previous one \nwould have passed cloture. This one didn't require cloture. So in \npassing this joint resolution of disapproval, our actions appropriately \nreflected what our States are telling us to do: Stop this rule.\n  Two Federal courts have already recognized the fallacy of this rule \nand issued stays to prevent it from being enforced. Those courts have \nrecognized what we should all recognize: the massive scope of this rule \nand the potential damage it could cause.\n  Wyoming was lucky in that it got some relief from a U.S. district \ncourt judge before the rule could be enforced in late August. In that \nruling by which the court stayed the rule's enforcement, the court \nsaid:\n\n       The rule asserts jurisdiction over waters that are remote \n     and intermittent. No evidence actually points to how these \n     intermittent and remote wetlands have any nexus to navigable-\n     in-fact water.\n\n  I couldn't have said it better.\n  What the EPA is doing is more out of control than protection. It is \nan overreach, it is power, and they can't afford it. For the sake of \nfarmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small businesses and their \nemployees, it is time to stop this outrageous regulation.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Ernst for \nrecognizing how important it is to fight this bad EPA rule and bring \nlegislation to the floor to push back.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this resolution of \ndisapproval so that we can send a clear message to the President that \nthis Congress will not continue to accept ill-thought-out, ever-\nexpansive, unendingly complicated regulations from this administration, \nones that the courts have already ruled on three times.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy with Senators Carper, Warren, Murphy, Blumenthal, Schatz, and \nBrown for up to 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          For-Profit Colleges\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I come to the Senate floor to \ndiscuss the issue of for-profit colleges. One may wonder how a Member \nof the U.S. Senate takes up an issue. This came to my attention when a \nyoung woman in Chicago, IL, contacted our office and told her story. \nShe was a conscientious young woman who wanted a college education, \nand, having graduated high school, she shopped around on the Internet \nand found the degree she wanted. It was a degree in law enforcement \noffered by Westwood College. Westwood is a for-profit college based in \nColorado.\n  She enrolled in Westwood, and 5 years later--5 years of classes \nlater--she got her diploma in law enforcement from Westwood. She took \nit to every law enforcement agency in the Chicagoland area, and they \nsaid: Young lady, this is not a real college; this is one of those for-\nprofit Westwood colleges. We don't recognize your degree.\n  When she went to another place, she got the same reaction, and then \nshe realized she had wasted 5 years of her life on a worthless diploma. \nBut that is not the worst part. She incurred a student loan debt of \n$80,000 and she couldn't get a job. She moved back into her parents' \nbasement. Her dad came out of retirement to help her pay off this loan, \nand she is going to take years to do it. She has postponed buying a \ncar, getting her own apartment, or even considering marriage or a \nfamily. This was one personal tragedy that opened my mind.\n  I used to drive out on the Kennedy Expressway and see Westwood \nCollege signs on these large, tall buildings and think, wow, this must \nbe some college. Well, it turned out that it was part of a network of \nfor-profit colleges and universities that I have been researching and \nspeaking about ever since.\n  When I started 5 years ago, it was a different industry than it is \ntoday. Too many people like this young lady ended up with empty \npromises, deep debt, and worthless diplomas from for-profit colleges \nand universities.\n  Westwood isn't the only one. The biggest for-profit college is the \nUniversity of Phoenix. DeVry University, based out of Chicago, IL, is \nthe second largest. Kaplan--which used to own or was owned by the \nWashington Post, depending on your point of view--ITT Tech, and Le \nCordon Bleu are names young people know right off the bat because they \nare inundated with advertising from for-profit schools. They and their \nparents think these are real schools. They think: It is worth my time. \nIt is worth the debt to me and my family to pursue a degree.\n  Five years ago, this industry was in its heyday. Enrollment and \nprofits were sky high. They were a favorite of Wall Street investors. \nBetween 1998 and 2008, enrollment at for-profit colleges exploded by \n225 percent. By 2010, total enrollment in these for-profit schools \nreached 2.4 million.\n  When the former chairman of the HELP Committee, Senator Tom Harkin of \nIowa, released a report on the industry in 2012, they had grown to take \nan incredible share--$32 billion in Federal taxpayer dollars, 25 \npercent of all the Federal aid to education. Despite the fact that they \nhad 10 percent of the students, they were taking 25 percent of the \nFederal aid at that point. Why? They are so expensive. The tuition is \nso much higher than public colleges and universities or even many \nprivate colleges.\n  Meanwhile, more than half the students who enrolled in for-profit \ncolleges left without a degree within 4 months and found themselves in \nstudent loan default. Five years ago, 10 percent of the students \naccounted for 47 percent of the student loan defaults. How can it be \nthat 47 percent of the students who can't pay back their student loans \nwent to for-profit colleges? It costs so much and the degrees are \nworthless.\n  John Murphy is a cofounder of the University of Phoenix. This was the \nmother ship of them all during the\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\ngreat for-profit college movement. Here is what he said in the Deseret \nNews National:\n\n       They are not educators and they're looking to manipulate \n     this model to make money. There is nothing wrong with making \n     money, but I think anyone making money in an educational \n     activity has a higher standard of accountability.\n\n  John Murphy, a cofounder of the University of Phoenix, is right. He \nexplained that they started off as a serious venture to educate \nstudents, but they soon became a company listed on Wall Street chasing \nstock prices, tapping into the open spigot of Federal loans, which Mr. \nMurphy calls the juice of the for-profit college industry. He went on \nto say:\n\n       Phoenix was the one that got it rolling, and then all the \n     other for-profits followed them in.\n\n  I will yield at this point to my colleague from Hawaii. I thank \nSenator Schatz for joining me in this colloquy.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader \nfor his leadership on this issue and for his willingness to educate \ncolleagues and educate the public and to push the DOE to take much \nneeded action in this area.\n  What is happening with some for-profit colleges is truly a national \nscandal, and it is a scandal for two reasons: First, students are being \nhurt, and second, we are wasting tens of billions of dollars. The \nnumbers speak for themselves. Almost 2 million students are enrolled in \nfor-profit colleges, and they have collectively taken on $200 billion \nin debt to attend, but they often leave with little to show for it. \nMore than half drop out within a few months, and in some programs less \nthan 5 percent of their students ever graduate. For those who leave \nwithout a degree, repaying loans is a struggle. Students at for-profit \ncolleges default on student loans at double the rate of students at \nnot-for-profit colleges.\n  People may be surprised to learn that these substandard programs are \nfinanced almost entirely by the Federal Government, and the amount is \ntotally staggering. In total, for-profits receive over $32 billion a \nyear in Federal financial aid--over 20 percent of the total aid--yet \nthey serve only 12 percent of the students.\n  There are several for-profit companies that each take in more than $1 \nbillion a year in Federal aid and graduate less than 10 percent of \ntheir students. Think about that. They take in more than $1 billion in \nFederal taxpayer money and they graduate less than 10 percent of their \nstudents. These companies include the Apollo Group, DeVry, ITT, Kaplan, \nand Education Management Corporation.\n  Not only are the educational metrics awful, but many of these for-\nprofit colleges are also under investigation for fraud and deception. \nEssentially, they have been lying to students and to State and Federal \nagencies to cover up how bad their record is. Even while prosecutors go \nafter these schools for fraud, they remain accredited and continue to \nrake in Federal funds. Here are a few examples:\n  Education Management Corporation, EMC, faces charges of fraud and \ndeception brought by prosecutors in 13 States and the Department of \nJustice and faces a lawsuit to recover $11 billion in Federal and State \nfunds. Yet EMC is still accredited and still receives $1.25 billion \nfrom the U.S. DOE. So the Department of Justice is trying to recover \n$11 billion at the same time that the Department of Education gives \nthem $1.25 billion.\n  ITT Educational Services is being investigated and sued by 19 States, \nthe SEC, CFPB, and the DOJ. It is also under scrutiny from U.S. DOE for \nfailure to meet financial responsibility standards. Yet they are still \naccredited, and last year they received just under $600 million.\n  Another 152 schools are under investigation by a working group of 37 \nState attorneys general. They too are still accredited. Collectively, \nthey received $8 billion in Federal financial aid last year.\n  What do all of these schools have in common? They are accredited. \nAccreditation is the key to the castle for accessing this spigot of \nFederal financial aid. It is supposed to signify that a program \nprovides a quality education for its students. Too often, however, the \naccreditation means nearly nothing.\n  The GAO released a study on accreditation last year, and its findings \nare shocking. Over a 4-year period, the GAO found that accreditors \nsanctioned only 8 percent of the institutions they oversee and revoked \naccreditation for just 1 percent. Even more troubling, GAO found there \nwas no correlation between accreditor sanctions and educational \nquality. In other words, schools with bad student outcomes were no more \nlikely to be sanctioned by their accreditor than schools with good \nstudent outcomes.\n  Our accreditation system is broken. According to the Higher Education \nAct, accreditation agencies are supposed to be ``reliable authorities \nas to the quality of education or training offered'' by institutions of \nhigher education.\n  That is the reason for making accreditation a core criterion for \nreceiving Federal funds. How are we following the law when \naccreditation reviews find that 99 percent--basically, everybody--99 \npercent of institutions are providing an education of value? How can we \nsay with a straight face that accreditors are acting as reliable \nauthorities on educational quality?\n  The problem here is money. Incentives are lined up against being \ncritical and against setting high standards. The problem can be traced \nto the funding and governance of the accrediting agencies. First, \naccrediting agencies are funded by the same institutions they accredit. \nColleges pay an initial fee to become accredited and annual dues after \nthat. They pay for site visits and other services.\n  Second, accrediting agencies are run and overseen by the institutions \nthey accredit. The member institutions elect their own academics and \nadministrators to serve on the board of the accreditation agency.\n  It is not hard to see how the incentives are misaligned here. We have \ncreated a dysfunctional, if not corrupt, ecosystem in which it is far \ntoo easy to become and remain accredited. This system is eerily similar \nto the one that enabled credit rating agencies to pump out inflated \nasset ratings, which contributed to the worst financial crisis of our \ntime. Like credit rating agencies, accreditors have a financial \ninterest to churn out accreditations.\n  The DOE has the authority to improve accreditation. There are a lot \nof things that Senator Durbin and others, Senator Murphy, and I are \nworking on in terms of changing the Higher Education Act and working in \nthe appropriations context, but U.S. DOE has authority that it is \nbeginning to use but needs to use more of in the accreditation space. \nIt can and must do more to ensure that accreditors are actually looking \nat academic quality and holding schools to high standards. For the sake \nof students and taxpayers, the DOE must make this a top priority.\n  I thank the assistant Democratic leader for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Hawaii can stay \nfor just a moment.\n  If a student is about to graduate from high school, looking for a \ncollege, and goes online and types in the word ``college'' or \n``university,'' watch what happens. The page is flooded. The University \nof Phoenix, DeVry, Kaplan--all of these different schools are flooding \nthe page saying: Come to our school. How does a student know if it is \ngood or not? The only yardstick that can be used is, well, do they \nreceive Federal Pell grants for their students? Do their students \nreceive Federal loans? The answer, when it comes to for-profit schools, \nis yes.\n  Senator Schatz has put his finger on the problem. They accredit \nthemselves. They decide among themselves who will stay in business. \nGuess what. They all stay in business.\n  So the unsuspecting student goes to a worthless, for-profit school, \ngets a worthless diploma, goes deep in debt, and thinks, I thought this \nwas a good school. How can I get a Federal Pell grant to this school \nand get a worthless diploma?\n  The Department of Education is not doing its job. Congress is not \ndoing its job. We have to enforce these standards.\n  Corinthian was one of the giants. Corinthian went bankrupt. They \nmeasured how many students came out of Corinthian and got a job. The \nnumbers were pretty encouraging. The Huffington Post writer started \nfollowing\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\nthe students that got the jobs. Do you know what Corinthian was doing? \nThey were giving $2,000 to employers to hire their graduates for 1 \nmonth so they could report to the Federal Government that their \ngraduates all have jobs. When they were caught with it, they went \nbankrupt.\n  Do my colleagues know what we ended up losing, what the Federal \ntaxpayers lost? It could be billions. Who ended up on the hook? The \nstudents. The students ended up with the debt, and the taxpayers ended \nup as losers. Corinthian should never have been accredited.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, there are two problems here. Normally, \nwhen something is a waste of taxpayer money, it is not usually also \nharmful to individuals across the country, but this is a double whammy. \nThis is harming students, causing them to collectively incur tens of \nbillions of dollars' worth of debt, and it is a waste of money, so this \nreally is a double whammy.\n  I will make this final point: The Obama administration has done the \nright thing in terms of going after malfeasance in this space, but they \nare split among their executive agencies. We have the Department of \nJustice who understands the fraud and deception. We even have parts of \nthe U.S. DOE that understands what is going on, yet they have been slow \non the uptake in terms of using the authority under the statute to make \nthe accreditation process a little more reliable when it comes to \nstudents. I think that is one of the key things that we are going to be \nable to accomplish in the next couple of years. The U.S. DOE has to \nunderstand that there are separate accrediting agencies, but under the \nhigher education statute, U.S. DOE has the authority to make sure that \nno institution that is providing a low-quality education and no \ninstitution that is engaging in fraud and deception ought to avail \nthemselves of tens of billions of dollars in Federal financing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Last week, the senior Senator from Arizona came to the floor and said \nit was Durbin's speeches that brought down Corinthian. Correction: What \nbrought down Corinthian was its own malfeasance. They were under \ninvestigation by 20 different attorneys general for fraud and \ndeception. They were also under investigation by the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the Department of Education, and the Department of \nJustice. It was their malfeasance that brought them down, as Senator \nSchatz has indicated. The victims: Students and taxpayers.\n  For purposes of this colloquy, I wish to yield to my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Carper.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator for inviting \nus to come to the floor this afternoon and have this conversation. It \nis great to be with our colleague from Hawaii as well.\n  Senator Durbin and I came to the House of Representatives together in \n1982. I had been a State treasurer and before that I was a naval flight \nofficer. I was a P-3 aircraft mission commander. I served three tours \nin Southeast Asia. In 1968, the P-3 four-engine aircrafts were on 12-\nhour surveillance flights tracking Soviet nuclear submarines all over \nthe world. We flew a lot of missions off the coast of Vietnam and \nCambodia, low-level missions tracking infiltration. That is what I did \non three tours over there.\n  I came back from overseas after the last tour, 5 years, and moved \nfrom California where my station was home ported, where my squad was \nhome ported during the war, and I ended up moving across the country. I \nfound Delaware on the map, drove my Volkswagen across the country, and \nenrolled in business school.\n  I signed up with the GI Bill. I remember the first check I got was \n$250. I was thrilled. I used that money to help pay my expenses, and I \nsigned up with a Reserve P-3 aircraft squadron up at the naval air \nstation north of Philly and started flying the same aircraft and a new \nsquadron. I did that for another 18 years and then retired as a Navy \ncaptain.\n  As Senator and as a Governor for 8 years and as commander in chief of \nthe Delaware National Guard--they have a special spot in my heart. A \ncouple of months ago, a delegation with the Governor were sending off \nthe 300 men and women from the Delaware National Guard to eventually \nend up in Afghanistan. I suspect they are there by this time. I said to \nthe men and women and their families as they were preparing to leave--I \ntold them about my GI Bill and how grateful I was to have it for my \ngeneration. I talked to them about their GI Bill. I said: When you come \nhome, if you have 3 years of service during your time in Afghanistan, \nhere is what you are going to get. If you go to Delaware State \nUniversity, University of Delaware, Delaware Tech Community College, \nyou go for free--tuition, free; books, free; fees, tutoring, free. Plus \nyou get a $1,500 a month housing allowance. People said: Wow. And I \nsaid: If the GI doesn't use it--the Delaware National Guardsman--if you \nguys don't use it when you come home, your spouse can use it. If your \nspouse doesn't use it, your dependent children can use it. It is the \nmost incredible GI bill benefit ever. My generation, we got $250 a \nmonth. I am happy for the folks today who serve in Afghanistan and in \nIraq for the benefit they receive.\n  It has not only been a great benefit for the veterans and their \nfamilies, it puts in the words of--I think it is Polly Petraeus who \nworks at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Polly said that what \nthe GI bill does is it also puts a silver bull's-eye on the veterans \nbecause they come back and what happens is a lot of colleges and \nuniversities and training schools want to help those GIs and their \nspouses and maybe their kids go to school. Some of them are for-profits \nand some of them are non-profits; some of them are public colleges and \nuniversities. Some of them do a great job. Some of the for-profits even \ndo a great job. But some of them--and the Senator from Illinois has \nmentioned some of them here today--do not. They spend more money on \ntrying to recruit people to come to their schools than they actually \nspend educating them. They are preparing them for careers, allegedly, \nfor what there are no jobs. Senator Durbin mentioned what Corinthian \nhas done to place people in work opportunities for a month or so just \nso it will look like people are being gainfully employed.\n  There is a lot of money to be made by these for-profit colleges and \nuniversities, and for the ones that aren't the white hats but the black \nhats, what is happening to the GIs and, frankly, to taxpayers is \nshameful. It is just shameful.\n  I want to say around maybe 1992, maybe the early 1990s, maybe on this \nfloor, the Senate debated whether or not there should be some way to \nharness market forces to ensure that--whether it is people using Pell \ngrants or other Federal aid programs, or maybe the GI bill--they could \nsomehow harness market forces to ensure that taxpayer money going to \npeople going to college was being well used. Initially, when the \nCongress adopted something called the 85-15 rule, the idea was that for \nat least 15 percent of the students in the school, if they were \nreceiving Federal assistance, 85 percent of those students would have \nto be coming on nonFederal money. That seemed to make sense, so for a \nwhile, that worked pretty well.\n  Then the rule was changed to the 90-10 rule so that at least 10 \npercent of the revenues had to come from nonFederal sources. The idea \nwas to use market forces to ensure that the quality of the diploma was \nactually worthwhile at the school.\n  Then, we had this new GI bill. We have spent, I think--and the \nSenator from Illinois probably knows better than me, but I think we \nhave spent today close to $50 billion on the Iraq-Afghanistan GI bill, \nclose to $50 billion. It probably dwarfs whatever we spent for folks \ncoming back from the Vietnam war.\n  Some of the smart for-profit colleges figured out a loophole, though, \nand what they figured out is the law, when it was first adopted, didn't \nreally focus on the GI bill because it wasn't all that robust, and the \n90-10 rule--85-15 and 90-10--focused on things that did not include the \nGI bill. So when veterans go to college and the GI bill helped to pay \nfor their tuition, or for that of their spouses or their children, that \ndoes not count toward the 90 percent.\n  So as a result, what we have is a loophole that allows a college or \nuniversity, a private college or university, to realize as much as 100 \npercent of their revenues from the Federal Government--100 percent. \nThere is nothing\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\nabout market forces; 10 percent, 15 percent of your students have to \ncome by nonFederal means. All of them are there on the Federal \nGovernment's dole.\n  Among the people who pushed for the 85-15 rule, I think, were Bob \nDole and Phil Gramm, and they said a long time ago that we ought to \nhave something like the 90-10 rule. A couple of years before that, the \nguy that Senator Durbin will remember named William Bennet--remember \nhim, the Secretary of Education--here is what he called for-profit \ntrade schools. Here is what he called them in 1987. He said:\n\n       Diploma mills, designed to trick the poor and to take on \n     Federally-backed debt, milk them for their loan money and \n     then wash them out or graduate them, ill-prepared to enter \n     the job market and pay off their loans.\n\n  That is what he called them. As I said earlier, there are some for-\nprofits that do a good job, but there are a bunch that don't. That was \nthe case in 1987 and, unfortunately, it is the case today.\n  I just want to say we--you have, I have, Tom Harkin in past years--\nhave continuously drawn this to the attention of our colleagues and \nanybody who wants to listen this issue. This needs to be fixed. It \nneeds to be fixed.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for working so hard and letting me help him a \nlittle bit on this stuff. I think we are starting to break \nthrough. Some of the folks who are the worst actors in this business \nare starting to fold, and that is a good thing.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to thank Senator Carper.\n  Let me show the Senator briefly what has happened to the enrollment \nof for-profit colleges and universities as people have come to realize \nthey are wasting their time, and many times their GI bill benefits, \ndebt, and ending up with a diploma that doesn't take them anywhere.\n  Look at the University of Phoenix--this is the mother ship that \nlaunched this industry--peak enrollment was nearly 500,000 in 2010. Now \nit is 227,000, a nearly 50-percent loss.\n  ITT, which advertises constantly, had enrollment in 2010 of 88,000, \nand now they are down to 53,000. Career Education Corporation enrolled \n41,000 students in 2014 compared to 118,000 in 2010--a 65-percent \ndecrease. Education Management Corporation is down 25 percent. DeVry \nhas declined in enrollment. What is happening here?\n  I talked to some of the people from some of these for-profit \ncolleges. Parents and families are finally realizing that this is a \nwaste of time and money. It is time for taxpayers to realize the same \nthing. I overhear my colleagues--conservative colleagues--preaching to \nme about the miracle of free markets. We are talking about the most \nheavily subsidized industry in America, accounting for over 40 percent \nof the student loan defaults with 10 percent of the students enrolled.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for coming, and I yield to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Ms. Warren.\n  Ms. WARREN. I thank the Presiding Officer and thank Senator Durbin \nfor calling us together to discuss this important issue.\n  Our higher education system is broken. Right now a student borrows \nmoney to go to college, and the college gets paid in full regardless of \nwhether the college provides a decent education. In fact, Federal loan \nmoney is so easy to come by that a new business model of for-profit \ncolleges has sprung up, spending more money on advertising to attract \nstudents than actually teaching them anything.\n  Consider three numbers--10, 20, 40. Just over 10 percent of all \ncollege students attend a for-profit college. Yet they take in about 20 \npercent of all Federal student aid and they account for about 40 \npercent of all student loan defaults. Many for-profit colleges target \nyoung vets and single moms for programs that promise the Moon but end \nup delivering nothing more than heartache.\n  I have met with student veterans at terrific public colleges and \nuniversities across Massachusetts, such as UMass Lowell and Bunker Hill \nCommunity College. These schools are working hard to reach vets and to \nhelp them get a first-rate education through their Office of Veterans \nService and other resources. It is an exciting story, but time after \ntime the for-profit colleges got there first, so young vets show up \nalready tens of thousands of dollars in debt and without a single \ncredit that will transfer to a decent public college. This makes me \nsick. These for-profit schools are stealing more than money. They are \nstealing the hard work and dreams of some of our finest young people.\n  There are 347 colleges in the United States in which the majority of \nthe students have defaulted or failed to begin paying down their loans. \nOf these colleges, 85 percent are for-profit. Even with those huge \ndefault rates keep raking in the Federal loan dollars and paying out \nmillions of dollars in dividends to their shareholders. These 294 for-\nprofits are sucking down $2.2 billion in Federal assistance and leaving \nthe majority of their students unable to repay their loans.\n  The business model of for-profit colleges challenges the conventional \nwisdom that a college degree is always a smart investment. A recent \nstudy found that the average salary increase of for-profit graduates \nisn't even enough to cover the costs of attending a typical for-profit \ninstitution. The research is clear: attendance at a typical for-profit \ncollege is simply not worth the cost. It is a bad return on investment.\n  For-profit colleges know this, but too often the potential students \ndon't. Instead of taking the tough steps necessary to improve the value \nof the education they offer, most of these for-profit institutions have \nsimply ramped up their marketing operations--and some just flatout \nbreak the law--to keep the gravy train going. These colleges have \nengaged in fraud in order to swindle more and more students and suck \ndown more and more Federal funds.\n  Corinthian College is a prime example. At its peak, Corinthian was \nthe Nation's largest for-profit chain, with 120 campuses enrolling over \n100,000 students. It was massive. Corinthian built its business model \nto scoop up Federal financial aid by any means necessary--including \nfraud. Corinthian was trying to rope students in by using false and \nmisleading information and then saddling them with debt that would be \nimpossible to repay.\n  Federal policymakers had concerns about Corinthian's conduct for \nyears and had the tools to shut off the Federal loan supply, but \ninstead of acting, the Department of Education allowed Corinthian to \nkeep recruiting more and more students and sucking down more and more \nFederal funds. When Corinthian's dangerous mix of mismanagement and \ndeception finally blew up, the Department of Education even stepped in \nto bail out the college and keep it running a little while longer. Now \nCorinthian is bankrupt and its students are scrambling to start over.\n  Last week--due to a lawsuit brought by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau--a Federal judge ruled Corinthian broke Federal \nconsumer protection laws and ordered the company to pay $531 million \nfor its illegal behavior, but Corinthian is dead broke, and its \nexecutives are off the hook for the financial liability. Plus students \nand taxpayers are left holding the bag.\n  Corinthian got people to sign up for student loans by scamming them. \nIf an insurance salesman or a car dealer did that, the buyer wouldn't \nhave to pay. The law is just as clear here, when a school breaks the \nlaw, students are entitled to cancel their student loans. That is why \nthis week several of my Democratic colleagues are sending a letter to \nthe Department of Education telling them they have dragged their feet \nlong enough. These students don't owe the student loans that Corinthian \ntricked them into signing.\n  Schools like Corinthian make it clear that the Federal Government \nneeds to be more aggressive and more willing to cut off the money \nfaster when schools defraud students. When schools such as Corinthian \nbreak the law, their executives shouldn't be allowed to walk away from \nthe mess. They should pay real penalties.\n  This is about basic fairness. Neither students nor taxpayers should \nbe on the hook to a for-profit college that makes its money by cheating \nits students. It is time for the Federal Government to step up and do \nits job to hold for-profit colleges accountable and to ensure that \nhigher education remains a real pathway to success for all hard-working \nstudents.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor back to Senator Durbin.\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Warren, and before we recognize the \nSenator from Connecticut, I would like to make a point about executive \ncompensation, which is something we should not overlook.\n  We take a look at the actual amount of money that is being paid to \nexecutives of these for-profit colleges and universities. It is \ndramatically larger than what is being paid to presidents of public \nuniversities. I will put this information in the Record at a later \npoint.\n  The average pay for college presidents is less than $500,000 a year. \nThere is an executive at the University of Phoenix who was paid over $8 \nmillion in 1 year. When we wrote to the Department of Justice recently, \nwe asked how many of these people are going to be held personally \naccountable. They left the students holding the bag with student loans \nand worthless diplomas or dropouts. They left the taxpayers holding the \nbag because the students can't pay back their loans, and now they are \ngoing to go away scot-free after taking billions of Federal dollars? If \nthere is any justice, they need to be held accountable.\n  I yield to my colleague Senator Murphy.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I thank Senator Durbin very much.\n  This article is a few years old, but it underscores his point. Here \nis the opening line of an article from CNBC on this question of \nsalaries for the CEOs of for-profit universities. The article opens by \nsaying: ``Forget Wall Street and Silicon Valley. If you're looking to \nrake it in post-graduation, set your sights on the executive floor at \none of the nation's for-profit colleges.''\n  That is an article from CNBC detailing the fact that in their \narticle--again this is a few years old--the salary of the head of \nPhoenix University was $11 million, and the CEO of Bridgepoint, another \nnational for-profit university, was making over $20 million a year.\n  You can say to yourself: These are private, for-profit companies. Why \nshould Congress be in the business of caring what the CEO of Phoenix \nUniversity makes or what the CEO of Bridgepoint or ITT or DeVry makes?\n  Harry Truman made his name as a critic of wartime profiteering. LBJ \nmade his name as a young Member of Congress doing the same. Their idea \nwas that it is all well and good to make yourself rich in the most \ndynamic capitalist economy in the world, but it is another thing to be \ngetting rich off the taxpayers. It is another thing to be making your \nfortune almost exclusively coming from sources of money that really is \nall of our constituents' money in the form of the taxes they pay.\n  That is what we are talking about today. What we are talking about \nare executives who are getting rich off of companies that are 90 \npercent funded by the U.S. taxpayer because this 90-10 rule we talked \nabout is an important rule for these companies. They run their revenue \nright up to the limit. So for many of these for-profit universities, \ntheir revenue is 70, 80, 90 percent from the taxpayers of the United \nStates, and their CEOs are making $11 million, $12 million, sometimes \n$20 million a year.\n  Listen, I am all for people making a million dollars. I have a lot of \npeople in Connecticut who are making $20 million, but if we are being \ngood stewards of the taxpayers' dollars, we should be wary of those who \nare making their fortune off of the Federal dole. That is what is \nhappening today.\n  Senator Durbin, I just wanted to add in this conversation a note of \naccountability. That is one of the things that used to unite \nRepublicans and Democrats. Frankly, the Republicans, I admit, cared \nmore about accountability in Federal dollars than sometimes the \nDemocrats did. It was the Republicans in the second Bush administration \nwho started attaching strings to education dollars that were flowing \nout of Washington to make sure there was actually quality attached to \nthe money that was coming from U.S. Federal taxpayers, but that era \nseems to be over.\n  Unfortunately, we don't have a bipartisan consensus on \naccountability. We are about to approve a budget that a lot of \nRepublicans and a lot of Democrats will vote for that will send $140 \nbillion in higher education aid to universities all across this \ncountry. It will come with almost no strings attached. It will come \nwith almost no expectations that schools give a degree to kids that \nwill actually get them a job or attempt to keep them in school so they \ncan get some return on investment for the money we are all paying to \nthem.\n  Senator, you might have talked about it already today, but the \nnumbers of for-profit colleges that just came out today are absolutely \nstunning. I don't know if you talked about the ``Trends in Student \nAid'' report that just came out today from the College Board.\n  Here is an amazing statistic. What this survey says is that borrowers \nwho don't graduate from public and private nonprofit 4-year schools \ndefault at about the same rate as borrowers who do graduate from for-\nprofit schools. Think about that. You are just as likely to not be able \nto pay back your student loan if you get a degree from a for-profit \nschool as if you had dropped out of a not-for-profit school.\n  Here are the numbers: 14 percent of for-profit graduates default; 15 \npercent of not-for-profit 4-year college nongraduates default. That is \na really stunning number. Yet we are just sending money willy-nilly out \nto these schools that are not putting students in degrees. Why are they \nnot putting students in degrees? Because they are marketing themselves \nin a way that just does not square with the job market today.\n  As part of one of these attorney general lawsuits--there is a litany \nof stories about the abusive marketing techniques of these for-profit \nuniversities.\n  One of them said: I told the enrollment representative that I did not \nwant to sign the loan unless I was guaranteed a job because I knew that \nI would not be able to pay it back. She told me that the school placed \n99 percent of the students and they could guarantee a job after I \nfinished my externship. She told me that I would be making between $18 \nand $20 an hour after completing the program. No worries about the \nloan. She told me career services could place me in a job and that she \nmakes sure everybody who enrolls gets placed.\n  These are the claims that are being made. So it is frankly not \nsurprising, when you have these for-profit universities enrolling \nthousands of kids in video game design degrees, that you are just as \nlikely to default on a loan if you graduate from some of those \nworthless programs as if you don't graduate from a not-for-profit \nuniversity.\n  So last Congress, Senator Schatz and I, joined by Senator Murray and \nSenator Sanders, introduced a piece of legislation that would start to \nrequire some real outcomes from universities. We applied it to for-\nprofit and not-for-profit universities. We said: You have to show that \nyou are giving kids a chance to succeed and get a job, that you are \nkeeping your tuition at reasonable levels. If you do that, then you can \ncontinue to get title IV dollars.\n  But if they don't, we are not going to continue to send money to \nthese schools that simply are not producing graduates who are ready to \ncompete or that are deceptively drawing students in based on claims \nthat just do not wash out in the end.\n  So, yes, we have to shut down these fraudulent institutions like \nCorinthian. But we could just make a decision, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to put some additional accountability standards on title IV \ndollars, apply it to for-profit and not-for-profit schools, and say: If \nyou have a certain number of students who are defaulting, you are not \ngoing to continue to get title IV dollars. If you have a rate of \ntuition increase that is way above that of the national average, you \nare not going to continue to get title IV dollars.\n  We know by statistics that this would put a good number of for-\nprofits out of business. It might even touch a handful of the lower \nperforming not-for-profits. But it should be something on which both \nsides can come together, just some basic accountability for higher \neducation, a basic accountability for the $140 billion we send, because \nthis does not make sense. It does not make sense to pad the pockets of \nthese CEOs who are making $20 million a year off of our taxpayers when \nthey are not delivering results that are actually making our economy \nbetter.\n  Thank you, Senator Durbin, for bringing us together here. I hope that \nas we debate the Higher Education Reauthorization Act in front of the \nHELP\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nCommittee--I think Senator Alexander is very interested in some of \nthese debates. So we are going to add some accountability standards. We \nare talking about these for-profits, but if we really are being good \nstewards of the taxpayer dollars, we should expect some results.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Murphy for his comments.\n  I will tell you that it is interesting to me that when you take a \nlook at what Wall Street thinks about the for-profit colleges and \nuniversities, they are certainly bearish. You would think from what \nCongress is doing--sending billions of dollars to this industry and \npropping it up--we are bullish. Take a look at the stock prices of the \nmajor for-profit colleges and universities since 2010. The University \nof Phoenix went from a high of $57 a share down to $7.50. This was \nafter the Department of Defense suspended their activities under the GI \nbill. ITT Tech--a high of $92 a share in 2011 and they now trade at $3 \na share. Career Education was $20 a share in 2011 and was $3.80 \nyesterday. Education Management Corporation withdrew their stock from \nNASDAQ so they would not have to make reports to the Securities and \nExchange Commission. In 2014, they lost $684 million. This is an \nindustry which is failing as a business, but sadly it is dragging along \nstudents and families and taxpayers with it. That is why we have to \ncome to grips.\n  I endorse your idea. Apply the standards across higher education, to \nfor-profit and not-for-profit. I can tell you, these for-profits cannot \nlive with that standard. Thank you, Senator Murphy.\n  I thank Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut for joining me.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my great colleague from \nIllinois and my friend and partner from Connecticut for their very \npowerful analysis, along with Senator Warren and Senator Carper, \nbecause there really is a need for dispassionate, objective, and \ntargeted consideration of this area of education.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is absolutely right that we need \naccountability in both the for-profit and nonprofit areas. Senator \nDurbin has emphasized that fact repeatedly. I am here as a former \nmember of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee who \nparticipated with Senator Harkin in announcing a report more than 2 \nyears ago that highlighted many of the abuses in this area. Still, \nCorinthian has happened since then. There are still abuses in the for-\nprofit area. But there is a need for accountability in the nonprofit \narea as well.\n  In all of these areas, there is a need for facts. There are more \nfacts that may be available more recently that ought to be considered, \nindications that some of the for-profit colleges are doing a better job \nthan others. Kaplan, for example, has recently released facts. None of \nus can vouch for them independently. The Department of Education has an \nobligation to do better and more to make sure it keeps faith with \nAmerican students and American taxpayers in the way dollars are \nallocated to those for-profits.\n  I am particularly concerned, as the ranking member of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, with the impact of some of these abusive practices \non veterans. One of the really unacceptable facts about this industry \nis the way it can sometimes exploit and take advantage of our veterans. \nSenator Carper put it very well when he discussed how the for-profit \nschools are prohibited from receiving more than 90 percent of their \ntotal revenue from Federal student aid, but VA educational benefits are \nnot counted toward that 90 percent. This 90/10 loophole causes the for-\nprofits to target veterans and to rake in billions of dollars in VA \neducational benefits. In fiscal year 2014, the for-profit schools \nreceived over $2 billion in VA educational benefits--that is our money, \ntaxpayer funds--including post-9/11 GI benefits.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am \nworking to help protect our Nation's veterans and the GI bill benefits \nthey have earned. In fact, I have introduced legislation--the Career-\nReady Student Veterans Act--to ensure that GI bill funding is not \nsquandered on education programs that lack appropriate programmatic \naccreditation.\n  Facts are stubborn things, as Ronald Reagan famously said. Facts are \nwhat we need. Accreditation and verification and credibility in this \narea is essential rather than painting with a broad brush every for-\nprofit, rather than tarring all of them. Facts are necessary here, and \nthere is a need for accreditation and for facts that show credibility \nand legitimate course work.\n  I will be introducing another bill this week to provide relief to \nveteran students who have been harmed by for-profit schools. I want to \nrepeat that point. These veterans have been harmed directly and \ntragically by some of these practices. We owe them better. We need to \nkeep faith with them. That is the reason I am going to be introducing \nthe Veterans Education Relief and Reinstatement Act. That will give the \nVA Secretary authority to reinstate GI bill entitlements that a veteran \nhas used at a school that abruptly closed--think Corinthian--where \nveterans have lost those benefits and they need a remedy, not just a \nright but a remedy.\n  I am hopeful that we can advance these bills through the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee and stop for-profit colleges like Corinthian from \nscamming our Nation's veterans. Like my colleagues, I could cite real-\nlife instances of nonveterans as well. But the evidence is \noverwhelming, and it is acknowledged by some in the industry who say \nthere is a need for corrective measures here, and some of the outliers \nneed to be treated with the strong discipline and discouragement they \nmerit.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues in this effort. I am hopeful that \nthe report Senator Harkin and the HELP Committee produced years ago \nwill finally reach fruition and that action will be taken by the \nDepartment of Education and by this Senate to take measures that \nprotect taxpayer dollars, protect students of America, and protect our \nveterans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator \nBlumenthal, for joining in this colloquy this afternoon.\n  What we have tried to do with a number of Senators is to lay out the \ncase that when we go to higher education reauthorization, we owe the \ntaxpayers and we owe families across America the responsibility to look \nat this industry. What is happening here in inexcusable and \nunacceptable. It is unfair. Ten percent of the high school graduates, \n20 percent of the Federal aid education, 40 percent of all student loan \ndefaults.\n  Senator Murphy pointed to the statistics that came out today. You are \nin just as bad shape with a diploma from a for-profit school as if you \ndrop out of school at a not-for-profit school. That is a damning \nstatistic, just like the 40 percent in student loan defaults.\n  We cannot continue to look the other way. Wall Street is not looking \nthe other way; they are downgrading these for-profit colleges and \nuniversities because they believe this model is flawed. They don't \nbelieve it can be sustained. Why do we kid ourselves? Let's apply \nstandards across higher education--standards that are fair to students, \nfair to families, and fair to the schools--and say to them: This is \nwhat we expect as a minimum if you are going to offer higher education \nto the students across America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this transcript from Sharyl Attkisson's \ntelevision program ``Full Measure'' which played last Sunday be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Transcript\n\n\n                  sharyl attkisson's ``full measure''\n\n                    (Aired Sunday, November 1, 2015)\n\n       Washington (Sinclair Broadcast Group).--Some for-profit \n     colleges are allegedly preying on military troops; veterans \n     with benefits and a desire to build a new life become \n     targets.\n       They've even been given a name by some college recruiters: \n     cash cows.\n       About 300 thousand vets get up to $21K a year in G.I. Bill \n     money. In all, 1800 colleges--many of them for profits--have \n     received more than $20 billion G.I. Bill tax dollars.\n       With so many billions in the mix, it's easy to see why some \n     colleges use high pressure and allegedly dishonest tactics. \n     Now, taxpayers are about to be on the hook for alleged \n     misconduct by the schools.\n       As a U.S. Marine, Bryan Babcock fought on the front lines \n     in Iraq including the Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. His \n     post-military plan: police work. He used his GI Bill money to \n     pursue a criminal justice degree at the for-profit college \n     ITT Tech.\n       Attkisson: How did you hear about it?\n\n[[Page S7767]]\n\n       Babcock: I saw a commercial on TV. That kind of got me \n     interested in them.\n       Babcock says ITT promised that police agencies everywhere \n     would accept the degree. The cost--$70,000--would far exceed \n     his GI Bill grant at the time, but ITT made it easy for \n     Babcock to borrow. He says they even helped him fill out \n     paperwork for student loans. Then, after his third year, he \n     made a startling discovery.\n       Babcock: We applied to 22 or 23 police departments.\n       Attkisson: And what did they say?\n       Babcock: All of them said that they did not recognize ITT's \n     degrees or their credits.\n       Attkisson: And what thoughts went through your head when \n     you heard this?\n       Babcock: I was angry that I'd spent all this money in \n     student loans and it turns out that the degree, if I would \n     have finished there, would have been pretty much worthless.\n       It's a story told by thousands of vets who attended for-\n     profit colleges where students are more likely to drop out, \n     default on their loans, or graduate in dire debt without a \n     useful degree.\n       Of eight for-profits that get the most GI bill funds, seven \n     have been targets of inquiries for possible violations \n     including deceptive or misleading recruiting.\n       Together, they received nearly a billion ($939,086,610 \n     million) tax dollars over two school years.\n       One of those companies is DeVry University where Chris \n     Neiweem was hired as the school recruited vets under the new \n     GI Bill.\n       A veteran himself, Neiweem was assigned to ``Team Camo'' \n     where he says managers urged the sales team to use high-\n     pressure tactics on troops who sometimes weren't suited for \n     college.\n       ``Working in the industry at that time truly reminded me of \n     the film `Glengarry Glen Ross,' '' he said.\n       ``There is this scene where a corporate sales manager is \n     brought in to improve the performance of the sales floor--\n     played by Alec Baldwin.''\n       In the scene, Baldwin says to a salesman ``they're sitting \n     out there waiting to give you their money, are you gonna take \n     it?''\n       ``And that was similar at the company,'' said Neiweem.\n       If ``Team Camo'' dared to let veterans suspend class while \n     in combat like those in the National Guard Neiweem says \n     management called them on the carpet.\n       Neiweem: The company didn't care. They just wanted to make \n     sure that they stayed in their classes and so the university \n     could continue to be paid and they would continue to be on \n     the enrollments books.\n       Attkisson: Even if they were in a combat zone that didn't \n     make sense for them to try to go to college on the computer?\n       Neiweem: Yes. Management's guiding wisdom was, to be frank, \n     ``get their ass in class.''\n       Neiweem showed Full Measure today's sales tactics at work.\n       In a chat on DeVry's website, he asks about costs and \n     benefits--but can't get direct answers.\n       ``I can have a representative from our military admissions \n     team reach out to you,'' he said, reading the response of a \n     recruiter.\n       ``It's fairly frustrating that I asked these questions and \n     I can't get answers. Rather, they're trying to sort of tie me \n     in and get me closer so they can work towards selling the \n     school.''\n       DeVry officials declined an on camera interview but said \n     ``DeVry has a long history of serving veterans and military \n     personnel'' dating back to the 1940's. And ``['W]e offer \n     quality academics and student services with flexibility to \n     meet their busy schedules.''\n       Former Congressman Steve Gunderson leads the main national \n     for-profit college trade group called the Association of \n     Private Sector Colleges and Universities (APSCU).\n       ``If anybody has a bad outcome, and certainly if a veteran \n     has a bad outcome, that's a problem and we want to solve \n     that,'' he said.\n       He believes for-profits are under assault from opponents \n     and competitors.\n       Gunderson: I have never before seen a situation where a \n     sector is the target of attacks for ideological reasons. I \n     mean, there simply are good people who do not believe the \n     private sector oughta be involved in the design and delivery \n     of education.\n       Attkisson: Fair enough, but is there any doubt in your mind \n     that some schools have used unfair, unethical, or even \n     dishonest tactics?\n       Gunderson: There is no doubt in my mind that there are bad \n     schools in every sector of higher education who have engaged \n     in inappropriate conduct for various reasons whether it be \n     athletics or whether it be admissions or it be something \n     else.\n       Gunderson said the industry is improving.\n       A Government Accountability Office report found for-profits \n     catering to military students actually beat public schools in \n     one area: higher graduation rates.\n       With billions flowing to for-profits under investigation, \n     President Obama dispatched a warning at Ft. Stewart army base \n     about any for profits that may be preying on the troops.\n       ``It's not right. They're trying to swindle and hoodwink \n     you. They don't care about you; they care about the cash,'' \n     he said.\n       But as federal scrutiny surged, the industry has countered \n     with Washington lobbyists and campaign cash.\n       Since 2010, for-profit colleges have poured nearly $10 \n     million ($9,906,512) into campaign contributions and spent \n     $41 ($41,924,452) million on lobbying, according to the \n     Center for Responsive Politics.\n       Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois): That's how you really win \n     friends and influence people on Capitol Hill. The for-profit \n     colleges and universities have friends in high places.\n       Attkisson: That implies some members in Congress, you \n     think, are bought and paid for on this issue.\n       Sen. Durbin: I would say this--they are influenced by it.\n       Senator Durbin has pushed one bill after another to fight \n     for-profit college fraud, only to see the bills get watered \n     down and voted down.\n       ``If these schools that are enticing kids into loans for \n     educations that are worthless had some `skin in the game,' \n     some responsibility for default, they'd think twice about it. \n     But they don't. They could care less,'' he said.\n       It turns out taxpayers have the most skin in the game.\n       In June, the federal government said it will forgive loans \n     for students at Corinthian College, putting taxpayers on the \n     hook for up to $3.5 billion. Corinthian shut down in May amid \n     fraud accusations, which the company denied. And the feds may \n     wipe out loans at other problematic colleges.\n       In May, the federal government charged Babcock's alma \n     mater, ITT Tech, with fraud, alleging it concealed financial \n     information from investors.\n       ITT is fighting the charges, but declined our interview \n     request.\n       Gunderson says he doubts Babcock's ITT degree would have \n     really been useless.\n       ``I am willing to say, that if he graduated, from an \n     accredited criminal justice program, there are many police \n     agencies that would hire him. Maybe not the one he wanted to \n     go to, but there are many that will, and evidence all across \n     the country shows that,'' said Gunderson.\n       Babcock gave up on the ITT degree and his dream of police \n     work. Instead, he's focused on warning other vets, and \n     working to pay down his $40 thousand student loan debt.\n       ``I think it's a shame that they prey on men and women that \n     volunteered to protect this country. And that earned a \n     benefit with their service, and then ITT and the other for-\n     profit schools are just trying to take that,'' he said.\n       The Defense Department recently banned the University of \n     Phoenix from recruiting on military bases, alleging a pattern \n     of violating policies designed to protect military students. \n     Senator Durbin says ITT is now facing investigations by the \n     Justice Department and 18 Attorneys General.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON.

Mr. President, today I wish to speak about our vote on \nthe waters of the United States and the Environmental Protection \nAgency.\n  I noted that the White House has lately been advocating for criminal \njustice reform. They say an underlying problem with the justice system \ntoday is that Congress criminalized too much conduct too severely. But \nit is the same White House that is behind the new waters of the United \nStates regulation--an Executive power grab that would effectively put \nevery landowner in Arkansas and in America at risk of Federal criminal \ncharges for making adjustments to land on their own private property.\n  The waters of the United States regulation gives the government \njurisdiction--and, in turn, the danger of Federal criminal charges--\nover tributaries, adjacent waters, and ``other waters.'' This includes \nstreams that only exist after heavy rains or, as some of us call them, \nmud puddles.\n  If a landowner in Arkansas has so much as a ditch on his or her \nproperty, he or she could be liable for Federal criminal charges for \ndisturbing that ditch in any way. If a homeowner wants to add an \naddition to his garage and this addition even touches ``land that fills \nwith water after rain,'' also known as just ``land,'' this homeowner \ncould be liable for Federal criminal charges.\n  President Obama and my Democratic colleagues argue that we are \nexaggerating: Come on, they say; the Environmental Protection Agency \nwould never bring charges against a homeowner for expanding his garage \nor trying to regulate a mud puddle.\n  They insist on the benevolence of the EPA and ask us to trust them to \nexercise good judgment and reasonable discretion. Before we trust the \nEPA's benevolence, though, it is prudent to examine the EPA's own track \nrecord.\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\n  Let's consider that in August of this year, the EPA directed \ncontractors to excavate the Gold King Mine in Colorado without first \ntesting the water pressure or calculating water volume. In the worst \nenvironmental disaster in recent years, the EPA caused more than 3 \nmillion tons of toxic wastewater to pollute the Animas River.\n  Since the spill, much of the toxicity remains, endangering farmers, \nlandowners, Native Americans, and anyone who relies on this river. \nAfter the spill, the EPA has refused to turn over documents, \ndisciplined no one, failed to show up to congressional hearings, \nrefused to take responsibility, and still won't answer the simple \nquestion of whether the Agency will pay for the damages it caused.\n  The Navajo Nation in New Mexico relies on the river polluted by the \nEPA for drinking water and for farming. In the days following the \nspill, the Navajo lost their water supply. The EPA offered to deliver \nclean water that the Navajo could use for drinking and crop irrigation \nbut, instead, they used dirty oil tankers to deliver contaminated \nwater.\n  The EPA is not only a threat to citizens, to landowners, and to \nbusinesses, but it is also a threat to the environment they purport to \nprotect. Since the disaster, the EPA has continued to spill toxic \nwastewater into creeks and rivers. There has been zero accountability \nfor this Agency.\n  Based on that track record, I don't think we should be giving the EPA \nany more power. That is why I joined my colleagues earlier today to \nvote to roll back the waters of the United States regulation before the \nEPA criminalizes nearly every landowner in the United States.\n  But we should also consider the bigger picture. This regulation is a \nsymptom, not the problem. The problem is the EPA itself--its overreach \nand lack of accountability.\n  That is why we must pass the EPA Accountability Act. This legislation \nwould require the EPA to pay--out of its own budget--for the damages it \nrecklessly caused when spilling 3 million gallons of toxic waste into \nthe Animas River. Unless the EPA faces consequences for its actions \nagainst the American people, nothing will change. It is our \nconstitutional responsibility to provide oversight of an agency that \nhas caused massive damage to both the American people and to the \nenvironment.\n  We must protect Arkansans and Americans from EPA overreach and lack \nof accountability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, what is our parliamentary posture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the motion to proceed to H.R. \n2685.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 5 \nminutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          ``El Faro'' Tragedy\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, on the morning of October 1, the El Faro \ncargo ship--a container ship almost 900-feet long--was carrying 33 men \nand women, and on that fateful day it sent its final communication, \nreporting that the engines were disabled. This left the ship drifting \nwith no power, with an oncoming category 3 hurricane. Despite search-\nand-rescue attempts by the Coast Guard, the El Faro and her crew were \nnot heard from again.\n  One month later, the National Transportation Safety Board, working \nwith the U.S. Navy, has found the sunken El Faro at the bottom of the \nocean in waters that are 15,000 feet deep. At nearly the same time, the \nship's owner, TOTE Maritime, began its attempt to limit the company's \nliability for this tragedy.\n  News reports have indicated that the company filed a complaint last \nweek stating that the company did everything in its power to make the \nship safe and that the company ought to be exonerated from any and all \nclaims for all damages.\n  Well, this is clearly hasty decisionmaking. It clearly is a matter of \nconcern to me because most of these mariners were from my State of \nFlorida. Their families are grieving and hoping for any answers as to \nwhat happened to their loved ones.\n  Well, right now, we don't have all of those answers. The NTSB only \njust found the ship with the help of the U.S. Navy, and yet somehow the \ncompany is able to definitely declare that they weren't at fault and \nthat they bear no responsibility for the loss. It seems that this is an \nattempt to limit any liability of the company.\n  So this is a time when we need reflection for figuring out what \nhappened to the El Faro, for finding the ship's recorder, which the \nU.S. Navy is now in the process of trying to find, and then once you \nhave that black box, for piecing together the ship's last minutes \nbefore the ship sank.\n  So instead of being split apart, it is a time to come together as a \ncommunity and to support those who have been so tragically impacted.\n  I have some leadership responsibility on the commerce committee, \nwhich has jurisdiction over maritime matters. It is my intention to see \nthat there is a thorough and honest investigation to try to find \nanswers for the families and to find answers so that we can prevent a \ntragedy such as this from happening again. That is where we should be \nfocused.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is hard to think of a time in recent \nmemory when the number of threats facing our country were more diverse \nor more threatening than they are now--from ISIL to Russia, from China \nto the Taliban, from Iran to Al Qaeda. These threats are real, these \nthreats are worrying, and these threats make the political games that \nDemocrats continue to play with our men and women in uniform all the \nmore hard to understand.\n  Democrats have spent months upon months blocking funding for our \ntroops. They have tried to hide behind a whirling kaleidoscope of \nexcuses, moving from one to another as each is debunked, but with the \nsetting of a top-line budget number last week, the final excuse is \ngone. What is the excuse now?\n  It is time for the appropriations process to finally be allowed to \nmove forward. That means it is time for the men and women who put \neverything on the line for us to finally receive the support they need \nto be safe. It is time for our troops to finally get the certainty they \nneed to plan for training and operations.\n  The Defense appropriations bill is half of all discretionary \nspending. The Defense appropriations bill contains no controversial \npolicy riders--none. The Defense appropriations bill was supported in \ncommittee 27 to 3. Nearly every Democrat voted for it. Democrats even \nsent out press releases praising the bill. It is obvious why we should \npass it now.\n  President Obama's own Secretary of Defense just wrote an op-ed titled \n``U.S. Military Needs Budget Certainty in Uncertain Times'' in which he \nimplored Congress to authorize long-term funding for the military.\n  He said:\n\n       In this uncertain security environment, the U.S. military \n     needs to be agile and dynamic. What it has now is a \n     straitjacket. At the Defense Department, we are forced to \n     make hasty reductions when choices should be considered \n     carefully and strategically.\n\n  He concluded with this:\n\n       I appeal to Congress to act on a long-term budget deal that \n     will let American troops and their families know we have the \n     commitment and resources to see them succeed, and send a \n     global message that the United States will continue to plan \n     and build for the finest fighting force the world has ever \n     known.\n\n  So look, our colleagues across the aisle are just completely out of \nexcuses. It is time to move the bill forward. Once we do, we have every \nintention of then moving on to other appropriations bills as well.\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n  Remember, our Members worked very hard on these bills. Nearly all of \nthe appropriations measures passed committee with support from both \nparties. We obviously want to process all of them.\n  If Democrats hadn't wasted literally months blocking every last one \nas part of some political game, we could have passed all 12 \nappropriations bills a long time ago, but since they did, it has forced \nCongress up against a December 11 deadline of the Democrats' own \ncreation. We are going to work within that deadline to get as much done \nas we possibly can. With bipartisan cooperation, we can get a lot more \naccomplished. With more political games, we can get a lot less done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7769-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I was pleased to vote today in support of \nS.J. Res. 22, which would nullify the Environmental Protection Agency's \nrecently finalized clean water rule. Just yesterday, I voted in support \nof a bipartisan bill, S. 1140, authored by my colleague, Senator John \nBarrasso, which would have forced EPA to pull the rule. Unfortunately, \nthat bill did not receive the 60 votes necessary under Senate rules \nthat are needed to pass.\n  The resolution passed by the Senate today is supported by hundreds of \nnational and local organizations, including the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Homebuilders \nAssociation, to name a few. While I understand that the White House has \nthreatened to veto this resolution if it reaches the President's desk, \nit is still important that a majority of Congress voice their \nopposition to the EPA rule as Federal courts continue to weigh its \nlegality.\n  Americans around the Nation are lining up against the EPA clean water \nrule because of its economic cost, the regulatory impact, and the \nuncertainty it engenders among State and local governments, businesses, \nand consumer alike. The rule itself bypassed Congress by redefining the \ntypes of water bodies under the Clean Water Act that EPA has the \nauthority to regulate. EPA pushed forward without regard for State and \nlocal environmental protection laws, which is partly why about a dozen \nState attorneys general, including from my home State of Arizona, have \nwon injunctions in Federal court against the EPA rule.\n  The EPA claims that the rule only allows the Agency to halt \nactivities that disturb small, environmentally sensitive streams and \nwetlands. But when you dive into the rule's lengthy publication, you \nwill find that EPA is proposing to expand its jurisdiction over roughly \n60 percent of all waters of the United States and can also capture \ncertain irrigation ditches, stock ponds, and even dry desert washes. \nFarmers, housing, construction jobs, and other activities will all \nsuddenly find themselves under the thumb of EPA bureaucrats. The EPA \nwill claim it has written waivers into the rule for these industries, \nbut there is growing consensus that the waivers are so unclear and \nconflicting that nobody believes they hold any water. The EPA's \nrulemaking process itself was so closed off from outside input and \npeer-reviewed science that it is clear to any reasonable observer that \nEPA had misjudged the economic damage their rule will inflict on small \nbusiness, farms, and local governments around the country.\n  The EPA rule is especially bad news for Arizona agriculture and \nhomebuilding sectors which, combined, account for most of all economic \nactivity in my State. If a farmer wants to build or repair a canal, the \nEPA rule could block it. A community that wants to build a school or a \nchurch near a dry wash will have to beg EPA for a permit. Under the \nrule, the EPA can even fine a private property owners tens of thousands \nof dollars if the Agency thinks water historically flowed across their \nland even when there is no visible evidence.\n  Regardless whether or not the President vetoes this resolution, I \nwill continue to oppose the EPA clean water rule. I am a proud \ncosponsor of Senator Jeff Flake's similar bill, S. 1179, the Defending \nRivers from Overreaching Policies Act, DROP Act, which would direct the \nEPA to pull its rule over its poor, nonscientific definition of \n``navigable'' water bodies. We will continue to push forward with this \nand other legislative initiatives and will watch closely to see how the \ncourts handle the EPA rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7769-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBERT PARK\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and congratulate \nMr. Robert Park, director of the Portage County Veterans Service \nCommission, on his retirement after more than two decades of service to \nOhio veterans.\n  Mr. Park served 26 years in the naval service, retiring in 1997 as a \nchief aviation electronics technician, Aircrew. He flew more than 2,000 \nhours in a P-3 Orion aircraft, predominately as a radio operator with \nCombat Aircrew 6 in Patrol Squadron 93, where he was selected as ``Gold \nWing Sailor of the Year.''\n  During his time with the Portage County Veterans Service Commission, \nVSC, Mr. Park worked directly with staff to help maintain a high-\nquality standard of service to veterans. Mr. Park advocated to \nsignificantly increase VA benefits for Portage County veterans. \nAccording to the Ohio Department of Veterans Services, for every dollar \nPortage County spends related to the VSC, veterans in Portage County \nreceive $93.20 in benefits thanks to the work of Mr. Park.\n  Mr. Park's dedication to veterans and military families in Portage \nCounty extends beyond his position at the Portage County VSC. Mr. Park \nalso served as a board member for the Family and Community Services \nFreedom House, which is an organization that serves homeless veterans. \nMr. Park is also a member of many veterans organizations, including the \nlocal Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, and Disabled American \nVeterans chapters.\n  Mr. Park also served statewide as second vice, first vice, and \nfinally as president of the Ohio State Association of County Veterans \nService Officers. He also worked for many years as an instructor for \nthe Ohio Department of Veterans Services.\n  Nationally, Mr. Park advocated for veterans as an executive board \nmember, judge advocate, and instructor on the National Association of \nCounty Veterans Service Officers.\n  Beyond his dedication to veterans, Mr. Park continues to support his \ncommunity through involvement in organizations that help develop young \npeople as future leaders. Mr. Park currently serves on the board of \nAccess to Independence and the Rootstown Local School District. He also \nvolunteers as an assistant coach for both baseball and soccer, as well \nas Cub Master and Scout Master for local Cub and Scout Troops.\n  Mr. Park and his wife, Rebecca, have three children: David, Jonathan, \nand Rachel.\n  Bob will be truly missed not only by his VSC family, but by the \nveteran community in Portage County and throughout the State of Ohio. \nBob always gave his best to the veterans and families he served. I \nwould like to thank Mr. Park for all his years of service, as a sailor \nand later as an advocate for veterans. I wish him all the best in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7769-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2232.

A bill to prohibit drilling in the outer Continental Shelf, \nto prohibit coal leases on Federal land, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the damage global \nwarming is doing to our beautiful blue-green planet and talk about a \nspecific bill, the keep it in the ground bill, that can be part of the \nway we successfully address global warming. There is no doubt our \nplanet is getting hot: 2014 was the hottest year ever recorded, and \n2015 is on course to be yet hotter and set a new record.\n  In fact, the top 10 hottest years have all occurred since 1998. We \nsee the evidence of warming everywhere. The Earth is crying out. \nMaine's lobsters are moving North, Pacific oysters are struggling to \nform shells in a more acidic Pacific Ocean, glaciers are disappearing \nfrom Glacier Park, moose are dying in Minnesota and New Hampshire \nbecause winters are too warm to kill the ticks that prey on the moose, \nand they are also too warm to kill the pine beetles that kill our \ntrees.\n  Wildfires are raging in the West, towns in Florida are flooding at \nnormal high tide, droughts are killing crops, and the most powerful \nstorms are doing major damage to communities across our Nation. \nEverywhere the impacts of global warming are substantial. They are \ndamaging. Our planet is in danger. So we need to act to keep our planet \nfrom being destroyed. It is time for our Federal Government to show \nsome real leadership on this. Specifically, we need to accelerate the \ntransition from a fossil fuel energy economy to a clean energy economy. \nAll the damage I was citing, damage to our forestry, damage to our \nfarms, damage to our fisheries, all of this is caused by a less-than-1-\ndegree-Celsius change. The current estimate is about 0.9 Celsius \ndegrees.\n  Scientists have said the maximum the planet can tolerate without \ncatastrophic damage is 2 degrees Celsius or about 3.6 degrees \nFarenheit. So we have almost used up half of that global warming \nquotient. How much more damage will we see if we get to 2 degrees? The \nanswer is, a whole lot more. Scientists say it will be catastrophic for \nour ecosystems, it will be catastrophic for human civilization.\n  The simple fact is that carbon dioxide is serving as a blanket on our \nplanet making it warmer. The simple fact is that the major culprit for \ncarbon dioxide is the burning of fossil fuels. To limit our planet's \nwarming to 2 degrees Celsius, we must leave, as human civilization of \nthis planet, 80 percent of the identified proven fossil fuel reserves \nin the ground--not to extract it, not to burn it.\n  Part of the answer to this challenge is beneath our feet. We, the \nU.S. citizens, own fossil fuel reserves that constitute a substantial \npercentage of the proven reserves on the planet. Various estimates are \n6 to 10 percent. If we must keep it in the ground; that is, keep our \nfossil fuels--80 percent of them--in the ground, then isn't it \ncounterproductive to do new leases, leases that will extend production \nnot 10 or 15 years but 20 or 30 years on gas and 40 or 50 years on \ncoal, into the future? We lock in extraction and burning of fossil \nfuels far into the future, when our planet cannot bear the burden of \nthe carbon dioxide from burning that far into the future.\n  Shouldn't our public reserve, that citizen-owned reserve, be managed \nfor the public benefit and not for private profit? It is said that if \nyou find yourself in a hole, quit digging. This is one place where \nliterally we must quit digging. That is why today I have introduced, \nwith a number of my colleagues, the keep it in the ground bill. A big \nthank-you to my cosponsors: Patrick Leahy, Kirsten Gillibrand, \nElizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Ben Cardin, and Barbara Boxer. That \ngroup of Senators are standing up and saying we must be responsible \nstewards of our ecosystem and particularly we must stop this global \nwarming that is doing so much harm to rural America.\n  The bill does three things: It stops new leases and ends nonproducing \nleases for coal, oil, gas, oil shale, and tar sands on all Federal \nlands. It stops new leases and ends nonproducing leases for offshore \ndrilling in the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. It prohibits offshore \ndrilling in the Arctic and in the Atlantic.\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\n  This effort is a crucial component of good stewardship of our \nplanet--really saving our planet. Our First Nations talk about thinking \nabout the seventh generation. In a single generation, we have seen \nsubstantial impacts occurring right in our local communities. Every \nState can cite the impact. None of us is expecting that there is going \nto be quick action on Capitol Hill. It is grassroots organizing that \ncame together and said we should not turn on the tap to the tar sands \nin Canada because it is the dirtiest oil on the planet. It is \ngrassroots organizing that has come together and said that drilling in \nthe Arctic is the height of irresponsibility. It is going to be \ngrassroots efforts across this Nation that come together and say to us \nin the Halls of the Senate and the Halls of the House: Please act. \nPlease exercise your responsibility as stewards of our planet. Please \nstop this egregious attack on rural America, on our forests, our \nfarming, and our fishing--because on Capitol Hill, the voice heard \nright now is not the voice of common sense, it is not the voice of \nstewardship; it is the voice of those who own the oil and the coal who \nhave invested massive amounts in the elections in the House and the \nelections in the Senate.\n  They have come up here and said they plan to invest nearly $1 billion \nin the 2016 election. The Citizens United court case has opened the \ndoor wide open to this corruption of common sense, this corruption of \nstewardship, this corruption of the democratic process. So it is going \nto be grossroots that make a difference, to rally, to keep it in the \nground. This message is one that should be debated in every \ncongressional campaign. It should be debated in every Senate campaign. \nIt should be debated in the Presidency. It should be debated in \nDecember in Paris when nations comes together. It should be debated in \nother nations that have public assets, as they ask how are they going \nto be good public stewards, because we need the international community \nworking together.\n  Yes, we can work on the demand side--fuel efficiency and better \ninsulated buildings--but we need to work on the supply side of keeping \nfossil fuels in the ground as well. We need to attack this problem from \nevery direction. In doing so, as we transition from a fossil fuel \neconomy to a clean energy economy, we are going to create millions of \ngood-paying jobs. In doing so, we need to make sure that in that \ntransition we don't leave our workers behind.\n  Those working in the fossil fuel industry have spent their lives \nproviding the energy that has fueled tremendous growth in our economy, \noften at the expense of their personal family health and their families \nwell-being. So this must not be a green-versus-blue transition from \nfossil fuels to clean energy, but it has to be green and blue together, \nside by side fighting for the environment and fighting for our workers. \nWe will not leave our workers behind.\n  It has been said that we are the first generation who feels the \nimpact of global warming, and we are the last generation who can do \nsomething about it. So the choice is simple. Let us take on the climate \nchallenge as policymakers and stewards. Let us take on the climate \nchallenge fighting for rural America because of the terrible impact \nwarming is having on our forests, our fishing, and our farms.\n  Let us make our Federal lands off limits. Let us do the smart thing. \nIn terms of those Federal citizen-owned reserves of fossil fuels, let \nus keep it in the ground.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/04/senate-section/article/S7773-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 305--COMMENDING AND CONGRATULATING THE KANSAS CITY \n               ROYALS ON THEIR 2015 WORLD SERIES VICTORY\n\n  Mr. BLUNT (for himself, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Moran) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
