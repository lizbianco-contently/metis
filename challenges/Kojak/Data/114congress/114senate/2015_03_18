Mr. President, it is hard to believe what we saw \nyesterday. Democrats actually filibustered a bill to help victims of \nmodern slavery apparently because leftwing lobbyists told them to. Yes, \ntheir historic mistake is callous and extreme, but more than that it is \ntragic.\n  I mentioned the story of Melissa yesterday. Melissa was sold into \nsexual slavery before she had even become a teenager. She still bears \nthe scars of her years of torment, the beatings, the shackling, the \nemotional cruelty. When Melissa finally escaped, she wasn't embraced as \na victim, she was branded as a criminal.\n  Melissa's story is heartbreaking, but it is anything but unique. \nStories such as hers remind us how important the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act is. It is stories such as hers that remind us that no \nexcuse about not reading a bill and no command from leftwing lobbyists \ncould justify filibustering the critical help this human rights bill \nwould provide.\n  So we have not given up on the thousands of victims in this country \nwho suffer as Melissa did--shaken and shackled but still hanging on to \nhope. Democrats owe these victims, not lobbyists, help--help the Senate \nis so close to passing.\n  A strong majority of the Senate, including several Democrats, have \nalready voted in favor of this human rights bill. Now all it takes is a \nfew more Democrats of courage to ignore the lobbyists and do what is \nright. All that will mean is the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee \nsupporting the very same bill they voted for just a few weeks earlier.\n  Apparently, all of these Senators were for this human rights bill \nbefore they were against it, and it is not like the bipartisan \nprovision now suddenly in question is anything new. As the \nCongressional Research Service notes, bipartisan provisions such as \nthis one ``have been enacted in a variety of contexts since 1970,'' \nappearing in authorizing legislation as diverse as the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, the Legal Services Corporation Act, the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act, the Foreign Assistance Act, \nand others--language that is quite common and has been voted for \nnumerous times by our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  That is why the distinguished Democratic leader, my friend, had been \nsuch a strong supporter of the bipartisan Hyde provision for so many \nyears and why he said during his tenure as majority leader: ``My belief \nin the sanctity of life is why I have repeatedly voted against using \ntaxpayer money for abortions.'' That was my friend, the Democratic \nleader. That is the declared view of my friend. It is what he said just \na few short years ago before he and his party voted to filibuster a \nbill that would help the victims of modern slavery.\n  So this afternoon we invite Democrats to ignore the lobbyists and do \nthe right thing. We invite every Democrat to help us write a happy \nending to this story, where the forces of hope and humanity, not \npowerful lobbyists, prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1591-6", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1591-S1592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SENATE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on another matter, several weeks ago \nthe White House released an unserious budget that would have raised \ntaxes by nearly $2 trillion and increase the national debt by more than \n$7 trillion. In other words, it was more of the same old tired, failed \npolicies of the past. Hardly anyone took that budget seriously mostly \nbecause it was not meant to be taken seriously.\n  Contrast that with the balanced budget the Senate will introduce this \nmorning. It is a budget that controls spending, reduces the deficit, \nand improves programs such as Medicaid. It is a budget that will \nsupport economic growth and more opportunity for hard-working families \nwhile protecting our most vulnerable citizens. It is a budget\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\nthat will allow us to repeal and replace a program that hurts the \nmiddle class, ObamaCare. It will allow us to repeal and replace a \nprogram that hurts the middle class, ObamaCare.\n  I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Enzi, for his \ngood work on this sensible budget.\n  We have heard some talk of shrinking deficits these days. Of course, \nRepublicans are proud to take credit for helping force some fiscal \nresponsibility on the Obama administration, but we know these deficits \nwill soon shoot up dramatically if Washington does not start making \nmore commonsense choices.\n  The reality is our country still has many tough fiscal challenges to \nconfront. These are not challenges that can just be taxed away. These \nare not challenges that can be denied away either. But by working \ntogether these are challenges we can overcome, and the way we can \novercome them is with sensible ideas to get spending under control and \nmake government more efficient, more effective, and more accountable, \njust as the Senate's budget proposes to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1592-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRADE PROMOTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have one final matter. For all the \nissues that may divide Democrats and Republicans these days, there is \none thing many of us can agree on--trade is good for America. There is \nbipartisan agreement that trade is good for American wages with export-\nrelated manufacturing jobs paying nearly 20 percent more than other \nkinds of jobs, and there is bipartisan agreement that trade is good for \nAmerican jobs overall.\n  According to one study, trade supports nearly 40 million jobs \nnationally--about one out of every five jobs and more than one-half \nmillion jobs in my State of Kentucky alone. In fact, Kentucky's exports \nin goods and services have already increased dramatically since the \nenactment of trade agreements with countries such as Australia, from \nabout $10 billion a year to almost $30 billion a year. Trade is good \nfor Kentucky and trade is good for America, and that is why this is an \nissue where the White House and Congress are working together to \nsupport American jobs and wages.\n  While the United States has historically been a world leader in \nopening more markets to the products our country makes and grows, we \nhave fallen woefully behind in recent years.\n  Thankfully, emerging agreements with countries in Europe and the \nPacific present us with a real chance to catch up. These agreements \npresent us with the unique opportunity to export more of what we make \nover there so we can create more American jobs right here at home. But \nwe cannot make this important progress for America's middle class \nwithout passing the right kind of trade legislation in Congress first.\n  There is bipartisan agreement--at least in principle--to do exactly \nthat, but the details will obviously be important. We want to ensure we \nget those details of that legislation right so we can get the best \nagreements possible for the American people. We certainly don't want to \nbe considering legislation that would make these goals harder to \nachieve--undermining future economic and job growth.\n  The good news is our country has decades of experience with the kind \nof bipartisan trade promotion legislation that allows for the best \ndeals for American workers to be negotiated by America's trade \nrepresentatives and then approved by Congress. Several members of my \nconference will speak about that issue on the floor today. Like many of \nour Democratic friends, these Senators are interested in getting the \nbest deals possible for the American people--the kind of deals that \nwould only be possible with truly effective and bipartisan trade \nlegislation. So they will explain this important issue, and that is \njust what is needed. They will explain it in further detail.\n  Before I leave the floor, I wish to recognize the good work of the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for being an incredible advocate on \nthis issue, and allow me to also recognize the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee for working hard to try to get this right. We all \nlook forward to working with these Members, and all Members, on this \nvery important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1592-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, instead of being bogged down in another \nRepublican-contrived fight, I have proposed a path forward that is very \nsimple and very direct. While we work toward an agreement to pass \ntrafficking legislation--and there is work being done on that as we \nspeak--we should move to the Executive Calendar and consider the \nnomination of a very fine person, Loretta Lynch.\n  Democrats are fully committed to voting for Lynch's nomination and \nreturning immediately to the trafficking bill. The Senate can do two \nthings at the same time. We can certainly work on coming up with a path \nforward on trafficking and also do something to move forward and have a \nvote for a new Attorney General.\n  The chief law enforcement officer of this country--the man who is now \nthe Attorney General--said months ago he wants to leave. He has been \nwinding down. It is not right for this country not to have a fully \nengaged Attorney General.\n  I am disappointed that with all the work the Senate needs to \naccomplish, the majority leader is bound and determined to waste the \nrest of this week with the same votes we took yesterday. I was told we \nare going to have the same votes today that we had yesterday, and we \nwill have the same votes on Thursday that we are going to have today \nand that we had on Tuesday.\n  Albert Einstein, a genius, said the pure definition of insanity is \nsomebody who does the same thing over and over again and comes up with \nthe same result. It is insane to keep going forward on these votes that \neveryone knows are going to turn out the same way.\n\n  Loretta Lynch has waited 130 days. There is no reason to delay her \nconfirmation another minute. We can vote for her confirmation now and \nmove back to the trafficking bill right now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1592-5", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1592-S1593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE HOUSE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Gandhi said, ``Action expresses \npriorities.'' Action expresses priorities. Congressional Republicans' \nactions on the budget clearly demonstrate how little regard they have \nfor the American middle class. I want to get into a few examples. Their \nbudget proposal--the one the House is going to send to us soon--ends \nMedicare as we know it, replacing it with another voucher program. It \ntakes health care away from 16.4 million Americans now insured through \nthe Affordable Care Act. It guts Medicaid and undercuts millions of \nfamilies who rely on it to fund nursing homes and other care. It cuts \nbillions in education funding--billions--and it cuts job training and \nemployment services for 4 million American workers. The list goes on \nand on.\n  But we know one thing their budget does not do. It doesn't cut a \nsingle tax loophole for the superwealthy to reduce the deficit. Not \none. Instead, this budget is brimming with more tax breaks for the \nmegarich--many new tax breaks. In fact, the Republican budget would \ndrastically cut the tax bill for the average millionaire while raising \ntaxes on the middle class. That is not just irresponsible, it is \nimmoral.\n  Of course, lowering taxes for millionaires and billionaires will add \nto the\n\n[[Page S1593]]\n\ndeficit, not cut it. Republicans claim they are reducing the deficit, \nbut that is not true. In truth, they are using mirrors and a lot of \nsmoke in an effort to fool the American people.\n  House Republicans are really hiding the ball--moving the ball--\nclaiming massive savings without explaining how. They are, for lack of \na better description, cooking the books, using speculative and what \nthey call ``dynamic scoring.'' What is dynamic scoring? This is an \neffort to claim they are balancing the budget. Dynamic scoring says, \nhere is all this tax revenue and other money we are going to get and it \nwill help significantly. The fact is everyone knows there isn't any \ntruth to that. It is only some numbers on paper. They are relying on \ntransparent tricks to hide their refusal to protect our military from \nsequestration and budget cuts. Yet Republicans say of their own budget \nplan, we do not rely on gimmicks or creative accounting to balance our \nbudget.\n  The definition of ``gimmick'' is a concealed, devious aspect or \nfeature of something, as a plan or a deal--a concealed, devious aspect \nor feature.\n  Well, we have a perfect example of a gimmick in the Republican budget \nthat the House is working on and we are told they will complete. It \nsounds like a gimmick to me. At least one Republican from the House \nagrees with me. Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado said yesterday, ``It's \nall hooey.'' The budget is all hooey. But as Dana Milbank said in \ntoday's Washington Post, speaking of the House Republicans' plan: \n``True, the budget does not rely on gimmicks. The budget is a \ngimmick.'' That is a direct quote.\n  We don't need gimmicks. We need a responsible budget and this is not \na responsible budget. This is not responsible governance.\n  Unfortunately, though, this is the budget we have come to expect from \ntoday's Republican Party--a party that is so committed to supporting \nthe superwealthy that they are throwing America's middle class and the \nmilitary overboard.\n  Democrats are focused on the middle class. We want to create jobs, \ninvest in the future, and make sure that all Americans benefit from an \nimproving economy.\n  We are more than happy to work with our Republican colleagues in \norder to make our goals a reality. Unfortunately, helping the middle \nclass just doesn't seem to be a priority for congressional Republicans.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1593-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the Executive Calendar of the U.S. \nSenate. This Executive Calendar tells us the nominations that are \npending before the U.S. Senate where action is needed. There is one \nname to be found on this calendar on page 4--a name which has been \nsitting on this calendar longer than any nominee for Attorney General \nof the United States of America over the last 30 years. This name has \nbeen sitting on this calendar for 20 days, which doesn't seem like an \nextraordinarily long period of time. However, it turns out that the \nprevious nominees for Attorney General were moved so quickly on this \nSenate calendar that the last five combined, by Democratic and \nRepublican Presidents, took less time to be confirmed than this one \nname. What is that name? It is Loretta E. Lynch of New York to be \nAttorney General--a name that was submitted to the U.S. Senate by \nPresident Barack Obama to make history--a name, a nominee to make \nhistory. This is the first African-American woman in the history of the \nUnited States to be nominated to serve as Attorney General. It is a \ncivil rights milestone that her name has been submitted.\n  I sat through the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, and it was a \npacked room. All the TV cameras were there. Loretta Lynch came and sat \nat the table, with her father behind her, with her family around her, \nwith close friends gathered from all over the United States, and this \nwoman calmly, in a dignified way, gave the most compelling testimony I \nhave heard of any witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nincluding those who came before us seeking to be appointed to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. She was excellent. No one laid a glove on her. No one \nraised any concern about her nomination. And then, when the public \nwitnesses were invited to come in from both the Republican and \nDemocratic sides to comment on her nomination, Senator Patrick Leahy of \nVermont asked all of them gathered: Is there any one of you who opposes \nthe nomination of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General? Not one. Not \none.\n  Yet, here we are now, with this nomination pending longer than any \nAttorney General nomination in the last 30 years. Why? Why has the \nSenate Republican leadership decided to target this good woman and to \nstop her from serving as the first female African-American Attorney \nGeneral of the United States of America? There is no good reason. There \nis no substantive reason. She has been an extraordinary prosecutor in \nNew York. She has the support of so many outstanding organizations. The \nNational District Attorneys Association supports Loretta Lynch, as do \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, \nthe Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. The FBI Agents Association \nsupports Loretta Lynch, and a long list of Republican- and Democratic-\nappointed former U.S. Attorneys, including Patrick Fitzgerald from my \nState of Illinois, and former FBI Director Louis Freeh, appointed by a \nRepublican President, and Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson from \nthe George W. Bush administration. The list goes on and on.\n  The fact is there is no substantive reason to stop this nomination. \nThe Republican majority leader announced over the weekend that he was \ngoing to hold this nomination of Loretta Lynch until the bill which is \npending before the Senate passes, whenever that may be.\n  So Loretta Lynch, the first African-American woman nominated to be \nAttorney General, is asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes \nto the Senate calendar. That is unfair. It is unjust. It is beneath the \ndecorum and dignity of the U.S. Senate.\n  This woman deserves fairness. She seeks to lead the Department of \nJustice, and the U.S. Senate should be just in its treatment of her \nnomination. To think that we would jeopardize her opportunity to serve \nthis Nation and to make history is fundamentally unfair.\n  What is the issue? The issue is this important bill. It is a bill \nwhich relates to human trafficking. As chairman of the constitution \nsubcommittee, I have held hearings on this subject and it is \nheartbreaking to hear how primarily young women have been enslaved and \nexploited not just around the world but in the United States. I support \nthis legislation. I think we should move it forward. What is holding \nthis up is very simple: one sentence. Out of a 112-page bill, there is \n1 sentence on pages 50 and 51 that relates to the issue of abortion.\n  I needn't tell anyone following this debate how controversial and \ndivisive that issue can be and has been for so many decades in the \nUnited States. The fact is that issue has nothing to do with human \ntrafficking. It should be debated at another moment, another time, on \nanother bill. But, sadly, this 1 sentence in this 100-page bill is \nholding it up from being considered on the floor.\n  If the senior Senator from Texas, who is the lead sponsor on this \nbill, would come to the floor and simply remove this one sentence, this \nbill would pass. It would pass this afternoon, overwhelmingly. There is \nno question about it. He knows it. We have told him that. We have \noffered that to him, but he refuses.\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\n  So this good bill language is on the calendar, the Senate is mired in \ncontroversy, and Loretta Lynch sits on the calendar for another day.\n  It has been 130 days since President Obama announced the nomination \nof this woman to serve as our Attorney General. That is more than three \ntimes the period of time it took for us to confirm Attorney General \nAshcroft. It is more than 2\\1/2\\ times as long as it took to confirm \nAttorney General Mukasey and twice as long as it took to confirm \nAttorney General Holder.\n  It is time for us to give Loretta Lynch an opportunity to continue to \nserve America and to make civil rights history by allowing this \nAfrican-American woman to step forward and serve. It is time to stop \nholding her hostage to a political debate on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate that has nothing to do with her obvious qualifications to serve \nthis Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if there is one thing Americans have made \nclear, it is that they want their leaders to do something about the \neconomy. The recession may have officially ended almost 6 years ago, \nbut millions of Americans are still struggling economically and \nopportunities are still few and far between.\n  One big thing we can do to help the economy and expand opportunities \nfor American workers is pass trade promotion authority or what we refer \nto as TPA. Our prior trade agreements have been a boon to the economy, \nproviding American workers with jobs and American farmers, ranchers, \nand manufacturers with new markets for their goods. In my home State of \nSouth Dakota, 74 percent of exports go to countries with which the \nUnited States has a free-trade agreement. Between 2005 and 2014, South \nDakota saw a 110-percent increase in exports to free-trade agreement \ncountries. That has been a huge benefit to South Dakota farmers, \nranchers, and manufacturers.\n  Speaking of farmers and trade, today is National Agriculture Day. I \nwould just like to add as an aside that the substantial agriculture \ntrade surplus the United States currently enjoys is a tribute to the \nefficiency and the productivity of America's farmers and ranchers. I \nsalute American farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses that provide \nAmerica and the world with a safe and abundant food supply.\n  Passing trade promotion authority is one way we can ensure an even \ngreater global expansion of U.S. agricultural trade. Currently, the \nadministration is in the process of negotiating two new trade \nagreements that would open vast new markets for American products and \nput American goods on a level playing field internationally. The first \nof these agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, is being negotiated \nwith a number of Asia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New \nZealand, Singapore, and Vietnam. Currently, American goods face heavy \ntariffs in many of these countries--at times as high as 85 percent. \nTariffs of that size put American goods at incredible disadvantage \ncompared to their foreign competitors. Tariffs provide a powerful \ndisincentive for citizens in other nations to purchase American \nproducts. Removing this disincentive would increase foreign demand for \nU.S. products, which would mean more business for U.S. farmers, \nranchers, and manufacturers and more jobs and opportunities for \nAmerican workers.\n  Just to give an example of how important trade is to American \nagriculture, we currently export half of U.S. wheat, milled rice \nproduction, and soybean production; 70 percent of almond, walnut, and \npistachio production; more than 75 percent of cotton production; 40 \npercent of grapes; 20 percent of cherries; 20 percent of apples; 20 \npercent of poultry and pork production; and 10 percent of beef \nproduction.\n  If you think about it, there are approximately now 260 preferential \ntrade agreements worldwide. Only 20 of those involve the United States. \nEvery time we have entered into a new trade agreement where we have \nbeen able to eliminate tariffs and duties on a lot of our products, we \nsee an explosion in exports into those particular markets. That is why \nnegotiating the strongest possible transpacific trade agreement, as \nwell as the agreement the United States is negotiating with the \nEuropean Union, has to be a priority. For that, we have to have trade \npromotion authority.\n  Trade promotion authority has been the means by which nearly every \nU.S. free-trade agreement has been negotiated. The idea behind TPA is \nvery simple: Congress sets the negotiating priorities the \nadministration must follow and then requires the administration to \nconsult with Congress during the negotiating process. In return, \nCongress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the final agreement, \ninstead of a lengthy amendment process that could leave the final \nagreement looking nothing like the deal the administration negotiated.\n  The promise of that up-or-down vote on a final agreement is the key. \nThat is what gives our trading partners the confidence they need to put \ntheir best offers on the table, which allows for a successful \nconclusion of negotiations. Trade promotion authority demonstrates that \nCongress and the administration are on the same page when it comes to \nthe content of trade agreements and that the final agreement will be \neither accepted or rejected, not amended beyond recognition.\n  Trade promotion authority expired in 2007. Republicans have been \npushing for renewing it ever since. The President is also on board. He \ncalled for trade promotion authority in this year's State of the Union \nAddress.\n  This is an excellent chance, I would add, for Democrats and \nRepublicans to accomplish something significant for the American people \nand to show that Washington is working again.\n  Unfortunately, while the President and Republicans are united on this \nissue, many Senate Democrats continue to oppose trade promotion \nauthority legislation. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee is \ncurrently engaged in negotiations on a TPA bill with the committee's \nranking member, the senior Senator from Oregon. I am hopeful and I know \na lot of us on the committee and many of us in this Chamber are hopeful \nthat these efforts will yield legislation both Republicans and \nDemocrats can support.\n  Republicans are very open to suggestions and improvements. In fact, I \nexpect the final agreement will include many elements advocated by the \nsenior Senator from Oregon and other Senate Democrats, such as greater \ntransparency surrounding trade negotiations. However, the one thing \nRepublicans cannot support is an attempt to undermine the core of trade \npromotion authority--that guaranteed up-or-down vote that gives other \ncountries the confidence to put forward their best offers in trade \nnegotiations. Simply put, we cannot afford to weaken TPA.\n  I know the senior Senator from Utah, who is the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee--who is on the floor right now; and we will \nhear from him in just a few minutes--is working very hard to ensure \nthat we have a strong TPA agreement that we can bring to the floor of \nthe Senate, that we can pass through the Congress, and that we can put \non the President's desk so that we can enable these trade negotiations \nto continue in a way that will lead to a conclusion, to a result that \nis good for American manufacturers and service industries and American \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  If we fail to pass TPA, which will likely spell the failure of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership and the United States-European Union trade \nagreement, we will not be maintaining the status quo. Just because we \nare not negotiating agreements does not mean other countries will not \nbe. Other countries will secure favorable treatment of their goods, and \nAmerican goods will fall further and further behind. That is not \nsomething we can afford in this economy.\n  If we pass TPA, on the other hand, that will allow the transpacific \ntrade agreement and the United States-European Union trade agreement to \nmove forward, which means American producers will benefit from new \nmarkets\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nfor their goods and American workers will benefit from new jobs and \nopportunities. Since 2009, exports have accounted for more than 1 \nmillion new jobs here in the United States. If we pass the Trans-\nPacific Partnership and the United States-European Union trade \nagreements, we could be looking at more than 1 million more new jobs \nover the next few years.\n  It is time to pass TPA, to get these agreements concluded, and to let \nAmerican workers and businesses start experiencing the benefits. It has \nbeen far too long. Mr. President, 2007 is when the last TPA expired. We \nare losing ground by the day when we are not in the room and a part of \nnegotiating new trade agreements that are beneficial to American \nbusinesses, farmers, and ranchers.\n  I wish to point out one more time that there are approximately now \n260 preferential trade agreements worldwide, only 20 of which involve \nthe United States. So if we want to participate in a growing global \neconomy where 95 percent of the world's population lives, we have to \nbecome aggressive in creating the trading opportunities that will \nenable our businesses to prosper, to create good-paying jobs here in \nthe United States, to raise incomes for middle-income families in this \ncountry, and to give us as a country an opportunity to lead the world \nwhen it comes to an economy that benefits all people--not just those \nhere in the United States but all around the world. We have the \nwherewithal, the know-how, the technology, the creativity, and the \ninnovation in our economy to make that possible, to make it happen. \nThat is why these trade agreements are so essential.\n  These trade agreements, as I pointed out, do not happen unless we \nhave trade promotion authority in place to make sure they happen. If we \ndo not have it in place and these trade agreements do not get done, it \nis not that America--that we are just going to be standing still, we \nare going to be losing ground as countries around the world that are \naggressively trying to negotiate trade agreements and improve the \neconomies of their countries continue to do that, leaving us further \nand further behind.\n  So I hope we can get this passed through the Senate Finance \nCommittee, passed through the Senate, the House of Representatives, and \non the President's desk where it can be signed into law. The sooner \nthat happens, the better it will be for our economy, for jobs, for \nAmerican businesses, and for American farmers and ranchers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, and I \nappreciated the wonderful remarks of the senior Senator from South \nDakota, Mr. Thune. He is working very hard on that committee and really \nmaking a difference, as I think most people on the committee are trying \nto do. But he makes a difference, and I truly appreciated his remarks \ntoday.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor to talk about the \nimportance of Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA, to the health of our \nNation's economy. At the beginning of this Congress, I, along with many \nof my colleagues, stated publicly that trade was one of the few areas \nwhere the new Republican Congress would be able to find common ground \nwith President Obama. I still believe that is the case.\n  I chatted with him just last week--one of the few conversations I \nhave had with him since he has been President--and I was very \nappreciative. He would like to get this done, and he is right.\n  The Obama administration is currently negotiating some of the most \nambitious trade agreements in our Nation's history. The first is the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, an Asia-Pacific trade agreement \nbeing negotiated between the United States and 11 other countries. On \nthe other side of the world, the United States is negotiating a \nbilateral trade agreement with 28 countries of the European Union; that \nis called T-TIP.\n  Together, these two trade agreements have the potential to greatly \nexpand access to U.S. trade with other countries, allowing our job \ncreators to sell more American-made goods and services. They are in \ndemand. We just have to get in the game. This helps us create and \nsupport more high-paying export-related jobs at home. Of these two \nagreements, the TPP negotiations, or the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nnegotiations, are further advanced. According to administration \nofficials, the agreement could be concluded over the next few months. \nThat is good news.\n  Now, I wish talk about the bad news. Without renewal of effective TPA \nprocedures, the administration will simply not be able to conclude a \nstrong TPP agreement.\n  Why is TPA, or trade promotion authority, so important?\n  TPA is a compact between the Senate, the House, and the \nadministration. Under this compact, the administration agrees to pursue \nspecified objectives and consult with Congress as it negotiates trade \nagreements. Both the House and the Senate agree to allow for expedited \nconsideration of trade agreements without amendments. This is essential \nfor the conclusion and passage of strong trade agreements.\n  Put simply, without TPA, our trading partners will not put their best \noffers on the table because they will have no guarantees the agreement \nthey sign will be the same one Congress will vote on in the end. The \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota made that very clear. They \ndon't want to agree with our Trade Representative and then have \ncountless amendments in the House and the Senate that could change the \nwhole agreement they had agreed to. That is why trade promotion \nauthority became such an important part of our international relations.\n  As former Deputy USTR Miriam Sapiro said in a recent speech:\n\n       Neither our Asian nor our European partners want to get \n     into the real give-and-take that's necessary to reach a final \n     agreement until they are sure that the president has the \n     authority that he needs to conclude the deal. Absent that, \n     they are content to wait.\n\n  In other words, if we want good trade agreements, we must have strong \nTPA procedures in place, and we need to be clear on one other point: \nThe specifics of those procedures matter. They matter a great deal. \nThis is bipartisanship at its best.\n  Our goal should not be to pass just any TPA bill. Our goal should be \nto pass the strongest bill possible. That is the only way to ensure we \nget the best possible deal out of our trade negotiations, which is, in \nthe end, the purpose of TPA. We have used the same basic TPA structure \nfor every major trade agreement over the last four decades and, quite \nfrankly, the results speak for themselves.\n  As my colleagues have so eloquently stated today, we do not need new, \nuntested changes to establish TPA procedures that can hamper the \nprocess and make it harder for both our negotiators to reach a good \ndeal and for Congress to be able to vote on agreement up or down.\n  When Republicans took control of the Senate this year and I became \nthe chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I made renewing TPA my \ntop trade priority for this Congress. I set out to work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to craft the best possible bill. \nWe already had a good framework in place--the bill I introduced last \nyear with former Chairman Baucus and Chairman Camp, which had broad \nsupport in Congress, in the administration, and in the business \ncommunity.\n  My goal has been to see if we could improve upon that product in \norder to broaden support for TPA. I am certainly willing to do that, \nbut I have made it clear throughout this process that I cannot agree to \nany bill that would dilute the effectiveness of TPA as a tool to \nnegotiate and enact strong trade agreements.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to talk personally with President \nObama about TPA, as I mentioned. I think he understands the importance \nof getting a strong TPA bill through Congress. That is why I am willing \nto work with him to make the advancement of our Nation's trade agenda a \nhigher priority. I am hoping the President will do his part to help \npersuade the Members of his party to support an effective TPA bill. He \nsays he will, and I believe him.\n  Make no mistake. Our competitors are not sitting on their laurels \nwhen it comes to trade. There are literally hundreds of trade \nagreements under negotiation throughout the world, and the United \nStates is party to only a few.\n  This hurts our exporters badly. This bill is really necessary. We \nneed to do\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\nbetter. We need to do everything we can to ensure that the United \nStates is not only a participant in international trade but a leader. \nThe only way we can do that is by passing a strong TPA bill.\n  I stand ready and willing to work with the White House and my \ncolleagues in the Senate to get an effective TPA bill introduced out of \ncommittee and onto the Senate floor as soon as possible.\n  We cannot afford to miss this opportunity. This is a grand \nopportunity for us. It is bipartisan down the line, and I think it \nwould be a great accomplishment for the Congress of the United States \nto get this done. But, more importantly, it would be a great \naccomplishment for the President and this administration to have this \ndone. It would give him the tools to do a lot of the things that need \nto be done.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I did not come down to speak on this \nparticular bill. I am back for week No. 4 of waste of the week.\n  In recent weeks, I have highlighted what I describe as excess \nspending of taxpayer dollars. We have talked about double dipping in \nunemployment insurance, where if we could close this loophole, we could \nsave the taxpayer $5.7 billion in savings.\n  We have also talked about duplication in Federal economic development \nprograms. There are 50-some programs that provide for workforce \ntraining spread among a number of agencies. Surely we can reduce that \nnumber significantly. And if we could do so, we could save the taxpayer \n$200 million.\n  And last week--somewhat tongue in cheek, nevertheless not small \nchange--I talked about a $387,000 grant issued by the National \nInstitutes of Health in which 18 New Zealand white rabbits were given, \nfour times a day, 30-minute massages to determine whether they would be \nrelieved of some soreness after they were given some physical exercise. \nThen four massages a day, 30 minutes apiece, costing $387,000, to prove \nthat a massage helped to make them feel better or removed some of those \naches and pains.\n  I think we could have asked any athlete from any college. As we are \nmoving into college basketball's March Madness and Final Four that we \nall engage in at this time of year, we could ask any college athlete, \nor any person for that matter who is doing work in the yard: Do you \nthink 4 30-minute massages a day would help you feel a little better \nand help you with some of those aches and pains? Do we need to spend \n$387,000 of taxpayer dollars in order to prove this and give rabbits \nmassages?\n  So up we go with the chart. Waste of the week. This is week No. 4, \nand I would like to talk about a so-called bonus that has been given by \nour Federal Government that is quite egregious.\n  I am sure many look forward to a potential bonus at the end of the \nyear--though it doesn't apply in our business here. A bonus sounds like \nsomething that comes along with something that was earned, but what if \nit was a bonus you didn't earn? Is it still a bonus or does it become \nfraud?\n  Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen recently \nconfirmed to the Senate that unless action is taken, an amnesty bonus \nwould be available to millions who have broken our immigration laws. \nAll of this stems from the President's announcement in November of 2014 \nto grant 3 years of tentative legal status to as many as 4 million \nindividuals who crossed America's borders into this country illegally. \nFortunately, President Obama's Executive amnesty has been temporarily \nblocked by a Federal court. Hopefully, that blockage will survive all \nlegal challenges to undo it. But if this amnesty plan moves forward, 4 \nmillion illegal individuals will be granted Social Security numbers.\n  Why does this matter? Well, when you are granted a Social Security \nnumber, it triggers certain benefits, including eligibility for the \nearned income tax credit for up to 3 prior years in future tax filing \nyears.\n  The earned income tax credit is a benefit for working people who have \nlow to moderate income. It is an incentive and a reward for those who \nchoose to work, and it does help to reduce the number of those who are \ndependent on government welfare programs. It allows some individuals to \nreceive payments from the U.S. Treasury just by filing a tax return. It \nreduces the amount of tax an individual owes and it may also provide a \ntax refund.\n  Why is this issue qualified as waste of the week? Since the President \nis trying to legalize an additional 4 million individuals, if his \naction is upheld by the court, 4 million people will now have \nretroactive access to this benefit and taxpayers foot the bill for \nthese 4 million illegal immigrants who will be in a position to earn \nthis tax credit.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation says this so-called amnesty bonus for \nthose who have come into our country illegally will drain about $2.1 \nbillion from the United States Treasury.\n  I am for legal immigration. The United States has a rich history as a \ndestination where people from all over the world can come to make a \nbetter life for themselves. We are a nation of immigrants. As a matter \nof fact, I am the son of an immigrant. My mother came here with her \nfamily, and it has been the narrative of our family. Legal immigration \nis what has made America the great prosperous country it is today. But \nwe also are a nation of laws, and Congress should help ensure that \nlegal immigrants to our country can benefit from the opportunities they \nneed to succeed, but that doesn't include rewarding those who are \ngaming our immigration system to receive benefits they do not legally \nqualify for.\n  To address this matter, I have joined with Senator Grassley and \nseveral other of my colleagues to introduce legislation that would \ncorrect this issue. If we can correct this issue, we will save the \ntaxpayers an estimated $2.1 billion in future spending.\n  So up we go with the thermometer here, and we will be adding another \n$2.1 billion to the money that can be saved our taxpayers by \neliminating duplication, by pursuing awards that are not legally given, \nby looking at the way the Federal Government wastes money by giving \nrabbits back rubs, and we are going to continue to fill this up until \nwe hopefully reach the $100 billion goal. That is not small change.\n  I continue to hear from Hoosiers and others who write and say: Yes, \nwe haven't been able to address the big issues of debt and deficit, but \nwe can go after government waste. And those who say we can't afford to \ncut spending a nickel because we have cut so much so far clearly have \nnot paid attention to the billions of dollars that can be saved the \ntaxpayers simply by addressing the waste and illegal use of the \ntaxpayer money.\n  I look forward to sharing some more of these in coming weeks, and I \nthank the sponsor of the bill here for giving\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nme the time to come down and add another waste of the week to the list \nclimbing toward our goal of $100 billion in savings for the taxpayer, \nwho is overtaxed already.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the pending business, the \nJustice for Victims of Human Trafficking Bill.\n  The Senate is now on the second week of the trafficking bill and my \ncolleagues in the minority refuse to allow this body to amend or pass \nthis bipartisan bill. When this legislation was reported out of \ncommittee, not a single Democrat on the committee raised any concern \nwith the inclusion of the protections offered by the Hyde amendment. \nThis was hardly surprising, after all, Democrats have previously voted \nin favor of legislation that includes similar long standing statutory \nprotections--such as the Affordable Care Act. That is why it's so \nshocking that Democrats--out of nowhere--have had a change of heart on \nthe Hyde amendment, and are now obstructing efforts to help victims of \nhuman trafficking.\n  I urge my colleagues who are filibustering this legislation to \nconsider the gravity of their actions. While Democrats play politics as \nusual, thousands of victims--many of whom are children--are assaulted \nand abused every day, hoping someone will hear their cries for help. We \ncannot and must not allow political gamesmanship to stand in the way of \nhelping thousands of victims of human trafficking. Now is the time we \nmust work together to protect our Nation's most vulnerable from a \nhorrific trade that robs our children of their childhood and rejects \nthe sanctity of life.\n  Let us honor our commitment to protect children from abuse, neglect \nand rape. Let us put aside politics and do the right thing by moving \nforward on this bill.\n  Mr. COATS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today for two reasons. One is \nto manage the bill at hand for the next few hours, and the other is to \ntalk a little bit about Loretta Lynch, and how I hope we can resolve \nboth these issues.\n  I believe when it comes to the human trafficking bill on the floor, \nas well as my bill, the safe harbor bill--which is not the one on the \nfloor, but it is also a strong bipartisan bill that passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee with every single person voting for it, 20 to 0. I \nwant to talk a little bit about the bill so people don't forget it. It \nis expected to be an amendment to the bill on the floor when we get \nthese issues resolved.\n  I am hopeful that at some point here--and I hope it is today--we are \ngoing to turn the corner on some of the language we have been hearing \non the floor. I think it is becoming a sad situation, especially sad \nfor the victims of trafficking, and I think we have a moment in time \ntoday and tomorrow where we can actually work on this and try to \nresolve it. I believe this great august body, which has dealt with many \nlarge issues in the past--100 people who I think have come to this \nplace with good will--should be able to resolve it in some way, get \nthrough this, and get this bill done.\n  As we continue to work on the issues with the bill at hand, Senator \nCornyn's bill, I also want to talk about the bill I have and why both \nthese bills are important and actually work together.\n  On trafficking. First, we know the numbers. More than 27 million \npeople around the world are victims of some kind of trafficking each \nyear. It is not always sex trafficking. Sometimes it is labor \ntrafficking and other things. When it comes to sex trafficking, the \naverage age of a victim when she is trafficked is 13 years old. She is \nnot even old enough to go to a high school prom, not even old enough to \nget a driver's license.\n  When you look at the statistics around the world, it is the third \nbiggest international criminal enterprise in the world. The first is \nthe illegal trafficking of drugs. I don't think that is a surprise. The \nsecond is the illegal trafficking of guns, and the third is the illegal \ntrafficking of children, mostly little girls. But what people don't \nalways realize when they think about trafficking--I think they often \nthink about kids who are found in the bottom of a boat. That does \nhappen, horrible stories like that. But when it comes to the United \nStates of America, 83 percent of the victims--83 percent of the \nvictims--are from our own country. They are from our own country. They \nare girls such as Tamara Vandermoon of Minnesota. She was 12 when she \nwas first sold for sex. She was not even a teenager. She was just mad \nat her mom, and she ran away. A pimp found her and made her all kinds \nof promises--promises that sounded pretty good when you are a scared \nkid away from home. It happened when she was the most vulnerable. He \ntook advantage of her before she even had a chance to grow up and be an \nadult. She has worked to change her life around through services and \nhelp in our State.\n  Our State has been the leader in this area. That is one of the things \nwhy I introduced the safe harbor bill, which I hope will be the first \namendment to this bill after we resolve these issues. My bill also is \nsponsored with Senator Cornyn. He and I have worked together on this \nbill.\n  Another example--because people always use numbers. I used a bunch of \nnumbers at the beginning of this speech, but I think sometimes people \nknow behind those numbers, every single one of those numbers, is a \nchild.\n  Two weeks ago, out of the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota, our \ncase was charged, and it happened a few months ago. It was a 12-year-\nold in Rochester, MN, which is an idyllic community, a beautiful place. \nThis little 12-year-old got a text. She was with a girl who was a \nlittle older than herself. The text invited them to a party. She \nthought that was pretty cool. She goes to the McDonald's parking lot. \nShe is at the McDonald's parking lot, and this pimp puts her in the \ncar. She thinks she is going to a party. She gets carted up to the Twin \nCities. She gets raped. He takes sexually explicit pictures of her. He \nputs them on Craigslist. She gets sold the next day to two other guys, \nraped by two other guys.\n  Finally they were able to track down this perpetrator. He has been \ncharged with a very serious crime by the U.S. Attorney's office. This \nhappened in Minnesota. We can ask Senator Heitkamp, who has been \ninvolved in this issue. It happens in the oil patches in North Dakota. \nIt happens on the streets of Washington, DC. It happens all over this \ncountry.\n  We may say, why is everyone talking about this now in this day and \nage? I look at this, as a former prosecutor, as back when people viewed \ndomestic violence as a crime that was behind doors, that no one wanted \nto talk about it, and no one realized it was a crime. They thought of \nit as a family issue.\n  When we start seeing kids who are in situations of domestic violence \nare multiple times more likely to commit crimes themselves because they \ngrow up seeing it, we realize it is not just an issue between two \npeople. As horrible as the injuries are to the immediate victim, it is \nalso an issue for their entire family and for the entire community. We \nlearned that about domestic violence. We learned that about child \nabuse. Now we are starting to see this about trafficking.\n  We can't have a 12-year-old who is a criminal, right? The 12-year-old \nis a victim of this. The 12-year-old doesn't know what they are doing. \nThey are only 12 years old, but they are a victim, they are not a \ncriminal. That is the focus of the Safe Harbor Act.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Republican Erik Paulsen in the House, \nwho has taken this bill on. We have worked together on it. A version of \nit has passed the House. We like ours a little bit better because it \nhas the national sex trafficking strategy in it, and that is the bill \nwe are going to be putting on as an amendment. Erik has been a true \nleader on this issue, and we just talked yesterday about it. This bill \nactually now has--a version of it, my safe harbor bill--has passed the \nHouse twice. It doesn't have the issues with the Hyde amendment. \nHopefully it will be the first bill, the first amendment, when we \nresolve these other issues.\n\n[[Page S1598]]\n\n  What does the bill do? What it does is looks at what has been working \nin States across the country. According to a report by Polaris--a group \nthat is among many groups as a leader on sex trafficking--it shows that \n15 States across the country have taken these safe harbor laws. The \nlaws basically say we are not going to treat these kids as criminals. \nWe are going to make sure they are treated as victims, that they get \nthe services they need. And mostly then from a law enforcement \nperspective--from someone who was a prosecutor for 8 years, ran an \noffice of 400 people and saw these cases coming in and out of our doors \nall the time--what it means is these victims will then better testify \nagainst the people whom we want to get. Those are the perps. Those are \nthe people running the rings. Those are the johns who are buying the \nsex. By having this approach, we have a much better chance of going \nafter the people who are doing this.\n  The Ramsey County attorney's office out of St. Paul, MN, with their \nleader John Choi, was able to get a 40-year sentence last year of \nsomeone who was running one of these rings. We have had numerous \nprosecutions in Minnesota.\n  This idea of having a shelter, a place for the victims to go--because \notherwise what is going to happen if they don't think they are going to \nget help or maybe get some job training, have a place to stay, they are \ngoing to go right back to the pimp, and then they are not going to be \nwilling to testify and tell their story. That is what has happened \nthrough history, and that has enabled the rings to get worse and worse.\n  The other thing we know that has enabled them to get worse is the \nInternet. We love the Internet, but it has allowed people to market \nthings on all kinds of Web sites and in all kinds of devious ways. They \nare able to sell young girls and young boys on these Web sites. They \nget a text and they show up and think they are going to a party. That \nis what is happening. It is behind closed doors and it is hidden. That \nis one of the reasons we are seeing this increase and these problems \ncoming up, in addition to the realization we are not going to tolerate \nthis anymore.\n  We have 15 States across the country that already have the safe \nharbor laws. Another 12 States are making good progress in this \ndirection. It is not starting from scratch. As I said, my home State is \none of the first ones, but we are seeing them. What our bill does is \ncreate incentives for States to adopt these kinds of laws. It is not \ninvolving a lot of money. It is taking existing programs and trying to \ncreate incentives so that States will adopt these laws.\n  The other piece of the bill is that it allows victims of these crimes \nto qualify for certain Federal job programs that they may not qualify \nfor now. It also creates a national strategy, as I mentioned, to combat \nhuman trafficking.\n  I always found when I was a prosecutor that people didn't care who \ntook on the case, whether it was a local prosecutor or the State AG or \nthe U.S. Attorney's office. They just wanted people to get the job \ndone. They didn't actually understand the jurisdictional divisions. By \nmaking this national sex trafficking strategy the idea--and I have seen \nthis with the Violence Against Women Act--it may not be that we are \nmandating people do a certain thing, but we put out there some best \npractices that local offices can cover. We look at what is working in \ncertain States. Then we put those out there because we have a national \nsex trafficking strategy, and we give people ideas of what they can do \nbest.\n  Those are parts of the bill. It is pretty straightforward. Again, it \nis not the bill on the floor right now which, of course, has an \nimportant purpose, to help fund some of the shelters and pay for it by \nan increase on the fees on perpetrators, but it is a part of the \nsolution.\n  Another part of the solution we haven't talked too much about over \nthe last few days, because there have been a lot of other things going \non, I think we have to also remember the role of the private sector. We \ncertainly have seen this in our State, where Marilyn Carlson Nelson, \nwho is a wonderful business leader, headed up Carlson Companies for \nmany years. Carlson Companies owns the Radisson Hotels. She has made \ntraining of her workforce a major part of this because it is the people \non the frontline--and you can see Delta and all the others, American, \nUnited, a lot of the airlines are making this a priority as well. They \nare training their workers because they are on the frontline, and they \nare going to see this happen. They are going to see the victims. They \nare going to figure out something is going on that is wrong, so they \ncan at least report it to their hotel's security or whatever \nauthorities they think they need to; they can stop it right there on \nthe ground floor and report it to the authorities.\n  We shouldn't forget that. Because unless these private sector \nentities who see it happening come forward--this isn't in any of our \nbills. This is something they are doing on their own. Unless they do \nthat, we can have all the laws we want on the books, but it is really \nhard to catch these things from happening. I am proud of the work they \nhave done.\n  My good friend Cindy McCain, Heidi Heitkamp, and I went to Mexico \nlast spring with the major focus on sex trafficking. We met with the \nattorney general of Mexico and met with the head of their law \nenforcement in Mexico City about this very topic. Because Mexico, along \nwith many other countries, has girls who do come in and are brought in \nfor purposes of sex trafficking. I do want to emphasize, however, this \nis not just an international problem, but over 83 percent of the \nvictims are from our country. But they have been coordinating with us \non a number of successful prosecutions by giving us information so when \nthe cases come to the United States, we view this. They have their own \ninternal problems with this and other things as well, obviously, in \nMexico. We went there not to say you are doing something wrong. We went \nthere to say we have our own problems, and so do you. Let's figure out \nhow we can work together on this issue.\n  Again, Cindy McCain is an example of someone who on the private side \nhas been very involved with her foundation in working on this issue and \nhelping with shelters and other things. The private sector piece of \nthis, they can be called trafficking facilitators, unknowingly, because \nthey are allowing this to happen. But in a way, they are a major part \nof the solution. I do not want us to forget that as we go forward and \nas they work with us to address the needs of the victims, and mostly to \nbe able to catch these cases and bring them to law enforcement.\n  That is kind of a tour through what the safe harbor bill does. Again, \nSenator Cornyn and I have talked about it being the first amendment to \nthe bill. I am very aware that we need to work out the issues on the \nunderlying bill, and I am hopeful after days of acrimony that at some \npoint we are going to be able to work together. I am hoping there will \nbe a different flavor to people's discussions about this issue today.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  The Loretta Lynch nomination now has been tied into this. I have a \nlittle bit of a different approach because I do not think we should be \nslowing it down anymore. I understand that we have to work out the \nissues on the sex trafficking, and there is plenty of blame that can go \naround. But I think the major focus should be on working it out instead \nof playing this blame game.\n  Loretta Lynch, on the other hand--I do not understand why our friends \non the other side of the aisle have been delaying this for so long. I \nunderstand this is a major job, but this is a woman who has had 900 \nwritten questions and an 8-hour job interview, to my mind, where \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee could ask her whatever they wanted, \nin several rounds of questions, if they wanted. She also met with \nmembers of that committee. I am sure that anyone who wanted to met with \nher--I know she has met with at least 59 Senators to date. That is a \npretty major job interview. Twenty-five U.S. Attorneys from Republican \nand Democratic administrations have approved and suggested that she is \nmore than fit for this job.\n  How do I come down on this? I come down on this as a perspective of \nknowing that Attorney General Holder wants to leave. I think he has \ndone some really good things. I know some\n\n[[Page S1599]]\n\nof my colleagues have not been a big fan of his. This is an opportunity \nfor them to put someone new in. We will start with that.\n  The second thing is this is someone who is highly qualified. Coming \nfrom a State where we have indicted 20 people for criminal activity \nrelated to al-Shabaab with their terrorist activities in Somalia, we \nhave recently indicted a number of people who decided they were going \nto go fight with ISIS, coming out of our State. And I am proud of our \ncommunities, our Muslim and Somali communities, that have been working \nwith law enforcement on this. This has been an effort, because no kid \nshould be going over there and no parent wants their kid to go join a \nterrorist organization.\n  That being said, to keep our communities safe, we have to be very \naggressive about these cases. So given that these cases are going on \nright in my hometown, I would really like to have the support of an \nAttorney General in place, and one who is nominated before this \nbody. And as the nominee, she is someone who is uniquely qualified to \nhandle these kinds of cases that the citizens in my State want to have \nhandled, these terrorism cases. In fact, her office is No. 1 in the \ncountry when it comes to how many terrorism cases they have \nsuccessfully handled in New York. So she is a seasoned U.S. attorney. \nShe is not someone who comes from a political background; she is \nsomeone who comes from a prosecutor background and is a former \nprosecutor and someone who wants to see that kind of commonsense, no-\nnonsense mentality in the Attorney General's office.\n\n  I highly recommend that my colleagues not only vote for her \nconfirmation but just let this come to the floor as soon as possible.\n  Some of the critiques I have heard against her from some of my \ncolleagues--some have said she has been lawless, and that doesn't quite \nmake sense to me, especially when we look at who has been backing her \nfrom the law enforcement community, such as the 25 U.S. attorneys I \nmentioned. The New York police commissioner has endorsed her, as has \nthe president of the Federal Law Enforcement Association and the \npresident of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. These \npeople are not exactly known for supporting lawlessness.\n  The other thing that has been mentioned by many of my colleagues that \nconcerns me as to the reason they gave for blocking her nomination is \nthat she said when she was at a hearing that she would be supportive, \nas the chief law enforcement person for our country, of the President's \npolicies when it comes to immigration.\n  Let's start with the law. We know this is now tied up in the courts, \nand there are different court decisions. One court is upholding the \nExecutive order of the President, and another court has said it is not \nlegal. We have had disputes on it in the courts. All right. But when we \nlook through time, we realize every President since Dwight Eisenhower \nhas done some kind of Executive order of varying degrees. George H.W. \nBush did a major Executive order involving many immigrants. When we \nlook at those through history, we realize those Presidents to some \ndegree or other--I know the Liberian community in Minnesota. They have \nbeen for decades on an emergency order, and that is why they are in our \nState. Every year, they have to come back, and sometimes Congress does \nsomething and sometimes the President does something. But year after \nyear, they need this Executive order because of the status under which \nthey came to this country. They are law-abiding citizens. They are \nworking throughout our State and have been here for 15 or 20 years. And \nthat is just one example.\n  These Executive orders on immigration have been going on since Dwight \nEisenhower. I don't really have the time to look back and see what \nevery Attorney General did at the time, but my guess is that the \nAttorneys General under Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon and both \nBushes and Bill Clinton all said: OK, this is legal. You can go ahead \nand do this Executive order.\n  I am not saying this one is not of more magnitude. It is. But there \nwas a major Executive order when George Bush was President. We know \nthat. So why we would then somehow take that history and extrapolate it \ninto, OK, well, Loretta Lynch is somehow lawless just because she said \nthe President could issue an Executive order--it just doesn't make any \nsense to me at all.\n  We have a woman who has been prosecuting these cases of terrorism for \nyears. We have someone who has significant support from Democratic and \nRepublican U.S. attorneys from many administrations. We have someone \nwho really did pass her senatorial job review. I understand that my \ncolleagues feel strongly about immigration and that they didn't like \nwhat the President did, and the President himself said he would like to \ntear up that piece of paper that contained the Executive action if only \nthis body and the House would pass comprehensive immigration reform.\n  When I look back through this whole story, one of my proudest moments \nwas when the Senate came together on comprehensive immigration reform. \nI am on the Judiciary Committee, and I believe that was the best moment \nfor the Judiciary Committee in the last few years. Under Chairman \nLeahy's leadership, our committee was able to work together across \nparty lines, starting with the Gang of 8 who came up with the base \nconcept, which was half Democrats and half Republicans, including \nSenator Durbin, Senator McCain, Senator Schumer, Senator Bennet, \nSenator Menendez, Senator Flake, and the work of many other Members, \nwhich made it possible to get that bill done.\n  So the Gang of 8 got that done, and from there we went to the \ncommittee with a bill, and we spent days voting on amendments. We voted \non amendments that stretched over every part of the bill, whether it \nwas the fence at the border or what would happen with undocumented \nworkers or the work Senator Hatch and I did on making sure we had the \ngreen card and visa system up to date. We have a situation in our \ncountry right now where we have literally unlimited visas for wild \nhockey players. We love our hockey team in Minnesota, and they are able \nto recruit a bunch of Canadians. That is good for us, but doctors from \nthe Mayo Clinic are not able to bring in a spouse if they want to come \nfrom another country.\n  We have to look at this as to the undocumented workers who are here, \nwe have the border issues, and we also have these issues related to \nagriculture and the innovation economy that make this comprehensive \nreform so important. Let's remember that when it comes to business \nissues, we have a case where 200 of our Fortune 500 companies were \nstarted by immigrants or kids of immigrants. Ninety of our Fortune 500 \ncompanies were started by immigrants. Thirty percent of our U.S. Nobel \nlaureates were born in other countries.\n  I neglected to add Marco Rubio to the Gang of 8 as I recall in my \nmind everyone who was in it.\n  That is why I was such a fan of the comprehensive immigration \nreform--because it was so important to look at all parts of the issue.\n  So now I get to Loretta Lynch. We passed a bill with pretty strong \nsupport here--I think it was like 68 votes or something in that \nneighborhood--and then it went over to the House and it sat there in a \ndeep freeze. That bill sat there for over a year somewhere between the \nchocolate ice cream and the frozen peas. We were never able to get it \nout of the House, and that is what led to the President's Executive \norder, and now somehow--OK, that is fine, it was bad enough that that \nall happened, and I am still hopeful we will be able to get this done, \nbut how that story leads to Loretta Lynch's confirmation being held up \nis beyond belief to me. I think it is time to get her nomination voted \non. I don't think it should be related to the present difficulties we \nare having with this bill that I care so much about and mostly also \nwith my safe harbor legislation, which has been slotted to be the first \namendment.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to work everything out with the bill \nthat is on the floor right now--I truly am--because I don't think it is \nfitting of the Senate to keep up this fight when there are victims of \nsex trafficking every single day, such as that 12-year-old girl out of \nRochester, MN. How are we going to explain this to that little girl, \nthat we are fighting it out every single day instead of trying to come \nto a resolution?\n  I remember when we were down in Mexico--Heidi Heitkamp and Cindy\n\n[[Page S1600]]\n\nMcCain and I--and visited one of the shelters there. We met all the \ngirls who were there. There was one girl there named Paloma. All the \nother girls had an interpreter and they talked to us through the \ninterpreter, but she spoke a little English. She introduced herself, \nand then she just started to cry and could not stop crying. As she \ncried, you just knew that whatever happened to her was so bad, she \ncould not even talk about it.\n  It reminded me of when Senator Gillibrand, Senator Graham, Senator \nHoeven, and I were on a trip and went to a refugee camp in Jordan and \nmet with a group of refugees. One of the women there said that what she \nhad seen happen to her family in Syria was so sad that it would make \nstones cry. That is what I thought of when I saw Paloma, that what had \nhappened to her--this little, young, beautiful, 12-, 13-year-old girl--\nwhat had happened to her was so sad that it would make stones cry.\n  I hope my colleagues keep this in mind as we work on these two bills. \nI am tired of talking about how this happened or how we got where we \nare. There is a way to resolve this problem, and certainly the \nnomination of the Attorney General of the United States should not be \nheld up because of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I see my good friend Senator Isakson from Georgia is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I encourage the Members of the Senate to \nvote favorably on cloture so we can move forward on the important bill \non human trafficking.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to ask unanimous consent to \naddress the Senate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Setting The Record Straight\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I don't normally come to the floor and \naddress a question that was asked rhetorically on the floor the night \nbefore, but I am compelled to do so today.\n  There were two instances that happened in the last week where my name \nand the Coca-Cola name came up, and I thought I should set the record \nstraight.\n  This weekend, in an op-ed published in USA TODAY, the Democratic \nleader, Harry Reid, and Sheldon Whitehouse, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, made the following statement:\n\n       Republicans in Congress who represent great corporations \n     headquartered in their states ignore those corporations--\n     Walmart in Arkansas, Coca-Cola in Georgia, VF Corporation in \n     North Carolina--when they explain the business case for \n     addressing climate change and are already reducing their own \n     pollution.\n       Republicans in Congress who root boisterously for their \n     state university sports teams ignore the warnings of \n     scientists and researchers at those very universities on \n     climate change.\n\n  Then last night on the floor of the Senate, in his 93rd speech on \nglobal warming, Senator Whitehouse made the following statement and \nasked this rhetorical question: ``I don't know whether Coca-Cola has \never spoken about climate change to Senator Isakson . . . from Coca-\nCola's home State of Georgia.'' So I came to answer that rhetorical \nquestion and to answer the reference that was made in the editorial by \nSenator Reid and Senator Whitehouse.\n  This is a picture of me and Senator Coons in Ghana, Africa. It is 5 \nyears old. At the request of the Coca-Cola Company, he and I traveled \nthe continent of Africa looking at clean water projects all over that \ncontinent. African people who never had the opportunity to drink clean \nwater now have sustainable clean water plants thanks to the Coca-Cola \nCompany. These plants are environmentally safe, environmentally \nfriendly, noncarbon-emitting water purification systems.\n  During the course of the years I have been in the U.S. Senate, the \nCoca-Cola Company has briefed me on the following things about their \nbusiness as it deals with climate change or carbon.\n  They have saved 7 billion gallons of water in the United States with \nfacility improvements in the United States. They have donated 70,000 \ningredient drums for reuse as rain barrels, have supported over 100 \nwatershed projects across North America, and have partnered with the \nNational Forest Service to provide water to 60 million Americans.\n  On energy and climate, they have improved cooling equipment \nefficiency by 60 percent in their operation since the year 2000. They \nown the largest heavy-duty hybrid electric truck fleet in North America \nand have improved energy efficiency in manufacturing by 8 percent since \n2008.\n  In packaging, over 96 percent of total waste is diverted away from \nlandfills.\n  Since 2007, they have distributed 240,000 public recycling bins. They \nhave achieved a 70 million-pound reduction in packaging material, and \ninnovative packaging avoids 150,000 metric tons of CO2 \nemissions--150,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.\n  As far as agriculture, they have invested over $1 million to support \nsustainable agriculture in Georgia and across the United States. They \nhave supported the planting of 25,000 acres of new orange groves in \nFlorida and 4,100 new jobs in energy efficiency.\n  That is what the Coca-Cola Company has advised me of since I have \nbeen in the U.S. Senate in terms of their commitment to a clean \nenvironment for our world and country.\n  I believe the climate does change, but I don't believe climate change \nis a religion, I think it is science. I have done everything I can as a \nSenator to educate myself on the carbon and climate change issue. Seven \nyears ago, I went with Senator Boxer from California to Disko Bay in \nGreenland with Dr. Ally, the leading glaciologist in the world, to \nstudy what he says about the possibility of carbon being the cause of \nclimate change. There are mixed reviews and mixed scientific evidence \non that.\n  I am the first person to say we should reduce our carbon footprint. \nIt is good for the atmosphere and our health. Eight years ago, when I \nhad just entered the U.S. Senate, I bought a hybrid vehicle. I still \ndrive that hybrid Ford Escape today. I did so because I thought it was \na good business and a good atmospheric decision. I didn't buy it \nbecause someone made me; I bought it because I cared. My wife and I \nrecycle because we think it is a good idea.\n  There are lots of things we can do to reduce the footprint of carbon, \nbut to infer in USA TODAY or in a speech that we are not cognizant of \nthe things that are done by our corporations to reduce carbon emissions \nand reduce the danger to the environment is just wrong and it is just \nunfair.\n  Senator Whitehouse wrote a great book, which I read, called \n``Virtues.'' It is about the great virtues of living a good and healthy \nlife, and one of those virtues is truth. The truth is that all of us \ncare about the environment; we just don't all subscribe to the same \ntheory about what happens.\n  We should all be praising the good things that corporations are doing \nand recognize that it is not just Democrats and not just Republicans, \nbut it is American politicians who make the policies that determine \nwhere we go in the future.\n  I think it is very important that we reduce carbon emissions, but I \nthink it is important to be practical in those reductions. We can pass \nall the great regulations in the world that are good for the \nenvironment, but if they shut down the American economy and American \nbusiness, they are probably not a very good idea.\n  The environment and business should work in harmony together rather \nthan be adversaries and enemies. Publications like what appeared in USA \nTODAY over the weekend or speeches like the one that was made last \nnight don't do anything to foster harmony or a good commitment; \ninstead, they raise controversy.\n  I love Sheldon Whitehouse. He is a great U.S. Senator. I appreciate \nLeader Reid and what he does. But I don't appreciate the references \nthat were made about Coca-Cola or about me in the article they wrote \nover the weekend or the speech that was made last night.\n  In fact, as I thought about what I would do in terms of responding to \nwhat was said, I sat down last night and made an interesting \nobservation. Monday of this week before I left Georgia to come up here, \nI met with the Southern Company, and one of the discussions that came \nup were the solar panels they put out in the Southwest to amend the \ngrid out there with solar energy--something that is environmentally \nsound and doesn't emit carbon. They talked about Plant Vogtle, where \nthey are adding three or four reactors, which is renewable energy and\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\nrecyclable, and it emits no carbon and is now being generated in \nGeorgia--reliable electricity with carbon-free generation through \nnuclear power.\n  Yesterday, I had a meeting with the UPS corporation, which just \nhappens to be one of the leaders in the world using nonfossil fuel-\nburning waste to deliver their packages.\n  You can go down the list of corporate America and the things they are \ndoing to reduce carbon emissions every single day, and they deserve the \ncredit. But they don't need to be criticized or lectured by Members of \nthe Senate for not lobbying me because they do lobby me. They believe, \nas I believe, that reducing carbon is good, but it shouldn't be a \nreligion; it should be dealt with scientifically. It is important that \nwe understand that every contribution we can make to a carbonless \nenvironment is a good contribution, but we can't abolish it absolutely. \nEvery regulation we pass to improve our environment is important, but \nif it shuts down American business, it probably is not the right \ndecision to make.\n\n  So since the question was asked rhetorically last night on the floor \nof the Senate, I thought I would come to the floor and answer it in \nperson. I believe truth is a virtue. The truth is the Coca-Cola Company \nhas informed me continuously about the efforts they have made to reduce \ncarbon emissions and to improve their environmental contribution. There \nis no greater evidence of that than me drinking water that just came \nout of a purification plant in Ghana, Africa, out of a Coca-Cola cup. I \nthink that is about the best evidence we can possibly find that they \nhave delivered their message. They are doing their job. I am proud of \nthe Coca Cola Company.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wanted to clarify something I said \nwhen I spoke about the work the Senate did on comprehensive immigration \nreform in relation to the Loretta Lynch nomination. I mentioned the \nGang of 8, and I think I got seven of them right. I wish to clarify \nexactly who was a Member of the Gang of 8: Senator Schumer, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Menendez, Senator Bennet, Senator McCain, Senator \nFlake, Senator Graham, and Senator Rubio. That was the starting-off \npoint for the comprehensive immigration reform that passed through the \nSenate.\n  I wish to get back to the matter at hand. As I stand in the Chamber \ntoday, I am going to keep reminding people of why we are really here, \nwhy the bill is on the floor--which is about sex trafficking--and the \nreason we want to try to resolve these issues and actually focus on the \nmatter at hand and not on extraneous issues and other issues and other \nfights. My own Republican Congressman who carries my bill, the safe \nharbor bill--which of course is not the bill at issue but we hope will \nbe the first amendment--has noted that we just need to move on and get \nthese bills done and not play politics as usual. That is going to be my \nfocus today as I manage this bill.\n  So I thought I would read on the floor a book that has been a \nnational bestseller by Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and his \nwife Sheryl WuDunn. It is a book about sex trafficking. It is an \nincredible book. It focuses more on international sex trafficking. As \nwe know, our bills here--the one that is on the floor and the one I \nhave authored--are about how our own country gets a handle on this, by \ngetting better laws in place and creating incentives and working with \nthe private sector and doings things so our country, I think from my \nperspective, internationally can be a true leader. We can't be a true \nleader and tell these states and democracies and countries that aren't \neven democracies across the world that they need to do a better job if \nwe don't do a better job.\n  To me, this should be a major tenet of our foreign policy. Once we \nget women so that they are not treated as slaves and they are not \ntreated as chattel--once we get them to that circumstance--countries \nalways do better. When we have women who can work and own businesses, \nwomen who can serve in government, it changes a whole society.\n  So that is why the sex trafficking bill is on the floor and the one \nthat I have that will be considered as an amendment. The reason we need \nto get through where we are right now and focus on the real issue at \nhand is that our country can not only help the victims in our own \ncountry, but by shining a light on this, by being a leader on this \ninternationally, it will help us internationally. We want to be able to \nwork with other countries--not saying they are doing something bad when \nwe have our own problem, but saying, Here is what we did and here is \nhow we are handling this and we want to work with you as partners and \nwe want to have women be treated with respect throughout the world.\n  So this book, as I said, focuses on international sex trafficking. It \nis called ``Half the Sky.'' I love this name. It is a Chinese proverb. \nIt talks about how women basically are holding up half the sky. That is \nwhat it is about. Women are holding up half the sky. We can't forget \nabout half the sky and just let half the sky go and let them be sold \ninto slavery and not be treated equally and expect a society to \nfunction.\n  So this is how the book starts out. It has a great quote from Mark \nTwain. I like jokes. Listen to this one: ``What would men be without \nwomen? Scarce, sir, mighty scarce.''\n  It is making the point again that women hold up half the sky.\n  So this is the book and how it starts:\n\n       Srey Rath is a self-confident Cambodian teenager whose \n     black hair tumbles over a round, light brown face. She is in \n     a crowded street market, standing beside a pushcart and \n     telling her story calmly, with detachment. The only hint of \n     anxiety or trauma is the way she often pushes her hair in \n     front of her black eyes, perhaps a nervous tic. Then she \n     lowers her hand and her long fingers gesticulate and flutter \n     in the air with incongruous grace as she recounts her \n     odyssey.\n       Rath is short and small-boned, pretty, vibrant, and bubbly, \n     a wisp of a girl whose negligible stature contrasts with an \n     outsized and outgoing personality. When the skies abruptly \n     release a tropical rain shower that drenches us, she simply \n     laughs and rushes us to cover under a tin roof, and then \n     cheerfully continues her story as the rain drums overhead. \n     But Rath's attractiveness and winning personality are \n     perilous bounties for a rural Cambodian girl, and her \n     trusting nature and optimistic self-assuredness compound the \n     hazard.\n       When Rath was fifteen, her family ran out of money, so she \n     decided to go work as a dishwasher in Thailand for two months \n     to help pay the bills. Her parents fretted about her safety, \n     but they were reassured when Rath arranged to travel with \n     four friends who had been promised jobs in the same Thai \n     restaurant. The job agent took the girls deep into Thailand \n     and then handed them to gangsters who took them to Kuala \n     Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Rath was dazzled by her \n     first glimpses of the city's clean avenues and gleaming high-\n     rises, including at the time the world's tallest twin \n     buildings; it seemed safe and welcoming. But then thugs \n     sequestered Rath and two other girls inside a karaoke lounge \n     that operated as a brothel. One gangster in his late \n     thirties, a man known as ``the boss,'' took charge of the \n     girls and explained that he had paid money for them and that \n     they would now be obliged to repay him. ``You must find money \n     to pay off the debt, and then I will send you back home,'' he \n     said, repeatedly reassuring them that if they cooperated they \n     would eventually be released.\n       Rath was shattered when what was happening dawned on her. \n     The boss locked her up with a customer, who tried to force \n     her to have sex with him. She fought back, enraging the \n     customer. ``So the boss got angry and hit me in the face, \n     first with one hand and then with the other,'' she remembers, \n     telling her story with simple resignation. ``The mark stayed \n     on my face for two weeks.'' Then the boss and the other \n     gangsters raped her and beat her with their fists.\n       ``You have to serve the customers,'' the boss told her as \n     he punched her. ``If not, we will beat you to death. Do you \n     want that?'' Rath stopped protesting, but she sobbed and \n     refused to cooperate actively. The boss forced her to take a \n     pill; the gangsters called it ``the happy drug'' or ``the \n     shake drug.'' She doesn't know exactly what it has, but it \n     made her head shake and induced lethargy, happiness, and \n     compliance for about an hour. When she wasn't drugged, Rath \n     was teary and insufficiently compliant--she was required to \n     beam happily at all customers--so the boss said he would \n     waste no more time on her: She would agree to do as he \n     ordered or he would kill her. Rath then gave in. The girls \n     were forced to work in the brothel seven days a week, fifteen \n     hours a day. They were kept naked to make it more difficult \n     for them to run away or to keep tips or other money, and they \n     were forbidden to ask customers to use condoms. They were \n     battered until they smiled constantly and simulated joy at \n     the sight of customers, because men would not pay as much for \n     sex with girls with reddened eyes and haggard faces. The \n     girls were never allowed out on the street or paid a penny \n     for their work.\n       ``They just gave us food to eat, but they didn't give us \n     much because the customers\n\n[[Page S1602]]\n\n     didn't like fat girls,'' Rath says. The girls were bused, \n     under guard, back and forth between the brothel and a tenth-\n     floor apartment where a dozen of them were housed. The door \n     of the apartment was locked from the outside. However, one \n     night, some of the girls went out onto their balcony and \n     pried loose a long, five-inch-wide board from a rack used for \n     drying clothes. They balanced it precariously between their \n     balcony and one on the next building, twelve feet away. The \n     board wobbled badly, but Rath was desperate, so she sat \n     astride the board and gradually inched across.\n       ``There were four of us who did that,'' she says. ``The \n     others were too scared, because it was very rickety. I was \n     scared, too, and I couldn't look down, but I was even more \n     scared to stay. We thought that even if we died it would be \n     better than staying behind. If we stayed we would die as \n     well.''\n       Once on the far balcony, the girls pounded on the window \n     and woke the surprised tenant. They could hardly communicate \n     with him because none of them spoke the language, but the \n     tenant let them into his apartment and then out the front \n     door. The girls took the elevator down and wandered the \n     silent streets until they found a police station and walked \n     inside. The police first tried to shoo them away, then \n     arrested the girls for illegal immigration. Rath served a \n     year in prison under Malaysia's tough anti-immigrant laws, \n     and then she was supposed to be repatriated. She thought a \n     Malaysian policeman was escorting her home when he drove her \n     to the Thai border--but then he sold her to a trafficker, who \n     peddled her to a Thai brothel.\n\n  So I say to my colleagues, this is what we are talking about. This \nstory is in another country, but this same story is repeated in our \ncountry day in and day out. If we are going to try to lead in Cambodia \nand try to change the world for these girls, we have to lead in our own \ncountry. Certainly we have to lead by focusing on the issue at hand, \nwhich is sex trafficking, and what we can do in our country. What can \nwe do? Well, we can have better services for the victims. We can set up \nour law enforcement system in a way that works by not treating--for so \nlong, these young 12-year-olds and 13-year-olds were thought of as \ncriminals when, in fact, they are victims. How can we say someone is \nnot raped, how can we say the story of this girl, who thought she was \ngoing to work to have a better life for herself as a dishwasher, then \ngets raped--how can we say that is not rape, that it is prostitution or \na crime? No. She is a victim.\n  That is what the safe harbor bill--which I have introduced and which \nI am hopeful will be the first amendment once we work out these other \nissues--would do. It would treat these girls and boys as victims.\n  So I wish to remind my colleagues what we are truly dealing with. \nThis is not supposed to be a fight over abortion. This is a fight about \nhow to help these young girls throughout our country and by virtue of \nus being a leader throughout the world.\n  So I am going to continue reading from the book, just so we are all \nreminded what we are talking about.\n\n       Rath's saga offers a glimpse of the brutality inflicted \n     routinely on women and girls in much of the world, a \n     malignancy that is slowly gaining recognition as one of the \n     paramount human rights problems of this century.\n       The issues involved, however, have barely registered on the \n     global agenda. Indeed, when we began reporting about \n     international affairs in the 1980s--\n\n  This is a book by Nicholas Kristof and his wife Sheryl, whose book, \n``Half the Sky,'' is a national best seller. The subhead is ``Turning \nOppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.''\n  Again, why am I reading this? Because this is what we are supposed to \nbe talking about here. This is a bill we are supposed to be getting \ndone and not talking about extraneous issues that I think we should be \nable to resolve because they have been resolved in the past. To do \nthat, we have to decide that these girls are important enough to do \nthat.\n  Continuing on, they talked about how these issues have barely \nregistered on the global agenda:\n\n       Indeed, when we began reporting about international affairs \n     in the 1980s, we couldn't have imagined writing this book. We \n     assumed that the foreign policy issues that properly furrowed \n     the brow were lofty and complex, like nuclear \n     nonproliferation. It was difficult back then to envision the \n     Council on Foreign Relations fretting about maternal \n     mortality or genital mutilation. Back then the oppression of \n     women was a fringe issue, the kind of worthy cause the \n     girl scouts might raise money for--\n\n  And I hope that is not how we are treating this in the Senate. I hope \nthat is not how we are treating it, and I hope we are not treating it \nas a political football.\n\n       We preferred to probe the recondite ``serious issues.''\n       So this book is the outgrowth--\n\n  The writers write--\n\n     of our own journey of awakening as we worked together as \n     journalists for The New York Times. The first milestone in \n     that journey came in China. Sheryl is a Chinese-American who \n     grew up in New York City, and Nicholas is an Oregonian who \n     grew up on a sheep and cherry farm near Yamhill, Oregon. \n     After we married, we moved to China, where seven months later \n     we found ourselves standing on the edge of Tiananmen Square \n     watching troops fire their automatic weapons at prodemocracy \n     protestors. The massacre claimed between four hundred and \n     eight hundred lives and transfixed the world. It was the \n     human rights story of the world. It was the human rights \n     story of the year, and it seemed just about the most shocking \n     violation imaginable.\n       Then the following year, we came across an obscure but \n     meticulous demographic study that outlined a human rights \n     violation that had claimed tens of thousands more lives. This \n     study found that thirty-nine thousand baby girls die annually \n     in China because parents don't give them the same medical \n     care and attention that boys receive--and that is just in \n     their first year of life. One Chinese family-planning \n     official, Li Honggui, explained it this way: ``If a boy gets \n     sick, the parents may send him to the hospital at once. But \n     if a girl gets sick, the parents may say to themselves, \n     ``Well, let's see how she is tomorrow.''\n     . . . A similar pattern emerged in other countries, \n     particularly in South Asia and the Muslim world. In India, a \n     ``bride burning''--to punish a woman for an inadequate dowry \n     or to eliminate her so a man can remarry--takes place \n     approximately once every two hours, but these rarely \n     constitute news.\n       In . . . Pakistan, five thousand women and girls have been \n     doused in kerosene and set alight by family members or in-\n     laws--or, perhaps worse, been seared with acid--for perceived \n     disobedience in the last nine years. Imagine the outcry if \n     the Pakistani or Indian governments were burning women alive \n     at those rates. Yet when the government is not directly \n     involved, people shrug.\n\n  Again, how does this apply to the matter at hand? We know there are \ngirls who are victims of trafficking who are put into slavery--sex \nslavery--every single day in this country. So if we think we can be a \nleader when it comes to what is going on around the world and we want \nto hold our Nation up, then we have to be a leader in this Chamber this \nweek and get this bill done and get these extraneous issues behind us \nthat people feel strongly about. But, as I said, somehow we have been \nable to handle these issues in the past on other bills, and I hope the \ngirls we are talking about here are just as important as those other \nissues.\n\n       When a prominent dissident was arrested in China--\n\n  I go back to the book--\n\n     we would write a front-page article; when 100,000 girls were \n     routinely kidnapped and trafficked into brothels, we didn't \n     even consider it news. Partly that is because we journalists \n     tend to be good at covering events that happen on a \n     particular day, but we slip at covering events that happen \n     every day--such as the . . . cruelties inflicted on women and \n     girls. We journalists weren't the only ones who dropped the \n     ball on this subject. [A tiny portion] of U.S. foreign aid is \n     specifically targeted to women and girls.\n\n  They then go on to quote a Nobel Prize-winning economist who has \ndeveloped a way to look at gender inequality that is a striking \nreminder of the stakes involved.\n\n       ``More than 100 million are missing,'' Sen wrote in a \n     classic essay in 1990 in ``The New York Review of Books,'' \n     spurring a new field of research. Sen noted that in normal \n     circumstances women live longer than men, and so there are \n     more females than males in much of the world. Even poor \n     regions like most of Latin America and much of Africa have \n     more females than males. Yet in places where girls have a \n     deeply unequal status, they vanish. China has 107 males for \n     every 100 females in its overall population . . . India has \n     108, and Pakistan has 111.\n\n  I remember at the McCain Institute, where Cindy McCain and Heidi \nHeitkamp and I spoke on a panel, that Senator McCain had just returned \nfrom a trip abroad and had been in a country that was experiencing \nenormous upheaval. He had asked: ``Where are the girls?'' And someone \nsaid to him: ``Most of them have been sold.'' They had been sold. So \nthis is really happening, and the people in this Chamber know it is \nhappening. That is why, again, I get back to the fact that if we want \nto do something about it here, we need to resolve these issues, we need \nto do it without going into a blame game, and we need to get this done \nso we can pass this bill--and not have a dispute\n\n[[Page S1603]]\n\nover abortion--that, in fact, helps the very girls we are supposed to \nhelp. Only then can we be a leader in the world.\n  I will go back to the book:\n\n       The worst of these abuses tend to occur in poor nations, \n     but the United States and other western countries are not \n     immune. In America, millions of women and girls face beatings \n     or other violence from their husbands or boyfriends and more \n     than one in six undergo rape or attempted rape at some point \n     in her life, according to the National Violence Against Women \n     survey. Then there is forced prostitution. Teenage runaways \n     are beaten, threatened and branded (with tattoos) by pimps in \n     American cities, and thousands of foreign women are \n     trafficked into the United States as well. Still, in poor \n     countries gender discrimination is often lethal in a way that \n     is usually not in America. In India, for example, mothers are \n     less likely to take their daughters to be vaccinated than \n     their sons--that alone accounts for one fifth of India's \n     missing females--while studies have found that, on average, \n     girls are brought to the hospital only when they are sicker \n     than boys taken to the hospital. All told, girls in India \n     from 1 to 5 years of age are 50 percent more likely to die \n     than boys the same age. The best estimate is that a little \n     Indian girl dies from discrimination every four minutes.\n       A big, bearded Afghan . . . once told us that his wife and \n     son were sick. He wanted both to survive, he said, but his \n     priorities were clear: A son is an indispensable treasure, \n     while a wife is replaceable. He had purchased medication for \n     the boy alone. ``She is always sick,'' he gruffly said of his \n     wife, ``so it's not worth buying medicine for her.''\n\n  Again, why is this relevant to the matter at hand? I think these \nyoung girls and women in our own country and across the world deserve \nto be treated seriously. They deserve not to be treated as a political \nfootball on extraneous issues this Chamber likes to debate.\n  This bill needs to be treated just as seriously--and my safe harbor \nbill--as any other bill. Somehow, the people in charge of these \ninstitutions have been able to work out the differences.\n\n       Modernization and technology can aggravate the \n     discrimination. Since the 1990s, the spread of ultrasound \n     machines has allowed pregnant women to find out the sex of \n     their fetuses--and then get abortions if they are female.\n\n  Again, we are talking about China.\n  ``We don't have to have daughters anymore!'' someone said in China.\n\n       To prevent sex-selective abortion, China and India now bar \n     doctors and ultrasound technicians from telling a pregnant \n     woman the sex of her fetus. Yet that is a flawed solution.\n\n  According to the book:\n\n       Research shows that when parents are banned from \n     selectively aborting female fetuses, more of their daughters \n     die as infants. Mothers do not deliberately dispatch infant \n     girls they are obligated to give birth to, but they are \n     lackadaisical about caring for them. A development economist \n     at Brown University . . . quantified the wrenching trade-off: \n     On average, the deaths of fifteen infant girls can be avoided \n     by allowing 100 female fetuses to [die].\n\n  This is what is going on around the world right now.\n\n       The global statistics on the abuse of girls are numbing. It \n     appears that more girls have been killed in the last fifty \n     years, precisely because they were girls, than men were \n     killed in all the battles of the twentieth century. More \n     girls are killed in this routine ``gendercide'' in any one \n     decade than people were slaughtered in all the genocides of \n     the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, the central \n     moral challenge was slavery. In the twentieth century, it was \n     the battle against totalitarianism. We believe that in this \n     century the paramount moral challenge will be the struggle \n     for gender equality around the world.\n\n  That will be the struggle to help these girls.\n  Maybe this is the battle we are having right now. Maybe this \ninstitution has to come up to speed. We have 20 Senators who are women. \nTwenty percent of the Senate are women. That is pretty good. It is the \nbest we have ever gotten. But when you look at the numbers, the numbers \naren't frequent when you look back through history. Maybe that is what \nwe are going to have to do to have people take these bills seriously \nand not play king of the hill with a bill as serious as this one.\n  I will continue to read ``Half the Sky'' by Nicholas Kristof and \nSheryl WuDunn.\n\n       The owners of the Thai brothel to which Rath was sold did \n     not beat her and did not constantly guard her. So two months \n     later, she was able to escape and make her way back to \n     Cambodia.\n       Upon her return, Rath met a social worker who put her in \n     touch with an aid group that helps girls who have been \n     trafficked start new lives. The group, American Assistance \n     for Cambodia, used $400 in donated funds to buy a small cart \n     and a starter selection of goods so that Rath could become a \n     street peddler. She found a good spot in the open area \n     between the Thai and Cambodian customs offices. . . . \n     Travelers crossing between Thailand and Cambodia walk along \n     this strip, the size of a football field, and it is lined \n     with peddlers selling drinks, snacks and souvenirs.\n       Rath outfitted her cart with shirts and hats, costume \n     jewelry, notebooks, pens and small toys. Now her good looks \n     and outgoing personality began to work in her favor, turning \n     her into an effective saleswoman. She saved and invested in \n     new merchandise, her business thrived, and she was able to \n     support her parents and two younger sisters. She married and \n     had a son, and she began saving for his education.\n       In 2008, Rath turned her cart into a stall, and then also \n     acquired the stall next door. She also started a ``public \n     phone'' business by charging people to use her cell phone. So \n     if you ever cross from Thailand into Cambodia at Poipet, look \n     for a shop on your left, halfway down the strip, where a \n     teenage girl will call out to you, smile, and try to sell you \n     a souvenir cap. She'll laugh and claim she's giving you a \n     special price, and she's so bubbly and appealing she'll \n     probably make the sale.\n       Rath's eventual triumph--\n\n  If you remember from the first part of the book that I read, she was \nsold into slavery when she simply thought she was going to work as a \ndishwasher; she was sold into sex and repeatedly raped--\n\n     is a reminder that if girls get a chance, in the form of an \n     education or a microloan, they can be more than baubles or \n     slaves; many of them can run businesses. Talk to Rath today--\n     after you've purchased that cap--and you'll find that she \n     exudes confidence as she earns a solid income that will \n     provide a better future for her sisters and for her young \n     son.\n       Many of the stories in this book are wrenching, but keep in \n     mind this central truth: Women aren't the problem but the \n     solution. The plight of girls is no more a tragedy than an \n     opportunity.\n\n  I will repeat that:\n\n       Women aren't the problem but the solution. The plight of \n     girls is no more a tragedy than an opportunity.\n       That was a lesson we absorbed in Sheryl's ancestral \n     village, at the end of a dirt road amid the rice paddies of \n     southern China. For many years we have regularly trod the mud \n     paths of the Taishan region to . . . the hamlet in which \n     Sheryl's paternal grandfather grew up. China traditionally \n     has been one of the most oppressive and smothering places for \n     girls, and we could see hints of this in Sheryl's own family \n     history. Indeed, on our first visit, we accidentally \n     uncovered a family secret: a long-lost stepgrandmother. \n     Sheryl's grandfather had traveled to America with his first \n     wife, but she had given birth only to daughters. So Sheryl's \n     grandfather gave up on her and returned her to Shunshui, \n     where he married a younger woman as a second wife and took \n     her to America. This was Sheryl's grandmother, who duly gave \n     birth to a son--Sheryl's dad. The previous wife and daughters \n     were then wiped out of the family memory.\n       Something bothered us each time we explored [the town] and \n     the surrounding villages: Where were the young women?\n\n  This is, by the way, what Senator McCain said when he returned from a \ncountry that was repressed.\n\n       Young men were toiling industriously in the paddies or \n     fanning themselves in the shade, but young women and girls \n     were scarce. We finally discovered them and we stopped in the \n     factories that were then spreading throughout the [Guangdong] \n     Province, the epicenter of China's economic eruption. These \n     factories produced the shoes, toys, and shirts that filled \n     America's shopping malls, generating economic growth rates \n     almost unprecedented in the history of the world--and \n     creating the most effective antipoverty program ever \n     recorded. The factories turned out to be cacophonous hives of \n     distaff bees.\n       Eighty percent of the employees on the assembly lines in \n     coastal China are female, and the proportion across the \n     manufacturing belt of East Asia is at least 70 percent. The \n     economic explosion in Asia was, in large part, an outgrowth \n     of the economic empowerment of women. ``They have small \n     fingers, so they're better at stitching,'' the manager of a \n     purse factory explained to us. ``They're obedient and work \n     harder than men,'' said the head of a toy factory. ``And we \n     can pay them less.'' Women are indeed the linchpin of the \n     region's development strategy.\n       Economists who scrutinized East Asia's success noted a \n     common pattern. These countries took young women who \n     previously had contributed negligibly to the gross national \n     product and injected them into the formal economy, hugely \n     increasing the labor force. The basic formula was to ease \n     repression, educate girls as well as boys, give the girls the \n     freedom to move to the cities and take factory jobs, and then \n     benefit from a demographic dividend as they delayed marriage \n     and reduced childbearing. The women meanwhile financed the \n     education of younger relatives, and saved enough of their pay \n     to boost national savings rates. This pattern has been ``the \n     girl effect.'' In a nod to the female chromosomes, it could \n     also be called ``the double X solution.''\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\n       Evidence has mounted that helping women can be a successful \n     poverty-fighting strategy anywhere in the world, not just in \n     the booming economies of East Asia. The Self Employed Women's \n     Association was founded in India in 1972 and ever since has \n     supported the poorest women in starting businesses--raising \n     living standards in ways that have dazzled scholars and \n     foundations. In Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus developed \n     microfinance at the Grameen Bank and targeted women \n     borrowers--eventually winning a Nobel Peace Prize for the \n     economic and social impact of his work.\n\n  I would note here--just a little sidenote, as I am reading through \nNicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book, to make everyone in this \nChamber remember why we are here. We are here to help girls, not just \nin the United States, but in the world. We are here to hold up ``Half \nthe Sky.'' We are here to show that this Chamber, at its best, can \nactually help the people we are supposed to help, the most vulnerable \nin our society, instead of debating extraneous issues that we are \nunable to resolve on this bill but that we seem able to resolve on \nother bills that just must be more important than the girls and the \nwomen of this world. That is all I can figure out.\n  But I would like to note, as I read about one of their suggestions \nfor things that help girls and women around the world, this idea of \nmicrocredit. My dad, who is kind of an adventurer and goes around the \nworld, actually wrote a book on microcredit called ``The Miracles of \nBarefoot Capitalism''--in case he is watching on C-Span, I thought he \nwould like that note--with his wife Susan Wilkes. They are big \nbelievers in helping women around the world with microcredit.\n  So then they go on in the book to talk about helping people through \nmicrocredit.\n\n       In the early 1990s, the United Nations and the World Bank \n     began to appreciate the potential resource that women and \n     girls represent. Investment in girls' education may well be \n     the highest return investment available in the developing \n     world.\n\n  I think it is something that we need to remember in the United States \nas we look at the low numbers of girls that go into science and \ntechnology and head up companies, because for some reason they do not \nhave the confidence to go into those fields or they are not encouraged \nto go into those fields. If we in the Senate cannot even say they \nshould not be trafficked and we cannot do anything to help them, I do \nnot think we are helping that cause very much.\n  Larry Summers wrote, when he was the chief economist of the World \nBank: ``The question is not whether countries can afford this \ninvestment, but whether countries can afford not to educate more \ngirls.''\n\n       In 2001, the World Bank produced an influential study, \n     Engendering Development Through Gender Equality in Rights, \n     Resources, and Voice, arguing that promoting gender equality \n     is crucial to combat global poverty. UNICEF issued a major \n     report arguing that gender equality yields a ``double \n     dividend'' by elevating not only women but also their \n     children and communities. The United Nation Development \n     Programme (UNDP) summed up the mounting research this way: \n     ``Women's empowerment helps raise economic productivity and \n     reduce infant mortality. It contributes to improved health \n     and nutrition. It increases the chances of education for the \n     next generation.''\n       More and more, the most influential scholars of development \n     and public health--including Sen and Summers, Joseph \n     Stiglitz, Jeffrey Sachs, and Dr. Paul Farmer--are calling for \n     much greater attention to women and development.\n       Private aid groups and foundations have shifted gears as \n     well. ``Women are the key to ending hunger in Africa,'' \n     declared the Hunger Project. French foreign minister Bernard \n     Kouchner, who founded Doctors Without Borders, bluntly \n     declared of development: ``Progress is achieved through \n     women.'' The Center for Global Development issued a major \n     report explaining ``why and how to put girls at the center of \n     development.'' CARE is taking women and girls as the \n     centerpiece of its antipoverty efforts. The Nike Foundation \n     and the NoVo Foundation are both focusing on building \n     opportunities for girls in the developing world. ``Gender \n     inequality hurts economic growth,'' Goldman Sachs concluded \n     in a 2008 research report that emphasized how much developing \n     countries could improve their economic performance by \n     educating girls. Partly as a result of that research, Goldman \n     Sachs committed $100 million to a ``10,000Women'' campaign \n     meant to give that many women a business education.\n\n  I think this is actually a really good book. I just plan to keep \nreading it whenever I can over the next few days until we get a \nresolution to this problem.\n  I am going to take a look at how many pages it is. Well, if you \ninclude the notes, it is 296 pages. I will obviously take breaks when \nour colleagues come down here. But I do think it is really important \nthat we keep the pressure on, that the women and girls of this country \ndemand that this get resolved, because as I said, we have somehow been \nable to resolve it on other bills. I think this bill and the bill that \nI have, the safe harbor bill, are just as important. I think our \ncolleagues, in my discussions with them, know several ways we could \nresolve this problem, including just eliminating this extraneous \nprovision. But there might be other ways as well. We know what they \nare. I hope they keep working on them.\n\n       Concerns about terrorism after the 9/11 attacks triggered \n     interest in these issues as an unlikely constituency: the \n     military and counterterrorism agencies. Some security experts \n     noted that the countries that nurture terrorists are \n     disproportionately those where woman are marginalized. The \n     reason that there are so many Muslim terrorists, they argued, \n     has little to do with the Koran but a great deal to do with \n     the lack of robust female participation in the economy and \n     society of many Islamic countries. As the Pentagon gained a \n     deeper understanding of counterterrorism . . . it became \n     increasingly interested in grassroots projects such as girls' \n     education. Empowering girls, some in the military argued, \n     would disempower terrorists. When the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     hold discussions of girls' education in Pakistan and \n     Afghanistan . . . you know that gender is a serious topic on \n     the international affairs agenda. That's evident also in the \n     Council on Foreign Relations. The wood-paneled halls that \n     have been used for discussions of MIRV warheads . . . are now \n     employed as well to host well-attended sessions on maternal \n     mortality.\n\n  This is now Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn speaking in their \nbook, which has been a national best seller, ``Half the Sky.'' It is \nabout sex trafficking and how important it is to take this issue on--\nnot just in our own country but the world.\n\n       We will try to lay out an agenda for the world's women \n     focusing on three particular abuses: sex trafficking and \n     forced prostitution; gender-based violence, including honor \n     killings and mass rape; and maternal mortality, which still \n     needlessly claims one woman a minute. We will lay out \n     solutions such as girls' education and microfinance, which \n     are working right now.\n       While the most urgent needs are in the developing world, \n     wealthy countries also need to clear up their own \n     neighborhoods. If we are to lead the way we must show greater \n     resolution in cracking down on domestic violence and sex \n     trafficking in our own neighborhoods, rather than just \n     sputter about abuses far away.\n       It is true that there are many injustices in the world, \n     many worthy causes competing for attention and support, and \n     we all have divided allegiances.\n\n  This sounds kind of like us, right? There are a lot of different \ntopics and things that we have to take on, and there are many worthy \ncauses that are calling for our attention and support. We all have \ndivided allegiances. I think that is kind of what is going on in this \nChamber. But why do we need to focus on this? Well, I will go back to \nthe book.\n\n       We focus on this topic because, to us, this kind of \n     oppression feels transcendent--and so does the opportunity. \n     We have seen that outsiders can truly make a significant \n     difference.\n       Consider Rath once more.\n  Now, remember, this was the girl that was sold into sex trafficking \nin Malaysia.\n\n       We had been so shaken by her story that we wanted to locate \n     that brothel in Malaysia, interview its owners, and try to \n     free the girls still imprisoned there. Unfortunately, we \n     could not determine the brothel's name or address. (Rath \n     didn't know English or even the Roman alphabet, so she hadn't \n     been able to read signs when she was there.) When we asked \n     her if she would be willing to return to Kuala Lumpur and \n     help us find the brothel, she turned ashen. ``I don't know,'' \n     she said. ``I don't want to face that again.'' She wavered, \n     talked it over with her family, and ultimately agreed to go \n     back in the hope of rescuing her girlfriends.\n       Rath voyaged back to Kuala Lumpur with the protection of an \n     interpreter and a local antitrafficking activist. \n     Nonetheless, she trembled in the red light district upon \n     seeing the cheerful neon signs that she associated with so \n     much pain. But since her escape, Malaysia has been \n     embarrassed by public criticism about trafficking, so the \n     police had cracked down on the worst brothels that imprisoned \n     girls against their will. One of those was Rath's. A modest \n     amount of international scolding had led a government to take \n     action, resulting in an observable improvement in the lives \n     of girls at the bottom\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\n     of the power pyramid. The outcome underscores that this is a \n     hopeful cause, not a bleak one.\n       Honor killings, sexual slavery, and genital cutting may \n     seem to Western readers to be tragic but inevitable in a \n     world far, far away. In much the same way, slavery was once \n     widely viewed by many decent Europeans and Americans as a \n     regrettable but ineluctable feature of human life. It was \n     just one more horror that has existed for thousands of years. \n     But then in the 1780s a few indignant Britons, led by William \n     Wilberforce, decided that slavery was so offensive that they \n     had to abolish it. And they did. Today, we see the seed of \n     something similar, a global movement to emancipate women and \n     girls.\n\n  By the way, later in the book--since I have read it already, but now \nI will be able to read it again--they talk about how, in fact, it was \nthe evidence of that brutality of the slavery, of the stench of the \npeople who were slaves who were in the bottom of that ship that really \ndrove action. Yes, the activists and William Wilberforce understandably \nget a lot of the attention and well-deserved credit for what happened, \nbut it was the evidence that led to Britain, the people and their \nsociety, long before many other countries had even thought about \nabolishing slavery--it was the evidence of the brutality that led them \nto make a change.\n  That is one of the things that we need to talk about and why I am \ntalking about this here today. We have to get back on what really \nmatters here, such as the story of the 12-year-old girl in Rochester, \nMN--a 12-year-old girl who just got a text message and went to a \nMcDonald's parking lot and was shoved into a car and then brought to \nthe Twin Cities and then raped. Then her pictures were taken--sexually \nexplicit pictures--and put on Craigslist. Then she was sold the next \nday and raped by two men.\n  That is what this is really about. It is not about these extraneous \nfights and what has been going on, dragging this Chamber down, and even \nstopping us from confirming a well-qualified person for the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. That is what they are talking about here. \nIt is the evidence that the American people see. They start demanding \nchange. I hope that is happening today.\n\n       So let's be clear about this up front. We hope to recruit \n     you to join--\n\n  These are the authors.\n\n     --an incipient movement to emancipate women and fight global \n     poverty by unlocking women's power as economic catalysts. \n     That is the process underway--not a drama of victimization \n     but of empowerment, the kind that transforms bubbly teenage \n     girls from brothel slaves into successful businesswomen.\n       This is a story of transformation. It has change that is \n     already taking place, and change that can accelerate if you \n     will just open your heart and join in.\n\n  I think we need some opening of hearts here in the Chamber. I am \ngoing to take one break to talk to our staff, and then I will be back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am reading the book ``Half the Sky,'' \nby Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. I think it is a beautiful \nbook. It is on sex trafficking around the world and what has been \nhappening around the world. A part of this is that I think we need to \nmake the point that we can lead in our country when it comes to sex \ntrafficking.\n  We have Senator Cornyn's bill, and we know there is an issue with one \nof the provisions that needs to be resolved--and I don't think it is a \nprovision that is related to this topic--but we are hopeful people of \ngood will can come together and resolve this issue. The easiest way \nwould be to take it out. We can have other discussions. Somehow, \nthrough history, the Senate has been able to come together and take \ncare of this issue with the Hyde amendment and other bills.\n  I think the point I am trying to make today is this bill is just as \nimportant as those bills and that these girls who are victims of sex \ntrafficking are just as important as anyone else in this country.\n  I am going to continue reading this book. I am hopeful--as I \nmentioned, it is very long, and I will obviously pause for my \ncolleagues who come to the floor, but I am going to continue reading it \nuntil we get this resolved.\n  We are now on chapter 1, ``Emancipating Twenty-First-Century \nSlaves.'' The quote on this is actually from Christopher Buckley, one \nof my favorite authors, from ``Florence of Arabia,'' from the beginning \nof the chapter: ``Women might just have something to contribute to \ncivilization other than their vaginas.''\n  That might not have been said on this floor that many times, but he \nis a humorous writer. Now, let's go on with the book:\n\n       The red-light district in the town of Forbesgunge does not \n     actually have any red lights. Indeed, there is no \n     electricity. The brothels are simply mud-walled family \n     compounds along a dirt path, with thatch-roof shacks set \n     aside for customers.\n       Children play and scurry along the dirt paths, and a one-\n     room shop on the corner sells cooking oil, rice, and bits of \n     candy. Here, in the impoverished northern Indian state of \n     Bihar near the Nepalese border, there's not much else \n     available commercially--except sex.\n       As Meena Hasina walks down the path, the children pause and \n     stare at her. The adults stop as well, some glowering and the \n     tension rises. Meena is a lovely, dark-skinned Indian woman \n     in her thirties with warm, crinkly eyes and a stud in her \n     left nostril. She wears a sari and ties her black hair back, \n     and she seems utterly relaxed as she strolls among people who \n     despise her.\n       Meena is an Indian Muslim who for years was prostituted in \n     a brothel run by the Nutt, a low-caste tribe that controls \n     the local sex trade. The Nutt have traditionally engaged in \n     prostitution and petty crime, and theirs is the world of \n     intergenerational prostitution, in which mothers sell sex and \n     raise their daughters to do the same.\n       Meena strolls through the brothels to a larger hut that \n     functions as a part-time school, sits down, and makes herself \n     comfortable. Behind her, the villagers gradually resume their \n     activities.\n       ``I was eight or nine years old when I was kidnapped and \n     trafficked,'' Meena begins. She is from a poor family on the \n     Nepal border and was sold to a Nutt clan, then taken to a \n     rural house where the brothel owner kept prepubescent girls \n     until they were mature enough to attract customers. When she \n     was twelve--she remembers that it was five months before her \n     first period--she was taken to the brothel.\n       ``They brought in the first client, and they'd taken lots \n     of money from him,'' Meena recounted, speaking clinically and \n     without emotion. The induction was similar to that endured by \n     Rath in Malaysia, for sex trafficking operates on the same \n     business model worldwide, and the same methods are used to \n     break girls everywhere. ``I started fighting and crying out, \n     so that he couldn't succeed,'' Meena said. ``I resisted so \n     much that they had to return the money to him. And they beat \n     me mercilessly, with a belt, with sticks, with iron rods. The \n     beating was tremendous.'' She shook her head to clear the \n     memory. ``But even then I resisted. They showed me swords and \n     said they would kill me if I didn't agree. Four or five \n     times, they brought customers in, and I still resisted, and \n     they kept beating me. Finally they drugged me: They gave me \n     wine in my drink and got me completely drunk.'' Then one of \n     the brothel owners raped her. She awoke, hungover and \n     hurting, and realized what had happened. ``Now I am wasted,'' \n     she thought, and so she gave in and stopped fighting \n     customers.\n       In Meena's brothel, the tyrant was a family matriarch, \n     Ainul Bibi. Sometimes Ainul would beat the girls herself, and \n     sometimes she would delegate the task to her daughter-in-law \n     or her sons, who were brutal in inflicting punishment.\n       ``I wasn't even allowed to cry,'' Meena remembers. ``If \n     even one tear fell, they would beat me. I used to think that \n     it was better to die than to live like this. Once I jumped \n     from the balcony, but nothing happened. I didn't even break a \n     leg.''\n       Meena and the others girls were never allowed out of the \n     brothel and were never paid. They typically had ten or more \n     customers a day, seven days a week. If a girl fell asleep or \n     complained about a stomachache, the issue was resolved with a \n     beating. And when a girl showed any hint of resistance, all \n     the girls would be summoned to watch as the recalcitrant one \n     was tied up and savagely beaten.\n       ``They turned the stereo up loud to cover the screams,'' \n     Meena said dryly.\n       India almost certainly has more modern slaves, in \n     conditions like these, than any other country. There are 2 to \n     3 million prostitutes in India, and although many of them now \n     sell sex to some degree willingly, and are paid, a \n     significant share of them entered the sex industry \n     unwillingly. One 2008 study of Indian brothels found that of \n     Indian and Nepali prostitutes who started as teenagers, about \n     half said they had been coerced into the brothels; women who \n     began working in their twenties were more likely to have made \n     the choice themselves, often to feed their children. Those \n     who start out enslaved often accept their fate eventually and \n     sell sex willingly, because they know nothing else and are \n     too stigmatized to hold other jobs.\n\n[[Page S1606]]\n\n       China has more prostitutes than India--some estimates are \n     as high as 10 million or more--but fewer of them are forced \n     into brothels against their will. Indeed, China has few \n     brothels as such. Many of the prostitutes are freelancers \n     working as ding-dong xiaojie (so called because they ring \n     hotel rooms looking for business), and even those working in \n     massage parlors and saunas are typically there on commission \n     and can leave if they want to.\n       Paradoxically, it is the countries with the most \n     straightlaced and sexually conservative societies, such as \n     India, Pakistan, and Iran, that have disproportionately large \n     numbers of forced prostitutes. Since young men in those \n     societies rarely sleep with their girlfriends, it has become \n     acceptable for them to relieve their sexual frustrations with \n     prostitutes.\n       The implicit social contract is that upper-class girls will \n     keep their virtue, while young men will find satisfaction in \n     the brothels. And the brothels will be staffed with slave \n     girls trafficked from Nepal or Bangladesh or poor Indian \n     villages. As long as the girls are uneducated, low-caste \n     peasants like Meena, society will look the other way--just as \n     many antebellum Americans turned away from the horrors of \n     slavery because the people being lashed looked different from \n     them.\n       In Meena's brothel, no one used condoms. Meena is healthy \n     for now, but she has never had an AIDS test. (While HIV \n     prevalence is low in India, prostitutes are at particular \n     risk because of their large number of customers.) Because \n     Meena didn't use condoms, she became pregnant, and this \n     filled her with despair.\n       ``I used to think that I never wanted to be a mother, \n     because my life had been wasted, and I didn't want to waste \n     another life,'' Meena said. But Ainul's brothel, like many in \n     India, welcomed the pregnancy as a chance to breed a new \n     generation of victims. Girls are raised to be prostitutes, \n     and boys become servants to do the laundry and cooking.\n       In the brothel, without medical help, Meena gave birth to a \n     baby girl, whom she named Naina. But soon afterward, Ainul \n     took the baby away from Meena, partly to stop her from \n     breast-feeding--customers dislike prostitutes who are \n     lactating--and partly to keep the baby as a hostage to \n     ensure that Meena would not try to flee.\n       ``We will not let Naina stay with you,'' Ainul told her. \n     ``You are a prostitute, and you have no honor. So you might \n     run away.'' Later a son, Vivek, followed, and the owners also \n     took him away. So both of Meena's children were raised by \n     others in the brothel, mostly in sections of the compound \n     where she was not allowed to go.\n       ``They held my children captive, so they thought I would \n     never try to escape,'' she said. To some degree, this \n     strategy worked. Meena once helped thirteen of the girls \n     escape, but didn't flee herself because she couldn't bear to \n     leave her children. The penalty for staying behind was a \n     brutal beating for complicity in the escape.\n       Ainul had herself been a prostitute when she was young, so \n     she was unsympathetic to the younger girls. ``If my own \n     daughters can be prostituted, then you can be, too,'' Ainul \n     would tell the girls. And it was true that she had \n     prostituted her own two daughters. (``They had to be beaten \n     up to agree to it,'' Meena explained. ``No one wants to go \n     into this.'')\n\n  That is a good place to stop and talk a little about what we are \ndoing on the floor. No one wants to go into this. That is what these \nbills are about. These bills are about having a victims fund. These \nbills are about creating a safe harbor so we don't treat these young \nvictims as criminals, like we have in Minnesota with the safe harbor \nlaw. And it is about trying to get something done.\n  We know an extraneous provision is on this bill and that we need to \nresolve this one way or another. As I have noted, we have been able to \nresolve this in the past, and I welcome my colleagues to come and speak \nabout this issue. I hope this blame game is behind us, and that we \nwon't be making accusations but instead we will actually work on \ngetting this bill done. Because lost in all of this is the fact this \nisn't just some game people can play. These are actual young girls.\n  As I said, why is this international prostitution relevant to what we \nare talking about? It is relevant because our country can actually \nbecome a leader in this area. We can be a leader. We can actually do \nsomething in America to show we are taking this on. Our bill, the safe \nharbor bill I am leading, which we hope will be the first amendment to \nthis bill, sets up a national sex trafficking strategy. We don't have \none right now.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know when we work between Federal and State \nand local authorities, and we take on these cases and do it in a smart \nway, we actually are able to get things done. We did it with the \nViolence Against Women Act, when everyone thought that was just a \nsituation where you can beat your wife and no one is going to notice. \nIt happened behind closed doors. But we took it on as a country and we \nchanged things and changed things for women in this country. Now we can \ndo this with prostitution.\n  We can no longer see this as a victimless crime. There is a victim. \nThe victim is 12 years old. She is someone in your State right now. So \nthat is why these bills are so serious and why we need to continue to \nget them done. I am going to keep talking about this issue because I \nthink at some point we have to realize why we are here and what we are \ntalking about, instead of using it as a political football.\n  So the story goes on:\n\n       Meena estimates that in the dozen years she was in the \n     brothel, she was beaten on average five days a week. Most \n     girls were quickly broken and cowed, but Meena never quite \n     gave in. Her distinguishing characteristic is obstinacy. She \n     can be dogged and mulish, and that is one reason the \n     villagers find her so unpleasant. She breaches the pattern of \n     femininity in rural India by talking back--and fighting back.\n       The police seemed unlikely saviors to girls in the brothels \n     because police officers regularly visited the brothels and \n     were serviced free. But Meena was so desperate that she once \n     slipped out and went to the police station to demand help.\n       ``I was forced into prostitution by a brothel in town,'' \n     Meena told the astonished officer at the police station. \n     ``The pimps beat me up, and they're holding my children \n     hostage.'' Other policemen came out to see this unusual \n     sight, and they mocked her and told her to go back.\n       ``You have great audacity to come here!'' one policeman \n     scolded her. In the end, the police sent her back after \n     extracting a promise from the brothel not to beat her. The \n     brothel owners did not immediately punish her. But a friendly \n     neighbor warned Meena that the brothel owners had decided to \n     murder her. That doesn't happen often in red-light districts, \n     any more than farmers kill producing assets such as good milk \n     cows, but from time to time a prostitute becomes so \n     nettlesome that the owners kill her as a warning to the other \n     girls.\n       Fearing for her life, Meena abandoned her children and fled \n     the brothel. She traveled several hours by train to \n     Forbesgunge. Someone there told one of Ainul's sons, Manooj, \n     of her whereabouts, and he soon arrived to beat up Meena. \n     Manooj didn't want her causing trouble in his brothel again, \n     so he told her that she could live on her own in Forbesgunge \n     and prostitute herself, but she would have to give him the \n     money. Not knowing how she could survive otherwise, Meena \n     agreed.\n       Whenever Manooj returned to Forbesgunge to collect money, \n     he was dissatisfied with the amount Meena gave him and beat \n     her. Once Manooj threw Meena to the ground and was beating \n     her furiously with a belt when a respectful local man \n     intervened.\n       ``You're already pimping her, you're already taking her \n     lifeblood,'' remonstrated her saviour, a pharmacist named \n     Kuduz. ``Why beat her to death as well?''\n       It wasn't the same as leaping on Manooj to pull him off, \n     but for a woman like Meena, who was scorned by society, it \n     was startling to have anyone speak up for her.\n\n  To have anyone speak up for her. That is what I hope we are going to \nbe doing in this Chamber in the next few days, that we are going to \nspeak up for these victims and show that we want to actually get \nsomething done and that they have value outside of being a political \nfootball.\n\n       Manooj backed off, and Kuduz helped her up. Meena and Kuduz \n     lived near each other in Forbesgunge, and the incident \n     created a bond between them. Soon Kuduz and Meena were \n     chatting regularly, and then he offered to marry her. \n     Thrilled, she accepted.\n       Manooj was furious when he heard about the marriage, and he \n     offered Kuduz 100,000 rupees ($2,500) to give Meena up--a sum \n     that perhaps reflected his concern that she might use her new \n     respectability as a married woman to cause trouble for the \n     brothel. Kuduz wasn't interested in a deal.\n       ``Even if you offered me two hundred fifty thousand rupees, \n     I will not give her up,'' Kuduz said. ``Love has no price.''\n       After they were married, Meena bore two daughters with \n     Kuduz, and she went back to her native village to look for \n     her parents. Her mother had died--neighbors said she had \n     cried constantly after Meena disappeared, then had gone mad--\n     but her father was stunned and thrilled to see his daughter \n     resurrected.\n       Life was clearly better, but Meena couldn't forget her \n     first two children left behind in the brothel. So she began \n     making journeys back--five hours by bus--to Ainul Bibi's \n     brothel. There she would stand outside and plead for Naina \n     and Vivek.\n       ``As many times as I could, I would go back to fight for my \n     children,'' she remembered. ``I knew they would not let me \n     take my children. I knew they would beat me up. But I thought \n     I had to keep trying.''\n       It didn't work. Ainul and Manooj didn't let Meena in the \n     brothel; they whipped her and\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\n     drove her away. The police wouldn't listen to her. The \n     brothel owners not only threatened to kill her, they also \n     threatened to kidnap her two young daughters with Kuduz and \n     sell them to a brothel. Once a couple of gangsters showed up \n     at Meena's house in Forbesgunge to steal the two little \n     girls, but Kuduz grabbed a knife and warned: ``If you even \n     try to steal them, I'll cut you into pieces.''\n       Meena was terrified for her two younger girls, but she \n     couldn't forget Naina. She knew that Naina was approaching \n     puberty and would soon be on the market. But what could she \n     do?\n\n  So these stories are pretty raw, and they are stories we usually \ndon't tell on the floor of the United States Senate. But I think we \nneed to, because maybe it is the only way people will remember why we \nare here and what we are supposed to be doing right now, which is to \nget these bills done and then hopefully confirm an Attorney General of \nthe United States, which is something else we need to do that seems \ncompletely unrelated to these sex trafficking stories of these girls, \nexcept for one reason, and that is that we would want to have an \nattorney general in place so they can enforce the law.\n  Some of these cases are actually Federal, such as the one we had in \nMinnesota involving the little girl from Rochester, or the case in \nSenator Heitkamp's State of North Dakota involving the incident of a \nsex trafficking ring in the oil patch. This is going on right now in \nthis country. So what could an Attorney General do? I would ask: What \ncan we do? What we can do is to get this bill done.\n  Again, I welcome my colleagues to come and talk about this issue, but \nI hope when they talk about it we will actually focus on the matter at \nhand--not blame anyone anymore, not talk about the things we disagree \non but what we agree on. And then, hopefully, that will lead to the \ndiscussions I know are going on to resolve this bill because we can get \nthis resolved.\n  Continuing to read, this is the writers talking now:\n\n       Interviewing women like Meena over the years has led us to \n     change our own views on sex trafficking. Growing up in the \n     United States and then living in China and Japan, we thought \n     of prostitution as something women may turn to \n     opportunistically or out of economic desperation. In Hong \n     Kong, we knew an Australian prostitute who slipped Sheryl \n     into the locker room of her ``men's club'' to meet the local \n     girls, who were there because they saw a chance to enrich \n     themselves. We certainly didn't think of prostitutes as \n     slaves, forced to do what they do, for most prostitutes in \n     America, China, and Japan aren't truly enslaved.\n       Yet it's hyperbole to say that millions of women and girls \n     are actually enslaved today. (The biggest difference from \n     nineteenth-century slavery is that many die of AIDS by their \n     late twenties.) The term that is usually used for this \n     phenomenon, ``sex trafficking,'' is a misnomer. The problem \n     isn't sex, nor is it prostitution as such. In many \n     countries--China, Brazil, and most of sub-Saharan Africa--\n     prostitution is widespread but mostly voluntary (in the sense \n     it is driven by economic pressure rather than physical \n     compulsion). In those places, brothels do not lock up women, \n     and many women work on their own without pimps or brothels. \n     Nor is the problem exactly ``trafficking'' since forced \n     prostitution doesn't always depend on a girl's being \n     transported over a great distance by a middleman.\n\n  The story I told, by the way, of the girl in Rochester, she just went \nabout an hour-and-a-half drive. So this idea the trafficking is just \nabout going from one nation to another or being in the hold of a boat \nor something like that is not necessarily always the case. So we use \nthe words sex trafficking because people have to understand this is \nmore than just one pimp and one prostitute, that these are usually \nrings and these girls are usually brought someplace where they do not \nwant to be. But it doesn't necessarily mean they are brought long \ndistances.\n  So when we talk about the bills on the floor, let's remember that, \nand I think this is a good reminder from this book.\n  And, by the way, if I ever mispronounce names or words, my apology to \nthe authors Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. I have to say it is \nkind of small print, and I am trying my best. I know the Presiding \nOfficer has a good command of English and will help me out or correct \nme if I make a mistake.\n\n       The horror of sex trafficking can more properly be labeled \n     slavery.\n       The total number of modern slaves is difficult to estimate. \n     The International Labour Organization, a UN agency, estimates \n     that at any one time there are 12.3 million people engaged in \n     forced labor of all kinds, not just sexual servitude. A UN \n     report estimated that 1 million children in Asia alone are \n     held in conditions indistinguishable from slavery. The \n     Lancet, a prominent medical journal in Britain, calculated \n     that ``1 million children are forced into prostitution every \n     year and the total number of prostituted children could be as \n     high as 10 million.''\n       Antitrafficking campaigners tend to use higher numbers, \n     such as 27 million modern slaves. That figure originated in \n     research by Kevin Bales, who runs a fine organization called \n     Free the Slaves. Numbers are difficult to calculate in part \n     because sex workers can't be divided neatly into categories \n     of those working voluntarily and those working involuntarily. \n     Some commentators look at prostitutes and see only sex \n     slaves; others see only entrepreneurs. But in reality there \n     are some in each category and many other women who inhabit a \n     gray zone between freedom and slavery.\n\n  I will note this number--I have always tried to get the right number \nof how many victims we are talking about--but as I noted at the \nbeginning of my remarks this morning, the 27 million modern slaves \nincludes victims of not just sex trafficking but also labor \ntrafficking.\n  Back to the book.\n\n       An essential part of the brothel business model is to break \n     the spirit of girls through humiliation, rape, threats and \n     violence. We met a 15-year-old Thai girl whose initiation \n     consisted of being forced to eat dog droppings so as to \n     shatter her self-esteem. Once a girl is broken and terrified, \n     all hope of escape squeezed out of her, force may no longer \n     be necessary to control her. She may smile and laugh at \n     passersby, and try to grab them and tug them into the \n     brothel. Many a foreigner would assume that she is there \n     voluntarily, but in that situation complying with the will of \n     the brothel owner does not signify consent.\n       Our own estimate is that there are 3 million women and \n     girls (and a very small number of boys) worldwide who can be \n     fairly termed enslaved in the sex trade. That is a \n     conservative estimate that does not include many others who \n     are manipulated and intimidated into prostitution. Nor does \n     it include millions more who are under eighteen and cannot \n     meaningfully consent to work in brothels. We are talking \n     about 3 million people who in effect are the property of \n     another person and in many cases could be killed by their \n     owner with impunity.\n       Technically, trafficking is often defined as taking someone \n     (by force or deception) across an international border. The \n     U.S. State Department has estimated that between 600,000 and \n     800,000 people are trafficked across international borders \n     each year, 80 percent of them women and girls, mostly for \n     sexual exploitation. Since Meena didn't cross a border, she \n     wasn't trafficked in the traditional sense. That's also true \n     of most people who are enslaved in brothels. As the U.S. \n     State Department notes, its estimate doesn't include \n     ``millions of victims around the world who are trafficked \n     within their own national borders.''\n\n  The bills that we have--the one before us and my bill, the safe \nharbor bill, which we would like to see as the first amendment, which \npassed the Judiciary Committee with 20 votes on a bipartisan basis--\nthese bills are focused on sex trafficking within our own borders, \nalthough some of the victims will be brought in from other countries. \nThis book, ``Half the Sky,'' is so good because it really is about what \nis going on all around the world and all these victims around the \nworld. Every country has their own problems. Despite all of the \npolitical machinations and extraneous provisions and other things, what \nwe are trying to get done today is to do something real to help the \nvictims of sex trafficking through the fund Senator Cornyn has in his \nbill and then in my safe harbor bill, which is also a strong bipartisan \nbill, to make it clear there is a good model we can use across the \ncountry that has been used in 15 States and others, and one dozen more \nare working on them, where Minnesota has been one of the States leading \nthe way to view these girls as victims and not as criminals, when the \naverage age is 12 years old, not even old enough to go to a high school \nprom, not even old enough to drive the car.\n  Again, I welcome my colleagues to come down and talk about this \nissue. I am just going to keep filling in reading this book when no one \nis on the floor. I only hope that when we talk about this bill and this \nissue, we do it with some respect for the victims of these crimes and \nthe respect they deserve.\n\n       Technically, trafficking is often defined as taking someone \n     (by force or deception) across an international border. The \n     U.S. State Department has estimated that between 600,000 and \n     800,000 people are trafficked across international borders \n     each year, 80 percent of them women and girls, mostly for \n     sexual exploitation. Since Meena didn't cross\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\n     a border, she wasn't trafficked in the traditional sense. \n     That's also true of most people who are enslaved in brothels. \n     As the U.S. State Department notes, its estimate doesn't \n     include ``millions of victims around the world who are \n     trafficked within their own national borders.''\n\n  Again, as I have noted, 83 percent of the victims in the United \nStates are from the United States, and I don't think that is what we \nthink of when we first think about sex trafficking, but those are \nfacts.\n\n       In contrast, in the peak decade of the transatlantic slave \n     trade, the 1780s, an average of just under eighty thousand \n     slaves were shipped annually across the Atlantic from Africa \n     to the New World. The average then dropped to a bit more than \n     fifty thousand between 1811 and 1850. In other words, far \n     more women and girls are shipped into brothels each year in \n     the early twenty-first century than African slaves were \n     shipped into slave plantations each year in the eighteenth or \n     nineteenth centuries--although the overall population was of \n     course far smaller then. As the journal Foreign Affairs \n     observed: ``Whatever the exact number is, it seems almost \n     certain that the modern global slave trade is larger in \n     absolute terms than the Atlantic slave trade in the \n     eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was.''\n       As on slave plantations two centuries ago, there are few \n     practical restraints on slave owners. In 1791, North Carolina \n     decreed that killing a slave amounted to ``murder,'' and \n     Georgia later established that killing or maiming a slave was \n     legally the same as killing or maiming a white person. But \n     those doctrines existed more on paper than on plantations, \n     just as Pakistani laws exist in the statute books but don't \n     impede brothel owners who choose to eliminate troublesome \n     girls.\n       While there has been progress in addressing many \n     humanitarian issues in the last few decades, sex slavery has \n     actually worsened. One reason for that is the collapse of \n     Communism in Eastern Europe and Indochina. In Romania and \n     other countries, the immediate result was economic distress, \n     and everywhere criminal gangs arose and filled the power \n     vacuum. Capitalism created new markets for rice and potatoes, \n     but also for female flesh.\n       A second reason for the growth of trafficking is \n     globalization. A generation ago, people stayed at home; now \n     it is easier and cheaper to set out for the city or a distant \n     country. A Nigerian girl whose mother never left her tribal \n     area may now find herself in a brothel in Italy. In rural \n     Moldolva, it is possible to drive from village to village and \n     not find a female between the ages of sixteen and thirty.\n\n  I believe this is one of the countries that Senator McCain visited, \nwhen I talked to him after he came back last Easter, where he simply \ndidn't see the girls. He asked: Where are the girls? And they said: \nWell, the girls--many of them have been sold into sex. So these are \nthings that are happening right now in this world and in our own \ncountry.\n\n       A third reason for the worsening situation is AIDS. Being \n     sold to a brothel was always a hideous fate, but not usually \n     a death sentence. Now it often is. And because of the fear of \n     AIDS, customers prefer younger girls whom they believe are \n     less likely to be infected. In both Asia and Africa, there is \n     also a legend that AIDS can be cured by sex with a virgin, \n     and that has nurtured demand for young girls kidnapped from \n     their villages.\n       These factors explain our emphasis on sex slaves as opposed \n     to other kinds of forced labor. Anybody who has spent time in \n     Indian brothels and also, say, at Indian brick kilns knows \n     that it is better to be enslaved working a kiln. Kiln workers \n     most likely live together with their families, and their work \n     does not expose them to the risk of AIDS, so there's always \n     hope of escape down the road.\n       Inside the brothel, Naina and Vivek were beaten, starved, \n     and abused. They were also confused about their parentage. \n     Naina grew up calling Ainul [the brothel's owner] Grandma, \n     and Ainul's son Vinod, Father. Naina sometimes was told that \n     Vinod's wife, Pinky, was her mother; at other times she was \n     told her mother had died and that Pinky was her stepmother. \n     But when Naina asked to go to school, Vinod refused and \n     described the relationship in blunter terms.\n       ``You must obey me,'' he told Naina, ``because I am your \n     owner.''\n       The neighbors tried to advise the children. ``People used \n     to say that they could not be my real parents, because they \n     tortured me so much,'' Naina recalled. Occasionally, the \n     children heard or even saw Meena coming to the door and \n     calling out to them. Once Meena saw Naina and told her, ``I \n     am your mother.''\n       ``No,'' Naina replied. ``Pinky is my mother.''\n       Vivek remembers Meena's visits as well. ``I used to see her \n     being beaten up and driven away,'' he says. ``They told me \n     that my mother was dead, but the neighbors told me that she \n     was my mother after all, and I saw her coming back to try to \n     fight for me.''\n       Naina and Vivek never went to a day of school, never saw a \n     doctor, and were rarely allowed out. They were assigned \n     chores such as sweeping floors and washing clothes, and they \n     had only rags to wear--and no shoes, for that might encourage \n     them to run away. Then, when Naina was twelve, she was \n     paraded before an older man in a way that left her feeling \n     uncomfortable. ``When I asked `Mother' about the man,'' Naina \n     recalled, ``she beat me up and sent me to bed without \n     dinner.''\n       A couple of days later, ``Mother'' told Naina to bathe and \n     took her to the market, where she bought her nice clothes and \n     a nose ring. ``When I asked her why she was buying me all \n     these things, she started scolding me. She told me that I had \n     to listen to everything the man says. She also told me, `Your \n     father has taken money from the man for you.' I started \n     crying out loudly.''\n       Pinky told Naina to wear the clothes, but the girl threw \n     them away, crying inconsolably. Vivek was only eleven, a \n     short boy with a meek manner. But he had inherited his \n     mother's incomprehension of surrender. So he pleaded with his \n     ``parents'' and his ``grandma'' to let his sister go, or to \n     find a husband for her. Each appeal brought him only another \n     beating--administered with scorn. ``You don't earn any \n     income,'' ``Father'' told him mockingly, ``so how do you \n     think you can look after your sister?''\n       Yet Vivek found the courage to confront his tormenters \n     again and again, begging for his sister's freedom. In a town \n     where police officers, government officials, Hindu priests, \n     and respectable middle-class citizens all averted their eyes \n     from forced prostitution, the only audible voice of \n     conscience belonged to an eleven-year-old boy who was \n     battered each time he spoke up. His outspokenness gained him \n     nothing, though. Vinod and Pinky locked him up, forced Naina \n     into the new clothes, and the girl's career as a prostitute \n     began.\n\n  So I think that is a pretty good place to break for a minute as we \ntalk about ``the only audible voice of conscience belonged to an \neleven-year-old boy.'' I think we have an opportunity in the Senate to \nbe an audible voice of conscience and to move on this bill.\n  When I came to the floor today, my job was to just manage the bill \nfor 4 hours; then I just decided, after being somewhat disgusted by all \nof the anger that I have heard in this Chamber, that maybe I would just \nstart reading from this book. I had no plan to do it. I happened to \nhave it with me because I have used it when I have given speeches. This \nisn't an official filibuster, as I guess we have been asked. I am just \ngoing to keep reading from the book. When my colleagues want to come \ndown, I welcome them. But I only ask them one thing--if maybe they \ncould just focus on the issue at hand and stop all of this vengeance \nand anger, and then maybe we will have an opportunity, if we stop \nthrowing darts, to get this done--and then also to confirm the next \nAttorney General of the United States, which is completely unrelated to \nthis.\n  So let me continue on with this story, as we have an 11-year-old boy \nin the story whose voice was the only voice of conscience.\n\n       ``My `mother' was telling me not to get scared, as he is a \n     nice man,'' Naina remembered. ``Then they locked me inside \n     the room with the man. The man told me to lock the room from \n     the inside. I slapped him. . . . Then that man forced me. He \n     raped me.''\n       Once a customer gave Naina a tip, and she secretly passed \n     on the money to Vivek. They thought that perhaps Vivek could \n     use a phone, a technology that they had no experience with, \n     to track down the mysterious woman who claimed to be their \n     real mother and seek help from her. But when Vivek tried to \n     use the telephone, the brothel owners found out and both \n     children were flogged.\n       Ainul thought that Vivek could be distracted with girls, \n     and so he was told to try to have sex with the prostitutes. \n     He was overwhelmed and intimidated at the thought, and when \n     he balked, Pinky beat him up. Seething and fearful of what \n     would become of his sister, Vivek decided that their only \n     hope would be for him to run away and try to find the person \n     who claimed to be their mother. Somewhere Vivek had heard \n     that the woman's name was Meena and that she lived in \n     Forbesgunge, so he fled to the train station one morning and \n     used Naina's tip to buy a ticket.\n       ``I was trembling because I thought that they would come \n     after me and cut me into pieces,'' he recalled. After \n     arriving in Forbesgunge, he asked directions to the brothel \n     district. He trudged down the road to the red-light area and \n     then asked one passerby after another: Where is Meena? Where \n     does she live?\n       Finally, after a long walk and many missed turns, he knew \n     he was close to her home, and he called out: Meena! Meena! A \n     woman came out of one little home--Vivek's lip quivered as he \n     recounted this part of the story--and looked him over \n     wonderingly. The boy and the woman gazed at each other for a \n     long moment, and then the woman finally said in astonishment: \n     ``Are you Vivek?''\n       The reunion was sublime. It was a blessed few weeks of \n     giddy, unadulterated joy, the first happiness that Vivek had \n     known in his life. Meena is a warm and emotional woman, and \n     Vivek was thrilled to feel a mother's love for the first \n     time. Yet now that Meena\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\n     had news about Naina, her doggedness came to the surface \n     again: She was determined to recover her daughter.\n       ``I gave birth to her, and so I can never forget her,'' \n     Meena said. ``I must fight for her as long as I breathe. \n     Every day without Naina feels like a year.''\n       Meena had noticed that Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an \n     organization that fights sex slavery in India, had opened an \n     office in Forbesgunge. Apne Aap is based in Kolkata, the city \n     formerly known as Calcutta, but its founder--a determined \n     former journalist named Ruchira Gupta--grew up partly in \n     Forbesgunge. Other aid groups are reluctant to work in rural \n     Bihar because of the widespread criminality, but Ruchira knew \n     the area and thought it was worth the risk to open a branch \n     office. One of the first people to drop in was Meena. \n     ``Please, please,'' Meena begged Ruchira, ``help me get my \n     daughter back!''\n       There had never been a police raid on a brothel in Bihar \n     State, as far as anyone knew, but Ruchira decided that this \n     could be the first. While Ainul Bibi's brothel had warm ties \n     with the local police, Ruchira had strong connections with \n     national police officials. And Ruchira can be every bit as \n     intimidating as any brothel owner.\n       So Apne Aap harangued the local police into raiding the \n     brothel to rescue Naina. The police burst in, found Naina, \n     and took her to the police station. But the girl had been so \n     drugged and broken that at the station she looked at Meena \n     and declared numbly: ``I'm not your daughter.'' Meena was \n     shattered.\n       Naina explained later that she had felt alone and \n     terrified, partly because Ainul Bibi had told her that Vivek \n     had died. But after an hour in the police station, Naina \n     began to realize that maybe she could escape the brothel, and \n     she finally whispered, ``Yes, you're my mother.''\n       So Apne Aap whisked Naina off to a hospital in Kolkata, \n     where she was treated for severe injuries and a morphine \n     addiction. The brothel had drugged Naina constantly to render \n     her compliant, and the morphine withdrawal was brutal to \n     watch. In Forbesgunge, life became more difficult and \n     dangerous for Meena and her family. Some of the brothel \n     owners there are related to Ainul and Manooj, and they were \n     furious at Meena. Even those in the Nutt community who didn't \n     like prostitution disapproved of the police raid, and so the \n     townspeople shunned Apne Aap's school and shelter. Meena and \n     her children were stigmatized, and a young man working with \n     Apne Aap was stabbed. Threats were made against Meena's two \n     daughters with Kuduz. Yet Meena was serene as she walked \n     about the streets. She laughed at the idea that she should \n     feel cowed.\n       ``They think that good is bad,'' she scoffed, speaking of \n     the local villagers. ``They may not speak to me, but I know \n     what is right and I will stick to it. I will never accept \n     prostitution of myself or my children as long as I breathe.'' \n     Meena is working as a community organizer in Forbesgunge, \n     trying to discourage parents from prostituting their \n     daughters and urging them to educate their sons and daughters \n     alike. Over time the resentment against her has diminished a \n     bit, but she is still seen as pushy and unfeminine.\n       Apne Aap later started a boarding school in Bihar, partly \n     with donations from American supporters, and Meena's children \n     were placed there. The school has a guard and is a much safer \n     place for them. Naina now studies at that boarding school and \n     hopes to become a teacher, and in particular to help \n     disadvantaged children.\n       One afternoon, Meena was singing to her two young \n     daughters, teaching them a song.\n\n  This is how it went:\n\n     India will not be free,\n     Until its women are free.\n     What about the girls in this country?\n     If girls are insulted and abused and enslaved in this \n           country,\n     Put your hand on your heart and ask,\n     Is this country truly independent?\n\n  The next part of the chapter: ``Fighting Slavery from Seattle.'' This \nis a book, ``Half the Sky,'' by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. It \nis about sex trafficking, and I am reading it, one, because it is a \nreally good book and so people understand the issue, two, so people \nwill refocus on why we have these bills on the floor and work together. \nWe all know some potential ways to resolve this on both sides of the \naisle so we can pass this bill and resolve this Hyde amendment \nprovision which should not be on this bill. But there are ways to \nresolve this, and we know what they are, and then, also, hopefully, \npass my safe harbor bill which was the bill that in addition to Senator \nCornyn's bill passed through our Committee on the Judiciary \nunanimously. Every single person voted for it. It is slated to be the \nfirst amendment vote on this bill, and it establishes safe harbor \nincentives so that other States will do what Minnesota and about 15 \nStates have done, which is not to consider these victims as criminals \nbut to consider them as victims. Then not only do we help these girls \nso they have a chance of turning their lives around but also so that we \nactually make better criminal cases.\n  I know as a former prosecutor, running an office of 400 people for 8 \nyears--seeing some of these major cases come in our doors--the best way \nto make these cases, if you have victims who feel that they are \nprotected, who feel they have another life they can lead, who feel they \ncan do something with their lives between going back to their pimp and \ngoing back to the person who has beaten them up and gotten them hooked \non drugs, is by doing something like that. So those are two worthy \nbills that are on the floor.\n  Again, my colleagues are welcome to come down here and join me. I \nthink it would be nice for a change if people focused on the issue at \nhand instead of a partisan fight that has been going on, because I \nthink this institution is better than what we have seen in the last \nweek.\n  The next part of the chapter: ``Fighting Slavery from Seattle.''\n\n       People always ask how they can help. Given concerns about \n     corruption, waste, and mismanagement, how can one actually \n     help women like Meena and defeat modern slavery? Is there \n     anything an ordinary person can do?\n\n  That is a good question. I finally decided to start reading this book \nbecause I was sick of what was going on here. I think ordinary people \naround the country can do something about sex slavery by supporting \nstrong laws and making sure Congress gets its job done but also doing \nwork on their local and State level.\n  The authors say:\n\n       A starting point is to be brutally realistic about the \n     complexities of achieving change. To be blunt, humanitarians \n     sometimes exaggerate and oversell, eliding pitfalls. They \n     sometimes torture frail data until it yields the demanded \n     ``proof'' of success. Partly this is because the causes are \n     worthy and inspiring; those who study education for girls, \n     for example, naturally believe in it. As we'll see, the \n     result is that the research isn't often conducted with the \n     same rigor as is found in, say, examinations of the \n     effectiveness of toothpaste. Aid groups are also reluctant to \n     acknowledge mistakes, partly because frank discussion of \n     blunders is an impediment in soliciting contributions.\n\n  The reality is that past efforts to assist girls have sometimes \nbackfired. In 1993, Senator Tom Harkin wanted to help Bangladeshi girls \nlaboring in sweatshops, so he introduced legislation that would ban \nimports made by workers under the age of fourteen. Bangladeshi \nfactories promptly fired tens of thousands of young girls, and many of \nthem ended up in brothels and are presumably now dead of AIDS.\n  Again, I am reading from the book ``Half the Sky,'' by Nicholas \nKristof and Sheryl WuDunn, which is a great book about sex trafficking \nin order to refocus this Chamber on what we should be doing, which is \ngetting these bills done and coming up with a way to resolve timeworn \ndisputes which we somehow have been able do with other bills.\n  I am trying to make the case here that these girls, as reflected in \nsome of these stories, are just as important as some of the other work \nthat we do in the Senate and deserve our greatest efforts.\n\n       Yet many forms of assistance--particularly in health and \n     education--have an excellent record. Consider the work of \n     Frank Grijalva, the principal of the Overlake School in \n     Redmond, Washington, a fine private school with 450 students \n     in grades five through twelve. Annual tuition hovers around \n     $22,000, and most of the kids are raised in a sheltered \n     upper-middle class environment. Grijalva was looking for a \n     way to teach his students about how the other half lives.\n       ``It became clear that we, as a very privileged community, \n     needed to be a bigger, more positive force in the world,'' \n     Grijalva recalled. Frank heard about Bernard Krisher, a \n     former Newsweek correspondent who was so appalled by poverty \n     in Cambodia that he formed an aid group, American Assistance \n     for Cambodia. Rescuing girls from brothels is important, \n     Krisher believes, but the best way to save them is to prevent \n     them from being trafficked in the first place--which means \n     keeping them in school. So American Assistance for Cambodia \n     focuses on educating rural children, especially girls. Bernie \n     Krisher's signature program is the Rural School Project. For \n     $13,000, a donor can establish a school in a Cambodian \n     village. The donation is matched by funds from the World Bank \n     and again by the Asian Development Bank.\n       Grijalva had a brainstorm. His students could sponsor a \n     school in Cambodia and use it as a way of emphasizing the \n     importance of public service. Initially the response from \n     students and parents was polite but cautious, but then the \n     attacks of 9/11 took place, and suddenly the community was \n     passionately concerned with the larger world and engaged in \n     this project. The students conducted bake sales, car washes, \n     and talent shows, and also\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\n     educated themselves about Cambodia's history of war and \n     genocide. The school was built in Pailin, a Cambodian town on \n     the Thai border that is notorious for cheap brothels that \n     cater to Thai men.\n       In February 2003, the school construction was completed, \n     and Grijalva led a delegation of nineteen students from \n     Overlake School to Cambodia for the opening. A cynic might \n     say that the money for the visit would have been better spent \n     on building another Cambodian school, but in fact that visit \n     was an essential field trip and a learning opportunity for \n     those American students. They lugged along boxes of school \n     supplies, but as they approached Pailin by car, they realized \n     that Cambodia's needs were greater than they ever could have \n     imagined. The dirt-and-gravel road to Pailin was so deeply \n     rutted that it was barely passable, and they saw a bulldozer \n     overturned beside a crater--it had hit a land mine.\n       When the Americans reached the Cambodian school, they saw a \n     sign declaring it the OVERLAKE SCHOOL in English and Kmer \n     script. At the ribbon cutting, the Americans were welcomed by \n     a sea of excited Cambodians--led by a principal who was \n     missing a leg, a land-mine victim himself. Cambodian men then \n     had an average of only 2.6 years of education, and Cambodian \n     women averaged just 1.7 years, so a new school was \n     appreciated in a way the Americans could barely fathom.\n       The school dedication--and the full week in Cambodia--left \n     an indelible impression on the American students. So Overlake \n     students and parents decided to forge an ongoing relationship \n     with its namesake in Cambodia. The Americans funded an \n     English teacher at the school and arranged for an Internet \n     connection for e-mail. They built a playground and sent \n     books. Then, in 2006, the American school decided to send \n     delegations annually, dispatching students and teachers \n     during spring vacation to teach English and arts to the \n     Cambodian pupils. And in 2007, the group decided to assist a \n     school in Ghana as well, and to send a delegation there.\n\n  ``This project is simply the most meaningful and worthwhile \ninitiative that I have undertaken in my thirty-six years in \neducation,'' Frank Grijalva said. The Overlake School in Cambodia is \nindeed an extraordinary place. A bridge has washed out, so you have to \nwalk across a stream to reach it, but it looks nothing like the \ndilapidated buildings that you see in much of the developing world. \nThere are 270 students, ranging in age from six to fifteen. The English \nteacher is university educated and speaks good English. Most stunning \nof all, when we dropped by, the sixth graders were busy sending e-mails \nfrom their Yahoo accounts--to the kids at Overlake School in America.\n\n       One of those writing an e-mail was Kun Sokkea, a thirteen-\n     year-old girl who would soon be the first in her family ever \n     to graduate from elementary school. Her father had died of \n     AIDS, and her mother was sick with the same disease and \n     needed to be nursed constantly. Kun Sokkea is rail-thin, a \n     bit gangly, with long, stringy black hair. She is reserved, \n     and her shoulders sag with the burdens of poverty.\n       ``My mom encourages me to stay in school, but sometimes I \n     think I should go out and earn money,'' Kun Sokkea explained. \n     ``I have no dad to support Mom, so maybe I should provide for \n     her. In one day, I could earn seventy baht, [a bit more than \n     two dollars] cutting hay or planting corn.''\n       To address these financial pressures, American Assistance \n     for Cambodia started a program called Girls Be Ambitious, \n     which in effect bribes families to keep girls in school. If a \n     girl has perfect attendance in school for one month, her \n     family gets $10. A similar approach has been used very \n     effectively and cheaply to increase education for girls in \n     Mexico and other countries. Kun Sokkea's family is now \n     getting the stipend. For donors who can't afford to fund an \n     entire school, it's a way to fight trafficking at a cost of \n     $120 per year per girl. The approach helps because it is \n     typically girls like Kun Sokkea who end up trafficked. Their \n     families are desperate for money, the girls are poorly \n     educated, and a trafficker promises them a great job selling \n     fruit in a distant city.\n\n  Kun Sokkea showed us her home, a rickety shack built on stilts--to \nguard against flooding and vermin--in a field near the school. The \nhouse has no electricity, and her possessions were in one small bag. \nShe never has to worry about choosing what to wear: She has just one \nshirt, and no shoes other than a pair of flip-flops. Kun Sokkea has \nnever been to a dentist and to a doctor only once, and she gets the \nfamily's drinking water from the nearby creek. That's the same creek in \nwhich Kun Sokkea washes the family clothes (she borrows someone else's \nshirt to wear when she has to wash her own). She shares a mattress on \nthe floor with her brother, as three other family members sleep a few \nfeet way. Kun Sokkea has never touched a phone, ridden in a car, or had \na soft drink; when she was asked if she ever drank milk, she looked \nconfused and said as a baby she had drunk her mother's milk.\n\n       Yet one thing Kun Sokkea has beside her bed is a photo of \n     the American Overlake students on their campus. In the \n     evenings before she goes to sleep, she sometimes picks up the \n     photo and studies the smiling families and neat lawns and \n     modern buildings. In her own shack, with her mother sick and \n     often crying, her siblings hungry, it is a window into a \n     magical land where people have plenty to eat and get cured \n     when they fall ill. In such a place, she thinks, everybody \n     must be happy all the time.\n\n  For one thing, we know that is not quite true in our country. As we \nknow, we have these same crimes occurring in our country every single \nday. Every single day, we have thousands of girls who are victims of \nsex trafficking. We had it happen in Minnesota. We have had it happen \nacross the country. We have it happen when some girls are brought in \nfrom other countries. We know it is going on every day in our own \nNation. We have an opportunity to do something about it, to tell the \nrest of the world that this place is a place where good things get \ndone. But somehow we have gotten bogged down in a political game again \nwith blame going back and forth and back and forth, and I just don't \nthink that is dignified for the Senate.\n\n  While we can battle it out--and we should--on issues such as the \nbudget and on issues where we don't have an agreement when it comes to \nour country's international affairs, this is an issue on which we \nactually agree, but somehow we found a way to not agree, and I think we \nneed to find our way back. That is why I am going to continue to read \nfrom this book.\n  Someone asked me if this is a filibuster. It is not a filibuster \nbecause obviously I don't mind if my colleagues come down. I would like \nthem to come down and talk about this important topic. But I will point \nout that at least when it comes to this issue of sex trafficking, we \ncan stop going back and forth on who is to blame and who knew what when \nand what people did wrong and instead just focus on resolving this \nissue and getting a bill passed and certainly not attaching it to the \nAttorney General of the United States.\n  I will say that it is attached to the Attorney General in one way, \nand that is when it comes to Federal sex trafficking cases. Most of \nthese cases are on the local level, county level, State level, the DA's \noffice, but there are cases that are handled federally. I know from \ntalking to the nominated Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, that she \ncares very much about these cases. It would be good to have her in \nplace so we can start working on this national sex trafficking \nstrategy. So in that way they are connected, but they certainly are not \nconnected, in my mind, procedurally.\n  I know some of my colleagues have addressed this. I have spoken out \nfor her several times. Not everyone knows about Loretta Lynch's \nbackground. Loretta Lynch is someone who grew up in a neighborhood--her \nfamily didn't have a lot of money. Her dad was a pastor at the church.\n  When she was in elementary school, she took a test and did really \nwell on that test. The teacher came to her and said: You know what, we \ndon't really know if that was really you who took that test or if that \nwas really your score. So she took the test again, and she scored even \nhigher the second time.\n  When Loretta Lynch graduated from high school, she was actually the \nvaledictorian. The principal of that school came up to Loretta Lynch \nand said: You know what, it is a bit controversial to have you as our \nvaledictorian, so you will have to share it with a White student. That \nhappened to Loretta Lynn, and she just waited it out, and that is what \nshe is going to do with this Chamber. She is going wait it out, and in \nthe end she will be confirmed as the next Attorney General.\n  Why is this relevant? Because some of our friends on the other side \nof the aisle are attaching it to the sex trafficking issue, and I don't \nthink it should be attached to the sex trafficking issue. I think we \nshould get her confirmed.\n  But most importantly and the reason I am here on the floor reading \nfrom this book is just to say, can we just stop going back and forth \nand the vengeance and get this bill done?\n  From the very beginning, Senator Cornyn and I have worked on my bill, \nthe safe harbor bill--which is not the bill on the floor--together. \nWhile I was not involved in the beginning of the drafting of his bill, \nI believe that idea of helping victims in some way with some kind of \nfunding with shelters is a really good idea as well.\n  I hope we can resolve the issue on his bill, the Hyde amendment \nprovision,\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\nand that we can then go on to pass my bill as the amendment. As we \nknow, there is significant support in the House for these bills, and \nthey are very important bills.\n  I will continue with the book:\n\n       Kun Sokkea and her family are not the only beneficiaries. \n     The Americans themselves have been transformed as much as the \n     Cambodians. And that is something you see routinely: Aid \n     projects have a mixed record in helping people abroad, but a \n     superb record in inspiring and educating the donors. \n     Sometimes the lessons are confusing, as Overlake found when \n     it tried to help Kun Sokkea get to middle school after \n     graduating from elementary school. She needed transport \n     because the middle school was far away, and young men in the \n     area often harassed girls on their way to school.\n       So, at the teacher's suggestion, Overlake bought Kun Sokkea \n     a bicycle, and for several months that worked very well. Then \n     an older woman, a neighbor, asked to borrow Kun Sokkea's \n     bicycle; the girl felt she couldn't say no to an older \n     person. The woman then sold the bicycle and kept the money \n     she received for it. Frank Grijalva and the American students \n     were beside themselves, but they learned an important lesson \n     about how defeating poverty is more difficult than it seems \n     at first. The Americans decided they couldn't just buy Kun \n     Sokkea another bicycle, so the girl returned to walking an \n     hour each way to school and back. Perhaps in part because of \n     the distance involved and the risks of getting to school, Kun \n     Sokkea began to miss a fair number of days. Her grades \n     suffered. In early 2009, she dropped out of school.\n       America's schools rarely convey much understanding of the \n     2.7 billion people (40 percent of the world's population) who \n     today live on less than $2 a day. So while the primary \n     purpose of a new movement on behalf of women is to stop \n     slavery and honor killings, another is to expose young \n     Americans to life abroad so that they, too, can learn and \n     grow and blossom--and then continue to tackle the problems as \n     adults.\n       ``After going to Cambodia, my plans for the future have \n     changed,'' said Natalie Hammerquist, a seventeen-year-old at \n     Overlake who regularly e-mails two Cambodian students. ``This \n     year I'm taking three foreign languages, and I plan on \n     picking up more in college.''\n       Natalie's Cambodian girlfriend wants to be a doctor but \n     can't afford to go to university. That grates on Natalie: A \n     girl just like me has to abandon her dreams because they're \n     unaffordable. Now Natalie plans on a career empowering young \n     people around the world: ``All anyone should do is to use \n     their gifts in what way they can, and this is how I can use \n     mine. That is the weight of how valuable seeing Cambodia was \n     for me.''\n\n  This is now chapter 2 of Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book \n``Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women \nWorldwide.'' And I noted that really most of the book is about sex \ntrafficking and prostitution and why this is such a major problem \nworldwide.\n  Look at what happened that night when those girls were doing nothing \nbut learning at a school and Boko Haram came in and broke into that \nschool and took those girls away. Their parents had nothing but \nmotorcycles and bicycles and bows and arrows to try to chase them. They \nwere never able to get their daughters back, and now Boko Haram said \nthey sold many of those children into sex slavery.\n  This should not be happening, but it is going on right now--and not \njust internationally. It is going on everywhere in this country, and \nthat is why it is important. It is important not just for the victims \nin America, it is also important because of the victims \ninternationally. We have an opportunity in this country to actually \nstand up and say: We want to be a leader on this internationally. We \nare going to cast this dysfunction aside and actually get this done and \nshow the world we can be a leader when it comes to elevating girls and \nyoung women, when it comes to holding up half the sky.\n  Chapter 2, ``Prohibition and Prostitution.'' It starts with a quote \nby Abraham Lincoln:\n\n       Although volume upon volume is written to prove slavery a \n     good thing, we never hear of the man who wishes to take the \n     good of it, by being a slave himself.\n       After visiting Meena Hasina and Ruchira Gupta in Bihar, \n     Nick crossed from India into Nepal at a border village with \n     stalls selling clothing, snacks, and more sinister wares. \n     That border crossing is the one through which thousands of \n     Nepali girls are trafficked into India on their way to the \n     brothels of Kolkata. There they are valued for their light \n     skin, good looks, docility, and inability to speak the local \n     language. As Nick filled out some required paperwork at the \n     border post, Nepalis streamed into India, without filling out \n     a form.\n       While sitting in the border shack, Nick began talking to \n     one Indian officer who spoke excellent English. The man said \n     he had been dispatched by the intelligence bureau to monitor \n     the border.\n       ``So what exactly are you monitoring?'' Nick asked.\n       ``We're looking for terrorists, or terror supplies,'' said \n     the man, who wasn't monitoring anything very closely, since \n     one truck after another was driving past. ``After 9/11, we've \n     tightened things up here. And we're also looking for smuggled \n     or pirated goods. If we find them, we will confiscate them.''\n       ``What about trafficked girls?'' Nick asked. ``Are you \n     keeping an eye out for them? There must be a lot.''\n       ``Oh, a lot. But we don't worry about them. There's nothing \n     that we can do about them.''\n       ``Well, you could arrest the traffickers. Isn't trafficking \n     girls as important as pirating DVDs?''\n       The intelligence officer laughed genially and threw up his \n     hands. ``Prostitution is inevitable.'' He chuckled. ``There \n     has always been prostitution in every country. And what's a \n     young man going to do from the time he turns eighteen until \n     he gets married at thirty?''\n       ``Well, is the best solution really to kidnap Nepali girls \n     and imprison them in Indian brothels?''\n       The officer shrugged, unperturbed. ``These girls are \n     sacrificed so we can have harmony in society. So that good \n     girls can be safe.''\n\n  It is unfortunate. I hope that is not what we are going to be saying \nin this body--from the Senate to the rest of the world and to \ntrafficked girls and to those groups who are advocating so hard, \nespecially over the last 2 years, in trying to get this done. I hope we \nwill not say: It is unfortunate. We were not able to resolve this. \nThese are major fights, and this person did this, and this person knew \nabout this, and this person didn't know about that.\n  That is what has been going on over this past week, and we are better \nthan that. People keep backstabbing and going after each other, but \npersonally I have had it. So if anyone wants to join me here--I know \nthe women in the Senate have always worked together--and at least talk \nabout this issue instead of simply fighting with each other, I think we \nwould really improve our chances of getting it done.\n\n       ``But many of the Nepali girls being trafficked are good \n     girls, too.''\n       ``Oh, yes, but those are peasant girls. They can't even \n     read. They're from the countryside. The good Indian middle-\n     class girls are safe.''\n       Nick, who had been gritting his teeth, offered an explosive \n     suggestion: ``I've got it! You know, in the United States we \n     have a lot of problems with harmony in society. So we should \n     start kidnapping Indian middle-class girls and forcing them \n     to work in brothels in the United States! Then young American \n     men could have fun, too, don't you think? That would improve \n     our harmony in society!''\n       There was an ominous silence, but finally the police \n     officer roared with laughter.\n       ``You are joking!'' the officer said beaming. ``That's very \n     funny!''\n       Nick gave up.\n       People get away with enslaving village girls for the same \n     reason that people got away with enslaving blacks 200 years \n     ago: The victims are perceived as discounted humans. India \n     had delegated an intelligence officer to look for pirated \n     goods because it knew that the United States cares about \n     intellectual property. When India feels that the West cares \n     as much about slavery as it does about pirated DVDs, it will \n     dispatch people to the borders to stop traffickers.\n       The tools to crush modern slavery exist, but the political \n     will is lacking. That must be the starting point of any \n     abolitionist movement. We're not arguing that Westerners \n     should take up this cause because it is the fault of the \n     West; Western men do not play a central role in prostitution \n     in most poor countries. True, American and European sex \n     tourists are part of the problem in Thailand, the \n     Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Belize, but they are still only a \n     small percentage of the johns. The vast majority are local \n     men. Moreover, Western men usually go with girls who are more \n     or less voluntary prostitutes, because they want to take the \n     girls back to their hotel rooms, while forced prostitutes are \n     not normally allowed out of the brothels. So this is not a \n     case where we in the West have a responsibility to lead \n     because we are the source of the problem. Rather, we single \n     out the West because even though we are peripheral to the \n     slavery, our action is necessary to overcome a horrific evil.\n       One reason the modern abolitionist movement has not been \n     more effective is the divisive politics of prostitution. In \n     the 1990s, the American left and right collaborated and \n     achieved the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, \n     which was a milestone in raising awareness of international \n     trafficking in the global agenda. The anti-trafficking \n     movement then was unusually bipartisan, strongly backed by \n     some liberal Democrats, such as the late senator Paul \n     Wellstone, and by some conservative Republicans, such as \n     Senator Sam Brownback.\n\n  I do want to pause from this book for a second to note that when I \nwas at the McCain Institute out in Arizona, Cindy\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\nMcCain and Heidi Heitkamp and I spoke about this issue to all of those \ngathered. At the end, a guy came up to me and said that he was with the \nState Department under a Republican administration, and he talked to me \nabout how when Paul Wellstone died, they put forward some kind of a \nscholarship in his honor for students who wanted to work in the area of \ncombating sex trafficking and trying to eliminate sex trafficking.\n  It was at that moment last spring that I actually found out that Paul \nWellstone, the Senator from Minnesota, whom we miss so dearly, who died \nin that tragic plane crash, had taken on this issue. He had taken on so \nmany other issues, speaking for the voiceless, from mental health to \ndomestic violence, that I did not know--and I think this shows how \nsometimes this issue gets second shrift--that he was such a hero when \nit came to sex trafficking.\n  I think part of that was Paul always believed that there were a lot \nof causes around this building that had people advocating for them, \nthat keep people busy at meetings all day or that they get called up \nfor that are so important, but, in fact, those who can't afford that \nkind of help--the victims of domestic violence or those with mental \nillness or victims of sex trafficking--they don't have a lot of \nlobbyists coming over here to meet with people and they need someone to \nstand up for them, and they should not be forgotten or dismissed or \nmarginalized in becoming a political football, that maybe they need \nsomeone advocating on their behalf.\n  The other thing about Paul is he always embraced that immigrant \nexperience. He believed that no matter where one comes from in this \ncountry, or no matter what one's roots were, they should be able to \nrise up. He also believed that everyone should be treated with dignity.\n  I will never forget when I first came to the Senate, Darrell, the \ntrain driver who recently retired, came up to me and I told him I am a \nSenator from Minnesota, and all he said was, ``Paul Wellstone,'' \nbecause he remembered him. Whether it was the cops at the front desk or \nthe secretaries, they remember Paul. So it is no surprise that Paul \nWellstone, along with conservative Republican Sam Brownback, actually \ntook this issue on.\n  In this book, ``Half the Sky,'' Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn \ncontinue talking about who worked on this when people were actually \nworking together. They say:\n\n       Hillary Rodham Clinton was also a leader on this issue, and \n     no one has been a greater champion than Carolyn Maloney, a \n     Democratic Congresswoman from New York.\n\n  In fact, Congresswoman Maloney, in conjunction with Congressman Poe, \na Republican Congressman, are sponsoring a bill that is not exactly the \nsame as Senator Cornyn's bill, but similar. They are also cosponsors of \nthe bill I am carrying, the safe harbor bill that Erik Paulsen is \ncarrying in the House. So we can see this work has continued. Some of \nthe people are the same, but somehow back then, we were able to reach \nsome kind of an agreement, and this was treated as a serious issue and \na serious bill which we need to do.\n  They go on to talk about who else worked on this.\n  They say:\n\n     . . . Paul Wellstone, Sam Brownback, Hillary Rodham Clinton, \n     Carolyn Maloney, a Democratic Congresswoman from New York. \n     Likewise, one of George W. Bush's few positive international \n     legacies was a big push against trafficking. Vital Voices and \n     other liberal groups were stalwart on sex trafficking, as \n     were International Justice Mission, and other conservative \n     evangelical groups. Yet, while the left and the right each do \n     important work fighting trafficking, they mostly do it \n     separately. The abolitionist movement would be far more \n     effective if it forged unity in its own rank.\n\n  Now we get back to something I always remember Mike Enzi talking \nabout, about how we can have disagreement on something like 20 percent \nof the things, but we have agreement on 80 percent. Maybe that is what \nwe have to remember with this bill. We know how Senator Enzi always \nworked well with Ted Kennedy, as did Senator Hatch, even with how \ndifferent they were politically. But they were able to find some common \nground.\n  Certainly this bill should not be devolving into a fight over \nabortion. There is so much we agree on in this bill. There is also so \nmuch we agree on in the safe harbor bill which doesn't contain the Hyde \nprovision.\n  So this idea that we are going back and forth and dwelling on whose \nfault this was and how it happened--frankly, I think: Enough. I think \nwe need to resolve this. I know there are ways to resolve this. I hope \nthat is continuing to go on today. We have a lot of things, in addition \nto passing this bill, we need to get done. We need to get the vote on \nthe next Attorney General of the United States. We have a major budget \nthat we need to get done. The budget needs to be approved. I am looking \nat our staff and I know they are looking forward to one of those nights \nwhere we are going until 3 or 4 in the morning. Maybe we wouldn't have \nto do that if we could stop these kinds of fights.\n  This is kind of a practical argument for getting this done, I know \nthat, but one has to be slightly practical as we look at the fights \nbefore us on important matters that we need to resolve. One of the \nfights shouldn't be this. This is a fight against evil. This is a fight \nagainst those who are trafficking in little girls. It shouldn't be a \nfight across the aisle.\n  The authors talk about the groups that have worked on it and how we \nwould be more effective if we forged unity.\n  They continue:\n\n       One reason for discord is a dispute about how to regard \n     prostitution. The left often refers nonjudgmentally to ``sex \n     workers'' and tends to be tolerant of transactions among \n     consenting adults. The right . . . refers to ``prostitutes'' \n     or ``prostituted women''.\n\n  Do my colleagues know what is so interesting about this--let me see \nwhen this book was written: 2009. So even since that time, what is sort \nof a cool thing is that we have gotten some agreement now on the fact \nthat when we see a Republican House of Representatives being able to \npass the safe harbor bill--the bill I wrote in the Senate, the bill \nthat is not yet on the floor, to make clear, but the bill that would be \nconsidered as the first amendment--we have gotten some agreement here \nin these two Houses that these younger victims are, in fact, victims. I \nthink that is really important for our country to hear that. Because \nwhen we do things such as that--such as when we pass the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, it changes the whole way people think about these \ncrimes. Who is committing the crime? It is the people running the ring. \nIt is the johns. It is not the victims.\n  So I think that is why as we move forward, trying to get these bills \npassed, it is so important beyond the immediate bills.\n  OK. So they are talking about this debate. I don't think we should \ndwell on debate. We have had enough of them in this Chamber, but that \nis what this part of the book is about.\n  They continue:\n\n       What policy should we pursue to try to eliminate that \n     slavery? Originally, we sympathized with the view that a \n     prohibition won't work any better in prostitution today than \n     it did against alcohol in America in the 1920s. Instead of \n     trying fruitlessly to ban prostitution, we believed it would \n     be preferable to legalize and regulate it. That pragmatic \n     ``harm reduction'' model is preferred by many aid groups \n     because it allows aid workers to pass out condoms and it \n     permits access to brothels so that they can be more easily \n     checked for underage girls.\n       Over time, we've changed our minds. That legalize-and-\n     regulate model simply hasn't worked very well in countries \n     where prostitution is often coerced.\n\n  This is a change. I think we remember back decades ago where people \nwere talking about legalizing prostitution. I think what we have \nrealized, those of us who have worked as prosecutors, is that so often \nprostitution is not consensual. So often there are reasons--either the \npimp is keeping someone hooked on drugs to keep someone being a \nprostitute or they are threatening their lives or threatening their \nfamily lives--and this is something that we don't want to have be \nlegal.\n  I am going to finish this paragraph, and then I see we have been \njoined by the great Senator from New Jersey who I am really happy has \ncome so I can sit down and drink some water.\n  It continues:\n\n       That legalize-and-regulate model simply hasn't worked very \n     well in countries where prostitution is often coerced. \n     Partly, that is because governance is often poor so the \n     regulation is ineffective, and partly it is because the legal \n     brothels tend to attract a parallel\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\n     illegal business in young girls and forced prostitution. In \n     contrast, there's empirical evidence that crackdowns can \n     succeed, when combined with social services such as job \n     retraining and drug rehabilitation, and that is the approach \n     we have come to favor. In countries with widespread \n     trafficking, we favor a law enforcement strategy that pushes \n     for fundamental change in police attitudes and regular police \n     inspections to check for underage girls or anyone being held \n     against their will. That means holding governments \n     accountable not just to pass laws but also to enforce them, \n     and monitoring how many brothels are raided and pimps are \n     arrested. Jail-like brothels should be closed down, sting \n     operations should be mounted against buyers of virgin girls, \n     and national police chiefs must be under pressure to crack \n     down on corruption as it relates to trafficking. The idea is \n     to reduce the brothel owners' profit.\n\n  With that, I will take a pause from this book. I will say that \nSenator Booker has done not only an amazing job as a Senator, but he \nalso knows a little bit about being a mayor. He knows the struggle of \npoverty and also understands that to govern, we have to have a change \nof tone. I have always appreciated the work he has done across the \naisle and the tone he brings to the Senate. We are really trying to \npush today as we try to come together to work on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for those incredibly \ngenerous words. I recognize the Presiding Officer, Senator Perdue. I am \ngrateful to be able to serve with him, and it is great seeing him in \nthe captain's chair, to use my ``Star Trek'' parlance. I am happy to \nhave the chance to formally welcome the Senator from Georgia to the \nSenate. It is good to serve with him as well.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Mr. President, I am honored to stand on the Senate floor to express \nmy strong support for the historic nomination of Loretta Lynch to be \nthe Attorney General of the United States. Our Nation is fortunate to \nhave Ms. Lynch as the nominee for Attorney General. She is seasoned, \ncompetent, wise, extraordinarily dedicated, and has already served this \nNation for many years, receiving accolades from across the country. She \nis historic in and of herself and exceptionally well qualified. I wish \nto tell everyone a little bit more about her.\n  First, though, I want to ask--and this should not be necessary, but I \nwant to ask: Why do we almost have a double standard for Ms. Lynch's \nnomination? She is the first African-American woman appointed to head \nthe Department of Justice. She has had her nomination pending on the \nSenate floor longer than any nominee for Attorney General going back \nthree decades. Ms. Lynch has had to wait 81 days for a hearing in \ncommittee--longer than any of President George W. Bush's nominees for \nAttorney General had to wait; more than twice as long for Attorneys \nGeneral John Ashcroft and Michael Mukasey; and 24 days longer than \nAlberto Gonzalez. She waited 27 days for a committee vote after her \nhearing, again longer than any of George Bush's nominees to be Attorney \nGeneral. Now her nomination has lingered on the Senate floor without a \nvote for 20 days, which is again longer than the wait for any of the \nlast five Attorneys General combined. Her historic nomination has now \nbeen pending in the Senate for more than 130 days since the President \nfirst nominated her. I have not heard a single good reason germane to \nher qualifications, to her values, to her views, and to the kind of \nservice she has rendered or will render, as to why she should not be \npromptly confirmed.\n  She comes before the Senate having been twice appointed by two \ndifferent Presidents and twice unanimously confirmed by this very body, \nto be a U.S. attorney. She has been a career Federal prosecutor for \nalmost a decade, a partner at a prestigious law firm, and led one of \nthe finest Federal prosecuting offices in the country, the Eastern \nDistrict of New York.\n  Her nomination has the support of dozens of law enforcement \norganizations, civil rights organizations, and outspoken citizens from \nacross the country.\n  So, again, I wonder why are we here today still waiting? Why does \nthis President's exceptionally well-qualified nominee deserve such \nunfair treatment?\n  Attorneys General are important because they lead the Department that \nkeeps us safe and secure and protects our rights. From securing the \nright to vote to combating the violence of organized crime, to bringing \nterrorists to justice, this position is too important for any kind of \npolitical games and for any kind of delay.\n  Seventy-five years ago, another Attorney General, Robert H. Jackson, \nspoke eloquently about the qualities of a good Federal prosecutor and \nhence a good Attorney General, when he said: ``The citizen's safety \nlies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks \ntruth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, \nand who approaches her task with humility.''\n  This is the type of prosecutor Ms. Lynch has always been and the type \nof Attorney General she will be.\n  This appointment is historic. Once confirmed, Ms. Lynch will be the \nfirst Black woman to serve in the Nation's highest law enforcement \nposition. She will be only the second woman and second African American \nto be Attorney General. Her story is our story. It is an American \nstory. It reflects a long history of our Nation, the distance we have \ntraveled as a country.\n  It is a story of a Black woman who grew up in the Jim Crow South, the \ndaughter of a fourth-generation minister and segregation-fighting \nmother who overcame discrimination and achieved the American dream \ndespite the early obstacles she faced. Once, while a student at a \npredominantly White elementary school, her standardized test scores \nwere so high that the disbelieving school demanded she retake her test. \nThe great thing about that story is she retook the test and got a \nhigher score. On one other occasion, she was named the valedictorian of \nher high school class which was a predominantly White high school, but \nthe White administrators in the school did not think it was appropriate \nto have a Black girl as the top student, so they asked her to share \nthat honor with a White student, and she did so with dignity and grace.\n  She would go on to earn an Ivy League education, climb the highest \nladders of her profession, and stand today nominated by the President \nof the United States of America, and when confirmed by the Senate, she \nwill be our 83rd Attorney General. Only in this great Nation can a \nstory such as this be possible, can a story such as this be told.\n  Today, we continue our efforts. All of us--Republicans and \nDemocrats--in this body are committed to building a more perfect Union. \nI know this confirmation will inspire people all across our country--\npeople who may have lost their faith in law enforcement or in our \ngovernment's ability to get things done, to know that despite the odds \nor challenges, we are still a great nation, that we are devoted to \novercoming our challenges.\n  We celebrate someone who has broken glass ceilings, who has broken \nbarrier after barrier, and now as a qualified candidate will hopefully \nsoon ascend to this position. It is a reaffirmation of the American \ndream.\n  While history is important, I don't want to overshadow those \nqualifications. I want to reiterate them.\n  She is a well-qualified nominee. She graduated with Harvard College \nand Harvard Law School degrees, and went on to gain exceptional \nexperience as a prosecutor and as a manager. As U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of New York, she led one of the Nation's most \nchallenging prosecutorial offices. I know this. I live right across the \nriver from where she works. Her tough approach to fighting crime became \nalmost legendary. She won acclaim throughout our metropolitan region as \nwell as in the law enforcement community.\n  In that office she established a record that would make any \nprosecutor proud. She led an office that had the tenacity to take on \nviolent criminals, to confront political corruption, and to disrupt \norganized crime.\n  At a time when the Senate is considering legislation to combat human \ntrafficking, we need an Attorney General who will vigorously, \nunapologetically, and courageously prosecute traffickers. Ms. Lynch has \nbeen a leader on that very issue. Her\n\n[[Page S1614]]\n\noffice prosecuted over 100 child exploitation cases and brutal global \ntrafficking cases. Her office tried more terrorism cases since 9/11 \nthan any other office in the country.\n  I was impressed when she first came to my office. She was candid, \nstraightforward, and down to earth. What is clear from Ms. Lynch's \nrecord is not just that she is a tough prosecutor but that she is a \nleader with a vision and the right values to be Attorney General.\n  Too many Americans distrust the ability of law enforcement to fairly \nenforce our laws. Ms. Lynch believes in the principles of equality and \njustice first and foremost, and she will restore even more faith in our \nsystem. In her committee testimony she articulated a vision about how \nin a great time of tension in our country we can rebuild the trust \nbetween dedicated, committed law enforcement officers on the streets \nand the communities they serve. Too many Americans, as I said time and \nagain, go to prison for far too long. The majority of people \nincarcerated today in Federal prisons are there for nonviolent \noffenses. We have a nation that leads the globe in incarcerating \npeople, and we do it often in a way that is discriminatory against poor \npeople and minorities.\n  Ms. Lynch has a vision of alternatives to incarceration for \nnonviolent offenders that are based on facts and based on her \nexperience. She supported her district's drug court with a diversion \nprogram taking first-time nonviolent offenders out of the prosecution \nsystem and giving them access to drug treatment. Her innovation and \nsuccesses speak volumes about her commitment to saving taxpayer dollars \nand addressing our swelling prison population while also driving down \ncrime.\n  So I say in conclusion, she has sterling character. She has \nincredible credentials. She has unflappable integrity. I am confident \nthat as Attorney General she will ensure that the Department leads in a \nway that will make us proud.\n  The road to building a more perfect Union in this country has been \nlong, and the work still continues. We are at a time in this Nation \nwhen cynicism with government is at an all-time high. One of the \nhighest-ranked concerns that Americans have right now--issues of \nemployment and education are now being caught up to by concerns that \nAmericans have about whether their very government will work together \nto do what is right.\n  The delay in her nomination undermines the integrity of this body. It \ngives a signal to all those who are cynical to further surrender to \nthat emotion. This great candidate passed through committee in \nbipartisan fashion. She is a great woman, a great African American, and \nmost of all a great American and she should not be delayed on the \nsidelines when there is work to be done, when her very delay begins to \nundermine what we say this body can do when we all work together and \nput petty partisan politics aside and stand up for something far more \nimportant, which is the work to make this country a more perfect Union.\n  We can do that together, all of us in the Senate, by confirming Ms. \nLynch who will use that post to do the very same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly echo the passionate and \ncogent presentation that my colleague from New Jersey has just given, \nthat this body can be well served--very well served--for us to go \nimmediately to the confirmation of Loretta Lynch. The delay in this \ncritical position is unacceptable, does a disservice to the individual, \na disservice to the office, a disservice to the executive branch, and a \ndisservice to justice in America.\n  Let's have that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider the vote by which cloture was not invoked on the committee-\nreported amendment to S. 178.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \ncloture was not invoked on the committee-reported amendment to S. 178.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee-\n     reported substitute amendment to S. 178, a bill to provide \n     justice for the victims of trafficking.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, Shelley Moore Capito, Steve \n           Daines, Roger F.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \ncommittee-reported substitute amendment to S. 178, a bill to provide \njustice for the victims of trafficking, shall be brought to a close, \nupon reconsideration?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

On this vote, the yeas are 57, the nays are \n41.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion, upon reconsideration, is rejected.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have had the opportunity in the 40 years \nI have been in the Senate to lead with others of both parties many \nefforts to help support victims--crime victims, domestic violence \nvictims, victims of child abuse, and human trafficking victims.\n  One of the things I have learned during that time is we have to pay \nattention to what the survivors tell us when they tell us what they \nneed. None of us have walked in their shoes.\n  We can offer advice, but we can't second-guess them. We can't assume \nwe know best. Our job is to listen and try to help them rebuild their \nlives.\n  If we would all just stop the political rhetoric and listen, the \nmessage from these survivors is clear.\n  Earlier this week, the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic \nViolence Against Women--this, incidentally, is a coalition of thousands \nof organizations representing millions of survivors of domestic and \nsexual violence--wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S1615]]\n\n\n       We write today to express our deep concern about the \n     controversy of inserting the Hyde provision into the Justice \n     for Victims of Trafficking Act. The House passed a version of \n     that Act that did not include this new Hyde provision and we \n     ask the Senate to the do the same.\n\n  I agree with them. I worked very closely with this group for more \nthan 2 years as we drafted the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act. They are some of the most dedicated advocates I \nhave ever worked with and I listen to what they say. I believe they are \nshowing us the way forward.\n  The House version of the very bill we are debating today does not \ncontain the unnecessary destructive provision that wreaks such havoc \nhere. Speaker John Boehner found a way to bring the House together--\nRepublicans and Democrats--and passed a bill without injecting abortion \npolitics into the discussion. Now, if that deeply divided body can do \nit, I would assume we can do it here in the Senate.\n  Some are being very casual about the divisive partisan provision that \nSenate Republicans injected into this Senate bill. They call it \nboilerplate. Well, it is not. It places limitations on the health care \nservices victims can use as they access money collected from the very \npeople who trafficked them.\n  We are not talking about taxpayers' money. We are not talking about \ntaxpayers' dollars. We are talking about traffickers' money. This is \nthe money traffickers would pay in fines.\n  Criminals have already taken away so many choices for these young \nwomen and girls, and we shouldn't be taking away their right to make \ntheir own health care choices. We certainly should not require these \nsurvivors to have to prove they were raped. That is offensive. It is \nwrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for coming to the floor. I know how \nmuch he supports this bill to end human trafficking, sex trafficking, \nand what a frustration he must feel--and which I share--that we have \nbeen unable to bring a bill before us that has strong bipartisan \nsupport and with few amendments is likely to be considered and would \npass very quickly in the Senate.\n  I thank him for pointing out what I tried to point out this morning. \nIn this 112-page bill, there is one sentence related to the Hyde \namendment, which changes what we have been doing here for more than 30 \nyears and which is holding up the passage of this important bill. What \nwe have been pleading with the Republican leaders to do is to remove \nthis sentence, and then let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to the Senator from Illinois, that the Republican \nHouse of Representatives passed this Act without this provision, and \nDemocrats and Republicans here in the Senate should do the same.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, there may be partisan differences over this one \nsentence, but there is bipartisan support for ending the trafficking \nand helping the victims.\n  Thank you, because I know you want to offer another amendment about \nrunaways, which is very important. I have met so many of them, as you \nhave. It is a heartbreaking story how so many are abused and exploited. \nThank you for your leadership and for bringing this issue to our \nattention today.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Illinois, who has worked on this \nthroughout his career, both in the House and in the Senate. It means a \nlot. I will state what one survivor, Tina Frundt, a survivor of human \ntrafficking who now helps counsel other young trafficking victims, \nsaid:\n\n       It is not for us to judge the type of services a survivor \n     of sex trafficking needs. We need the basic rights of medical \n     services without judgment.\n\n  I think, instead of our trying to be political about this, we should \nlisten to survivors such as Tina. We can't pass a bill that ignores the \nrequests of the various survivors it is designed to help.\n  Experts across the political spectrum who treat survivors of \ntrafficking are telling us to remove the language.\n  I heard, for example, from a group called HEAL Trafficking, an \norganization of health care professionals who treat survivors. These \nare physicians, nurses, and counselors. They wrote a letter to me and \nsaid: ``We implore the Senate to pass S. 178 without the inclusion of \nHyde amendment language, which would place limits on trafficking \nsurvivors' access to vital health services.''\n  I also heard from the service providers, whom I know and respect, at \nthe Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth. They work with \nyoung people who are exceptionally vulnerable to becoming victims of \ntrafficking and sexual exploitation. They wrote: ``There should be no \ndoubt that legislation involving the well-being of individuals who have \nbeen victimized by the most base of human behavior should be free of \npartisan wrangling.''\n  It is time to listen to the people this bill is supposed to help. \nThey say: Take out the provision; pass the bill.\n  I hope that we will.\n  I can only imagine what these victims of trafficking go through. I \nhave said several times on the floor--I remember so vividly; I remember \nas though it were yesterday, listening to some of the victims when we \nwere trying to prosecute the people who trafficked them or harmed them \nor exploited them. I thought, wouldn't it be great if we had some help \nto stop this horrible crime from happening in the first place.\n  But at least we did not have politicians telling us: Well, you can \noffer this service, but you cannot offer that service. They simply \nsaid: Find the best experts you can and use their advice.\n  The experts are there day by day by day. Let them do their work. \nDon't play politics with them.\n  I have said before, when we considered the Leahy-Crapo Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization Act, a victim is a victim is a victim. We \nought to do what we can to help them.\n\n\n      SSCI Study of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program\n\n  Mr. President, on another matter which goes into an interesting area, \neach year, Sunshine Week reminds us we cannot take for granted our \ndemocratic system of government. Our Nation's Founders understood that \nto maintain a true democracy, we have to have an open government. Only \nan open government can be truly accountable to the people.\n  But pulling back the curtain on the internal workings of governmental \nagencies is not always easy. Sometimes, it is not even popular. In some \ncases, it generates great controversy, as was the case of Senator \nFeinstein's hard-fought efforts last year to declassify the executive \nsummary of the Senate Intelligence Committee's historic torture report.\n  This extraordinary report thoroughly reviewed the CIA's use of \ntorture during the Bush administration and revealed that it was far \nmore brutal than we knew. Now, shedding light on the CIA's actions \ndemonstrates to the world that America is different. We acknowledge our \nmistakes, so that we can learn from them. We do not sweep them under a \nrug and pretend they never happened. But some seem to want just that.\n  When Senator Feinstein publically released the executive summary, she \nalso provided the full report, which totaled, I am told, more than \n6,700 pages. She provided the full report to the President and the \nrelevant executive branch agencies. The report details the failures \nthat allowed this program to happen. She rightly put these details in \nthe hands of those officials who had appropriate clearances who could \nlearn from the mistakes and ensure that they do not happen again--\nwhether it is a Republican or a Democratic administration.\n\n  Unfortunately, some of the program's defenders will stop at nothing \nin an effort to erase this ugly history. Immediately after the report \nwas issued, there was an unabashed campaign to discredit it and an \nattempt to portray what happened as something other than what we all \nknow it was--torture.\n  I have had enough of the disingenuous euphemisms and acronyms used to \nmask the truly brutal nature of what was done to other human beings. We \nshould acknowledge what it was. It was torture. The President has \nacknowledged that. And Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch did \nduring her hearing, when she stated clearly and unequivocally that \nwaterboarding is torture. Instead, defenders of this brutality call it \nsomething else. They claim it was justified, but then they\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\noffer no evidence to support their assertions and insist outright that \nthey would do it again. Even though they have no evidence that it \nhelped, they imply as much.\n  But if that wasn't bad enough, some now want to make the report \nitself disappear. In January, the incoming chairman of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee asked the President and the agencies to return \nthe full report to the Senate.\n  That is essentially saying: let us pretend we made no mistakes. Let \nus erase history. Let us be able to open the history book and just see \nblank pages. We did nothing wrong.\n  Well, that is outrageous. Neither this historic Senate report nor the \nshameful truths it reveals can be wiped out of existence.\n  It is also appalling to learn that several of the agencies that \nreceived the full report in December haven't even opened it. In a \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit seeking release of the full \nreport, Justice Department and State Department officials submitted \ndeclarations stating that their copies remain locked away in unopened, \nsealed envelopes. So they can say: I see nothing. It is locked up. It \nis sealed.\n  I don't know if this was done in an attempt to bolster the \ngovernment's position in the FOIA lawsuit or to otherwise avoid Federal \nrecords laws. I certainly hope not. But regardless of the motivation, \nit was a mistake that should be rectified.\n  The executive summary of the torture report, which they have seen, \nmakes clear that both the State Department and the Justice Department \nhave much to learn from the history of the CIA's torture program. Both \nagencies were misled by the CIA about the program. Both should consider \nsystemic changes in how they deal with covert actions. Yet neither \nagency has bothered to open the final, full version of the report or, \napparently, even those sections most relevant to them.\n  The fight for government transparency and accountability is never \ncomplete. I have joined with the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn, over the years to write and pass tougher provisions in FOIA. I \nthink the importance of the public release of this report's executive \nsummary cannot be overstated. It is one of the most important oversight \nachievements of this body. Now we must ensure the full report, \ncontaining the results of years of painstaking work, is put to good use \nby those within the executive branch.\n  So today, as we recognize Sunshine Week, I send this message to the \nexecutive branch agencies who received the full Intelligence Committee \ntorture report: Do not return your copy to the Senate. Ensure that the \nappropriate people in your agencies, with appropriate clearances, have \naccess to it and learn from it. Initiate a process to consider the \nlessons your agency should learn from this experience. Follow the \nexample of FBI Director Comey, who last week testified he would \ndesignate appropriate people to consider the report and what \nimprovements could be made, because there are no instances when torture \nis acceptable.\n  The Convention Against Torture does not make exceptions. There is no \ndoubt that if these actions were committed against American soldiers, \nby a hostile government, we would immediately condemn them as torture \nand a violation of international law. We have to make clear to the rest \nof the world we follow international law. We don't torture. We have to \nensure that America never allows this to happen again.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, again today, just like yesterday, we saw \nall but four Senate Democrats filibuster a bill that passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee unanimously, including nine Democratic Senator \nvotes. This is a bill that is cosponsored by 12 Democrats and a bill \nthat came to the floor by unanimous consent of the Senate--all 100 \nSenators. Any single Senator could have barred that from happening and \nforced us to go through procedural hoops. I would like to believe they \ndid so because all of us agree--Democrat and Republican alike--that \nhelping the victims of human trafficking should be our sole and \nsolitary focus in this legislation. And that is what this bill does.\n  This bill is probably the last bill you would imagine would be \ncontroversial--certainly one that people would be loath to politicize--\nbut, indeed, that is exactly what has happened. I just can't explain \nit. Maybe some of our colleagues who have done this can. How can you \ncosponsor a bill, how can you vote for it and then come to the floor of \nthe Senate on two occasions and vote to kill it?\n  Well, as I said earlier, we have four Senate Democrats who have \njoined with Republicans to pass this piece of legislation, then \nreconcile it with the House bill, and send it on to President Obama, \nwhere I am confident he would sign it. I am confident he would sign it \nbecause this is an issue where, if we can't do a bill to help victims \nof human trafficking, I wonder what we can possibly accomplish. If \npolitics and the divisiveness here in Washington so polarizes people on \nthis bill, how are we going to do the other things we need to do, such \nas pass a budget? How are we going to take care of our national \nsecurity needs? How will we deal with the immigration issue? How will \nwe deal with other things that are far more controversial?\n  Just to reiterate what this bill does, it focuses on the people on \nthe demand side of sex trafficking and the sex trade. In other words, \nthe people who actually pay for the services provided by these 12-to-\n14-year-old girls and the pimps that basically manage them.\n  This takes the money from the people who create the demand. Once they \nhave been convicted and penalized, they pay into a crime victims \ncompensation fund. We estimate, if our calculations are correct, that \ncould generate as much as $30 million a year--$30 million a year. That \nmoney would then be subject to grants to help organizations that are \nset up to help the victims of human trafficking.\n  So not only are we interested in trying to rescue these children from \nthe grasp of these criminal organizations that run human trafficking \nrings, we want to find a way to help them heal and get better. We have \nall heard story after story about the tragedy of human trafficking. I \nhave talked to the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who, as a former prosecutor, understands this issue and the \nhuman wreckage left in the wake of the people who purchase these \nservices and help facilitate these criminal organizations. So somehow, \nsome way, we need to find a way to help the victims. Our focus ought to \nbe on them and them alone.\n  We have heard a lot of, to my mind, phony excuses about this bill. I \nactually had some Senators tell me they didn't know of this provision \nthat limits the use of the fines and penalties. This is a rule that has \nprevailed for 39 years, known as the Hyde amendment. They say they \ndidn't know it was there. They didn't read the bill, apparently.\n  I don't actually quite believe that. I know that staff on both sides \nin the Judiciary Committee and generally the staff in the Senate are \nhighly professional people. They are not going to let something slip \nby. But if there is a reason why they did, I believe it is because this \nlanguage has become routine. It has become routine. It has been in \nliterally every appropriations bill since 1976. It had been in things \nsuch as the Children's Health Insurance Program. It has been in Defense \nauthorization bills. It has been in ObamaCare. All of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have voted for this sort of language over \nand over and over again.\n  I happen to be proudly pro-life, but we have many colleagues who \nconsider themselves pro-choice who have said: Well, I don't think we \nought to appropriate tax dollars to pay for abortions. I agree with the \nHyde amendment. So they have clearly had an opportunity to read and \nunderstand the bill. I don't believe 12 Senators on the other side \nwould cosponsor a bill they hadn't read and didn't understand. I don't \nbelieve nine members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the other \nside would vote for it, including the distinguished ranking member, \nwithout knowing what was in the bill.\n  The reason why this was so unremarkable is because, as I said, it\n\n[[Page S1617]]\n\nhas become routine, and virtually all the legislation that touches on \nthis area has passed since 1976. So why here and why now? Why are we \nthreatening to kill this important piece of legislation to help the \nmost vulnerable victims that exist in America?\n  It is estimated that about 100,000 children are sex trafficked a year \nin the United States. It happens in Texas, sadly; it happens in \nVermont; and it happens everywhere. The fact of the matter is, most \nAmericans are simply unaware of it because this is an underbelly of \nlife, a criminality that is really unbeknownst to most of us because it \nhappens outside of our view and outside of our experience. But we have \nthousands of scared and abused children who need our help.\n  By killing this bill, as our friends across the aisle have done, with \nthe exception of four brave exceptions, instead of our helping hand we \nare giving them a shrug of indifference. We are saying: You know what. \nOur political fights here in Washington are more important than your \nfuture and your life and the fact that you have been treated as human \nbaggage.\n  I happen to believe--and I know many share this belief--that we are \nall created in the image of God, and it is a terrible sin and it is an \nevil thing to treat a human being created in the image of God as a \ncommodity, as a thing to be bought and sold.\n  We went through a terrible period in our Nation's history where we \nhad African Americans treated as less than human. We fought a civil \nwar, where 600,000 people died, and then we passed a constitutional \namendment and other important legislation to try to heal those wounds \nthat existed from the very beginning of our Nation. Indeed, it has not \nyet finished healing even today.\n  Knowing what we know about human slavery and what that has been in \nour history, why in the world wouldn't we want to do something about \nmodern-day human slavery to try to rectify, to try to rescue, to try to \nhelp heal these victims, which is what this legislation does?\n  To summarize: We have a piece of legislation that contains a \nprovision that has been the law of the land for 39 years. We have a \nbill on the floor that was cosponsored by 12 Democrats on the other \nside of the aisle. Unfortunately, most of them have voted to filibuster \nthis bill now that it has come to the floor because of this provision \nthey said they didn't know about or they weren't aware of or they \nobject to.\n  We have a piece of legislation that will not cost taxpayers anything \nbecause it is financed by the fines and penalties assessed against \npeople who demand and purchase these illicit services. That is why this \nis the sort of bipartisan consensus legislation I think the American \npeople would like to see us pass.\n  We need to overcome this obstacle. I know the majority leader, \nSenator McConnell, is determined to give those who are filibustering \nthis bill a chance to change their mind and a chance to let us finish \nthis piece of legislation. Indeed, we need two, maybe three more \nSenators on that side. I would think that among the 12 people who \ncosponsored the bill, among the 9 who voted for it already in \ncommittee, we could find at least 3 more who would vote for this \nlegislation and allow us to finish it.\n  I know the distinguished ranking member from Vermont has an amendment \nhe wants to offer on the bill, and he has that right. He should have \nthat right. But we can't do it unless we get past this hurdle of the \nfilibuster. This bill is simply too important to let politics get in \nthe way of helping the innocent victims who need our support.\n  So the Senate being the way it is, which is somewhat broken these \ndays, how in the world do we get to the point where we can actually \nhelp the victims of human trafficking, given the filibuster? Well, \nSenator McConnell has said he is going to keep bringing this bill back \nagain and again--and, indeed, this is now the second vote we have had \non this--until we can recruit at least two more Democrats to vote to \nclose off debate to allow us to finish the bill. He has also said we \nare not going to be able to get to the confirmation of Attorney General \nLoretta Lynch, which has been voted out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, until we finish this bill. I agree with that. I think the \nmajority leader has made the right call, because, apparently, if the \ncries and the needs of the innocent victims of human trafficking aren't \nenough to move our friends across the aisle to let us finish this bill, \nthen we are going to have to look for whatever leverage we can.\n  Indeed, I would say this does not bode well for the future of the \n114th Congress if this is the way we are going to be operating. I don't \nknow how many nominations will be voted out of committee and be \neligible for floor action that will not be considered on the Senate \nfloor because we are stuck in situations such as this--where we know \nwhat the right thing to do is, all of the Senators know what the right \nthing to do is, but somehow we can't quite seem to get it done. We have \nto get it done. We have to get all of the Senate's business done, \nincluding considering the President's nominees.\n  So I hope we do. I look forward to having another opportunity, \nperhaps tomorrow, to vote to close off debate. My hope is that \novernight, sometime during the next 24 hours, at least 2 more of our \ncolleagues--we would be glad to have more--can examine their \nconscience, can think about why it is they actually ran for the Senate, \nwhy it is they are here. Is it to try to actually do something good to \nhelp people who can't help themselves? I believe it is. I think that is \nwhy all of us came here, to try to do that. But somehow, some way, we \nhave gotten off track, and some people think that political games and \nobstruction are more important than actually doing what we got elected \nto do and the reason why we actually volunteered to serve in the United \nStates Senate.\n  So I hope we have at least two more Senators on the other side \nexamine their conscience and reconsider their ``no'' vote and decide to \nclose off debate by providing the votes. We need to do that tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I totally agree with the senior Senator \nfrom Texas that the Hyde amendment has been in a number of bills that \nspend tax dollars. I have been in the Appropriations Committee for \nnearly 40 years. I am aware of that. But as the distinguished senior \nSenator from Texas just stated, there are no tax dollars in this \nmatter. The way he has drafted this bill, it would take moneys from \nfines levied against those who are convicted of sex exploitation.\n  This would be the first time, to my knowledge--and I would stand \ncorrected if I am wrong, but I cannot think of a time in the past 40 \nyears that we have applied the Hyde amendment to such funds. I think \nthat is probably why--because there are tax dollars in the House \ncompanion bill--that the House of Representatives did not include the \nHyde amendment.\n  I have voted for appropriation bills with the Hyde amendment in it so \nwe could move them to the floor. But to go to this expansion when all \nthese different groups who have written in to us tell us please don't \ndo this, and the groups who actually work with victims--they say don't \ninclude it. I agree with them.\n  I think there can be a way forward. We came together in this body to \npass the Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, with \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act as an amendment. \nWe worked for some time, but we passed it.\n  I also want to say that--again, based on my experience here--I cannot \nthink of a time, whether the Senate was under Democratic control or \nRepublican control, that a piece of legislation has been used like this \nto hold up a key member of the President's Cabinet. Loretta Lynch has \nbeen held up longer than the past four Attorney General nominees--four \nmen--put together. She is still being held up. I think that is \nunfortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to my friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Vermont, whom I have worked with closely on a number \nof pieces of legislation and whom I would love to be able to work with \nto find a solution to the current impasse that we have on this \nlegislation--I would say to my friend that if the objection is\n\n[[Page S1618]]\n\nthat this fund is not subject to the appropriations process, then that \nis something we ought to discuss and talk about.\n  Why the fund is so important to me is because the fines and penalties \nthat go into this save the taxpayers money. It actually takes the money \nfrom the people who create the demand and uses that to help heal and \nsave and rescue the victims.\n  I guess I would have a little difference of opinion--and maybe it is \njust semantics--that once the fines and penalties are paid to the \nTreasury, my view is they become public dollars although they \ntechnically aren't derived from taxes, per se. But beyond that point, I \nwould say once this money is paid into the fund, I think we could come \nup with a mechanism that would then allow the Appropriations Committee \nto play its traditional role in directing the money to the purposes for \nwhich Congress designates. And I know, as a long-time member of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Senator believes--and I respect--that is \nan important part of the process.\n  It is important, though, to note that this would still be subject to \nthe same rule which has prevailed for 39 years, and that is the Hyde \namendment. Here is where I don't understand the principle of the \nobjection--because the Hyde amendment has an exception, as the Senator \nknows, for the physical health and mental health of the mother, as \ncertified by a physician, and also in cases of rape. I can't imagine \nany case where a potential beneficiary of this fund would be excluded \nfrom services that would be allowed under the legislation as written. \nBut I would say if the Senator thinks that might be a fruitful area for \nus to continue conversations and to figure a way to structure this so \nthat it would be subject to an annual appropriation process--subject to \nthose limitations that have prevailed now since 1976--I think there \nmight be some room for discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren  pertaining to the introduction of S. 793 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I was here for nearly 3 hours this \nmorning when there was some spare time on the floor to get us refocused \non the issue at hand, which is the issue of the victims of sex \ntrafficking.\n  As I noted this morning, this is now the third biggest criminal \nenterprise in the world. The first is illegal drugs, the second illegal \nguns, and the third is the illegal sale of children. The average age of \na victim of sex trafficking is 12 years old--not even old enough to go \nto their first prom or not even old enough to get a driver's license. \nThat is what we are talking about here.\n  As I said, we have seen it in every part of the country. Just last \nweek, there was a case out of Rochester, MN, of a 12-year-old girl who \nwas charged by the U.S. Attorney's office. She got a text and went to a \nMcDonald's parking lot. She thought she was going to go to a party. She \ngot shoved in a car and got brought up to the Twin Cities, got raped. \nSexually explicit pictures were taken and posted on Craigslist by the \npimp. She was sold for sex to two men, raped by two men. Finally, the \nguys got caught and they have charged the case. So that is what we are \ntalking about here.\n  I know there are disagreements on the issues of our time, whether \nthey are the issues of our economy and the budget fight that is going \nto be coming up next week, or whether it is the issues of foreign \nrelations, but there shouldn't be a disagreement about this. This is a \nbipartisan bill. There is a provision in this bill that I don't believe \nneeds to be in this bill. There are some potential solutions here and I \nhope my colleagues are talking about them.\n  We have to refocus our efforts on what matters. That is what we have \nto remember. I am tired of looking back at who is blaming who and whose \nfault it is and now, somehow, it has gotten tied to the confirmation of \nthe next Attorney General of the United States. This makes no sense at \nall. If these issues are connected at all, it is simply because the \nAttorney General of the United States helps to enforce the sex \ntrafficking laws. Their office sometimes takes on Federal cases such as \nwe saw in the oil patch of North Dakota. They enforce our other laws, \nsuch as what we care about right now in Minnesota where we have had a \nnumber of people indicted for going to help ISIS, or we have had 20 \npeople indicted and 9 convictions for helping al-Shabaab, and here we \nhave an Attorney General who is immensely qualified and who literally \nhas the highest number out of her office of terrorism prosecutions in \nthe Nation. So let's just get Loretta Lynch confirmed. That is for \nstarters.\n  As to this bill, I would like to see a different tone as we discuss \nit. I would like to see people on both sides of the aisle talk about \nsolutions and remember what we are dealing with here. We have been able \nto deal with this issue on other bills. I don't understand why we can't \ndeal with it on this bill. Are these girls less important? Is this \nsomething that can just be a political football back and forth? I don't \nthink so.\n  I want to remind people that in addition to the bill that is on the \nfloor, Senator Cornyn's bill, which sets up a victims fund, there is \nanother bill, and that is the Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking \nAct. That is my bill. Senator Cornyn is the cosponsor. There are 19 \nbipartisan cosponsors. It is a bill that went through the Judiciary \nCommittee a few weeks ago--unanimously on the vote. Every single \nSenator voted for it. A similar version led by Representative Erik \nPaulsen of Minnesota has gone through the House. I like ours a little \nbetter because it includes a national sex trafficking strategy. Those \ntwo bills will be easily resolved to get this done.\n  My hope is--my bill is supposed to be the first amendment once we can \ngo on to this bill, once we get the fix of the bill--the provision of \nthe bill that is in controversy. I want to remind people that this bill \nis equally important. It sets a standard--the safe harbor bill--so \nother States will start looking at Minnesota and what about 15 other \nStates have done. It says these 12-year-olds are not criminals; they \nare victims.\n  How can you say a 12-year-old is a criminal? They are victims. Once \nyou start thinking like that, it changes the way you handle the cases. \nAs a former prosecutor, what matters to me is that when you change the \nway you look at the case, you have a better case because then you have \na victim who feels they have some place to go--a shelter. They can get \na job. They can get an education. They are much more likely to turn on \nthe pimp and to turn on the perpetrator that is running the sex ring.\n  In Minnesota, last year we got a 40-year sentence against a guy. John \nChoi, the chief attorney for Ramsey County, got a guy that was running \none of these rings. That is what is going on here when we talk about \nthis bill and the importance of passing this bill.\n  We have the 20 women Senators who came together and asked for a \nhearing on sex trafficking. We got that done. Now is the time where I \nhope we can come together and resolve this.\n  So one of the things I have taken to doing is reading Nicholas \nKristof and Sheryl WuDunn's great book ``Half the Sky.''\n  ``Half the Sky'' refers to women holding up half the sky. It refers \nto the fact that we have countries and systems that marginalize women \nand don't treat them as equal. This is not good for our world.\n  We have seen countries that do it the worst, that treat them as sex \nslaves, that allow that to happen. Those countries tend to have very \npoor human rights records. They tend not to be good partners for our \ncountry. If we\n\n[[Page S1619]]\n\nwant to lead the way for the world, we have to start on our own turf, \nwhere 86 percent of the victims in sex trafficking in the United States \nare from the United States.\n  If we are going to reach out to other countries, such as Heidi \nHeitkamp, Cindy McCain, and I did last spring--we went down to Mexico \nto work with them on some of the issues of cases on which they have \nactually helped in the United States with the U.S. attorney's office. \nWe need to be able to show that our country is doing the right thing, \nand this is an opportunity to do that.\n  So I have been reading from this book in part in the hope that we can \nchange the tone and remember who we are here to protect. It is also a \ngreat book. They have actually written another book as well that is \nfocused on domestic sex trafficking that I will be reading from \ntomorrow as well.\n  I note this is not an official filibuster, but whenever I have time \nand there is time on the floor, I am simply going to come down here to \nremind people of the importance of getting this bill done.\n  So we are talking in the book--I was in the chapter on ``Prohibition \nand Prostitution.'' I talked about the fact that ``the tools to crush \nmodern slavery''--I am reading from the book--``but the political will \nis lacking.''\n  That seems to be what is going on in this Chamber when extraneous \nbills are in the way of getting this done. When my Republican coauthor \nover in the House has said that these kinds of politics don't belong on \nthese bills, I agree.\n\n       The tools to crush modern slavery exist, but the political \n     will is lacking. That must be the starting point of any \n     abolitionist movement. We're not arguing that Westerners \n     should take up this cause because it's the fault of the West; \n     Western men do not play a central role in prostitution in \n     most poor countries. True, American and European sex tourists \n     are part of the problem in Thailand, the Philippines, Sri \n     Lanka, and Belize, but they are still only a small percentage \n     of the johns. The vast majority are local men. Moreover, \n     Western men usually go with girls who are more or less \n     voluntary prostitutes, because they want to take the girls \n     back to their hotel rooms, while forced prostitutes are not \n     normally allowed out of the brothels. So this is not a case \n     where we in the West have a responsibility to lead because \n     we're the source of the problem. Rather, we single out the \n     West because, even though we're peripheral to the slavery, \n     our action is necessary to overcome a horrific evil.\n\n  So that is my argument here, that by doing something here in this \nChamber and by showing that we care about these girls in the United \nStates, then we show we care internationally and it should be a major \ntenet of our foreign policy.\n\n       One reason the modern abolitionist movement hasn't been \n     more effective is the divisive politics of prostitution.\n\n  I talked about this earlier today. The issue that we have is that a \nnumber of people way back--including the late great Senator Paul \nWellstone of Minnesota, Senator Brownback of Kansas, Hillary Rodham \nClinton, Carolyn Maloney, whom I just left on the Joint Economic \nCommittee, and George W. Bush--showed great leadership in this area. So \nwe have seen time and again people being able to come together across \nparty lines to get this done.\n  So they talk about how things have changed, and they say that ``over \ntime, we've changed our minds'' about how we look at this. They talk \nabout the fact that it used to be: Well, let's legalize prostitution \nand regulate. That will really work. I think we have learned that it \nwill never really work. It doesn't work in those countries that have \ntried it, and it certainly doesn't work for these young girls who are \nvictims of the sex trade. So they talk about how we, in fact, through \nlaw enforcement, need to go after the profits and we have to take this \non. That is what the bills we are considering help to do. They give \nState and local prosecutors and shelters the tools that they need.\n  They say:\n\n       We won't eliminate prostitution. In Iran, brothels are \n     strictly banned, and the mayor of Tehran was a law-and-order \n     hard-liner until, according to Iranian news accounts, he was \n     arrested in a police raid on a brothel where he was in the \n     company of six naked prostitutes. So crackdowns don't work \n     perfectly, but they tend to lead nervous police to demand \n     higher bribes, which reduces profitability for the pimps. Or \n     the police will close down at least those brothels that \n     aren't managed by other police officers. With such methods, \n     we can almost certainly reduce the number of fourteen-year-\n     old girls who are held in cages until they die of AIDS.\n\n  This is happening in our world.\n\n       ``It's pretty doable,'' says Gary Haugen, who runs \n     International Justice Mission. ``You don't have to arrest \n     everybody. You just have to get enough that it sends a ripple \n     effect and changes the calculations. That changes the pimps' \n     behavior. You can drive traffickers of virgin village girls \n     to fence stolen radios instead.''\n       Many liberals and feminists are taken aback by the big \n     stick approach we advocate, arguing that it just drives sex \n     establishments underground. They argue instead for a \n     legalize-and-regulate model based on empowerment of sex \n     workers, and they cite a success: The Sonagachi Project.\n       Sonagachi, which means ``golden tree,'' is a sprawling red-\n     light district in Kolkata. In the 1700s and 1800s, it had \n     been a legendary locale for concubines. Today it has hundreds \n     of multistory brothels built along narrow alleys, housing \n     more than six thousand prostitutes. In the early 1990s, \n     health experts were deeply concerned about the spread of AIDS \n     in India, and in 1992 they started [this project]. . . . A \n     key element was to nurture a union of sex workers . . . which \n     would encourage condom use and thus reduce the spread of AIDS \n     through prostitution.\n       DMSC seemed successful in encouraging the use of condoms. \n     It publicized its role as a pragmatic solution to the public \n     health problems of prostitution. One study found [this \n     project] increased . . . condom use by 25 percent.\n\n  They go on to explain it.\n  But then they say--and this is key to our approach to trying not to \nallow prostitution to continue:\n\n       As we probed the numbers, however, we saw that they were \n     flimsier than they at first appeared. HIV prevalence was \n     inexplicably high among new arrivals . . . 27.7 percent among \n     sex workers aged twenty or younger. Research had also shown \n     that, initially, all sex workers interviewed . . . claimed to \n     use condoms nearly all the time. But when pressed, they \n     admitted lower rates. . . .\n\n  This goes on and they talk about the problem with this. What we are \ntalking about here is underage girls and what is really going on.\n  I am going to quote from one story they told when they went to this \nbrothel.\n\n       While the madam spoke with others in the room, gushing \n     about the group's success, the three of us on the bed asked \n     the prostitute in Hindi to tell us if those things were true. \n     Afraid and timid, the prostitute remained silent until we \n     assured her that we wouldn't get her in trouble. Barely \n     audible, she told us that almost none of the prostitutes . . \n     . came with aspirations of being a sex worker. Most of them \n     like herself were trafficked. . . . When I asked her if she \n     wanted to leave Sonagachi, her eyes lit up; before she could \n     say anything, the DMSC official put her hand on my back and \n     said that it was time to move on. . . .\n\n  These are stories about how it doesn't really work to have this model \nof allowing the prostitution to continue and regulate.\n\n       In the developing world, however, this difficult, \n     polarizing debate is mostly just a distraction. In India, for \n     example, brothels are technically illegal--but, as we said \n     earlier, they are ubiquitous--the same is true in Cambodia. \n     In poor countries, the law is often irrelevant, particularly \n     outside the capital. Our focus has to be on changing reality, \n     not changing laws.\n       Congress took an important step in that direction in 2000 \n     by requiring the State Department to put out an annual \n     Trafficking in Persons report--the TIP report.\n\n  I will remind again that this was done on a bipartisan basis. We \ndidn't see the kind of fights we are having now because people decided \nthat here is one thing that we could agree on--from Paul Wellstone to \nSam Brownback--and that perhaps without having outside political \ndebates, we can agree that we do not want young girls aged 12 to be sex \ntrafficked.\n  What did this report do?\n\n       The report ranks countries according to how they tackle \n     trafficking, and those in the lowest tier are sanctioned. \n     This meant that for the first time U.S. embassies abroad had \n     to gather information on trafficking. American diplomats \n     began holding discussions with their foreign ministry \n     counterparts, who then had to add trafficking to the list of \n     major concerns such as proliferation and terrorism. As a \n     result, the foreign ministries made inquiries of the national \n     police agencies.\n       Simply asking questions put the issue on the agenda. \n     Countries began passing laws, staging crackdowns, and \n     compiling fact sheets. Pimps found that the cost of bribing \n     police went up, eroding their profit margins.\n       This approach can be taken further. Within the State \n     Department, the trafficking office has been marginalized, \n     even relegated to another building. If the secretary of state \n     publicly and actively embraced the trafficking office--\n\n  I think we see this has happened since this book was written--since \n2009\n\n[[Page S1620]]\n\nunder Secretary Clinton and Secretary Kerry.\n\n     . . . that would elevate the issue's profile. The President \n     could visit a shelter . . .\n\n  And, by the way, that is something that Heidi Heitkamp, Cindy McCain, \nand I did when we went to Mexico.\n\n       Europe should have made trafficking an issue in negotiating \n     the accession of Eastern European countries wishing to enter \n     the European Union, and it can still make this an issue for \n     Turkey in that regard.\n       The big-stick approach should focus in particular on the \n     sale of virgins. Such transactions, particularly in Asia, \n     account for a disproportionate share of trafficker profits \n     and kidnappings of young teenagers. And the girls, once \n     raped, frequently resign themselves to being prostitutes \n     until they die. It is often rich Asians, particularly \n     overseas Chinese, who are doing the buying--put a few of them \n     in jail, and good things will happen: The market for virgins \n     will quickly shrink, their price will drop, gangs will shift \n     to less risky and more profitable lines of business, the \n     average age of prostitutes will rise somewhat, and the degree \n     of compulsion in prostitution will diminish as well.\n\n  This is from ``Half the Sky,'' written by New York Times reporter \nNicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn. They have a more recent book that \nthey have written called ``A Path Appears,'' and this is about domestic \nprostitution, which I will also be reading from. But I thought I would \nstart that tomorrow, as we continue to focus on this, so people \nunderstand what we are really talking about.\n  As we all know, the bills before the Senate today are about domestic \ntrafficking. They are about what is happening in the United States \nright now in every town in this country.\n  We talked earlier this morning about why this is happening, why we \nare seeing this kind of increase, and we are talking about it more. The \nreason is that more and more because of the Internet people can \nanonymously advertise. They can send instant messages and texts. It is \njust more hidden, and it is harder to track down for law enforcement. \nThat is part of why we are seeing this going on right now and why this \nis such a major issue in our country.\n  I would tie it into our international theme, because, again, first of \nall, we have a percentage of these victims--mostly girls--who come from \nforeign countries. So it matters to us what goes on in foreign \ncountries with their law, which is the focus of ``Half the Sky.''\n  But it also matters to us because we want a better world, and we want \nthese countries to do better. We don't want to put all our money in \nmilitary spending. We want these countries to become democracies, to \nbecome trading partners, to become places that we can work with. \nInstead, if we allow these girls to be subjugated and we allow them to \nbe chattel and we allow them to be treated like slaves, they are never \ngoing to get the kind of democracy that we want them to get to and that \nwill allow for a better country. You are not going to have a woman \nelected to the Senate in one of these countries if they believe that \nwomen can be treated as chattel, as we are seeing in so many of these \nplaces.\n  So I am going to go to the next part of the chapter, which is called \n``Rescuing Girls Is the Easy Part.''\n\n       We became slave owners in the twenty-first century the old-\n     fashioned way: We paid cash in exchange for two slave girls \n     and a couple of receipts. The girls were then ours to do with \n     as we liked.\n       Rescuing girls from brothels is the easy part, however. The \n     challenge is keeping them from returning. The stigma that the \n     girls feel in their communities after being freed, coupled \n     with drug dependencies or threats from pimps, often lead them \n     to return to the red-light district. It's emotionally \n     dispiriting for well-meaning aid workers who oversee a \n     brothel raid to take the girls back to a shelter and give \n     them food and medical care, only to see the girls climb over \n     the back wall.\n\n  That is what I talked about earlier. That is why, when we look at it \nfrom a U.S. perspective, what these bills focus on is trying to turn \nthese girls' lives around and trying to set that standard. We are not \nmandating it in other States; we are simply creating some incentives \nand giving them some funding so that States can start doing these cases \nin a different way and start seeing them as victims and making it \neasier to go after the people who are running the ring.\n  Back to the book:\n\n       Our unusual purchase came about when Nick--\n\n  Referring here to Nick Kristof--\n\n     traveled with Naka Nathaniel, then a New York Times \n     videographer, to an area in northwestern Cambodia notorious \n     for its criminality. Nick and Naka arrived at the town of \n     Poipet and checked into an $8-a-night guest house that \n     doubled as a brothel. They focused their interviews on two \n     teenage girls, Srey Neth and Srey Momm, each in a different \n     brothel.\n       Neth was very pretty, short and light-skinned. She looked \n     fourteen or fifteen, but she thought she was older than that; \n     she had no idea of her actual birth date. A woman pimp \n     brought her to Nick's room, and she sat on the bed, quivering \n     with fear. She had been in the brothel only a month, and Nick \n     would have been her first foreign customer. Nick needed his \n     interpreter present in the room as well, and this puzzled the \n     pimp, who nevertheless accommodated.\n       Black hair fell over Neth's shoulders and onto her tight \n     pink T-shirt. Below, she wore equally tight blue jeans, and \n     sandals. Neth had plump cheeks, but the best of her was thin \n     and fragile; thick makeup caked her face in a way that seemed \n     incongruous, as if she were a child who had played with her \n     mother's cosmetics.\n       After some awkward conversation through the interpreter, as \n     Nick asked Neth about how she had grown up and about her \n     family, she began to calm down. She stopped trembling and \n     mostly looked in the direction of the television in the \n     corner of the room, which Nick had put on to muffle the sound \n     of their voices. She responded to questions briefly and \n     without interest.\n\n  Now we have been joined--I am going to stop reading from the book for \na while. Senator Feinstein has come to the floor. Senator Feinstein has \nbeen a true leader on this issue of sex trafficking. She is a senior \nmember of the Judiciary Committee--the only other woman on the \nJudiciary Committee besides me, with, I think, 20-some guys. She knows \nhow important this issue is. I know she is going to talk a little bit \nabout that as well as some other things. I welcome her to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  As Senator Klobuchar stated, I come to the floor to speak on the sex \ntrafficking bill. I know it is now held up by certain language, which I \nwill go into in the details of my remarks, but briefly, I would like to \nbegin by describing the bill's highlights. The bill clarifies that a \nperson who buys a sex act from a minor or other trafficking victim can \nbe prosecuted under the Federal commercial sex trafficking statute. The \nbill authorizes block grants for State and local governments to develop \nprograms to rescue trafficking victims and investigate and prosecute \ntraffickers. The bill also includes nearly all of the provisions from \nthe Combat Human Trafficking Act which Senator Portman and I introduced \nin January.\n  I am very grateful to the authors--Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nCornyn--for adding these. Those provisions establish a minimum period \nof 5 years of supervised release for a person who conspires to violate \nthe commercial sex trafficking statute.\n  It would require the Justice Department to train on investigating and \nprosecuting buyers, on seeking restitution, and on connecting victims \nwith health services. It would require reporting on sex trafficking \nprosecutions. It would expand wiretap authority to cover all human \ntrafficking offenses. It would expand the rights of crime victims--\nsomething I have been interested in since Senator Kyl and I did the \nCrime Victims' Bill of Rights.\n  The bill, which is not controversial, should pass, except for the \nsurreptitious inclusion--I use this word considered--of a provision \nthat is known as the Hyde amendment. The provision was not included by \nlanguage but by cross-reference to provisions in another previously \nenacted appropriations bill.\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       Limitations. Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred \n     from the Fund, shall be subject to the limitations on the use \n     or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of \n     division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 \n     (Public Law 113-76; 128 Stat. 409) to the same extent as if \n     amounts in the Fund were funds appropriated under division H \n     of such Act.\n\n  This provision was not included in the bill Senator Cornyn introduced \nlast Congress, which I cosponsored. His staff approached my staff and \nstaffs of other Senators early in 2015. They asked if I would cosponsor \nagain. My staff asked whether the bill was identical to last year's \nbill and for an explanation of any changes that were\n\n[[Page S1621]]\n\nmade. Senator Cornyn's staff then sent back an email with a list of \nchanges--seven changes in all. That list did not include the Hyde \namendment language that had been added. That language was not mentioned \nto my staff at any point.\n  In other words, an important and sensitive change was made to the \nbill and was not disclosed upon request. That does not excuse us for \nnot catching this, but if you see the complicated and sort of \nobfuscated nature of this--I am not saying it is intended obfuscation, \nbut all of the numbers that are in there--I think it makes it \nunderstandable.\n  If the Hyde amendment--which is what this is--if that language comes \nout, this bill will pass easily.\n  Let me address for a moment the enormous problem we are trying to \naddress with this bill. Today, high demand and easy access fuels a huge \namount of sex trafficking. Human trafficking today is the second \nlargest criminal industry in the world. It is only behind illegal \ndrugs.\n  In 2005, human trafficking was a $32 billion criminal enterprise. \nToday, some 9 years later, it is a $150 billion estimate of illegal \ngains. Two-thirds of the proceeds from human trafficking come from sex \ntrafficking.\n  Children as young as 12, 13, and 14 can be found on the street or \nover the Internet. It is not an exaggeration to say that this is \nmodern-day slavery. Those victims are moved against their will to \ncities throughout the country and even to other countries, wherever \ndemand is high.\n  Trafficking rings are also run by gangs. In San Diego, for example, \nprofits are so great and the risk of being caught so minimal that rival \ngangs do not fight each other over sex trafficking, as they do when \ndrugs are involved.\n  Some traffickers make as much as $33,000 per week. These are numbers \ngathered by the Urban Institute: Atlanta, gross take per trafficker per \nweek, $32,833; Denver, $31,200; Seattle, $18,000; Miami, $17,741; \nDallas, $12,025; Washington, DC, $11,588; and San Diego, $11,129. This \nis weekly gross cash intake per individual trafficker.\n  Traffickers lure victims through promises of love and money or \nsometimes use an older trafficked girl as a recruiter. Those criminals \nprey on the most vulnerable children in our society, including those \nwho are homeless or in the foster care system. They target children who \nhave been victims of sexual abuse. Once they have a victim under their \ncontrol, they may traffic him or her from city to city based on demand.\n  For example, this is a slide of California. It is from the Orange \nCounty Human Trafficking Task Force, and it shows the route traffickers \ntake to move victims around the State of California to meet demand. You \ncan see these circles from Oakland to Sacramento and then down into the \nInland Empire and then from Los Angeles all the way around into the \nInland Empire. So you can actually track various routes. Orange County \ndid this. The orange center here is meant to be Orange County.\n  This particular task force is comprised of a number of Federal and \nlocal law enforcement agencies in Orange County, including Anaheim and \nHuntington Beach police departments, the U.S. Attorney's Office, the \nFBI, and the District Attorney's Office.\n  Now, here it comes: Regardless of how children are first trafficked, \none thing is almost universal--victims will be advertised on the \nInternet. By one estimate, 76 percent of child sex trafficking \nvictims--76 percent of them are sold over the Internet.\n  My staff and I have spoken with a number of law enforcement officials \nin California about the Internet's role in connecting sellers of \nunderage children with buyers. Nearly every single official we spoke \nwith said the Internet is the primary means to connect sellers with \nbuyers. So this is where we next must take decisive steps to stop sex \ntrafficking. Purveyors of these online ads must be held accountable. \nSenator Kirk and I have an amendment that will do that.\n  There are at least 19 distinct Web sites that accept ads relating to \ntrafficking underage boys and girls. Here they are: Backpage.com; \nEscortAds\n.xxx; ErosAds.com; EscortsInCollege.com; AsianEscortSF.com; \nEscortsInThe.us; LiveEscortReviews.com; MyProvider\nGuide.com; EroticMugShots.com; NaughtyReviews.com; EscortPhone\nList.com; RubAds.com; Eros.com; TheEroticReview.com; RubMaps.com; \nAPerfectSin.com; EscortDater.com; MyRedBook.com; and NightShift.com. \nNineteen Web sites act as purveyors of child sex trafficking in this \ncountry. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\n  This site I am going to show you, Backpage.com, allows a purveyor to \npost an advertisement for an escort or a body rub. In fact, nearly all \nof these ads are for commercial sex acts; many of them depict minors. \nWhen you view an ad for an escort or a body rub, you will see pictures \nof young girls, often with few or no clothes on.\n  Now I am going to show you two girls. The first is a missing 17-year-\nold girl. She is here as a runaway. This is a listing of the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, a very legitimate \norganization which I am fully in support of. It is entitled \n``Endangered Runaway,'' and it is information about her, her date of \nbirth, her age, her sex, her race, and all of it, and where you can get \nin touch if you have any information.\n\n  I wish to show how this is also used. This is the same girl on \nBackpage, and this essentially says:\n\n       Hello Texas,\n       Are you looking for an unforgettable experience? Look no \n     further!\n       I am 100% Great service provider!\n       I am very down to earth, warm, sensitive, passionate,\n       and genuinely interested in giving you a great experience.\n\n  And it goes on and on.\n  This is the same picture of this same girl.\n  We blocked out the image, and it is shocking. It is simply shocking \nthat this is going on to the extent it is in our country, right in a \nribald way on the Internet.\n  Law enforcement officials and anti-trafficking organizations say \nthere are a number of key indicators that allow them to identify ads \nthat are likely for trafficking victims.\n  In this advertisement we see three of those key indicators. First, \nthe title states the victim is ``New to your City.'' Anti-trafficking \norganizations say this is code for being underage. You may also see \ngirls in ads described as ``new,'' ``fresh,'' or ``new in town'' to \nindicate they are underage. Second, we see a victim is listed from \noutside the area. Here she is listed as from Miami for a posting that \nis in the Houston area.\n  Third, the victim also has an out-of-area phone number.\n  Those are three indicators of what this ad is for--to sell sex with \nchildren. Law enforcement and experts confirm this point.\n  The Cook County Sheriff's Office in Illinois found that 100 percent \nof women claiming to be massage therapists or platonic escorts on one \nWeb site, Backpage, were being sold for sex. This isn't mine, this is \nthe Cook County Sheriff's Office.\n  The sheriff's office set up so-called dates with 618 girls via \nBackpage. All 618 agreed to provide sex for money.\n  The sheriff's office concluded: ``This presents irrefutable evidence \nthat Backpage is indeed a haven for pimps and sex solicitors who are \nvictimizing women and girls for their own gain. Any notion that \nBackpage employs a legitimate business model simply does not stand up \nto the facts.''\n  This is a direct letter from Sheriff Tom Dart, Cook County, IL.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na memorandum to Sheriff Tom Dart.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Cook County Sheriff's Office Memorandum\n\n     Date: 6/9/2014.\n     To: Sheriff Thomas J. Dart.\n     From: Deputy Chief Michael Anton, Cook County Sheriff's \n         Police.\n     Subject: Backpage.com Arrests.\n       Per Sheriff Dart's direction, the Cook County Sheriff's \n     Police Vice Unit has utilized Backpage.com as its primary \n     forum for recovering victims of human trafficking in Cook \n     County. Please find our year-to-year Backpage arrest \n     statistics\n\n       Cook County Sheriff's Police Arrests Off of Backpage:\n       2009: 142\n       2010: 108\n       2011: 63\n\n[[Page S1622]]\n\n       2012: 121\n       2013: 135\n       2014 (through the end of May): 49\n       Total: 618\n\n       Additionally, the Cook County Sheriff's Police Vice Unit \n     has made 42 arrests for Involuntary Servitude, Human \n     Trafficking or Prostitution since 2007, with many of those \n     investigations originating from responses to Backpage ads.\n       It is important to note that 100% of the women claiming to \n     be massage therapists or platonic escorts on Backpage have \n     accepted the offer of money for sex from our undercover male \n     officers. Our team has set up ``dates'' with 618 via this \n     website--all 618 have turned out to be prostitutes. This \n     presents irrefutable evidence that Backpage is indeed a haven \n     for pimps and sex solicitors who are victimizing women and \n     girls for their own gain. Any notion that Backpage employs a \n     legitimate business model simply does not stand up to the \n     facts.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A study of ads placed in this year's Super Bowl in \nPhoenix concludes that 65 percent of the ads placed on Backpage's \nPhoenix Web site around the weekend of the game had indicators that the \nad was for a victim of sex trafficking.\n  Simply put, there are Internet companies that are profiting off the \nrape and abuse of children. This must stop.\n  One way we can combat sex trafficking over the Internet is to make it \na crime for a person such as the owner of a Web site to knowingly \nadvertise a commercial sex act with a minor. As I said, Senator Kirk \nand I have introduced such an amendment. It would create a new offense \nof knowingly advertising a commercial sex act with a minor on the \nInternet.\n  The amendment is identical to a House bill that has 52 cosponsors and \npassed that Chamber by voice vote.\n  If we come to a point where we are voting on amendments to Senator \nCornyn's bill, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I \nknow Senator Kirk and I would bring it to the floor.\n  Last October, 53 attorneys general offered a letter to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in support of the bill that Senator Kirk and I \nintroduced last June that is similar to the amendment. This is the list \nof the attorneys general.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter of 53 attorneys general.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 2014.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We, the \n     undersigned state and territorial attorneys general, urge you \n     to join us in the fight against human trafficking in the \n     United States. We commend your recent action to pass \n     legislation to increase federal penalties and victim \n     restitution and encourage you to act to protect children from \n     being trafficked on the Internet by passing S. 2536, the Stop \n     Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act (SAVE Act).\n       Human trafficking is tied as the second largest and is the \n     fastest growing criminal industry in the world, generating \n     roughly $150 billion each year. According to a study of \n     Department of Justice human trafficking task force cases, 83 \n     percent of sex trafficking victims identified in the United \n     States were U.S. citizens. Shockingly, there are numerous \n     cases nationally of children being used in prostitution as \n     young as 12.\n       Every day, children in the United States are sold for sex. \n     The use of the ``adult services sections'' on websites such \n     as Backpage.com has created virtual brothels where children \n     are bought and sold using euphemistic labels such as \n     ``escorts.'' The involvement of these advertising companies \n     is not accidental--these companies have constructed their \n     business models around income gained from those participating \n     in commercial sex. In just one week this June, law \n     enforcement arrested 281 alleged sex traffickers and took 168 \n     children out of prostitution in a nationwide FBI crackdown \n     where many child victims were offered for sale on ``escort'' \n     and other ``adult services'' websites. Organized crime groups \n     as well as street gangs are involved with human trafficking, \n     and many of these perpetrators use the Internet to sell their \n     victims.\n       The undersigned attorneys general respectfully request that \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee pass the SAVE Act so that \n     these websites that are facilitating trafficking through \n     their very business model will have to take steps to verify \n     the identity of individuals posting advertisements and the \n     age of those who appear in these advertisements.\n       We thank you in advance for your continued dedication to \n     the eradication of human trafficking.\n         Greg Zoeller, Indiana Attorney General; Luther Strange, \n           Alabama Attorney General; Tom Horne, Arizona Attorney \n           General; Kamala Harris, California Attorney General; \n           George Jepsen, Connecticut Attorney General; Irvin \n           Nathan, District of Columbia Attorney General; Robert \n           W.

Sorrell, Vermont Attorney General; \n           Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia Attorney General.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The attorneys general wrote:\n\n       The use of the ``adult services sections'' on websites such \n     as Backpage.com has created virtual brothels where children \n     are bought and sold using euphemistic labels such as \n     ``escorts.''\n\n  This is a quote from a letter to this effect--I don't want anybody to \nthink this is what I am saying, it is what they are saying.\n\n       The use of the term ``adult services sections'' on websites \n     such as Backpage.com has created virtual brothels where \n     children are bought and sold using euphemistic labels such as \n     ``escorts.''\n\n  Put simply, if you have knowledge that an advertisement placed on \nyour Web site is for commercial sex with a minor, then you should be \nprosecuted. That is what our amendment would do.\n  I have no doubt that prohibiting misconduct by a Web site owner is \nconstitutional. As the Supreme Court has held on several occasions: \n``Offers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically excluded \nfrom First Amendment protection.''\n  In fact, the Supreme Court in 1973 wrote: ``We have no doubt that a \nnewspaper constitutionally could be forbidden to publish a want ad \nproposing a sale of narcotics or soliciting prostitutes.''\n  This amendment targets illegal conduct--commercial sex with minors--\nthat would not be protected by the First Amendment.\n  It imposes liability on Web sites that know that their sites are \nbeing used to advertise minors for sex.\n  In conclusion, the Internet has made this industry what it is, the \nsecond largest criminal industry in the world, second only to drugs, \nand it is up to us to do something about it.\n  One of our duties in this body is to protect the most vulnerable of \nindividuals. That includes children, and this is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  Some say other parts of the bill will help stop sex trafficking, and \nwe don't need to touch the Internet. That makes no sense to me. \nSeventy-six percent of sales of sex trafficking victims begin on the \nInternet. So you can just touch\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\na small part of it--this touches 76 percent of victims.\n  We cannot allow these Web sites to continue to operate with impunity. \nIt is time to take a stand, stop the ads, and stop the exploitation of \nchildren.\n  I look forward to Senator Kirk coming to the floor, presenting our \namendment, assuming we can get past this block. This is so much more \nimportant than putting the Hyde amendment, cloaked in difficult \nlanguage, in this bill, when the House bill doesn't contain it. The \nHouse understands that it is going to have difficulty passing it with \nthis in the bill. Why isn't that recognized in this House? If they take \nthat out, this bill swims through.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I was in my office and watching the Senator on TV, so I \nthought I would come to the floor and maybe we could get to the bottom \nof this. There seems to be a ship passing in the night, it seems to me.\n  I know the Senator from California cares passionately about this \nissue, and I don't question that for a moment. It is very clear to me. \nBut I ask the Senator from California, she graciously agreed to \ncosponsor this legislation?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I did.\n  Mr. CORNYN. She voted for it in the Senate Judiciary Committee that \npassed unanimously. It does contain, on page 50 and 51 of this bill, \nthe language that the Senator referred to. I saw it on my TV screen in \nmy office, which incorporates the limitation that was contained in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. It incorporates that into the \nbill by reference.\n  Not only--I believe the Senator voted for the bill in committee and \ncosponsored it. The Senator also voted for that limitation in the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2014. This is the same or similar \nlanguage of what was contained in the Affordable Care Act, contained in \nthe Defense authorization bill, and contained in literally every \nappropriations bill since 1976.\n  This is what I would love to have my friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia, explain to me: Why is it that it all of a sudden becomes \nobjectionable on this legislation--when you care and I care so \npassionately about getting help for these victims--that this is the \nreason to derail the legislation?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because of what this legislation is. This legislation \nis the raping and the misconduct, sexually, with young girls, girls 14, \n15, and 16. What if they are impregnated? Should they be entitled to be \nable to go and get an abortion? Does this body really want them to be \nforced to bear somebody else's child?\n  So this offers the opportunity for some funding. These aren't wealthy \ngirls. They don't live in Beverly Hills, Hyde Park, or any of these \nplaces that are prominent. They are on the streets. They are lost, \nmaybe lost mentally, lost physically. They may have been abused, and \nnow they are caught up in an industry where they are held hostage in \nthe night.\n  I have read of some in a neighborhood in my city being handcuffed at \nnight, stripped, so they don't have clothes and can't run away. They \nare put out on the streets, they are watched. They are moved around. If \nit becomes too hot in one area, they are moved to another. They are \nmoved to another State, and they come from other countries.\n  It just seems to me to have this in this bill--and, Senator, I have \ngreat respect for you. I have wanted to work with you on this. I know \nyou are sincere.\n  It is not in the House bill. So maybe the House understands this. I \ncan't speak for the House.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am pleased to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Otherwise, we are going to have to keep addressing \nquestions through the Chair and keep asking for permission. I think it \nis great to have an honest conversation with my friend.\n  So it is clear that the Senator from California has voted for this \nrestriction on use of taxpayer funding for abortions previously, \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Not to my knowledge. Let me put it that way. Now you \ncan blame me and say I should have known--I am not the only one on our \ncommittee, Senator, who is in this position, either, who communicated \nwith your staff and was under the impression that the bill was \nidentical to last year, with the exception of seven pieces, which are \nnot this. The seven were detailed to us.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I am not going to engage in a debate about whether the \nSenator should have known or how she voted in the past. I believe the \nrecord would demonstrate that she and others voted for the Affordable \nCare Act, which actually National Abortion Rights Action League says is \nan expansion of the Hyde amendment.\n  I ask the Senator, you rightly point out that these child victims of \nsexual assault will have been raped, either statutory rape--they are \nbelow the age of consent--or they are adults and they have been \nassaulted, criminally assaulted.\n  Isn't it your understanding of the Hyde amendment that the exclusion \nto the Hyde amendment would still allow them to gain access to the \nservices that you believe they need or deserve?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. I think that is correct. I suppose we could \nchange this to have a rape implication, but the gauntlet has been \nthrown down. And it is not up to me alone to remove it. There was no \nopen discussion in our committee when we discussed this that there was \na highly sensitive issue in it, Senator.\n\n  Now, I will plead mea culpa. And guess what. I will wave a whip and \nget my staff and say: Look henceforth at every code change. But my \ncolleague and I both know that occasionally things slip through. I will \nplead mea culpa on that. But once I found out, I had an obligation to \ndo something about it.\n  So I am pleading with my colleague, let's just take it out. Let's \njust pass this bill. Let's put the Kirk-Feinstein amendment in. Let's \ngo after the Internet purveyors. Let's go after 19 sites that put \npictures of girls 12, 13, and 14 to be sold all around the United \nStates, to be sold after big football games in various areas of the \ncountry. Let's go after them. Isn't that more important?\n  I would like to ask my colleague a question.\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is the reason I am so confused by the filibuster of \nthis legislation by people, including my friend, who are cosponsors of \nthe legislation and who already voted for it.\n  I am not about pointing fingers in terms of what staff or Members \nshould have read or understood about the legislation, but I believe the \nreason it was not debated at the Judiciary Committee level is because \nit had become a routine matter since 1976, when the Hyde amendment was \npassed. Every appropriation of Labor-HHS or other funding that could \narguably use tax dollars for abortions has been limited by the Hyde \namendment language.\n  I had a couple of Senators in my office yesterday afternoon who are \nproudly pro-choice. I am proudly pro-life. But even my pro-choice \nfriends said we still believe taxpayer funds should not be used for \nabortions except in the case of rape or to protect the health of the \nvictim.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, why then, if I may ask a question, \nrespectfully.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Sure.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Why isn't it in the House language?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to my friend that I can't vouch for the \nHouse's product. I can just say what the Congress as a whole has done \nsince 1976, and it has limited the expenditure of funds for this \npurpose under the terms of the Hyde amendment.\n  That was the reason we referred in the legislation, on page 50, which \nmy colleague has blown up here, referring to the language in the \nCommittee on Appropriations, which I am confident my friend, the \nSenator from California, voted for, just as she did in the limitation \nthat was contained in the Affordable Care Act and all the other times \nthat Hyde has been part of our process. This has become so unremarkable \nand so routine that it hardly seems like something someone would point \nout because this language doesn't change the status quo at all.\n  So we have talked about ways to get past this impasse, and I would \njust\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\nhave to say I think abandoning the Hyde amendment would be a dramatic \nmistake and something I am not willing to be a part of. It has become \nthis one area, in a divisive area of abortion, where there has been \nbipartisan consensus for 39 years, at least to the point it has \nremained the law of the land effectively. To take it out and say \nsomehow we are going to depart from that today or this week would, to \nme, be a dramatic expansion of taxpayer funding for this purpose that I \ncan't support.\n  So I would say, if there are ways we can deal with this fund, as a \nfund that can be appropriated on an annual basis subject to the normal \nrestrictions--that is something I talked about with the ranking member, \nour friend from Vermont, that possibility--I think there are ways we \nmight be able to get to a solution. But stripping out this limitation, \nwhich has been the law of the land for 39 years, is not acceptable \nbecause it would represent a huge expansion on the use of taxpayer \nfunding for abortions in ways many of my pro-choice friends don't \nsupport.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, I guess I disagree with that. Those of us who \nbelieve a woman should control her own reproductive system, in concert \nwith her family and her doctor, have objection to the government \ngetting involved and telling us what to do. It is actually not your \nreproductive system--and I say ``you'' generically, as a man--it is our \nreproductive system. In a sense this has been a battle for our \nidentity.\n  I sat on a term-setting and paroling authority in California in the \n1960s, when abortion was illegal. I sentenced women to State prison for \nabortion. It had then an indeterminate sentence of between 6 months and \n10 years. I saw abortionists come back to prison. I asked one, when I \nwas setting the sentence: Why do you keep doing this? Her first name \nwas Anita. And she said: Because I feel so sorry for the women.\n  That was the way it was. I remember passing the plate at Stanford for \na young woman to go to Tijuana for an abortion. The morbidity that was \ndone to women through back-alley abortions, this has opened a Pandora's \nbox of big emotional issues for women.\n  As to the Hyde amendment, if there is rape and you can prove it, that \nis right; and then there is a 12-year-old, a 13-year-old who is out on \nthe streets as a prostitute, which is a different thing--sort of the \nsame but sort of different. The overwhelming evil of this trade \novercomes any of this, because you take a young woman, and you probably \nchange their life for the worse for the rest of her life.\n  Imagine your daughter being out on the street; my daughter, my \ngranddaughters being out on the street like this and what it would do \nto them being handcuffed and moved and traded around the country and \ngirls brought from Nepal through India, all over Europe. This is what \nis going on in the world today, and we are sitting here arguing \nessentially about the availability of an abortion in this area. To me, \nthat is so secondary to the enormous harm that is being done.\n  I have great respect for my colleague. He has been a very \ndistinguished jurist in his State. He makes sense when he speaks on the \nJudiciary Committee. We have listened to each other for more than a \ndecade now. Let this drop. Let us get on with the work of this bill--\nand the work of this bill isn't completed until we get some of the \namendments that relate to the bill--and then I think we can debate this \nanother day.\n  I would say I plead a mea culpa. I wish I had known. All I can say is \nI did not know. Is that my fault? Probably. But I didn't know. So if \nyou don't know, and you make a mistake, isn't the right thing to try to \nset that right? That is what we have tried to do, and women on our \nside, and some on my colleague's side, feel very strongly about this.\n  My colleague knows over the years we have lost virtually every battle \nthat has been on this floor and we are tired of it. So we are taking a \nstand and we are going to hold that stand.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I obviously don't agree with my friend \nfrom California, but I respect her for answering the questions I have \nposed here today. I just find it a terrible shame we are going to \nrelitigate what has been the law of the land for 39 years on this bill \nin a way that would block help to the very people I know the Senator \nfrom California cares so passionately about.\n  If we are going to undo the Hyde amendment, which the Senator has \nvoted for in some form or another repeatedly over the years, then we \nare not going to make any progress. If we can find some other way to \nstructure the funds so the appropriators will have a more direct role \nin appropriating the fines and penalties paid into this fund on an \nannual basis, I think maybe there is some room to talk. But I thank the \nSenator for her courtesy in answering my questions. I am sorry we find \nourselves at this loggerhead, but I hope at some point that can be \nresolved.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I say one more thing? It is my understanding--\nbreaking news coming here--that there is no language in Federal statute \non sex trafficking that defines a trafficking survivor as a victim of \nrape. So the victim would have to prove she is a victim of rape.\n  Now, look at what happens. I don't know if in my colleague's legal \ncareer it took him close to very young victims of this who cover up and \nwho don't want to let people know. I am sure my colleague knows all of \nthe vicissitudes, the hard life. We are asking someone to prove it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would say to my friend that when I was attorney general \nof Texas for 4 years, I had responsibility for administering the Crime \nVictims' Compensation Fund as part of my duties of office, and we \nworked very directly with victims groups, including those who took care \nof very young children who had been sexually assaulted, sometimes by \nmembers of their own family--just the worst, the most reprehensible \nsorts of crimes.\n  But if I can ask the Senator just one last question. Of course, we \nhave had the procedural vote on the floor, twice now, where Democrats \nhave blocked our ability to both vote on amendments, including \namendments the Senator may have with the Senator from Illinois, Mr. \nKirk. Why is there an objection to processing those amendments and \nallowing the Senate to work its will? Why can't we vote on them? Why \ncan't the Democratic minority take up the majority leader's offer for a \nvote to strip the language out that your side objects to?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Can I answer that as honestly as I feel?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I wish the Senator would.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Because there are many of us who believe this is one \nsmall step for womankind. It is one battle we can win, and we have had \nloss after loss after loss.\n  You know, many of us ran on the right to choose. I was one of them. I \nam old enough to have seen the way it was before, to have sentenced \nwomen who committed illegal abortions with coat hangers. That is sort \nof the systemic root of all of this. It is our history, Senator. We are \ntrying to change that history, and we keep losing. So there is one \nsmall thing in this.\n  My colleague is right, we didn't see it, and we have to live with \nthat. I understand that. But now we see it and we are trying to do \nsomething about it and, thankfully, our party is standing up with us. \nSo we say make that small change and we pass this bill, and maybe we \ncan even strengthen it with amendments.\n  My colleague has done a superior job in putting the bill together. \nLet it go.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would just say, in conclusion, that I \nthink it is a terrible shame that my colleague's side of the aisle has \ndecided to take this bill hostage to try to litigate something that has \nbeen the law of the land for 39 years. I understand she feels \npassionately about it. I don't question that for a minute--the \nsincerity of my colleague's deeply held personal views.\n  But why in the world would my colleagues take as a hostage a piece of \nlegislation that is going to help those 100,000 children who are sex-\ntrafficked each year? Why should they suffer so my colleagues can make \na point on this particular piece of legislation?\n  I don't understand that and I think it is a terrible shame.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Well, let me answer a question with a question. Why \ndoesn't my colleague just take it out? It is not in the House bill. \nThen we don't have to conference it, we don't\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\nhave to have another fight, we can get the amendments in the bill to \nstrengthen the bill, and we can move on, with the two parties together \ndoing something that is right for the Nation. Why don't we do it?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, I don't blame \nher for asking, but why in the world would we change settled law for 39 \nyears in order to accommodate the minority's view on this bill, and to \nchange, as I said, what has been the law of the land?\n  Since the Senator voted for this very language previously this year \nin the Judiciary Committee--since she cosponsored it, I don't really \nunderstand it since she voted for the legislation that is referred to \nhere that has that amendment. Does the Senator see this as breaking new \nground? Is she trying to expand or eliminate the Hyde amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I see it for standing up for a principle. I know \nsomething about these girls. I know something about the history of \nabortion in this country. I am old enough to have gone through it and \nknow that I don't want to go back to those days. I don't want young \nwomen who take the law now so much for granted to have to return back.\n  This is just one small step. There is nothing wrong with \naccommodating the minority on what is a relatively small point. In the \nHouse, 435 people over there didn't want it in. So why not accommodate \nthe minority? The Senator just comes out a bigger person.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would say to my friend I appreciate her \ncourtesy and her indulgence in having this conversation. I also feel on \nprinciple this limitation on tax dollars is an appropriate one. I \nunderstand the Senator disagrees and she would like to eliminate this \nfrom this point forward. But I am simply unable on principle to \naccommodate the Senator in that request.\n  As I said, I do appreciate her courtesy.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate it, too. And I appreciate the \ndiscussion. Principle doesn't know minority and majority. Principle is \ndeeply held.\n  I thank the Senator very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1625-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DEMOCRACY RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I support the Democracy Restoration Act. \nThis important legislation would restore a voice in our democracy for \nmillions of Americans who cannot vote simply because they have a \ncriminal conviction. I thank Senator Cardin for his leadership on this \nissue. I am honored to be an original cosponsor of this important \ncriminal justice reform legislation.\n  The right to vote for all is a principle that goes to the very heart \nof all democracy. Voting is a fundamental right because it is the right \nfrom which all other rights derive. Participation in the political \nprocess is about giving a voice to the voiceless. It is about who we \nare as a Nation and whether we want citizens that contribute to our \nsociety to have a say in who represents them in the Federal Government.\n  The road to extend voting rights to all Americans has been long and \nnot without bumps. Our country was founded at a time when African \nAmericans were denied the right to vote. For over a hundred years, we \nsilenced entire populations of Americans and deemed them unworthy of \nparticipating in the political process merely because of their race.\n  During his famous Gettysburg Address, President Lincoln called for \nthe country to have a ``new birth of freedom.'' After the Civil War, \nthe States ratified the Civil War Amendments to the Constitution to \nhonor President Lincoln's promise. One of those amendments, the \nFifteenth Amendment, gave African Americans the right to vote. Decades \nlater, the Nineteenth Amendment gave women suffrage.\n  Despite this progress, many States passed laws during the Jim Crow \nera to disenfranchise African Americans, including literacy tests, poll \ntaxes, and grandfather clauses. These States also passed laws that \nbanned people with certain convictions from voting. With the passage of \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, many of these State disenfranchising \nlaws were outlawed. But the ban on voting for people with certain \nconvictions was not touched and it remains the law in many States.\n  Today, 35 States restrict voting rights of persons who were formerly \nincarcerated. In fact, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent 5.85 \nmillion Americans from voting. This is a staggering number of Americans \nthat do not have a say in our political process.\n  Punishment is a legitimate goal of our justice system. But once \nsomeone has served their time and been released, we must help our \nfellow citizens get back on their feet. As President George W. Bush \nsaid in his State of the Union Address in 2004, ``America is the land \nof second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead \nshould lead to a better life.'' To further punish people who are back \nin the community by denying them the right to vote counters the \nexpectation that citizens have rehabilitated themselves after a \nconviction.\n  The Democracy Restoration Act would restore voting rights in Federal \nelections to millions of disenfranchised Americans who have been \nreleased from prison. It would require prisons receiving Federal funds \nnotify people about their right to vote in Federal elections upon \nleaving prison or being sentenced to probation. It would empower the \nDepartment of Justice and former offenders harmed by a violation of \nthis legislation with the right to sue.\n  This bill corrects a civil rights wrong. It would sweep away the last \nvestige of Jim Crow laws. It would outlaw State disenfranchisement laws \nthat have a disparate impact on racial minorities. It would provide a \nuniform standard to govern the restoration of voting rights.\n  This bill reforms the criminal justice system. Every year, over \n600,000 people leave prison. We must find ways to reintegrate them back \ninto the community. Civic participation gives ex-offenders a stake in \ngovernment, which motivates law-abiding behavior and reduces the \nlikelihood of future crimes. No evidence exists that denying voting \nrights to people after release from prison reduces crime. To the \ncontrary, it makes sense that people who have paid their debt to \nsociety should reclaim their rights.\n  This bill builds off of the progress in the States. Recently, 8 \nStates have either repealed or amended lifetime disenfranchisement \nlaws. Two states expanded voting rights to persons on probation or \nparole. Ten States eased the restoration process for people seeking to \nhave their right to vote restored after the completion of their \nsentence. The Federal Government should follow their lead.\n  Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come. This \nCongress can remedy the barriers to full citizenship faced by millions \nof formerly incarcerated people in our country, if this bill is enacted \ninto law. Restoring the right to vote is good public policy.\n  To protect basic public safety and strengthen the core of our \ndemocracy, I urge my fellow Senators to support the Democracy \nRestoration Act and quickly pass this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1625-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1625-S1626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING NANCIE ATWELL\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the inspiring \naccomplishments of Nancie Atwell from Southport, ME, who was awarded \nthe first Global Teacher Prize by the Varkey Foundation. This \ninternational, nonprofit organization is committed to improving the \nquality of education worldwide. Nancie's selection as the foundation's \nfirst ever prize recipient is a testament to her outstanding \ncontributions to the teaching profession and her effect on countless \nstudents and teachers. The $1 million prize was awarded at a ceremony \nin Dubai attended by former President Bill Clinton and Sheikh Mohammed\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\nbin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates.\n  Heralded as the ``Nobel Prize of Teaching,'' the prestigious Global \nTeacher Prize shines a spotlight on the critical role that teachers \nplay in our society. Nancie was selected from more than 5,000 \nnominations received from 120 countries. The candidates were evaluated \nbased on their innovative teaching practices, including their ability \nto prepare students to be global citizens.\n  The pool of thousands was narrowed down to a group of 10 remarkable \nnominees, including teachers from Afghanistan, India, Kenya, Haiti, \nMalaysia, Cambodia, and the United States. Within this elite group, \nNancie Atwell rose above the rest. Nancie has been a teacher since \n1973. In 1990, she used money from her own pocket to found the Center \nfor Teaching & Learning, an independent demonstration school that \neducates students from kindergarten through eighth grade in the small \ntown of Edgecomb. Her vision was to foster a more meaningful education \nfor Maine students. The center serves a close-knit population of \napproximately 75 students who travel from several surrounding towns \nbecause they are attracted to the school's small class sizes, research-\nbased curriculum, and teacher outreach programs.\n  In a gesture that exemplifies her deep commitment to her students, \nNancie announced that she intends to donate every last penny of the $1 \nmillion prize back to her school to support its resources, \nscholarships, library, and to replace its worn out furnace.\n  Nancie, who has authored many books and articles about education and \nhosted 140 education workshops, embodies a teaching philosophy based on \nstudent engagement, not just assignments. She encourages her pupils to \nidentify and pursue their passions. By enabling students to choose to \nread and write about what interests them, the center has created an \nenvironment where children are excited to learn and eager to \ndemonstrate their knowledge.\n  In addition to teaching students, the center does remarkable work \nteaching teachers. Educators from other schools regularly visit the \ncenter for professional development. Once there, they observe school-\nwide morning meetings, libraries in every classroom, and student-driven \nwriting workshops. The center facilitates a teacher internship program \nthat pairs visiting educators with teachers at the school. These \nintern-teachers observe and confer about instruction methods and leave \nequipped to make substantive changes back in their own schools.\n  In her acceptance speech, Nancie said:\n\n       When children are engaged, when learning is joyful, those \n     are the lessons that stick. Those are the lessons that are \n     worthwhile and meaningful and hang around.\n\n  This philosophy has inspired teachers and students alike. In fact, it \nwas one of Nancie's former students who nominated her for the prize.\n  Under Nancie's leadership, the Center for Teaching & Learning has \nearned national praise. How wonderful it is that Nancie's work has now \nearned global recognition. The people of Maine--and especially its \nstudents--are fortunate to have such a pioneering and driven educator \nfighting for a brighter future. Nancie is a remarkable ambassador for \nboth the State of Maine and our country, and I congratulate her on this \noutstanding accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1626-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING TONY ALEXANDER\n\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Tony Alexander, \nexecutive chairman of the board of FirstEnergy Corporation. Tony's 43-\nyear career at FirstEnergy and its predecessor companies was \ncharacterized by a commitment to superior customer service, greater \nvalue to shareholders, and more opportunities for employees. As \nFirstEnergy's longest serving chief executive officer, Tony's vision, \ndrive, and leadership helped propel the company to the forefront of the \nenergy industry.\n  Through Tony's management, Akron-based Ohio Edison quadrupled in size \nto become today's FirstEnergy. Over the course of his career, he guided \nthe company through significant mergers, acquisitions, and \ndivestitures; complex regulatory and environmental challenges; and a \nwide range of operational and financial issues. His willingness to push \nhard for important ideas and policies made him a strong advocate during \none of the most challenging periods in the history of the electric \nindustry.\n  Tony's principled leadership has also shown through his tireless work \nto improve his community. As a recognized leader in his community, he \ncurrently serves as an advisor to the boards of trustees for Akron \nTomorrow, Team NEO, and the University of Akron. Additionally, he \nserves on the board of directors and President's Advancement Council of \nthe Austen BioInnovation Institute.\n  Tony's service has not gone without notice. He has been awarded the \nDr. Frank L. Simonetti Distinguished Business Alumni Award from the \nUniversity of Akron--a testament to his community leadership.\n  I congratulate Tony, his wife Becky, and their four sons for the \nprofound impact he has made throughout his community and the energy \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1626-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:09 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1029.

A bill to provide for media coverage of Federal court \nproceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this week is Sunshine Week, when we \naffirm the public's right to know how their government is run. Sunshine \nWeek, which began as Sunshine Sunday in 2002, emphasizes the importance \nof transparency and accountability in a government of the people, by \nthe people, and for the people. In the spirit of government \ntransparency, we are pleased to introduce the Sunshine in the Courtroom \nAct of 2015. This important piece of bipartisan legislation furthers \nthe public's access to court proceedings by permitting federal judges \nat all federal court levels to open their courtrooms to television \ncameras and radio broadcasts.\n  Openness in our courts improves the public's understanding of what \nhappens inside our courts. Our judicial system remains a mystery to too \nmany people across the country. That doesn't need to continue. Letting \nthe sun shine in on Federal courtrooms will give Americans an \nopportunity to better understand the judicial process. Courts are the \nbedrock of the American justice system. Granting the public greater \naccess to an already public proceeding will inspire greater faith in \nand appreciation for our judges who pledge equal and impartial justice \nfor all.\n  For decades, States such as my home State of Iowa have allowed \ncameras in their courtrooms with great results. As a matter of fact, \nall 50 States and the District of Columbia now allow some news coverage \nof proceedings.\n  The bill I am introducing today, along with Senator Schumer and a \nnumber of cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, including Judiciary \nCommittee Ranking Member Leahy, will greatly improve public access to \nfederal courts by letting federal judges open their courtrooms to \ntelevision cameras and other forms of electronic media.\n  The Sunshine in the Courtroom Act is full of provisions that ensure \nthat the introduction of cameras and other broadcasting devices into \ncourtrooms goes as smoothly as it has at the state level. First, the \npresence of the cameras Federal trial and appellate courts is at the \nsole discretion of the judges--it is not mandatory. The bill also \nprovides a mechanism for Congress to study the effects of this \nlegislation on our judiciary before making this change permanent \nthrough a 3-year sunset provision. The bill protects the privacy and \nsafety of non-party witnesses by giving them the right to have their \nfaces and voices obscured. The bill prohibits the televising of jurors. \nFinally, it includes a provision to protect the due process rights of \neach party.\n  We need to open the doors and let the light shine in on the Federal \nJudiciary. This bill improves public access to and therefore \nunderstanding of our Federal courts. It has safety provisions to ensure \nthat the cameras won't interfere with the proceedings or with the \nsafety or due process of anyone involved in the cases. Our States have \nallowed news coverage of their courtrooms for decades. It is time we \njoin them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows.\n\n                                 S. 783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide \nfor the refinancing of certain Federal student loans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act of 2015. This \nbill will allow student loan borrowers to take advantage of today's \nlower interest rates, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Last Congress, Democrats pressed for a similar bill which has strong \nsupport from the Senate and from the public. Every Democrat, every \nIndependent, and three Republicans voted to move this bill forward. \nMore than 700,000 people signed petitions in support of student loan \nrefinancing, but Republicans filibustered the bill, so it didn't pass. \nIt is time to try again, because a problem that was bad last year has \ngotten worse--much worse.\n  Since last year, nearly 1 million more borrowers have fallen behind \nin their payments. Nearly 1 million more are watching their balances \nget bigger, not smaller. Nearly 1 million more people are sweating out \nhow they are ever going to repay their student loan debt.\n  Last year, student loan debt was an economic emergency. Now, 1 year \nlater, the emergency is getting worse. Just look at the numbers. \nStudents are now struggling with $100 billion more debt than 1 year \nago. Since last year, total student loan debt has jumped to $1.3 \ntrillion, and the debt is crushing young people.\n\n  Last year, experts at the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau all sounded the alarm on student \ndebt. This year, the alarm bells are sounding even louder. One year \nago, the Federal Government was projected to take in tens of billions \nin profits on the backs of our kids as a result of artificially high \ninterest rates. One year later, interest rates on new loans are even \nhigher, and even with millions of people struggling to pay, even after \naccounting for administrative and other costs, the Federal Government \nis still raking in huge profits on its student loan program.\n  Despite overwhelming public support for cutting the interest rates on \nstudent loans, Republicans last year refused to even debate this bill. \nRepublicans said there were other, better ways to tackle student debt, \nbut Republicans did nothing, nothing except filibuster the only student \nloan bill on the table. So tens of millions of borrowers got nothing, \nno help at all. Today, millions of borrowers are left with interest \nrates of 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and even higher. Nearly 1 \nmillion more borrowers are falling behind, and the Republicans have \ndone nothing. Nearly 1 million more borrowers are falling behind, and \nthey are watching their debt load get bigger. Nearly 1 million more \nborrowers are falling behind, paying interest rates that produce \nobscene profits for the U.S. Government, and the Republicans will not \neven debate refinancing student loans.\n  Why can't people refinance their student loans? When interest rates \nare low, homeowners can refinance their mortgages to reduce their \npayments. Businesses can refinance their debts. Even governments can \nrefinance their debts. But student loan borrowers are stuck with their \nloans, sometimes at 6 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, and even higher.\n  Our proposal is simple: refinance outstanding loans down to 3.9 \npercent for\n\n[[Page S1633]]\n\nundergraduates, and a little higher for graduates and PLUS loans. This \nsingle change would give borrowers across this country a chance to save \nhundreds--and for some, thousands--of dollars a year. That's real \nmoney--money they can put toward paying down the balance on their debt, \nsaving for a home, buying a car--money they can put toward building a \nsolid future.\n  This bill doesn't add one dime to the deficit. It is fully paid for \nby closing up a tax loophole that allows millionaires and billionaires \nto pay a lower tax rate than middle class families.\n  If Republicans don't like that way to pay for the student loan bill, \nhere's another idea. Senators Reed and Blumenthal have advanced a bill \nthat would close a different tax loophole. They want to end the tax \nbreaks for executive bonuses that are bigger than a million dollars.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues, if you don't like that way to pay \nfor the student loan bill, there are other options as well. Let's sit \ndown and talk about it, but don't close your eyes and pretend this \nisn't happening. Don't turn your backs on the 40 million Americans with \nstudent loan debt. Don't do nothing.\n  Refinancing student loans will not fix everything that is wrong in \nour higher education system. We need to cut the price of college. We \nneed to reinvest in public universities. We need to shore up financial \naid, crack down on for-profit colleges, and provide better protections \non student loans, but let's start by allowing people to refinance their \nstudent loans. Let's start by cutting back on the interest payments \nthat are sinking young people and holding back this economy.\n  We could have refinanced student loan debt 1 year ago, but \nRepublicans said no. Now Americans owe $100 billion more than they did. \nNow nearly 1 million more borrowers are falling behind. Now more people \nthan ever are choking on student loan debt.\n  By refusing to act, Republicans are sinking the hopes of an entire \ngeneration. It is time for Congress to step up and fix this problem, \nbefore it drags down another million Americans and another and another. \nIt is time to refinance student loan debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1633-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 103--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF SOCIAL WORK \n                    MONTH AND WORLD SOCIAL WORK DAY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Franken) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 104\n\n       Whereas the Border Patrol's Yuma Sector has long grappled \n     with the crossing of undocumented aliens and has seen illegal \n     traffic decline precipitously from the early 2000s to the \n     present;\n       Whereas a combination of increased manpower, technology \n     implementation, and the delivery of appropriate consequences \n     have resulted in gains in border security in the Yuma Sector;\n       Whereas a key to the success in the Yuma Sector has been \n     the implementation of Operation Streamline, a program \n     established in 2005 that was described by former Department \n     of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as ``a DHS \n     partnership with the Department of Justice, . . . a \n     geographically focused operation that aims to increase the \n     consequences for illegally crossing the border by criminally \n     prosecuting illegal border-crossers.'';\n       Whereas known for its ``zero-tolerance'' approach, the Yuma \n     County Sheriff's Office cites 100 percent prosecution of \n     illegal border crossers as a shared goal of a partnership \n     including Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies;\n       Whereas among the various consequences delivered to illegal \n     crossers by the Department of Homeland Security, Operation \n     Streamline is associated with a recidivism rate that is well \n     below average and has seen a steady decrease in recidivism in \n     recent years;\n       Whereas the United States Attorney's Office for the \n     District of Arizona will reportedly no longer be prosecuting \n     those apprehended crossing the border illegally for the first \n     time; and\n       Whereas according to the Sheriff of Yuma County, Operation \n     Streamline ``had a deterrent effect in Yuma County, which \n     gained a reputation as an area to avoid crossing into because \n     if caught, you were assured to go to court and possibly face \n     penalties'', but now the program has been ``has been severely \n     diluted.''.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) gains made in border security in the Yuma Sector and \n     positive trends in recidivism rates are of critical \n     importance to those living and working in the border region \n     and to the Nation as a whole;\n       (2) refusing to prosecute first time illegal border \n     crossers under Operation Streamline will jeopardize border \n     security gains;\n       (3) the border security steps that have led to some measure \n     of improvement on the border, such as the historical \n     implementation of Operation Streamline, should be preserved; \n     and\n       (4) the Executive Branch should immediately remove any \n     issued or related prohibition, policy, guidance, or direction \n     to cease prosecuting first time illegal border crossers under \n     Operation Streamline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/18/senate-section/article/S1633-3", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 319.
