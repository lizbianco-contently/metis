Mr. President, this is another day and another report \nhighlighting how ObamaCare is helping Americans.\n  Today's proof comes from a Gallup poll which finds that 9 out of 10 \nAmericans report having health insurance.\n  Here are a few excerpts from the Associated Press article about this \npoll: ``. . . underlining a change across the nation, nearly 9 out of \n10 adults now say they have health insurance, according to an extensive \nsurvey released today.''\n  The Gallup poll ``found that the share of adults who lack [health] \ninsurance dropped to 11.9 percent for the first three months of this \nyear, the lowest level since the survey began its tracking in 2008.''\n\n       Coverage gains from 2014-2015 translate to about 3.6 \n     million fewer adults uninsured since the fall. . . . ``The \n     Affordable Care Act had three major objectives: increase \n     coverage, slow the rate of increase in costs, and improve \n     health''. . . . ``The first one is a clear win. Coverage is \n     increasing; there is no question about it.''\n\n  ``On balance, an estimated 14.75 million adults have gained coverage \nsince the fall of 2013, when the law's first open enrollment season was \nabout to begin.''\n  The survey also found that ``Hispanics saw the biggest coverage gains \nof any ethnic or racial group. At a time when Republicans are very \nkeenly trying to court the Hispanic vote, a large chunk of Hispanics \nare gaining insurance via the Affordable Care Act.''\n\n       Recent gains in coverage have benefited people up and down \n     the income ladder. But the most notable improvement has been \n     among those making less than $36,000 a year, a group that \n     traditionally struggled to get and keep health insurance.\n\n  Here is a little short comment on this. When we have people who make \nless than $36,000 getting insurance coverage, it saves us money. They \nare not having to go through their primary care physician--which is an \nemergency room--the highest cost of health care delivery in the United \nStates. So this is really good news for America. ObamaCare is working, \nand there is more and more evidence every day. It is time to stop \ntrying to destroy the law that has been helping millions and millions \nof Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2093-6", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2093-S2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let's talk a little bit about Loretta Lynch. \nWe have now passed the first 100 days of the Republican-controlled \nSenate. We all remember the lofty promises made by the Republican \nleader and his party when they assumed power. But we are still \nstruggling to finish two issues that should have been resolved weeks \nago.\n  The Democrats are ready to move forward on the Lynch nomination and \nthe so-called doc fix. This doc fix, which we are going to talk about a \nlittle later, is so important not only for the doctors but also for \ntheir patients. Medicare is an important part of our health care \ndelivery system, and it benefits older Americans.\n  This day marks the 157th day since President Obama first nominated \nLoretta Lynch as Attorney General. For more than 5 months, Democrats \nhave been ready to take up and confirm the nomination. Back in November \nof last year, when Loretta Lynch was first nominated, the Republican \nleader said: ``Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate. \nAnd her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through \nregular order.''\n  I am not making this up. This is what the Republican leader said. I \nquoted him verbatim.\n  Even though the Democrats were ready to move the nomination before \nthe elections, some Republicans wanted a little more time to look at \nit. We agreed to that. We based this upon what the Republican leader \nsaid--that Ms. Lynch would receive fair consideration by the Senate.\n  Well, that hasn't happened. January came and went, and Loretta \nLynch's nomination never got a confirmation vote on the floor. \nDemocrats were\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\nready to confirm a new Attorney General, but Republicans weren't and \naren't.\n  February and March flew by and Republicans still aren't ready. Now we \nare half way through April, and once again, Senate Democrats are ready \nand willing to confirm a new Attorney General, but the Republicans are \nnot.\n  Ms. Lynch has a spotless record. No one can question her integrity, \nher background, and there is no question that she should not have to \nwait any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2094-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SGR LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spent a little bit of time talking \nabout the sustainable growth rate--the doc fix--or the SGR. Before the \nSenate recessed for the Easter break, Republicans were unable to agree \non how to prevent the physician pay cut. Democrats were ready to \nproceed. The last night we were here, we said: When we come back, we \nwant to move this House bill forward. We want three simple amendments.\n  We still feel the same way. We are willing not only to move forward \non those amendments, but we will give a very short time agreement on \neach one of them.\n  The Republican leader said when bills come to the floor, he wants to \nhave amendments. We don't want to amend this bill to death. We want \nthree simple amendments. We said that the night we were here when \nclosing the Senate for the Easter recess, and we say it again. I wish \nRepublicans would have joined us years ago in our efforts to repeal \nthis faulty law, but they did not do that.\n  Regardless of the history, we have an urgent need before us today to \nget this bill done. Each day that passes without doing this SGR, this \nsustainable growth rate--to get rid of it is basically what we are \ndoing. It would be a good day for America. It would also be a good day \nfor America when we can confirm Loretta Lynch. Each day that passes \nwithout her confirmation and without a doc fix is just another example \nof Republicans' inability to govern.\n  Mr. President, would you announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2094-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nonce again about the ongoing effort to replace the Medicare sustainable \ngrowth rate, or SGR, formula.\n  As we know, SGR has been a problem pretty much since its inception. \nMembers of both parties have grown tired of passing temporary SGR \npatches that have been cobbled together at the last minute behind \nclosed doors. This constant, seemingly unending, cycle has only grown \nmore tiresome as the years have gone by.\n  That is why a little over 2 years ago a group of leaders from both \nthe House and the Senate set out to fix this problem once and for all. \nI was part of this effort. I was joined on the Senate side by former \nFinance Committee Chairman Max Baucus. Together, Senator Baucus and I \nworked with the leaders of the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and \nMeans Committees to craft legislation that would repeal and replace SGR \nwith an improved payment system that rewards quality, efficiency, and \ninnovation.\n  While many critics deemed our efforts a lost cause, we introduced our \nbill in late 2013 and got it reported out of the Finance Committee on a \nvoice vote. That same legislation formed the basis of the SGR bill that \npassed overwhelmingly in the House with 392 votes at the end of March.\n  Now the bill is before the Senate. It is my hope that we will act \nquickly to pass this bipartisan, bicameral legislation and send it to \nthe President's desk as soon as possible.\n  This SGR bill is historic for a number of reasons. First of all, it \ndemonstrates what Congress is truly capable of when Members work \ntogether. While that type of cooperation used to be commonplace around \nhere, it has in recent years been in short supply. The bill also \nrepresents a step forward in the effort to reform our Nation's \nentitlement programs. The bill contains bipartisan reforms to the \nMedicare program, and it is not limited to fixing the broken SGR \nsystem.\n  To go along with the permanent SGR fix, the bill includes a \nmeaningful downpayment on Medicare reform without any accompanying tax \nhikes. These reforms include a limitation on so-called Medigap first-\ndollar coverage, more robust means testing for Medicare Parts B and D, \nand program integrity provisions that will strengthen Medicare's \nability to fight fraud.\n  I am aware that these are not transformative reforms and that much \nmore work will be necessary to put Medicare--not to mention our other \nentitlement programs--on a more sustainable trajectory. However, any \nSenators who, like me, have been clamoring for entitlement reform \nshould welcome these changes. After all, for years the idea of \nbipartisan Medicare reform seemed, at best, farfetched. President Obama \nand his allies here in Congress have stated repeatedly that, before \nthey would consider changes to our safety net programs, Republicans \nwould have to agree to massive tax hikes. But here we are, just one \nSenate vote away from enacting meaningful and bipartisan Medicare \nreforms into law.\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\n  Of course, as I said last month before the House vote, this bill is \nnot perfect. Anyone who is determined to vote no could likely dig \nthrough the bill and find a reason to do so. I have my own thoughts as \nto how I would like to improve the bill.\n  But, let's be honest. While I have only been in the Senate for 38 \nyears or so, I don't remember voting on many perfect bills, \nparticularly not on a subject matter this complex and under a divided \ngovernment. So, while I understand the impulse of some who may want to \nhold out for a better, more ideal solution to the SGR problem, I think \nit would be a grave mistake to pass up this bipartisan opportunity we \nhave before us now.\n  As I see it, we have two options. We can hold out for a better bill, \none that satisfies every demand and subject ourselves to many more \nyears of the last-minute, time-consuming SGR patches that are loathed \nby everyone in Congress and everyone in the health care industry or we \ncan pass the bipartisan, bicameral bill we have before us now, fixing \nthe SGR problem once and for all and setting the stage for future \nentitlement reform.\n  It should be pretty clear where I stand. This is a good bill, and it \nis coming at the right time.\n  I want to once again commend the leaders in the House from both \nparties who worked so hard to reach a deal on this legislation and to \npass it with such an overwhelming consensus. I know it was not easy.\n  It is now up to us here in the Senate. Let's get this done. I hope \nall of my colleagues will join me in supporting the SGR bill.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the course of the Easter recess, I \nwent to meet with the President of Honduras, President Hernandez, about \nthe limited albeit progress his country is making against crime, as \nwell as all the drugs that are coming in. I had gone to Honduras with \nour four-star Marine general, General Kelly, the Commander of United \nStates Southern Command.\n  Between the U.S. military and the Coast Guard, we have been \nsuccessful--as a matter of fact, I even went on some simulated drug \ninterdictions out in the Caribbean off of Key West. They showed me how \none Coast Guard fast boat can interdict a drug smuggler's fast boat, \nand basically they shoot out the engines. They can do that from another \nfast boat or they can do that from a helicopter.\n  That has had an effect. There are less drugs coming out of South \nAmerica going into Honduras, which is one of the three Central American \ncountries that had become so prime for the drug trade.\n  They arrive in big shipments into Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala. \nThen they break them down into much smaller packets and go through this \nvery efficient distribution system that goes north through the rest of \nCentral America, into Mexico, and from there to the United States.\n  It is hard to catch them when there are the much smaller packets of \ncocaine going north. Therefore, we have really made an effort to assist \nthe three Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, and \nHonduras.\n  Needless to say, there is a lot of corruption in the governments and \nthe local police of all of those three countries. As a result, the drug \nlords find it fairly easy pickings to buy off people and buy off \njudges, so President Hernandez came into office wanting to really make \na difference.\n  He started doing some shows of force. He has worked with General \nKelly on this issue, but the fact is it is still a very violent \ncountry, with not only the drug trade but also human trafficking, but \nthe trends are in the right direction.\n  One year ago, Honduras was the murder capital of the world. It was \nabout 86 murders per 100,000 of population. They have cut that number \ndown to about 66 per 100,000 of population--still very high, but the \ntrend is in the right direction.\n  I commend President Hernandez, and I commend the First Lady of the \ncountry. They have been trying to help their country with its economy \nso the extreme poverty that is so evident in that part of the world is \nnot a caldron bubbling that is ripe for corruption and for paying off \npeople to transport the drugs.\n  In addition, of course there is the human trafficking. There is part \nof it for the sex slaves, and that is a trade where often parents are \nsending their children north--thinking they will have a better life--\nand the young girls are just brutally treated and ultimately forced \ninto prostitution. But part of it is also, because of the poverty, the \nhopelessness of the parents that their children have no future. They \nare willing to turn--after paying thousands and thousands of dollars to \na human trafficker--their children over to a coyote to transport those \nchildren to the north.\n  Some of them don't make it, and it is true some of the reforms that \nthe Hernandez government have been putting in place have lessened the \nmigration of these young children, but there is a lot more to do. That \nis where I would commend the Senate to take a look at the \nadministration's request for Central America. It has a name, something \nsuch as Alliance for Progress. It is about a $1 billion appropriations \nrequest that will help with the economic development and the medical \ncare in that very poor region of the world. If the Congress will \napprove that request, I think we will continue to see the fruits of our \nlabors--a very positive outcome.\n  As long as there is such a difference between the economic elites and \nthe very poor--a huge majority who are very poor--we are always going \nto have those problems, but at least we are seeing the steps in the \nright direction.\n  While I was there, our Ambassador Nealon asked me in the assembled \npress to announce that in another week the Naval Hospital ship the \nComfort will be anchoring off the coast of Honduras. For 1 week it will \noffer the medical services of Navy doctors, nurses, and a whole host of \nprivate doctors and nurses from this country who are volunteering their \ntime to go to Honduras and help with the medical attention that is so \ndesperately needed in that part of the world.\n  I commend to the Senate that we seriously consider favorably the \nrequest of the administration for this $1 billion into Central America. \nAt the end of the day, it is going to lessen the drug trade going north \nthrough those countries and stop the family deprivation--lessen the \nfamily deprivation--of which they would dare risk their children to be \nsent north with a coyote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN.

Our manufacturing base \nhelped to build our country's infrastructure to win World War II and to \nspur our economy to new heights in the 21st century. We are not only \nhome to great makers, we are home to great creators as well.\n  We are the home of rock and roll--the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is \nin downtown Cleveland--great athletes and authors, people such as Jesse \nOwens and Toni Morrison, and we are home to great art. Cleveland is the \nhome to world-renowned Cleveland Orchestra, Playhouse Square, Karamu \nHouse, the NASA-designated Great Lakes Science Center, and one of the \nlargest and best art museums not just in the United States but in the \nworld, the Cleveland Museum of Art.\n  In the early 1900s, Midwest cities saw a cultural explosion. Cities \nwere prospering. Government and business leaders alike sought to \nharness that new wealth to build livable, world-class cities. Museums \nwere established across\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nthe Midwest. That is why cities such as Youngstown, Toledo, Dayton, \nCincinnati, Cleveland--cities that may not have been the Nation's \nlargest, especially when you look at Dayton, Youngstown, and Toledo, \nbut cities that were prosperous--created great products, created great \nwealth, and made huge contributions to start these cultural centers.\n  Ohio is one of the leading States in the Nation as far as locations \nof good art museums in pretty much all of our major cities. Art museums \nwere status symbols. In many ways, they were the sports arenas of the \nearly 20th century.\n  It was in this climate that the Cleveland Museum of Art was \nestablished 99 years ago, opening in June 1916. We mark, last year and \nthe next couple of years, the 100th anniversary of the Cleveland City \nClub and the 100th anniversary of the Cleveland Orchestra also. So much \nhappened in that decade in Cleveland, OH, and cities like it across the \ncountry.\n  The original marble neoclassic building was an instant icon, a signal \nto the world that Cleveland would take its place as a world-class city \nand a center for the arts. And 100 years later, the Cleveland Museum of \nArt is thriving. It has a permanent collection that is world-renowned \nand possesses a deep commitment to the local community.\n  Under the leadership of Director William Griswold and Steven Kestner, \nchair of the board of trustees, the museum is expanding in every \ndirection, working to engage the community and using new technology to \neducate visitors. I had the privilege of visiting the art museum just \nin the last week or so, talking with Dr. Griswold, and looking at the \nnew Africa exhibit that is on tour that has been collected for \nCleveland, and I got a chance to see a good bit of this beautiful \nmuseum. I have been many times. Each time I go, I come away with an \neven greater appreciation for the institution, the art, the curators, \nthe collectors, and the people who work there. Dr. Griswold shared with \nme that day he was appointed as director, he was with some European \nfriends who told him the Cleveland Museum of Art was their favorite art \nmuseum in the entire world.\n  The museum recently completed a $350 million expansion and renovation \nthat will better integrate the museum with the surrounding community. \nIt has transformed the museum's spaces and has prepared this \ninstitution to inspire and educate Ohioans for the next 100 years. It \nbeckons young people and students--many low-income students in the \nimmediate area, within a few square miles around the museum--to come \nvisit and learn about our cultural heritage and look to the future.\n  When I met with Dr. Griswold--let me back up for a moment. This \ncapital improvement was the largest capital improvement of any museum \nin Ohio history and supported some 1,100 local jobs. The project \ninjected more than $360 million directly into our State's economy. The \nimpact will be felt for years to come.\n  As it approaches its centennial celebration next year, the Cleveland \nMuseum of Art will continue to attract visitors from Cuyahoga County, \nfrom northeast Ohio, and from around the world. In 2013, 600,000 people \nvisited that museum. More than one-third of them were from outside of \nOhio. More than half a million visitors were responsible for $80 \nmillion in consumer spending in the city.\n  The museum's first director, Frederick Allen Whiting, believed the \nmuseum should serve not as an ivory tower but as an educational \ninstitution engaged in the community. He wanted to bring art to people, \nnot just people into the museum.\n  The museum established its first education department. In 1919, they \nheld the first annual exhibition of Cleveland artists and craftsmen. It \nbecame known as the May Show and showcased local artists for the next \n73 years. Dr. Griswold continues that tradition of community \nengagement.\n  When I met with him, he told me that leaders of cultural institutions \nhave a responsibility to participate in my city's transformation. He is \ncommitted and the museum's staff is committed to making our city a \nbetter place. They have elevated the museum's education and \ninterpretation department and are committed to the value of \ninterpretive excellence. Education in the museum is aimed at a general \naudience, not just art buffs and historians.\n  Parenthetically, my sister-in-law teaches in the art history \ndepartment at Case Western Reserve University. Catherine talks to me \nabout how integrated Case is in the art history department with that \nmuseum. It is a classroom for students. It is a classroom for the whole \ncommunity beyond Case.\n  Studies show that a high concentration of the arts in communities \nleads to higher civic engagement. Students who take art classes, play \nmusical instruments, take dance lessons generally do better in school.\n  Dr. Griswold and his team are in the forefront of the use of \ntechnology to educate and to connect visitors with the museum's \ncollections. The Cleveland Art Museum is also home to the country's \nlargest multitouch screen, a collection wall. This huge, interactive \nwall stands at 40 square feet and features more than 4,100 works of art \nfrom the museum's collection.\n  To get a feel for the reach and the breadth of a museum of this \nstature in one of our Nation's great cities, the museum has 20 curators \non staff. It recruits for these positions around the world.\n  In Cleveland, we have the Cleveland Institute of Art, and we have \ngreat universities. However, when it comes time to look for a new \ncurator, the Cleveland Art Museum looks worldwide.\n  The museum's collection includes 45,000 objects and spans nearly \n6,000 years of history. This February, the museum's ``Senufo: Art and \nIdentity in West Africa'' special exhibit opened after 5 years of work \nby curators. It features 170 objects from more than 60 collections \naround the world.\n  We know that strong communities require strong cultural institutions. \nFrom the Cleveland Institute of Music, to the Fine Arts Garden, to the \nBotanical Garden, to the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland continues \nto cultivate the vibrant arts community that enriches our city and \nenriches our State.\n  Thanks to the art museum, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and Dr. \nGriswold, who is relatively still new on the job, for their \ncontributions to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2096-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2096-S2098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY AND THE TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, let me start with a story. More than 15 \nyears ago, a friend and I--I met with friends, and I flew to South \nTexas at my own expense. I wanted to see how the North American Free \nTrade Agreement was working.\n  During my first year in Congress 20-plus years ago, in the House of \nRepresentatives, I helped to lead the opposition to the North American \nFree Trade Agreement. I stood up to a President of my own party, \nPresident Clinton, who I think was wrong on the North American Free \nTrade Agreement. Since then, I disagreed with President Bush--a \nPresident not of my party--on his trade policy.\n  I wanted to see, 4, 5 years after NAFTA was implemented, what it \nlooked like, what went on along the U.S.-Mexican border. As I said, at \nmy own expense I rented a car with a couple friends and went to Mexico. \nHere is what I found. I walked into a neighborhood where thousands of \nworkers lived, workers who were working in formerly U.S. plants that, \nbecause of NAFTA, had crossed the river and were relocated in Mexico in \nsome areas called maquiladoras. These were American plants that \nrelocated to Mexico, producing with very low-income workers, no \nenvironmental labor standards, and selling those products back into the \nUnited States. It is a 20th-century, 21st-century way of doing business \nfor far too many companies. Unknown in human history, to my knowledge, \nhave so many companies, as they have in the United States, incorporated \ntheir business plans where they shut down production in Sandusky or \nMansfield, OH, and move production to Wuhan or Shiyan, China, and sell \nthose products back into the United States.\n  I wanted to see what it looked like. I walked through this \nneighborhood where thousands of workers lived in very abject, poor \nconditions. These were workers working for in most cases American \ncompanies south of the border in Mexico, for very low wages.\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\n  I walked through these neighborhoods. I saw people living in shacks. \nThese shacks were often made of packing materials, maybe wooden crates \nfrom products that had been shipped in for assembly at these plants, \ncardboard boxes often with the names of the companies on them. They \nwere living in conditions like that.\n  I walked through the neighborhood, and I saw kind of meandering \nthrough the neighborhood these ditches filled with industrial and human \nwaste. Who knows what was in those ditches. Children were playing \nnearby, walking across and jumping across the ditches, sometimes \nplaying far too close to these ditches filled with toxic waste. The \nAmerican Medical Association in those days called that area in Mexico \nacross from the United States, across from the Rio Grande River, the \nmost toxic place in North America.\n  Then I went to an auto plant. Nearby was an auto plant. It was a new \nauto plant. It looked a lot like a U.S. auto plant. It was new and \nmodern. In fact, it was newer than many auto plants in the United \nStates. The workers were working hard. The machines were new. The \nworkers were productive. The floors were clean. There was one \ndifference between a U.S. auto plant--a plant in Avon Lake or Lorain, \nOH--there was one difference between a U.S. auto plant and a Mexican \nauto plant. Do you know what the difference was? The difference was the \nMexican auto plant had no parking lot because the workers in Mexico \nweren't paid enough to buy the cars they make.\n  Go halfway around the world. Go to China and go to an Apple plant--\nactually, it is a Foxconn plant. Apple has hired a Chinese contractor. \nGo to an Apple plant in China. The workers don't make enough in those \nplants to buy the iPhone they make.\n  Go to Bangladesh and go to a designer clothing factory, an apparel \nfactory, and the workers don't make enough to buy the apparel they \nmake.\n  Go back to this side of the globe and go to Colombia and go to a farm \nwhere they are growing cut flowers. The workers don't make enough to \nbuy flowers for their girlfriends and wives for Valentine's Day. They \ndon't make enough to buy the cut flowers they are growing for \nAmericans.\n  That is what has happened around the world with these trade \nagreements. You see the same things--a race to the bottom. Almost \nanywhere the United States passes trade agreements, we see workers \noverseas making products they cannot afford for themselves. These trade \nagreements would be different if workers were paid enough that they \nbegan to make products made in Dayton, OH, or Gallipolis, OH, or Troy, \nOH. Instead, these workers cannot afford to buy the products they are \nmaking.\n  That is what our trade deals force American workers to compete with--\njobs that pay pennies an hour. They lead to a downward wage spiral \nacross the globe. Why do most people sitting in this gallery, why do \nmost people in this country, unless they are in the top 5 or 10 \npercent, why have they not gotten a raise in the last 10 years? The \nmiddle class in this country has not seen their incomes go up even \nthough the wealthy get wealthier, even though companies are more \nprofitable, even though executives pay themselves higher bonuses. The \nmiddle-class wages have been stagnant, partly because of these trade \nagreements and partly because my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwon't let us fix the Tax Code, where if you shut down production in \nLima or in Ravenna, OH, and move it to Wuhan or Shiyan, China, and sell \nit back into the United States, you get a tax break. American companies \nget a tax break for shutting down production in this country and moving \nit overseas and partly because of trade policy.\n  The reason people don't get raises in this country--a big reason--is \nbecause of a trade policy and a tax policy that far too many \npoliticians in this body have allowed to happen. That is why we can't \nafford another agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We can't \nallow a fast track of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The last thing we \nneed is another NAFTA, another Northern American Freed Trade Agreement. \nWe do not need a deal negotiated in secret and rushed--hence the term \n``fast track''--rushed with no amendments, with no real oversight, with \nno access even to reading the text.\n  It would intrigue people if they knew that it is harder for a Senator \nor a Senator's staff to get the opportunity to read the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--this newly negotiated trade deal--it is harder for us to \nget access to read that than it is to read about the Iran sanctions or \nto read a CIA report or to read a classified document from the \nDepartment of Defense. It is actually harder to get access to the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, to this trade agreement, to study it, than \nit is to national defense, national security concerns. What are they \ntrying to hide? Why would that be?\n  I have spent much of the last couple of weeks talking with workers \nand businesses around Ohio. I met with workers like Darryl Parker, a \nformer worker at R.G. Steel's Warren, OH, plant and former president of \nthe Steelworkers Local 1375. The plant has a proud history dating back \nto 1912. Close to 3 years ago, it was the fourth largest flat-rolled \nsteel maker in America. It didn't close because of poor performance. \nThese are some of the most productive workers in the world. There is \none reason 1,300 workers like Darryl lost their jobs: unfair trade.\n  I met with Vinny Gaietto in Toledo, a former American Standard \nworker--actually, in Tiffin. I met him in Toledo. Vinny lost his job in \n2007 when the plant closed down and moved to Mexico.\n  We cannot allow this to continue. We have no business passing fast \ntrack to fast track jobs out of this country, to fast track weaker \nenvironmental rules and worker safety rules.\n  Trade policy should ensure a level playing field for all companies \ncompeting in a global economy. Instead, our trade policy is unfair to \nsmall businesses, to workers, and to those communities where plants \nshut down one after another. The communities then have to lay off \nteachers, firefighters, police officers, and municipal garbage \ncollection workers because their tax base has shrunk because their jobs \nhave gone overseas.\n  Although worker productivity is higher, they face stagnating wages, \nincreased middle-class insecurity, and rising inequality at home. Yet \ncorporate profits are up and CEO pay has reached record levels. \nFundamentally the workers are not sharing in the wealth they have \ncreated for their employers.\n  The reason our economy worked so well after World War II is because \nproductivity went up, profits went up, wages went up, but since the \nassault on organized labor and trade unions and the decline of \nunionization in this country, productivity continues to go up, profits \ncontinue to go up, and executives' compensation and bonuses continue to \nskyrocket, yet wages have stayed flat and most Americans have not had a \nwage increase.\n  Last year Wall Street bonuses--just the bonuses on Wall Street--were \ndouble what all minimum-wage workers earned in the country combined. I \nwill say that again. Wall Street bonuses--mostly their Christmas \nbonuses, or whenever they are given--were double what all the minimum-\nwage workers in the country made combined.\n  We need to invest in supporting workers with a living wage, paid sick \nand family leave, and equal pay for equal work. We need to invest in \ninfrastructure. When the State government is cut, we know what \nhappens--particularly in my State. When the State government is cut, it \ncuts support for local communities. We know what happens to our \nhighways, our streets, and our bridges.\n  We fundamentally know that trade, done right, creates prosperity. I \nwant trade, and I want more of it. I think Ohioans want trade, but we \nwant trade that builds an on-ramp to the middle class here at home and \nlifts workers from poverty in America and around the world. We do not \nwant another NAFTA.\n  Earlier this month, I visited the Ford plant near Cleveland in Brook \nPark, OH. Ford brought its manufacturing of EcoBoost engines back from \nValencia, Spain. They invested $200 million and brought 450 new jobs to \nCleveland. Some companies, such as Ford, are beginning to reshore \nmanufacturing jobs because they know our workers are skilled and \nefficient. But auto companies need protections from foreign \ngovernments' unfair trade practices.\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\n  While I disagree with President Obama on the trade promotion \nauthority fast track and on the Trans-Pacific partnership agreement, I \ngive him credit for being more aggressive than President Bush or \nPresident Clinton on enforcing trade rules and trade laws. It makes a \ndifference in helping to create jobs.\n  Trade agreements must include provisions protecting our workers and \nour companies from foreign governments that artificially manipulate \ntheir currency. For example, Japan has a history of shutting out \nAmerican auto companies and manipulating their currency to benefit \ntheir own manufacturers. That policy has worked for Japan, but it has \nnot worked for us. In 2013, for every 1 car the United States sold to \nJapan, we imported 99 cars from Japan. That doesn't sound like a level \nplaying field, where cars that were made by American workers get an \nopportunity to sell in Japan. It is not much different with Korea. Too \nmuch is at stake. Our capacity to outcompete and outinnovate our \ncompetitors depends on our capacity to outmanufacture them. That means \nwe need trade policies that will create opportunities for workers and \nsmall businesses so they can earn a living wage and join the middle \nclass.\n  I urge my colleagues to demand increased transparency in this \nprocess. I urge everyone to say no to a deal that shortchanges our \nworkers and companies and does not ensure a level playing field.\n  We cannot allow another trade deal--we had NAFTA, PNTR with China, \nCAFTA, South Korea, and Colombia, one after another--that sells out our \nworkers and ships jobs overseas. It is time for a very different trade \npolicy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2098-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2098-S2100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE JIM OBERGEFELL STORY\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I rise with some excitement as I get to \ntell a story that is an American story. This story is, in fact, a love \nstory.\n  The first time Jim Obergefell met the love of his life, John Arthur, \nneither of them were swept off their feet. As is the case with a lot of \ncouples, they met at a bar through mutual friends. They met then a \nsecond time, but the sparks didn't really fly then either. It wasn't \nuntil a few months later that they met for the third time at a New \nYear's Eve party. This time, they fell in love. Jim and John like to \njoke that theirs was a story of love at third sight.\n  Following the New Year's Eve party, John and Jim began building their \nlives together in Cincinnati, OH. The next 20 years they spent doing so \nmany of the things that connected couples do. They said ``I love you'' \nfor the first time. They had their first fight. Their bond grew and \ngrew, and this incredible couple moved in together, buying their first \nhome, selling that home, buying another home, and working together, \nbuilding lives together. They moved from job to job, but they stayed \ntogether. Traveling, making friends, becoming involved with their \ncommunity, they built a life of love together.\n  Jim and John's love story is a familiar one. They crossed familiar \nrelationship milestones and faced so many of the same probing questions \nmany couples often get: Why aren't you married? Have you thought about \ngetting married? Hey, what about marriage?\n  Well, of course, they had thought about marriage. Their bond was that \nstrong; they were so deeply in love and committed. But their response, \nunfortunately, was that they had thought of it, but they wanted it to \nactually mean something legally. They wanted it to be right and just. \nThey wanted their marriage to be affirmed before all, and for it to \nhave meaning under the law. They wanted it to be recognized just as it \nwas for other American citizens. They wanted that ideal that exists \ndeep in our country's heritage, flowing through all of our roots, that \nthey together as a couple could have a life, could have liberty, and \ncould pursue their happiness.\n  However, for them at that time, equality and freedom for all in our \ncountry was an ideal that was seemingly far off. But I will tell my \ncolleagues this: What I love about America is that we cannot slow down \nthe dream of freedom and equality. It marches forward. Look at history \nand we see all of the attempts to stop these fundamental ideals of \nfreedom and equality under the law. People and tyrants, with brutality, \ntry to chain our freedom, try to beat it back. They try to assassinate \nits advocates, but just as the Statue of Freedom sits on the Capitol \ndome, freedom rises, and it will come.\n  Jim and John watched the progress march in our country as so many of \nus did with encouragement. Painfully slowly but steadily it marched \nforward. As they watched and waited, they went on living their lives of \nlove together. For almost 20 years, their union, their bond as \ncommitted people with unconditional love continued.\n  Unfortunately, though, John began having problems walking. After \nmonths of tests, doctors' appointments, prodding and probing, John was \ndiagnosed with ALS. The typical prognosis for a patient with ALS is \n2\\1/2\\ to 5 years. Jim became John's primary caregiver. He leapt up. He \nhad unconditional love. There were trying times, but he said he \nconsidered it a privilege to care for his life's love.\n  Two years after John's diagnosis in 2013, when he was receiving \nhospice care and was confined to a hospital bed in their Cincinnati \nhome, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Edith Windsor, declaring that \nthe Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. That decision set the \nstage for an even greater national movement toward marriage equality. \nIt set the stage--after years of struggle and fights and sacrifice for \nequal rights--for equality under the law, for love to be affirmed in \nmarriage between two Americans, to be affirmed and equally recognized, \nnot condemned, not banned, not made illegal. So on a warm day in June, \nafter 20 years of love, commitment, and building a life together, it \nwas at this moment that Jim leaned over to John, sitting there in his \nhospital bed, kissed him, and proposed: ``Let's get married.''\n  Because Ohio has yet to recognize marriage equality, and with John \nconfined to his bed, this was going to be challenging. Their options \nwere limited. Transporting John to a State that would recognize their \nmarriage would require a special medically equipped airplane, and it \nwould require a lot of money they did not have. Jim asked for ideas on \nFacebook, and people came forward. Unprompted, Jim and John's friends \nraised $13,000 to cover the entire cost of a specially chartered \nmedical plane.\n  A few weeks later, Jim, John, and John's Aunt Paulette, who became \nordained to perform the service, boarded a plane in Ohio that took off \nand landed nearby in Maryland. In this State, they recognize marriage \nequality. In this State, they recognized the love of two American \ncitizens. And for 7\\1/2\\ minutes, on the tarmac at Baltimore-Washington \nInternational Airport, John and Jim, two Americans, had their wedding.\n  Sitting on the tarmac, Jim, holding the hands of his partner of 20 \nyears--whose hands lacked dexterity and strength--said this to John:\n\n       We met for the first time, my life didn't change, your life \n     didn't change. We met a second time, still nothing changed. \n     Then we met a third time, and everything changed. As you \n     recently said, it was love at third sight, and for the past \n     twenty years, six months and eleven days, it's been love at \n     every sight.\n\n  In a cramped medical airplane, John's aunt began the formal vows. She \nstarted to say, ``Take each other's hands,'' but then realized they had \nnever let go of each other's hands.\n  They exchanged their rings, Jim helping John place the ring on his \nown finger, and after the ceremony they left that Maryland tarmac to \nfly back. Jim and John arrived home to the realities of a disease like \nALS. John was dying. And while they had taken their eternal vows \ntogether, while their marriage was affirmed by love, affirmed by this \nunbreakable commitment, affirmed by loving family and by friends, \naffirmed to be legal by the State of Maryland, their marriage was \ndisavowed by their home State--the State John would eventually die in.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n  These men at this time decided to work with a civil rights attorney \nbecause they feared that even after their actions on their part, John's \ndeath certificate would list him as unmarried--an assault on the \ndignity of two great men. His life with his partner--their 20 years of \nlove and commitment and ultimate affirmation of those years--their \nmarriage would mean nothing according to the government. They feared \nthat on this document--the last documentation of his life--that their \nlife of love and commitment would be denied by their government. On \nthis paper their marriage would be denied--negated, disallowed.\n  John, who married to the love of his life, died in his home State and \nwas listed on that final government document as single. With their \nattorney, the men filed a lawsuit to have John and Jim's marriage \nlegally recognized in Ohio. A week and a half after their marriage, a \ndistrict judge in Ohio ruled to recognize their wedding, but that was \njust the start of a long legal fight.\n  In the last few months of John's life, Jim worked with the attorney \nto continue to fight for recognition of their citizenship rights as \nAmericans. People would ask Jim: Why, when your husband is dying, would \nyou use your last days together to fight this? Jim's response was \nsimple: Why not?\n  Jim could not think of any better way to honor his husband, to live \nup to his vows, and to demonstrate the power of his love, the power of \ntheir commitment, the power of love in our world, other than to fight \nthis injustice.\n  A little over 3 months after their marriage, the inevitable \neventually arrived. John passed away at the young age of 48. Amidst his \noverwhelming grief, Jim found a small but substantive source of \nconsolation. On his death certificate he was listed as married with \nJim's name listed as his surviving spouse.\n  The State of Ohio appealed the decision to list John as married. \nTheir government went to court to strip him and his beloved of this \nrecognition and won. State officials made it their mission to change \nJohn Arthur's death certificate.\n  Jim Obergefell now stands as a named plaintiff in an appeal to the \nU.S. Supreme Court, the highest Court in the land, to have he and his \nhusband's fundamental rights recognized--that their vows and commitment \nbe worthy of recognition as American citizens. They have joined with \ncases from three other States also seeking that affirmation of \ncitizenship, of equality under the law. Together, all these cases have \ncome to represent the cause of paving the way for marriage equality to \nbecome a reality in our Nation.\n  Jim and John's story is moving. It is being heard in a building \nacross the street with these words emblazoned over its doors, ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.'' Their story is heartbreaking. It is inspiring, but \nunfortunately in our Nation right now it is all too common. This story \nof theirs about the persistent, unyielding, and indefatigable love \nconquering indifference about our ideals of equality conquering \ninequality in our country. This call is in their hearts for each other \nreflects the larger call for our country for itself, for us to live our \ntruth. It calls that question forward, what kind of country will we be? \nWill we be the Nation of love and freedom and equality? Will we be the \nNation that every single generation has had people standing up for \nthese ideals, people pushing to March forward for our country these \nideals. This is not a question about sexual orientation or race or \ngender, it is a question about whether our country will live up to the \nideals we say every time we pledge allegiance to our flag: ``. . . \nliberty and justice for all.''\n  Will we have equality under the law or will we tolerate a government \nthat denies some citizens fundamental rights while granting them to \nothers? This is the question that is being called.\n  It is a question that echoes throughout our history--Sojourner Truth, \nstanding in Akron, OH, at the Women's Convention, calling the question, \n``Ain't I a woman?''\n  It is a question by my family members that I heard, standing strong, \nsaying defiantly: I am a man. I, too, am an American citizen.\n  Proclaiming those words, generation after generation have strained at \nchains, have fought Jim Crowe. It is what Susan B. Anthony said when \nshe said, ``It is we the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor \nyet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the \nUnion. . . . ''\n  This is the ideal--the love of our country, the sacrifice for our \nprinciples, this ideal that has been fought for generation after \ngeneration. The question was called by abolitionists, by suffragettes: \nWill we be a nation with liberty and justice for all?\n  Throughout our history the question would call: Will we have freedom \nfor all? Will truth march on--as it did in Selma, as it gathered in \nchurch basements and protested at Stonewall and came together at Seneca \nFalls. Will we live our truth, despite the assassinations of its \nadvocates such as Milk and King, Matthew Shepard or Emmitt Till? Will \nour march come to fruition to fight for recognition of full citizenship \nbeyond race, beyond creed, beyond color, beyond orientation? It is this \ndream that must be secured for all of our citizens as Langston Hughes \nsaid so clearly: ``There is a dream in this land with its back against \nthe wall, to save the dream for one, we must save the dream for all.''\n  We fight for this dream here. The time is now. The anguish has gone \non long enough. And I will tell you I found out just preparing my \nremarks that we still face these weary years and too many silent tears.\n  I sat with staff members and learned of some of their struggles right \nhere as Capitol Hill employees. One of my young staffers shared that he \nentered his adult life unsure if his full citizenship rights would be \nan option in his lifetime. Could he have equality under the law? Could \nhe be married? Similar to many gay men and lesbians decades before him, \nhe was afraid his country would cast his love as less meaningful at \nbest or at worst vile and immoral. Yet today, in this case before the \nSupreme Court, it makes him hopeful that we can live in a country that \none day recognizes his love, his value, his dignity, as being equal \nunder the law.\n  Another staff Member told me he feared that his coming out as gay \nwould mean his own family would never accept him. He shared what he \ndescribed as a defining moment in his own valuation of his self-worth \nwhen he came out as gay to his deeply religious grandmother. She held \nhis hands tightly in her own and looked him in the eyes and proclaimed, \n``I will always love you, and I will love anyone who loves you.''\n  All across America right now there are weary years, silent tears, \nunspoken pain in the country that does not value the dignity, worth, \nand citizenship rights of too many.\n  What message does it send? How many stand in uncertainty and fear and \ndespair that threatens to consume the potential of young people? I see \nthe data of suicide rates rising for our gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \ntransgender teens. We cannot give any implicit support for any idea \nthat they are worth less or are lesser citizens, and we all should come \ntogether and condemn so-called therapies that purport to change who \npeople are at their core, as if it is not enough, as if they are not \nworthy. All across the country this struggle is going on, from \nintimate, personal struggles to public fights--stories of love meeting \nfear, stories of hope meeting despair, our families and communities \ncoming together to stand and say that I am an American. I am a citizen. \nI deserve equality under the law.\n  As Jackie Robinson said then, and it is true now: ``The right of \nevery American to first-class citizenship is the most important issue \nof our time.''\n  Jim and John and all Americans have a right not to second-class \ncitizenship but first-class citizenship, to honor their first-class \nlove.\n  I am a prisoner of hope today. I am not going to let disappointment \nafter disappointment undermine my infinite sense of hope for our \ncountry. The history of our Nation is a screaming testimony of a \nperpetual achievement of freedom and light and truth overcoming \ninequality and hatred. Just 3 years ago, only six States and \nWashington, DC, had marriage equality, with 34 million Americans living \nin marriage equality States. Now 37 States and DC have marriage \nequality, meaning 224 million Americans now live in States that honor \nequal rights to marry. This movement has been a strong validation of \nour country's history. It is a shining example of\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\nprogress. However, just because the arc of history always bends toward \njustice does not mean it will not meet resistance. As King said, \n``Change never rode in on the wheels of inevitability.''\n  We are the architects of our Nation. We are the truth tellers, life \nworkers, and lovers that must exult our principles. We cannot fail now. \nLove is on the line. Citizenship is on the line. We are interdependent. \nWe need each other. We cannot deny the worth of one American without \ndenying the worth, dignity, and strength of our Nation as a whole.\n  The story of Jim Obergefell and John Arthur is a story not just of \nunconditional love and unconditional hope, it is not just about the two \nof them, but it is about our country. This is the story of all of us--\nof America. It is a story of what our truth will be. One member of this \nincredible partnership has passed away, but I know their love marches \non.\n  I believe in this country our truth will march on, and equality and \njustice will have its way.\n  Madam President, I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Senator Sessions wants to speak in a \nmoment, and I will be brief.\n  I would like to thank Senator Booker for his always stirring words \nand for his sense of justice and fair play and leadership in so many \nways.\n  I met Jim about 1 year ago and had a brief meeting, not too long \nafter the court decision by Judge Black in the Cincinnati Southern \nDistrict Court in Ohio. I just spent a half an hour with him in my \noffice. He never wanted and never expected to be famous. He never \nexpected to come to Washington to meet with Senators. He never expected \nto travel the country giving speeches. He was once a high school \nteacher. He joked that more people have been with him as he traveled \nacross the country, joked that when he spoke to crowds of hundreds or \neven 1,000 about his experience with his beloved John and what has \nhappened, he wished that his students had listened to him so closely. \nYou could hear a pin drop when he spoke to hundreds, which is not \nalways the case when speaking as a high school teacher. But he wanted \nto live his life in a normal way as most Americans do. He never \nexpected to have his story or his marriage litigated before the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  But that is really the mark of character, that Jim has taken his \ngrief and his pain and hoped to change the world, and that is what he \nis doing. His marriage is still not equal in my State of Ohio. I am \nembarrassed by that. I was, frankly, embarrassed when Ohio, 10 years \nago, passed a constitutional amendment outlawing same-sex marriage. I \nthought it was a terrible public policy mistake. I think it left too \nmany people behind and too many people heartbroken.\n  Jim and his late husband John Arthur's story is one of love and \nsacrifice. It could happen to anyone. It could happen to any of us. \nFrankly, it happens to too many families. So as Senator Booker pointed \nout, they flew to Maryland where John's aunt, Paulette Roberts, \nofficiated their marriage on the tarmac in a medical plane.\n  Paulette remarked, ``If marriage vows mean anything, then those two \nwere more married than anyone I have ever known.'' That speaks to their \ncommitment, it speaks to their love, to the seriousness with which they \ntook their wedding vows, and the seriousness of the relationship for 20 \nyears prior to that.\n  Just 3 months and 11 days later John passed away. Jim has been \nfighting for his marriage ever since. The question is, why should he \nhave to do that? No one ever voted to allow my wife Connie and me to \nstand before our families and acknowledge our love and commitment. When \nwe were married, we were benefitting from a right not--get this--a \nright not extended to the minister who officiated our wedding.\n  The woman who officiated our wedding, Kate Huey, had had a marriage--\nshe had had a commitment ceremony 18 years earlier. It was not until \nlate last year that she traveled to New York with the woman she loved \nand was officially married, legally married in New York. You still \ncannot do that in Ohio. It is outrageous that she cannot do that in \nOhio. I am hopeful after Jim's case is argued a couple of weeks from \nnow and the Court hands down that decision, it will stop that bigotry \nand inequality that has hidden under the banner of tradition for far \ntoo long.\n  Keep in mind--and Senator Booker, I thought, laid out a lot of this \nhistory very well--Ohio once passed laws to keep Black people and White \npeople from marrying. Ohioans came together, as we always do, we \nrallied, we repealed that unjust and hateful antimiscegenation law. We \nhave a long history of fighting for justice and equality. We will not \nrest until we achieve that justice for Jim and for John.\n  I look at the pages who sit before us who are mostly 16 and 17-years-\nold. This is something that makes no sense to most of them. When I was \ntalking to Jim earlier in my office, he had made a speech in Athens, \nOH, to Ohio University students. He told me most of them could not \nunderstand why State laws would prohibit somebody from marrying the \nperson whom they love. They could not understand why the State \ngovernment, the Ohio State government, would spend my tax dollars and \nJim's tax dollars, the tax dollars of Hazel's parents--mother of the \npage from Ohio--the tax dollars of all of us to fight this court battle \nso that Jim's marriage would be denied.\n  If the Supreme Court rules in Jim's favor, and I think it will, Jim's \nname will go down in the history books, along with Roe, from Roe v. \nWade; and Brown, in Brown v. Board of Education. It is not what Jim was \nafter. It would be fitting for a love that spanned decades and was \nstrong enough to carry Jim here to Washington. The moment has come for \nour Supreme Court to stand on the right side of history and join \nAmericans who support marriage equality.\n  As Senator Booker said, 37 States and the District of Columbia now \nallow marriage equality. I do not like it that we have to rely on the \nSupreme Court to get my State to change its laws. We have politicians \nwho look backward rather than forward. That is too bad. We have \npoliticians who are willing to deny human beings basic rights, basic \ncivil rights, basic rights of decency and fairness.\n  I am hopeful that Jim's courage and Jim's outspokenness and Jim's \nwillingness to join on behalf of John in his fight and make this fight \nwill help change my State and help change our Nation. I know I cannot \nlook to the gallery and thank somebody so I will not look to the \ngallery, but I will still thank Jim from here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2100-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2100-S2103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SGR LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to share a few thoughts \nas we head into this week, because we will be confronting the question \nof how to fix the payment to our physicians who treat Medicare and \nMedicaid patients. If we do not take action, there will be a 21-percent \nreduction in the amount of money they are paid to do the work for the \nFederal Government.\n  This is an unacceptable alternative, but it is what current law says. \nCongress needs to fix it. In fact, we have been dealing with this for \n17 years. For 17 years, Congress has, in some way or another, fixed the \ndoctor payment plan and raised their pay so that they do not take a \ncut. As years have gone by, the size of the cut that needs to be fixed \nhas increased too, as I said, 21 percent today if we do not act. I \nthink there is a uniform, universal belief that we should do that, and \ndo it on a permanent basis so we do not have to have doctors calling \nCongress every year, saying: Are you going to change the law so I can \ncontinue to do Medicare work? If you do not change it and my services \nare cut 21 percent, I am out of here. I can hardly make a living now on \nwhat you pay me, and taking a big cut will not allow me to continue to \noffer Medicare services for people in need.\n  It is a big issue and a real issue. I have favored a permanent fix \nfor a number of years. I would offer, though, to my colleagues that \nmany of us who have been concerned about the financial condition of our \ncountry have successfully insisted each one of those 17 times that the \nnew money that is needed to pay the additional funding be\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\npaid for, that is, by finding wasteful spending or other spending \nsomewhere else in the government of this country and use that money to \nmake up the difference.\n  We have refused to pass it by just borrowing the money. Remember, \nthis is an entitlement. By that, it means once the government says what \nthe rate will be, the doctors will go out and do the work, they will \ndemand payment whether the government has any money or not, whether we \nare running deficits or not. If the government does not pay them the \nrate agreed upon, they can file a complaint and the government will \nhave to come up with the money.\n  What we really needed to offset this was a real finding of wasteful \nspending, or spending in other areas to divert that money to pay for \nthis increase in pay for doctors on a permanent basis. It appears that \nSpeaker Boehner and Democratic Leader Pelosi in the House got together \nand agreed on a bill. They passed it in the House with a big vote. Even \nmost Democrats voted for the bill.\n  It was sent to the Senate as we were voting, at that very time, that \nvery day, on the budget resolution for the Senate. We were proud of our \nbudget. It was not a perfect budget. I supported it. But it balanced. \nIf we follow the plans put forth in the budget resolution that passed \nthe Senate--if we follow those--we would be on a path to a balanced \nbudget. We would be spending about $4,000-plus billion 10 years from \ntoday. We would be increasing spending all right, but not as much as \nhas been projected, but we also see a $3 billion surplus in the final \nyear of the budget window. So instead of having a deficit in the 10th \nyear, we were going to have a $3 billion surplus. That is something to \ncelebrate after decades of deficits, trillion dollar deficits, $1,000 \nbillion deficits. I think we have averaged $1,000 billion deficits for \nthe last 6 years. Unbelievable.\n  We are committed to the American people to do something about it. The \nBudget Control Act and other efforts have reduced our spending from \nwhat it might otherwise have been. The House decided to send H.R. 2 to \nthe Senate. They passed it with a big vote. This bill, over 250 pages \nin length, was sent to the Senate the same evening as our budget vote-\narama. We had over 750 amendments under consideration that evening. We \nfinished the budget process at 3 a.m. What many wanted us to do was \njust pass this bill at 3 a.m. with hardly any knowledge of what was in \nit and without a real understanding of how much it was going to cost. \nWe were told by a number of people that it was ``paid for.'' ``Don't \nworry about it.'' ``It has been taken care of.''\n  So there was concern about that. Senator McConnell did not bring it \nup at 3:30 in the morning right before we did our recess. It was \nunseemly to have done that for a whole host of reasons. But we are \ncoming right up to the deadline. The deadline was March 31, but I \nunderstand that there was a 14-day window whereby Congress could \nconsider a fix before doctors were impacted. We need to get this taken \ncare of. But we need to do it responsibly, in a grownup fashion.\n  The House Members really did not have the bill to study. They just \nfollowed mainly talking points, which if you read their talking points, \nI may have voted for it, based on what they were telling their Members. \nThe talking points said this: First, it told House members that the \nbill pays for all new future spending.\n  To not have a 21-percent cut, but to pay them at a more appropriate \nrate, this bill is going to cost more money. But, they were told that \nall the new future spending would be paid for.\n  Second, it said it allows ``Congress to go through regular order and \nlegislate thoughtfully.'' So we were going to pass it at 3:30 in the \nmorning without it having gone through a committee and without having a \nreal, firm, long-term cost estimate from CBO as to what it would \nactually cost?\n  Third, they also said in their talking points, ``It offsets all new \nspending.'' What that means, to Members of Congress, is that it would \nnot add to the debt because somehow the increase in spending would be \noffset by a reduction in spending somewhere else.\n  Fourth, they used the phrase we use around here, they claim it \n``bends the cost curve,'' it would bring down costs. But this is not \naccurate either.\n  So here are the problems: This bill is not paid for. Our own \nCongressional Budget Office said it would add $141 billion to the \ndeficit. Over 10 years, you add those up, $141 billion. They said the \nnet increase to the debt would be $174 billion. How does it get to be \nmore than 141? Well, when you spend $141 billion more then you have, \nyou have to borrow the money. When you borrow the money, you pay \ninterest on the money.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said it would add an additional $33 \nbillion in interest payments just over that 10 years. Many promoting \nthis legislation said: Well, there may be a shortfall in the first 10 \nyears, but over 20 years, the reductions in spending we found somewhere \nare going to bring in enough money to pay for it fully then.\n  So what did the Congressional Budget Office say? The Congressional \nBudget Office said this. ``It will increase budget deficits'' in the \n``second decade.'' So instead of reducing the deficits or paying for \nthe cost of this by changes now that benefit us 15, 20 years from now, \nit adds more.\n  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget--a fine, responsible \nnonpartisan group headed by Maya MacGuineas--did a study of this. They \nsaid over 20 years it would add $500 billion to the deficit. Those \nnumbers, to my knowledge, have not been disputed. I think that is a \npretty accurate figure. It is not going to reduce the deficit. In 10 \nyears, it is going to add $174 billion--not going to reduce the deficit \nover 20 years, it is going to add $500 billion.\n  So this violates the Budget Control Act that we passed in 2011 that \nis in law today. That is something we should not be doing. We need to \nadhere to that agreement which the President signed and we in both \nHouses of Congress agreed upon in a bipartisan way to hold spending \ndown. It is not going to balance the budget, the Budget Control Act \ndoesn't, but it helps a lot. We ought to at least adhere to it.\n  So this violates the Budget Control Act and is subject to at least \neight different violations--points of order, we call it, where you can \nobject because it violates the budget. There are at least eight \ndifferent ways in which this legislation violates the Budget Control \nAct and, of course, it violates the House and Senate budgets that we \nare just now in the process of adopting.\n\n  The Senate has passed its budget. They had a $3 billion surplus in \nthe 10th year. Listen, not paying down any of that debt except that $3 \nbillion in the 10th year--but just not having annual deficits--it would \ntake us 10 years to finally balance the budget, which we need to do. \nExperts have told us we need to do so because we are on an \nunsustainable financial path.\n  So our budgets go further than that. The House and the Senate budgets \ndo so. If we pass a bill that adds $174 billion to the deficit, it will \nbe at least $17 billion in the 10th year. So instead of having a $3 \nbillion surplus, we will have at least a $14 billion deficit. And the \nday we are celebrating the fact that we altered the spending course of \nour country and produced a balanced budget, that very day we were asked \nto pass a bill that would wipe out all of that. It is just not \nresponsible, in my view.\n  I am just not able to tout the fact that we passed a balanced budget. \nMaybe that is why they would like to pass this bill before the final \nagreement between the House and the Senate occurs in conference and we \nhave a firm budget. We just now have a House budget and a Senate \nbudget. Maybe they wanted to do that so the first thing we do isn't to \nbust the budget to which we just agreed.\n  I wish I didn't have to say these things. I wish I didn't have to say \nthis, but the truth is that this is not responsible. This is not \nmaintaining faith with the American people who sent us to Congress.\n  I think on both sides of the aisle--certainly on the Republican \nside--there were real commitments made to our constituents that if we \nwere in Congress, we would do something about these deficits and we \nwere going to bring this government under control and produce a \nbudget--a budget that balances.\n  In addition, it is claimed and asserted that this legislation \nrepresents a permanent fix--that we will not have to continue to come \nforward each year\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nto come up with the funding or some legislation to keep the doctors \npaid at a reasonable rate. But it is not a permanent fix, either. It is \nnot a permanent fix, as has been reported. It is only about 9 years, \nand there are huge, long-range concerns.\n  There is another thing it does, and, colleagues, we have to \nunderstand this. Being on the Budget Committee, we went through it. It \nis so important. One of the greatest manipulations and gimmicks we are \ndoing is in the way we are spending the taxpayers' money, why our \ndeficits are so large and our debt has become $18-plus trillion--on \nwhich we paid interest--$220 billion last year, and it will grow every \nyear, according to CBO.\n  Why? We double count money. It is unbelievable.\n  This is what they are going to propose. They are going to cut \nMedicare Part A in this legislation. That is the benefit that goes to \ndoctors and hospitals. They will cut it about $55 billion--I believe \nthe figure is--and then they will use this $55 billion to pay the \nphysicians under Part B and D of Medicare--the non-trust fund money. So \nthey are gutting the Medicare trust fund. That money is money that \ncomes off of your paychecks every week and goes to pay for your \nMedicare when you retire. That money goes into a trust fund. It has \ntrustees. If you cut the cost of doing business for Medicare, the \nsponsors of the bill say it will extend the life of Medicare 1 year.\n  That is probably correct. If you cut what you pay to doctors or \nhospitals or medical devices or drug companies, you reduce what you \npay, you could extend the life of Medicare, its financial solvency. It \nis becoming insolvent just as Social Security is becoming insolvent. So \nwe need to do some things to help extend its life so our seniors don't \nhave to worry about not having health care in the future.\n  How is it double counted, Jeff?\n  Well, they are using the money--the trustees. It is the trustees of \nMedicare's money that is being saved.\n  How did it get outside of the Medicare trust fund and get spent for \ndoctors in that part of Medicare? How does it get out of there?\n  The trustees of Medicare loan the money to the U.S. Treasury. Now we \nhave it, colleagues. The money that is used to pay the doctors that \ncomes from Medicare cost reduction is borrowed money, just the same as \nif they had borrowed it from a financier in London or Beijing. Interest \nis paid to the Medicaid trustees.\n  You cannot count the money twice. You cannot save the money here and \nsay it improves Medicare--legally it does improve Medicare--but it \nprovides no money to spend on new programs outside of Medicare, and the \nCongressional Budget Office has told us this. Yet they are scoring, I \nthink, $55 billion they claim is going to pay for this new expenditure \nby double counting the money.\n  ObamaCare did that, I believe--by about $500 billion. They cut \nMedicare expenses and used the money to fund an entirely new program. \nBut the money didn't go directly to the U.S. Treasury. It went to the \ntrustees of Medicare, who loaned it to the U.S. Treasury and double \ncounted the money.\n  If you would like to know why we are going broke, this is one of the \nbig reasons this country is on a reckless course. Nobody wants to talk \nabout it or confront it, because if you do, it reduces spending, and \npeople around here like spending too much.\n  By the way, I note our hospitals would like to see the doctors get \npaid more and have this problem fixed, but a big chunk of what is \nclaimed of that portion of this new expenditure that is actually paid \nfor appears to be $31 billion in cuts to providers such as hospitals. \nSo we are cutting hospitals here to pay doctors, and our hospitals are \nstruggling too.\n  To conclude, this is why the American people don't trust Congress. \nSome of our Members get their feelings hurt when they go home and some \ntea party person or somebody else accuses them of wasting money, not \nmanaging well, and they are offended by it.\n  I have to say the tea party got more right than wrong. This is \nanother example of reckless, irresponsible spending.\n  Before adjourning for our recess 2 weeks ago, in the middle of the \nnight, at 3 a.m., we passed a balanced budget plan, and we were proud \nof it. We went home the last 2 weeks and told our constituents we were \ngoing to work to accomplish that balanced budget goal and try to make \nsure it becomes a reality.\n  But what is the first bill we consider since adopting the balanced \nbudget goal? What is the first bill? We are taking up a bill to dig us \n$174 billion deeper in debt in the first 10 years. The first major \nlegislative accomplishment of our new Congress is going to be adding \nalmost $200 billion to the debt over 10 years and then perhaps $500 \nbillion or half a trillion over 20 years.\n  It is not necessary. I don't see how we can look our constituents in \nthe eye and say we are producing a balanced budget, when, if this bill \npasses, we don't have a balanced budget.\n  Well, was the plan really to balance the budget, people might ask, or \njust to use as talking points, just a fun campaign claiming we have a \nbalance? Our new Congress was sworn in only 3 months ago, and we are \nalready shattering our promises to our constituents.\n  I think it is fair to say we are acting irresponsibly. Not only are \nwe continuing to allow the debt to explode, but we aren't really being \nhonest with our constituents about it.\n  Before they cast their votes, House Members were told this bill \n``pays for all new future spending'' and that it ``offsets all new \nspending.'' But this is not accurate. It is not true. It adds to the \ndeficit every single year.\n  We are going to offer an amendment so that this bill lives up to the \npromises of the sponsors. A good amendment, a PayGo amendment that I \nthink Senator Lee will probably offer which will put us on a path to \nensure that this new expenditure is paid for.\n  I think we need to have that vote, and I think it needs to pass. That \nwould be responsible. Then we could honestly say we made choices. That \nis what you should do in this body. There is a limited amount of money \nand a virtually unlimited number of requests for good projects that we \nshould spend money on.\n  We are sent to the Senate to make choices, set priorities, do the \nright thing, and manage money carefully--that is why our constituents \nfrom all over the country sent us here, and they had their tax money \nextracted from them and sent to Washington--to be spent wisely and \nhonestly, I suggest.\n  One of the most amazing things is that we spend $3,800 billion a year \nnow. We can't find $15 billion a year to fix the doctor payments? We \ncan't find $15 billion in this whole $3,800 billion a year that we \nspend that will actually be able to fund the doctors in the way that we \nshould fund them without adding to the debt?\n  You bet we can. I have a list of them. Others have a list of them. \nThere will be some suggestions as to how this could be done.\n  We don't need to gimmick up this legislation, but it is legislation \nthat undermines the promises we made that we are going to be fiscally \nresponsible.\n  We don't vote on talking points. We vote on legislation. Legislation \ncan be studied, and it becomes law. Our Congressional Budget Office, \nand the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Maya MacGuineas \nand the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget can read and add the \nnumbers. They have read them, added them, and they don't add up.\n  This is legislation. We are not voting on talking points.\n  Without change, it is a massive debt increase that puts a balanced \nbudget even further out of reach.\n  It means a lot to me that we, as a Congress, establish credibility \nwith those whom we serve. One of the parts of doing that is to be \nhonest and to say we do have a tight situation here. We are going to \nhave to make some choices--but not brutal choices.\n  We can find the money we need without doing anything but eliminating \nfraud, waste, abuse, duplication, and unwise spending. We don't have to \nsavage children or the military to do so, but it is hard work. Every \ntime you talk about reducing this program or that program, a group \nshows up and pushes back, but that is why we are here.\n  As my wife says to me when I complain: Don't blame me; you asked for \nthe job.\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\n  That is what we asked for--to be in the Senate and make these tough \nchoices.\n  I hope, in the hours that are ahead, we will be able to have some \namendments--and there are several that would fix this and would allow \nthe doctors to receive the pay they are entitled to--and they are \nentitled to it--but at the same time would not add to the debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would just add that this isn't just my \nopinion about these cost overruns in the legislation. Here is a Wall \nStreet Journal article from a few days ago: ``Two-thirds of $214 \nbillion cost would be financed through higher deficits. . . . '' That \nis the subheadline on that. The headline is: ``Senate Wrangles Over \nMedicare-Payments Fix.''\n  So I don't think there is any real doubt about that. The article goes \non to say:\n\n       The deal reached by House leaders would shift some of those \n     costs onto Medicare beneficiaries--\n\n  So some of the Medicare benefits, such as Part C, are not part of \ntrust fund money. It is not paid for when you have that withholding \nfrom your paycheck, and people with higher incomes probably ought to \npay a higher percentage of the cost that they can reasonably afford, if \nthey have a higher income, when they go see a doctor. I think we could \nuse that. But at any rate, this bill would shift some costs to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The article continues--\n\n     while providers such as hospitals also would shoulder some \n     costs.\n\n  So they are paying for some of these costs by having reduction in \npayments to hospitals that are hurting this year. And the article \nstates:\n\n       The rest would be financed through higher deficits.\n\n  No doubt about it.\n  Forbes magazine comments here in an article by Stan Collender, saying \nthat ``the procedural choices Congress is making all favor increasing \nthe deficit rather than at least requiring it not get any worse.''\n  This is what the article says about the SGR--the physician's payment: \n``The SGR change without a full offset is projected to add an average \nof around $14 billion a year to the deficit.''\n  Here is a headline from The Fiscal Times: ``Medicare `Doc Fix' May Be \nNo Fix at All.''\n  Paul Winfree, an economic policy expert with the Heritage Foundation, \nsaid this:\n\n       Rather than a permanent replacement to the Sustainable \n     Growth Rate--\n\n  Remember, we have been promised this would be a permanent \nreplacement--\n\n     it is much more likely that the House doc fix will be a \n     shorter-term patch requiring another series of patchwork \n     legislation just nine years from now.\n\n  They also conclude in this article that the permanent fix would ``add \n$141 billion to the deficit over the first 10 years and could go as \nhigh as $500 billion over two decades, as previously reported here.''\n  I did want to emphasize it is really not $141 over 10 years, it is \n$174, because when you add up $141 billion in additional debt over 10 \nyears, you pay interest on that. You borrow that money and pay \ninterest, and when you calculate the interest that is paid, the \nincreased interest is $174 billion added to the total deficit of \nAmerica.\n  Colleagues, our interest payment on our debt is staggering. The \nhighway bill is about $40 billion to $50 billion a year. Aid to \neducation is nearly $100 billion a year, for example. The interest we \npay annually on the current $18 trillion debt, in spite of the fact we \nhave some of the lowest interest rates we have ever had, was more than \n$220 billion-plus last year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, however, says that 10 years from \nnow, with interest rates projected to return to the mean and with the \ndeficit every year out for 10 years, we will be over $900 billion in \ninterest in the 10th year. That is just in 10 years. We go from $200 \nbillion to $900-plus billion.\n  This is why the Congressional Budget Office Director, chosen by our \nDemocratic colleagues, Dr. Elmendorf, a very capable, wise man, has \nsaid we are on an unsustainable path. This is a path of fiscal \ndestruction. It is not responsible.\n  So day after day, week after week, we in Congress are going to have \nto start saying, no, we don't have the money. Do you not understand? We \ncan't keep digging the hole deeper. We are supposed to be trying to \nfigure out a way to reduce deficits and balance the budget, not to pass \nmore legislation that is going to cost more money than we have to spend \non these things. The only way we will be able to honor that legislation \nis to borrow more. That is what we are doing.\n  So I don't think there is any doubt about what I have said. If \nsomebody can come down and prove this bill is paid for I will shake \ntheir hand and I will be happy because I want to do the doctors fix, \nand I want to be sure we do it in a responsible financial way. If not, \nwe will have legislation, amendments will be offered that I think can \nfix it and that will require Congress to come up with the money in a \nproper way, do the assistance we need to provide to our doctors and not \nadd to the debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President. I rise today to recognize Mrs. Ethelene \nThompson.\n  She was born on June 6, 1925, in Water Valley, MS, as the third child \nof Minnie and Solomon Morgan. Today, Ethelene is a caregiver known to \nmany in her community for her willingness to provide free childcare and \ntransportation to those in need. She lived through the Great \nDepression, World War II, the civil rights movement, and the election \nand tenure of the first African-American President. In 1946, she \nmarried Willie Thompson, and they raised six beautiful daughters, until \nhis passing in 2000.\n  Mrs. Thompson has been instrumental in helping raise her 14 \ngrandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren, and 4 great-great-grandchildren. \nShe is known to give selflessly of her time and wisdom and to countless \nfolks in her neighborhood and at her church.\n  She helped lead the Girl Scout troops for her daughters and \ngranddaughters, ensured that her grandson and his friends made it to \nevery sports practice and game, and has served faithfully as a member \nof the Bloomfield Full Gospel Baptist Church for more than 50 years, \nwhere she has been a member of the choir, Sunday school, and kitchen \nministry.\n  I take this opportunity to celebrate Mrs. Ethelene Thompson's life \nand legacy. May she continue to grow in her steadfast faith and love \nfor her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2104-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2104-S2105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the Senate was in recess, Loretta \nLynch, the nominee to be our next Attorney General, announced that her \noffice brought charges against two residents of Queens, NY, for \nconspiring to use weapons of mass destruction and plotting a terrorist \nattack on American soil. U.S. Attorney Lynch continues to work \ntirelessly to protect our Nation, but the Senate Republican leadership \ncontinues to play politics with our law enforcement and has prevented \nthe Senate from fulfilling one of our most essential constitutional \nduties--the duty to provide advice and consent on Presidential \nnominations. The same baseless political obstructionism that has \nstalled Ms. Lynch's nomination has also led to the Senate's failure to \nconfirm a single Federal judge so far this year.\n  As one of the country's top Federal prosecutors, Loretta Lynch has an \nunparalleled record of keeping Americans safe from dangerous criminals \nand terrorists. This includes the successful prosecution of six \nindividuals for their roles in a 2009 Al Qaeda plot to attack the New \nYork subway system, the convictions of four terrorists who plotted an \nattack on John F. Kennedy Airport, and the conviction of a terrorist \nwho sought to detonate an explosive device at the New York Federal \nReserve. Despite her distinguished record of service, the Republican \nleadership is trying to use Ms. Lynch's nomination for political gain. \nThis is not how the Senate should be treating a nomination of such \nimportance to law enforcement and our national security.\n  It has now been more than 5 months since President Obama announced \nthe nomination of Ms. Lynch to be Attorney General. Her nomination was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support in \nFebruary, yet it has been pending before the full Senate for 46 days. \nThat is nearly twice as long as all of the past seven Attorneys General \ncombined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; William Barr, 5 days; Janet Reno, \n1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days, Alberto Gonzales, 8 days; Michael \nMukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. This historic delay is an \nembarrassment for the Senate.\n  In January, Ms. Lynch testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor nearly 8 hours and she responded to nearly 900 written questions. \nNot a single witness invited by Republicans opposed her nomination. \nWhen Republicans stalled consideration of Ms. Lynch's nomination in \ncommittee, Democrats noted the unnecessary delay and raised concerns \nabout filling this vital position. The assistant Republican leader \ndismissed this as ``faux outrage.'' But in November 2007, that same \nSenator complained that a 7-week process on the Mukasey nomination \nthreatened our national security. He issued a press release stating:\n\n       It is imperative that the president has his national \n     security team at full strength and the unnecessary delay of \n     Judge Mukasey's nomination has prevented that. He deserves an \n     immediate up-or-down vote by the full Senate.\n\n  Similarly, in early October 2007--just 3 weeks after Mr. Mukasey's \nnomination was announced, the Republican leader criticized me for not \nyet having set a hearing date, saying that Democrats should ``not hold \nJudge Mukasey hostage while they play partisan games.'' This is the \nsame Republican leader who is now holding Ms. Lynch's nomination \nhostage and who has kept her nomination languishing on the floor for \nnearly twice as long as the past seven Attorneys General combined.\n  No one can deny that Ms. Lynch is eminently qualified for the job. \nThe Republican leader should schedule a vote on Ms. Lynch's nomination \ntoday. She has the votes to be confirmed, and a vote on this highly \nqualified nominee is long overdue. The Majority must stop playing \npolitical games with our law enforcement.\n  We should also be voting on all 10 judicial nominees who have been \npending in the Senate since last year, two of whom just passed the 1-\nyear mark since they were first nominated. Tonight, we will consider \njust one of those nominees. Once confirmed, Alfred Bennett will fill a \n``judicial emergency'' vacancy in the Southern District of Texas that \nhas been empty for more than 2 years. There is no good explanation why \nit has taken us nearly 7 months to vote on his nomination, nor is there \na good reason for why we are not voting on the other two pending \nnominees to district court vacancies in Texas. There are still two \nFifth Circuit vacancies and seven other Federal district court \nvacancies in Texas for which there are no nominees. Texas has two times \nthe number of Federal court vacancies of any other State, and these \nvacancies account for one-third of the judicial emergency vacancies on \nour Nation's courts. I urge the Texas Senators to work with the \nPresident so that we can receive nominees for those vacancies as soon \nas possible.\n  Despite promises to govern responsibly, the Republican majority has \ncontinued to obstruct when it comes to judicial vacancies. When Senate \nDemocrats were in the majority, we confirmed 15 of President Bush's \ndistrict and circuit court nominees by April 2007. We confirmed 68 \njudges during the last 2 years of the Bush administration, building on \na record I established at the very beginning of the Bush Presidency \nwhen 100 judges were confirmed in the 17 months that I served as \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee. The fact that it has taken more \nthan 3 months into the 114th Congress for the Republican majority to \nschedule a vote on a single judicial nominee is disconcerting, \nespecially because all four\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\nof the district court nominees who have been languishing on the Senate \nfloor were recommended to President Obama by their two Republican home \nState Senators.\n  Judge Alfred Bennett, whom we are voting to confirm today, is \ncurrently the presiding judge on the 61st Civil District Court in \nHouston, TX. From 2010 to 2011, he served as the administrative judge \nof the Harris County Civil District Courts. Judge Bennett has presided \nover 8,400 cases, 640 jury trials, and 550 bench trials. Prior to \nbecoming a judge, he was in private practice for a decade and litigated \na range of civil matters. Judge Bennett has the support of both his \nRepublican home State senators, Senator Cornyn and Senator Cruz. He was \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by voice vote on \nFebruary 26. He has strong qualifications and should be confirmed.\n  I urge the Republican majority to schedule votes to confirm the \nremaining judicial nominees pending on the Executive Calendar. None of \nthe nominees are controversial. We should do our jobs and vote on their \nnominations so that they can start doing their jobs working for the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2105-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KIM KRUEGER\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Kim Short Krueger, a \ndedicated public servant for the U.S. Congress and the people of the \nState of Montana for over 39 years.\n  On behalf of all Montanans and all Americans, I stand to say ``thank \nyou'' to Kim for her service to our State and Nation.\n  It is my honor to share the story of Kim's public service and \ncommitment to her country.\n  Kim grew up in the small railroad town of Three Forks, MT. Kim was \nonly 21 when she packed her bags and moved to Washington, DC. She began \nher congressional career as a receptionist for Montana Congressman Dick \nShoup, back when Montana still had two congressional districts.\n  Always proud of her small town roots, Kim went to work for Nevada's \nonly Congressman, Jim Santini, in the mid 1970s. Kim wore many hats, \nserving as both the personal secretary and the scheduler, and \neventually became office manager.\n  Ever dedicated to putting Montana constituents first, Kim once gave a \nyoung Montana law student her personal ticket for Nelson Rockefeller's \nswearing-in as Vice-President of the United States. As fate would have \nit, Kim later married this same young law student and he became a \ndistrict court judge in Butte, MT.\n  In 1983 it was time for Kim to head home to Montana. Kim went to work \nfor Senator Max Baucus as field director of the Butte District office \nfor southwestern Montana.\n  Along the way, Kim built up an impressive record of accomplishments \nwhile always meeting the day-to-day demands of serving constituents. \nKim consistently demonstrated her skill and grace in handling the needs \nof Butte and southwest Montana's constituents. She worked on all sorts \nof issues--from the Butte superfund, housing, banking, taxation, \nnatural resources, immigration and military academy appointments.\n  In 2010, Kim was appointed State casework director.\n  Kim had a strong hand in boosting Montana's economic ties. Kim ran \nthree Montana economic development summits hosted by Senator Baucus in \nButte. The summits brought in folks from all around the world, like \ninvestors, ambassadors, and top business leaders. Almost 3,400 folks \nattended the final summit in 2013. Thanks to Kim's tireless work on the \nsummits, new businesses have moved to Montana.\n  Kim also worked on superfund issues, the Beaver Dam Park, the Old \nWork Golf Course, and the Maiden Rock Bridge on the Big Hole River.\n  Senator Baucus depended on Kim to run his Butte office smoothly and \nto represent him at local events. She often worked nights and weekends, \ngoing above and beyond her duties to meet the needs of the people of \nsouthwest Montana.\n  In February 2014, Senator Baucus was confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador \nto China and Governor Steve Bullock appointed John Walsh to serve out \nthe rest of his Senate term. Senator John Walsh asked Kim to continue \nas field director of his Butte office and as the State casework \ndirector.\n  While I could go on and on about Kim's incredible congressional \nachievements, I know she is most proud of her amazing family. Kim and \nher husband Kurt have two terrific children, Krista and Derrick. A true \nMontana native, she is very proud that her children were born and \nraised in the historic city of Butte, MT.\n  Kim recently retired from my Butte District field office where she \nwas working on special projects.\n  During her years of service, Kim always went beyond the call of duty \nto ensure the Montana congressional offices met the needs and requests \nof the constituents of our fine State. Her professionalism and \ndedication to her jobs and Montana constituents are outstanding \nexamples of how government should work. Kim's positive attitude, \nindispensable knowledge and talent for serving constituents were \ninvaluable to the citizens of southwest Montana.\n  Everyone who knows Kim is touched by her energy, kindness, dedication \nand positive attitude.\n  I am honored to know Kim and grateful that she was able to serve on \nmy Senate staff. I know her family and friends join me in thanking her \nfor her commitment to others. I wish her best of luck in all of her \nendeavors and many years of success to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2105-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2105-S2106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING CANTOR IVAN E. PERLMAN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \nto remember and honor the late Ivan E. Perlman, who served as the \npresident of the Cantors Assembly of America from 1983 to 1985. Cantor \nPerlman was devoted to his faith, his family, his community, and his \ncountry. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II and \nreceived the Bronze Star for his heroism at Iwo Jima. He stood next to \nLt. Roland B. Gittelsohn, the Marine Corps' first Jewish chaplain, at \nthe dedication of the 5th Marine Division Cemetery on Iwo Jima in March \n1945. He chanted a version of ``El Malei Rachamim,'' which is only sung \nfor fallen U.S. soldiers. The division chaplain had asked Chaplain \nGittelsohn to deliver the sermon at a joint service for all those who \nwere killed in the epic battle, but some Catholic and Protestant \nchaplains objected, so three separate services were held. But three of \nthe Protestant chaplains boycotted their own service to join Chaplain \nGittelsohn. They sent copies of his sermon, ``The Purest Democracy'', \nextolling the cause of democracy and freedom and equality to the entire \nregiment. It was widely circulated, appearing in newspapers and \nmagazines nationwide, and was read on the radio and into the \nCongressional Record.\n  After the war ended, Cantor Perlman, who was born in Flushing, NY, \nmarried Muriel Herman in 1947 and completed his cantorial studies at \nthe Jewish Theological Seminary in 1950. Cantor Perlman served \ncongregations in Lyndhurst and Fairlawn, NJ; Tulsa, OK; Des Moines, IA; \nProvidence, RI; Stockholm, Sweden; and Sarasota, Boca Raton, and \nTamarac, FL. Along the way, he and his wife had four sons: Eli, Emanuel \n``Manny'', Richard ``Rick'', and Josh. He trained all four of his sons \nin the cantorial arts, and they have carried on the family tradition is \nan exemplary way.\n  Cantor Perlman was cantor emeritus at Temple Emanu-El in Providence, \nRI, where he served for 23 years. After he retired from Temple Emanu-\nEl, at the age of 76, Cantor Perlman became the cantor at Temple Beth \nKodesh in Boynton Beach, FL. Two years later, he was elected the \ncongregation's Ritual Leader. Cantor Perlman conducted his last service \nthere in 2005 and then he and his wife returned to Rhode Island, where \nhe was a founder of the Friends of the Rhode Island School for the \nDeaf. Cantor Perlman was a life member of the Marine Corps League, the \nJewish War Veterans, JWV, and the Knights of Pythias. He served as the \nJWV post commander in New York City, and the department chaplain in \nIowa, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and Florida. He was the JWV's first \nnational cantor.\n  I mentioned that all four of Ivan Perlman's sons also became cantors.\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\nManny Perlman is the cantor at Chizuk Amuno in Baltimore. He and his \nbrother Eli--the religious leader of Congregation Beit Shalom in \nMonroe, NJ--participated in the October 24, 2011 dedication of the \nmemorial at Arlington National Cemetery to the 14 Jewish military \nchaplains killed in action in World War II, the Korean war, and the \nVietnam war. The memorial stands near separate monuments honoring \nfallen Protestant and Catholic chaplains that have been on Chaplains \nHill since 1981 and 1989, respectively. Manny and Eli, like their \nfather before them at Iwo Jima 66 years earlier, sang the ``El Malei \nRachamim'' memorial prayer. Cantor Eli Perlman rose to the rank of \ncaptain in the Army's Special Forces during the Vietnam War era. He \nserved in 1967 with CPT Morton Harold Singer, who was killed in a plane \ncrash in 1968 on his way to lead Hanukkah festivities for American \nservicemen and women. Captain Singer's name is one of the 14 listed on \nthe memorial.\n  I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating the \nwonderful life and legacy of Cantor Ivan Perlman and expressing our \ndeepest condolences to his beloved wife Muriel; his son Rabbi Eli \nPerlman and his wife Lynne of East Brunswick, NJ; his son Cantor \nEmanuel Perlman and his wife Janice of Baltimore, MD; his son Rabbi \nRichard Perlman and his wife Kit of Coventry, RI; his son Cantor Josh \nPerlman and his wife Sherri of Germantown, MD; his sister Annette \nZiegelstein of Baltimore, MD; his 13 grandchildren, 7 great-\ngrandchildren; and all the other family and friends of this \nextraordinary man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2106-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO RABBI SCOTT E.

While I am unable to attend the event, I have \nknown Rabbi Scott for some time, and I have had the good fortune of \nspeaking alongside him at the annual Martin Luther King, Jr., \ncelebration at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta in the past.\n  Rabbi Colbert has served Temple Emanu-El in many capacities since \n1987. He holds degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, \nas well as New York University, Hebrew Union College--Jewish Institute \nof Religion, and the Rabbinical Academy of America. In 1992, he was \nawarded the prestigious title of Reform Jewish Educator by the Reform \nMovement. In 2001, he graduated again from the Hebrew Union College--\nJewish Institute of Religion earning a doctor of ministry degree in \npastoral counseling. Earlier that year, the college institute honored \nhim with an honorary doctorate for his outstanding service to the \nJewish people.\n  In addition to serving as senior rabbi at Temple Emanu-El, Rabbi \nColbert is adjunct professor of Jewish religious thought at the McAfee \nSchool of Theology at Mercer University. He is a published author and \nwrites for various professional journals.\n  I applaud Rabbi Scott and congratulate Temple Emanu-El on their good \nfortune in having had him as one of their spiritual leaders for 29 \nwonderful years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2106-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND HENRY HOLLEY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to honor a great Christian \ncrusader, a great Georgian, a great American and a great friend, the \nReverend Henry Holley, upon his retirement.\n  Reverend Holley spent 45 years with the Billy Graham Evangelical \nAssociation, spreading the Gospel across the world, including in China, \nJapan, Brazil, and even North Korea, as international crusade director.\n  For many years, Reverend Holley traveled an average of 150,000 miles \nand 200 days overseas each year. At 87 years of age, he has logged 13 \nmillion air miles in his travel over his career with the Billy Graham \nEvangelical Association as a result of working in Korea more than 275 \ntimes and China more than 100 times.\n  Henry Holley's career on behalf of the Lord has more than a few \n``highlights.'' Reverend Holley organized the historic 1973 crusade in \nSeoul, Korea, where never before had so many come to one place to hear \na preacher proclaim the Gospel. On the final day, there were 1.1 \nmillion people in attendance. During the 5-day Seoul Crusade more than \n3.2 million people came to hear Dr. Billy Graham face-to-face.\n  In 1974, Holley was crusade director for another precedent shattering \ncrusade: the Greater Rio de Janeiro Billy Graham Crusade in Brazil held \nat the world famous Maracana Stadium. More people attended this meeting \nthan any other crusade ever held in North or South America, with \n250,000 attending on closing day.\n  In 1992, Holley was responsible for the diplomatic and administrative \npreparation work for a historic visit by Dr. Billy Graham to North \nKorea. Reverend Holley directed the small team that accompanied Dr. \nGraham to the capital city of Pyongyang. The significant mission to \nPyongyang was highlighted by Dr. Graham preaching the Gospel in the two \nchurches in North Korea. In addition, he lectured at Kim Il-Sung \nUniversity--the first American to do so. Dr. Graham and Reverend Holley \nalso had a personal meeting with President Kim Il-Sung where he brought \nprivate messages from President George Bush and Pope John Paul II.\n  Organization and administration were drilled into Holley during his \nfirst career lasting 30 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, including 23 \nyears Active Duty and 7 years Reserve Duty. Reverend Holley has served \nour Nation and our Lord in extraordinary ways throughout his entire \nlife.\n  He has recently retired from Billy Graham Evangelical Association, \nthough he continues to remain active in a consulting capacity and has \nworked with Franklin Graham for many years. And Reverend Holley \npromises not to really stop working ``until he's old.''\n  For nearly 45 years, Henry Holley and his wife of more than 65 years, \nBettie, have made their home right near mine in Marietta, GA. Bettie \nhas stood by his side through his career and shared in his successes \nand joys, including their three grown children, four grandchildren and \ntwo great-grandchildren.\n  I try to talk to, and visit with Henry Holley, as often as I can. I \nknow that God put him in my life for a reason and I am honored to call \nReverend Holley my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2106-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2106-S2107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING CHARLESTON JOB CORPS\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, today I honor the Charleston Job \nCorps Center and the 50th national anniversary of this outstanding \nprogram.\n  Since June of 1965, the Charleston Job Corps Center has been a leader \nin advancing vocational education and providing training that our \nState's youth can utilize for the rest of their lives. A successful \nyoung workforce means great things for the future of our State's \neconomy and for strengthening our local communities. What began as an \nall-female center at the old Kanawha Hotel on Summers Street grew to \nbecome a coeducational facility in 1976 as interest in the program \nincreased.\n  Administered by the U.S. Department of Labor, Job Corps is a no-cost \neducation and career technical training program that helps youth ages \n16 to 24 enhance the skills they need to be independent and successful \nindividuals. The Charleston center is overseen by the Philadelphia \nRegional Office of the Job Corps and is operated by Horizons Youth \nServices.\n  In addition to a strong emphasis on academics, the Charleston Job \nCorps Center also provides impressive recreational programs. These \nprograms are critical to encouraging our youth to be creative and work \nas part of a team--both of which are prized assets to any employer \nseeking to hire hardworking, talented, resourceful employees.\n  I cannot adequately express how valuable Job Corps is not only in \nWest Virginia, but across our entire Nation. It is often underestimated \nhow much of an impact an educator can have on a student--not only in \nthe classroom or in a training session, but years down the road. \nCountless lives have been positively affected thanks to the educators, \nadministrators, and supporters\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\nof Job Corps, and I sincerely hope this program continues to flourish \nfor generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2107-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER ERIC BADER\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee will soon bid farewell to our congressional \nfellow, Coast Guard CDR Eric Bader, who has served the Committee on \nAppropriations for the past 2 years. Commander Bader will be returning \nto Massachusetts where he will be the executive officer of Coast Guard \nAir Station Cape Cod. While I know Commander Bader is looking forward \nto running the day-to-day operations of the air station and flying \nhelicopters again, his departure is a great loss for the Committee on \nAppropriations as he is an invaluable asset to our team.\n  Commander Bader has been detailed to the committee from the Coast \nGuard since June 2013 and is a key member of our professional staff. \nMr. President, Commander Bader performed admirably in his role on the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. He did everything we \nasked of him, with pinpoint accuracy, and always beat the deadlines \ngiven to him. I would also add that he served the committee during \ninteresting times, perhaps more interesting than he imagined when he \naccepted the job. He was here during sequestration, for the Federal \nGovernment shutdown in the fall of 2013, the dramatic increase of \nunaccompanied children crossing our southern border, our response to \nthe Ebola crisis, numerous Presidentially declared disasters, and \nfence-jumping and drone incidents at the White House. Eric also helped \nthe subcommittee manage the arrival of the fiscal year 2016 budget \nrequest for the Department of Homeland Security at the same time \nCongress was considering, and ultimately enacting, the fiscal year 2015 \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security that had \nbeen delayed.\n  The Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee has greatly \nbenefited from the experience Commander Bader gained as a Coast Guard \nofficer, in particular his insights into the operations of a complex \nmilitary organization that is combined with a large domestic agency. He \nhas superb analytical skills that have been critical in our review of a \n$39 billion budget request and in developing complex spreadsheets that \nsynthesize funding issues into easily understood documents we have used \nin hearings, closed briefings, in full committee, and on the floor. On \nthe subcommittee, he handled the portfolios for the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center and the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, \nas well as assisted with the Customs and Border Protection and Secret \nService portfolios. In this oversight role, Commander Bader was able to \nobtain timely information when undocumented families who had recently \ncrossed the border during last summer's surge were temporarily provided \nshelter at the training facility in Artesia, NM. He also helped track \nthe daily influx of undocumented children and families to assist the \nsubcommittee in making the most up-to-date funding recommendations to \naddress this unforeseen surge. While arguably not a traditional \nappropriations area, he also put together a subcommittee hearing on \ntrade enforcement issues that showed how lax trade enforcement and \ncurrent duty collection policies were unfairly hurting some American \nindustries. The hearing highlighted the harm to domestic steel, \ncrawfish, seafood, and honey producers of these illegally dumped goods \nand commodities on American jobs and the economy at large. Commander \nBader made critical recommendations that were adopted to improve key \ncomponents within the Department of Homeland Security, including the \nfunding of nuclear detection equipment designed to keep our ports safe.\n  Commander Bader is also an exceptional writer. We relied on his \neditorial skills to put the appropriate touches into opening \nstatements, press releases, and analytical documents shared with all \nthe subcommittee members. His ability to take dry statistics and create \ninformational, easily understandable graphics and charts will be \ngreatly missed. His unqualified professionalism, perception, superb \nanalytic focus, and technical skills, combined with a keen sense of \nhumor, a cool head, and a modesty rarely seen on Capitol Hill, have \nplayed an integral part in moving the homeland security appropriations \nprocess forward. His high standards of professionalism and thoroughness \nare beyond reproach and his contributions are highly valued.\n  Through all of this, Eric maintained the decorum and professionalism \nthat we have all come to expect from our military officer corps, and he \nhas represented the Coast Guard with the highest integrity and \ncompetence. Commander Bader has served me, this subcommittee, and the \nSenate well. We are sorry to see him leave and will miss him as our \ncolleague but are glad to count him as a friend. Each of us on the \nHomeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee wish Eric all the best as \nhe moves forward in the next phase of his career, where he will be \nrunning the day-to-day operations of the Coast Guard Air Station in \nCape Cod. We look forward to seeing him back in uniform because we \nanticipate great things from him in the coming years.\n  I am grateful for his contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2107-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2107-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2107-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT OF THE VETO OF S.J.

Res. 8 would overturn the National Labor Relations Board's \nrecently issued ``representation case procedures'' rule and block \nmodest but overdue reforms to simplify and streamline private sector \nunion elections. Accordingly, I am withholding my approval of this \nresolution. (The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U.S. 655 (1929)).\n  Workers need a strong voice in the workplace and the economy to \nprotect and grow our Nation's middle class. Unions have played a vital \nrole in giving workers that voice, allowing workers to organize \ntogether for higher wages, better working conditions, and the benefits \nand protections that most workers take for granted today. Workers \ndeserve a level playing field that lets them freely choose to make \ntheir voices heard, and this requires fair and streamlined procedures \nfor determining whether to have unions as their bargaining \nrepresentative. Because this resolution seeks to undermine a \nstreamlined democratic process that allows American workers to freely \nchoose to make their voices heard, I cannot support it.\n  To leave no doubt that the resolution is being vetoed, in addition to \nwithholding my signature, I am returning S.J. Res. 8 to the Secretary \nof the Senate, along with this Memorandum of Disapproval.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 31, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2107-6", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2107-S2108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURMENT\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate on January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 1, 2015,\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\nduring the adjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House \nof Representatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 1092.

Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Cardin, and \nMr. Franken) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 133\n\n       Whereas the week of April 6, 2015, through April 12, 2015, \n     is National Public Health Week;\n       Whereas the theme for National Public Health Week in 2015 \n     is ``Healthiest Nation 2030'', with the goal of making the \n     United States the healthiest nation in one generation;\n       Whereas public health organizations use National Public \n     Health Week to educate the public, policymakers, and public \n     health professionals on issues that are important to \n     improving the health of the people of the United States;\n       Whereas the value of a strong public health system is in \n     the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, and \n     the places where we all live, learn, work, and play;\n       Whereas there is a 16 percent difference in the health \n     status of people living in the healthiest States compared to \n     people living in the least healthy States;\n       Whereas public health professionals help communities \n     prevent, prepare for, withstand, and recover from the impact \n     of a full range of health threats, including disease \n     outbreaks, natural disasters, and disasters caused by human \n     activity;\n       Whereas public health professionals collaborate with \n     partners that are not in the health sector, such as city \n     planners, transportation officials, education officials, and \n     private sector businesses, recognizing that other sectors \n     have an important influence on health;\n       Whereas according to the Institute of Medicine, despite \n     being one of the wealthiest nations in the world, the United \n     States ranks below many other economically prosperous and \n     developing countries with respect to many indicators for \n     healthy life, including life expectancy, infant mortality \n     rates, low birth weight rates, and the rate of drug-related \n     deaths;\n       Whereas studies show that small strategic investments in \n     prevention can result in significant savings in health care \n     costs;\n       Whereas each 10 percent increase in local public health \n     spending contributes to a 6.9 percent decrease in infant \n     deaths, a 3.2 percent decrease in deaths related to \n     cardiovascular disease, a 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due \n     to diabetes, and a 1.1 percent decrease in cancer-related \n     deaths;\n       Whereas in communities across the country, more people are \n     changing the way they care for their health by avoiding \n     tobacco use, eating healthier, becoming more physically \n     active, and preventing unintentional injuries at home and in \n     the workplace;\n       Whereas despite having a high infant mortality rate \n     compared to other economically prosperous and developing \n     countries, the United States is making progress, with the \n     infant mortality rate declining 12 percent between 2005 and \n     2011;\n       Whereas in 2013, the percentage of adults smoking in the \n     United States decreased from 21.2 percent to 19.6 percent and \n     the percentage of physically inactive adults in the United \n     States decreased from 26.2 percent to 22.9 percent; and\n       Whereas efforts to adequately support public health and \n     prevention can continue to transform a health system focused \n     on treating illness to a health system focused on preventing \n     disease and promoting wellness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Public Health \n     Week;\n       (2) recognizes the efforts of public health professionals, \n     the Federal Government, States, tribes, municipalities, local \n     communities, and individuals in preventing disease and \n     injury;\n       (3) recognizes the role of public health in improving the \n     health of individuals in the United States;\n       (4) encourages increased efforts and resources to improve \n     the health of people in the United States to create the \n     healthiest nation in one generation through--\n       (A) greater opportunities to improve community health and \n     prevent disease and injury; and\n       (B) strengthening the public health system in the United \n     States; and\n       (5) encourages the people of the United States to learn \n     about the role of the public health system in improving \n     health in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2112-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 134--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nPRESIDENT AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE SHOULD ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNMENT \n OF CANADA DOES NOT PERMANENTLY STORE NUCLEAR WASTE IN THE GREAT LAKES \n                                 BASIN\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Peters, Ms. Baldwin, and Mr. \nDurbin) submitted the following resolution;

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask \nunanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the \nfollowing treaty transmitted to the Senate on April 13, 2015, by the \nPresident of the United States: Protocol Amending the Tax Convention \nwith Japan, Treaty Document No. 114-1.\n  I further ask that the treaty be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its \nratification, the Protocol Amending the Convention between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of Japan \nfor the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal \nEvasion with respect to Taxes on Income and a related agreement entered \ninto by an exchange of notes (together the ``proposed Protocol''), both \nsigned on January 24, 2013, at Washington, together with correcting \nnotes exchanged March 9 and March 29, 2013. I also transmit for the \ninformation of the Senate the report of the Department of State, which \nincludes an overview of the proposed Protocol.\n  The proposed Protocol was negotiated to bring U.S.-Japan tax treaty \nrelations into closer conformity with current U.S. tax treaty policy. \nFor example, the proposed Protocol provides for an exemption from \nsource-country withholding tax on all cross-border payments of \ninterest, and updates the provisions of the existing Convention with \nrespect to the mutual agreement procedure by incorporating mandatory \narbitration of certain cases that the competent authorities of the \nUnited States and Japan have been unable to resolve after a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe proposed Protocol and give its advice and consent to its \nratification.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, April 13, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/13/senate-section/article/S2139-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2139-S2140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, APRIL 14, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
