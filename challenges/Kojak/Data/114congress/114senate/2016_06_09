Mr. President, I rise to speak of Pastor Steve Berger. It \nmoves me to hear his voice echoing throughout this Chamber. He is one \nof the preeminent spiritual leaders in our Nation. He prays daily with \nhis wife Sarah, who happens to be in the Chamber.\n  He prays daily for our Nation. There is a purity of his mission in \nleading a church that is making a difference in our State, and I think \nmaking a difference in our country, leading efforts not only here but \naround the world to bring people together, and I am so thrilled this \nChamber and the people of our country are able to witness someone who I \nbelieve to be one of the greatest spiritual leaders in our Nation.\n  I only hope more people would be able to hear from him. Truly, it is \na very moving moment for me to have a friend like Steve Berger, who \nmeans so much to our State and country, before us. I thank him for his \nwillingness to do this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I welcome Steve Berger and thank \nSenator Corker for arranging for him to be here today. Steve is, \nindeed, one of our most distinguished Tennesseans. We welcome his \nfamily and some of his friends who are with us in the Gallery.\n  Chaplain Barry Black has reminded us that this tradition of opening \nthe Senate with a prayer has been with us since the Senate began, and \nthe Senate has had a Chaplain before the First Amendment to our \nConstitution was adopted. This tradition is an essential part of the \nAmerican character, and having Steve Berger here to help us celebrate \nthat essential part of the American character is a very special moment \nfor me as well as for Senator Corker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3667-4"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, President Obama's approach to national \nsecurity policy began with unworkable ideas on the campaign trail, and \nit has been marked by some consistent themes, like inflexible \ncommitments to drawing down our conventional military posture from \nacross the globe, like an excessive reliance on international \norganizations, like a tendency toward the use of Special Operations \nforces to train and equip units in other countries.\n  What do we see as we look back now at the twilight of his Presidency? \nWe have seen increased instability in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand Yemen. We have seen the evolution of Al Qaeda in Iraq into ISIL and \nits expansion into Libya, Syria, and the Sinai.\n  In just a few short months, the next Commander in Chief, regardless \nof party, will be faced with the consequences of the President's failed \nforeign policy and will need to adapt an insufficient defense \nmodernization program to tackle both the challenges posed by terrorism \nand by adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran.\n  This is why we need to use the remaining months of this \nadministration to help prepare the next administration, regardless of \nparty, to deal with the news it is about to inherit. That is\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nwhat we are doing on the floor right now. The Defense bill before us \nwill modernize our military and provide our troops with more of the \ntools they need to confront the threats we face. It will help prepare \nthe next Commander in Chief to confront the complex challenges of today \nand of tomorrow. It is serious policy--policy that will keep our \ncountry safe, and after years of this administration's spin and \nfailures, that is what our people deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3667-6"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just left my ``Welcome to Washington,'' \nwhich I have been having for many years. I had about 85 people from \nNevada, my constituents--our constituents--and they asked me what I had \ndone in the Senate that I remember. So I told them a few things. They \nalso asked me if I have a regret, and I do.\n  It takes a lot of gall for my friend the Republican leader to talk \nabout foreign policy. My biggest regret is having voted for the Iraq \nwar. I was misled, as a number of people were, but it didn't take me \nlong to figure that out. So I became convinced it was a mistake, and I \nspoke out loud and clear.\n  Why was it a mistake? It was the worst foreign policy decision made \nin the history of our country. That invasion has caused the death of--\nno one knows for sure but about one-half million Iraqis--500,000 dead \nmen, women, and children. At this stage, because of the invasion, we \nhave now complete instability in Syria. About 300,000 are dead there. \nMillions have been displaced, driven into Europe and other places. Iran \nis stronger than they would have been but for the war. The whole Middle \nEast is destabilized.\n  When President Bush took office, because of the work done in the \nClinton administration, we had a balanced budget. Can you imagine that? \nA balanced budget. We were spending less than we were taking in as a \ncountry. When Bush took office, we had a surplus of, over 10 years, $7 \ntrillion. Where is that money now? It has been used with a credit \ncard--a credit card that paid for two wars. I repeat, unpaid for and \ntax cuts unpaid for. We are now upside down.\n  So for my friend to talk about failed foreign policy takes a \ntremendous amount of mental gymnastics. We have been clear from the \nstart, enough on the war in Iraq. It is a disaster that will be written \nabout for centuries because the full impact of it is not over yet. We \nhave been clear from the start of this Congress, the appropriations \nprocess needs to stick to last year's budget agreement. It is the law, \nwhich maintains parity between the Pentagon and the middle class, and \navoid poison-pill riders.\n  Today, we vote on Senator McCain's amendment to add $18 billion in \nPentagon spending beyond what Congress agreed to in last year's \nbipartisan agreement. In response, Senator Reed of Rhode Island and \nSenator Mikulski of Maryland have offered an amendment that would add \nsecurity and other funding in America to maintain the parity to which \nboth parties agreed in the budget law passed last year.\n  Our amendment would increase funding to combat Zika. By the way, we \nhad a briefing yesterday by the head of the Centers for Disease \nControl. The man who is in charge of NIH, with this terrible virus that \nis sweeping this part of the world, told us they are desperate for \nmoney. They are desperate for money to do their research to prepare \nvaccines.\n  Our amendment would also increase money for local police to fight the \nopioid scourge, to improve our infrastructure around the country, and \nto do something about the money that has never been provided to take \ncare of the devastation that hit Flint, MI, with the lead in the water. \nThe security of our great country depends on more than bombs and \nbullets. I support the military. I have my entire career. I know how \ngallantly they fight.\n  In my ``Welcome to Washington'' today, there was a young cadet there. \nI brought him up first thing to show him off. This young man is one of \nthe finest students in America. He could have gone to school anyplace. \nNot only was he a good student, he was a good athlete. He chose the \nMilitary Academy. He believes in serving his country.\n  I do everything I can to support the military, but our security \ndepends on more than bombs and bullets. It depends on the FBI, Homeland \nSecurity, Drug Enforcement Administration, and these many other myriad \nthings that take place in our country that need our attention.\n  If Republicans pass this amendment of Senator McCain's to block a \nsimilar increase for the middle class--Senator Reed's and Senator \nMikulski's amendment--they will have a broken budget agreement, and \nthey will grind the Defense appropriations bill to a halt. We have put \neveryone on notice. We have done it before, but let me reiterate. If \nthey break the budget agreement with the McCain amendment, the \nRepublicans will be stopping the appropriations process on the Defense \nappropriations bill. We will not get to the appropriations bill. That \nis not a threat. It is a fact.\n  The solution this year is the same as last year's: stick by the \nbudget agreement and give fair treatment to the Pentagon and nondefense \nspending. They should be on equal grounds.\n  Mr. President, I see no one on the floor. I yield the floor and ask \nthe Chair to announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3668-2"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, is the time automatically divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be \ndivided equally between the majority and minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not generally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Oh, it is not divided.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       72nd Anniversary of D-day\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this week, as we are debating the National \nDefense Authorization Act, we also celebrate the 72nd anniversary of D-\nday. On June 6, 1944, more than 160,000 allied troops, including 70,000 \nbrave Americans, did something that no one had ever tried before--a \ncross-channel landing the size and scope of which had never been \nenvisioned as a reality by warriors. These brave soldiers stormed the \nbeaches of Normandy.\n  I had an opportunity a few years ago to visit the Normandy American \nCemetery and Memorial. I walked through the cemetery with a Belgian \nguide who had a great appreciation for everything our American soldiers \nhad done to try to bring freedom to Europe again. By the way, later \nthat summer he visited the National World War I Memorial in Kansas \nCity, MO. We talked about the cemetery. One of my sons and one of my \ngrandsons were with us, and they had a chance to identify two brothers \nburied side by side and a father and son who were buried side by side. \nThese Missourians had given their life on D-day.\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\n  Our guide sat us down on this low wall with the English Channel \nbehind us where the Atlantic Ocean flows in and out and with the 8,000 \nor so graves in front of us. He then opened up his computer, and there \nwas a picture of General Eisenhower and Walter Cronkite sitting in \nexactly the same place 20 years after the D-day landing, June 6, 1964. \nFormer President Eisenhower said something like this: You know, Walter, \nmy son graduated from West Point on D-day, and many times over the last \n20 years, I thought about the family that he and his wife have had a \nchance to raise and the experiences they shared, and I thought about \nthese young men who didn't have those 20 years because of what they \nwere asked to do.\n  To hear those words spoken by the person who was ultimately the one \nwho asked these brave soldiers to do what they did showed the \nresponsibility he felt 20 years later for the many lives that were lost \nand those bodies that were brought back to the United States. That \nNormandy cemetery doesn't even begin to reflect the lives that were \nlost. It really made me think when he said: Many times over the last 20 \nyears, I thought about these young men and the lives they didn't get to \nhave because of what they were asked to do.\n  We have debated this bill for over 50 years now, and we have passed \nthis bill every single year. Every time we debate this bill, we should \nthink of what those who defend us are asked to do. We should think \nabout men and women who are carrying on the legacy of that generation \nof D-day and World War II and Vietnam and Korea and wars before that \nand after and the obligation we have to be sure that they have every \npossible advantage in any fight. Frankly, we never want to see \nAmericans in a fair fight; we want it to be an unfair fight. We want \nthose who defend us to have the best weapons, best training, best \nsupport, and the best of everything so they have every possible \nadvantage when they do what they are asked to do.\n  This bill came out of committee with three ``no'' votes. It has \nstrong bipartisan support. It is time to get this work done just as the \nSenate has done for 54 straight years. This will be the 55th year.\n  I am particularly glad that this bill takes new steps toward \nrecognizing the sacrifice we ask military families to make. GEN Ray \nOdierno, the immediate last Chief of Staff of the Army, said that the \nstrength of a country is its military and the strength of the military \nis its families.\n  This legislation includes language that Senator Gillibrand and I \nintroduced last fall which, for the first time ever, would give \nfamilies more flexibility if there is a job or educational opportunity \nfor a spouse. Many times, military families are asked to move a little \nquicker or stay a little longer. If our language is in the final bill \nand the President signs it, for the first time ever it will allow \nfamilies--without being questioned in any detail beyond whether they \nmeet the conditions of the Military Families Stability Act--to go ahead \nand move so the kids can start school on time, or whatever the case may \nbe, and the servicemember would stay or a family could stay a little \nlonger so that their spouse can complete any career obligations they \nmay have so they can continue to do what they do. Too many of our \nmilitary spouses are unemployed and don't want to be or underemployed \nand don't want to be because their careers are constantly impacted, and \nthe cost of maintaining two residences that those families now have to \nbear really makes no sense at all. This bill allows us to move forward \non that issue.\n  The men and women of the Armed Forces, as well as the civilians and \ncontractors who support them, work every day to meet the challenge. \nThey have faced more than 15 years of active military engagements and \nhave made all kinds of sacrifices so we can continue to have the \nfreedoms that we have.\n  The bill before us also enhances the capability of the military and \nsecurity forces of allied and friendly nations to defeat ISIL, Al \nQaeda, and other violent extremist organizations so they are no longer \na threat to us. This bill ensures that our men and women in uniform \nhave the advanced equipment they need to succeed in any future combats. \nThe bill reduces strategic risk to the Nation and our military \nservicemembers by prioritizing the restoration of the military's \nreadiness so they are able to conduct the full range of all of its \nactivities. We need training dollars, training time, and airplanes that \nare younger than the pilots who fly them, and this legislation \ncontinues to move forward in that area.\n  It also continues with comprehensive reform for the Defense \nAcquisition System that is designed to drive more innovation and ensure \nmore accountability to not take more time than it needs to take, but to \nbe sure that everything is being done with the interest of the \ntaxpayers and the security of the country in mind.\n  Finally, this bill puts the Senate on record again against the \nPresident's plan to remove terrorist detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. \nWe apparently need to continue to do this over and over again because \nsomebody is just not getting it.\n  There was a front page article, I believe in the Washington Post this \nmorning, about the absolute certainty that people who are freed from \nGuantanamo Bay over and over again reenter the fight and kill Americans \nand our allies. The people who are there now need to be kept there. The \nObama administration itself admitted earlier this year that Americans \nhave been killed by terrorists from Guantanamo. By the way, that \nadmission came just days before another dozen inmates were transferred \nout of Guantanamo.\n  According to the Director of National Intelligence, nearly one-third \nof terrorists who have been released from Guantanamo are either \nconfirmed or suspected to be rejoining the fight, and those were \nsupposedly the detainees who could be released. They were supposedly \nthe least dangerous of the detainees. The people who are there now are \nclearly understood to be the most dangerous, the most likely to be back \nin the fight, and the most likely to inspire others to be in the fight.\n  The number of detainees released under the Obama administration who \nwere suspected of engaging in terrorism has doubled since July of 2015 \naccording to the Director of National Intelligence. The President of \nthe United States supports and appoints the Director of National \nIntelligence. This is not some outside person suggesting things that \nthe Obama administration wouldn't want to hear. This is their Director \nof National Intelligence and ours. What we need is a President who has \na real plan to defeat terrorism, and while this bill can't ensure that, \nthis bill does provide the tools to defeat current terrorists in the \nMiddle East and continue to secure our liberty.\n  The No. 1 job of the Federal Government is to defend the country. The \nNo. 1 job of those of us in the Congress is to be sure that those who \ndefend the country have what they need to defend the country and to \nensure that those who have served have every commitment that has been \nmade to them fulfilled, and then some.\n  It is time to pass this bill for the 55th straight year. We need to \ndo what we should do for those who serve and protect us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to \nengage in a colloquy with the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4229\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we will have a vote around 11:30 a.m. on \nmy amendment that would increase funding under OCO to address the \nconsequences of an $18 billion shortfall from last year. All the \nreports we hear from the military are that sequestration is killing \nthem. The mismatch of what we are now seeing in the world as compared \nwith a continued $150 billion less than fiscal year 2011 is putting the \nlives of the men and women who are serving this Nation in danger.\n  I am told there will be a lot of people who will vote against this \nincrease to\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\nbring it up just to last year's number--an increase of $18 billion. I \nsay to my colleagues: If you vote no on this amendment, the \nconsequences will be on your conscience. If you ask any leader in \nuniform today, they will tell you that the lives of the men and women \nwho are serving this Nation in uniform are at risk. I think we have a \ngreater obligation, and that is the men and women who are serving in \nthe military.\n  The Chief of Staff of the United States Army said: We are putting the \nlives of the men and women serving in uniform at greater risk. That \ndidn't come from John McCain or Lindsey Graham. Talk to any military \nleader in uniform, and they will tell you that sequestration is killing \nthem. Planes can't fly; parts of the military can't train and equip. \nOnly two of our brigade combat teams are fully ready to fight. Look at \nthe world in 2011 when we started this idiotic sequestration and look \nat the world today.\n  My colleague serves on the Armed Services Committee and spent about \n33 years as a member of the United States military and has been a \nregular visitor to Kabul and Baghdad. I think he understands that what \nwe are doing with sequestration and voting against this amendment, in \nmy view, is putting the lives of the men and women who are serving in \ndanger. Have no doubt about it. There will be further attacks in \nEurope, and there will be further attacks in the United States of \nAmerica. We won't be ready, and the responsibility for it will be on \nthose who vote no on this amendment.\n\n  I recognize my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Here is the issue: To those who are a slave to these sequestration \ncaps, to those who believe sequestration and this budget practice we \nare involved with is going to save the country, boy, I couldn't \ndisagree with you more. We haven't moved the debt needle at all.\n  Discretionary spending is not the reason we are in debt. We are \nspending at a 2008 level. So these blind, across-the-board cuts limited \nto discretionary spending and a lot of programs that are not even \nsubject to sequestration are not moving the debt needle; they are \ndestroying the ability to defend this country.\n  The theory we are advocating here today is that there is an emergency \nin the U.S. military that needs to be addressed and we should be able \nto add money to the U.S. military, the Department of Defense, based on \nan emergency that is real and not be limited by caps that are insane.\n  Here is the issue: Is there an emergency in terms of readiness? Is \nthere an emergency in terms of operations and maintenance? Are we \nputting the ability to modernize our force at risk in an emergency \nsituation because we don't have enough money to fight the wars we are \nin and modernize the force for the wars to come?\n  If you don't believe us, here is what the Commandant of the Marine \nCorps said about the current state of readiness: ``Our aviation units \nare currently unable to meet our training and mission requirements, \nprimarily due to Ready Basic Aircraft shortfalls.''\n  I can tell you that in the Marine Corps today, 70 percent of the F-\n18s have a problem meeting combat status. I can tell you today that the \nArmy is stretched unlike any time I have ever seen. I can tell you \ntoday that the Navy is robbing Peter to pay Paul to keep the ships on \nthe ocean, and with the numbers we have in terms of defense spending, \nthey are having to forgo modernization to deal with readiness, to deal \nwith the ability to fight the war. I can tell you that the Commandant \nof the Marine Corps is going to take six B-22s out of Spain that are \nused to rescue consulates and embassies that come under attack in \nAfrica because we need those planes to train pilots, and if we don't \nbring back those planes, we are not going to have an airworthy B-22 \nforce at a time when we need it.\n  We are creating a hole and a vacuum in our ability to protect our \ndiplomats and U.S. citizens.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask my colleague whether he is aware that, at a \nhearing, General Milley, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, testified \nthat the Army risked not having ready forces available to provide \nflexible options to our national leadership and, most importantly, \nrisked incurring significantly increased U.S. casualties.\n  I say to my colleagues who are going to vote against this, you are \ntaking on a heavy burden of responsibility of incurring significantly \nincreased U.S. casualties in case of an emergency. The military is not \nready. We are at $100 billion less than we were in 2011 when \nsequestration began, and the world has changed dramatically.\n  I can't tell you my disappointment to hear that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee--I don't know if my colleague knows this--said \nhe is going to vote against it, using some rationale that they are \nincreasing it by some $7 billion. That is insane. That is not only \ninsane, it is irresponsible, and most importantly, it is out of touch. \nI say to my colleague and the chairman of the subcommittee, you are out \nof touch with what is going on in the world and in the U.S. military. \nYou better get in touch.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will add that anybody who doesn't believe there is an \nemergency in the U.S. military is not listening to the U.S. military \nand has not been following the consequences of what we have done over \nthe last 5 or 6 years in terms of cuts to the military.\n  Over the last 7 or 8 years, we cut $1 trillion out of the U.S. \nmilitary. We are on track now to have the smallest Army since 1940, the \nsmallest Navy since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in modern times. \nWe are on track to spend half of what we normally spend in time of war. \nNormally we spend about 4.5 percent of GDP to defend this Nation; we \nare on track by 2021 to spend 2.3 percent of GDP.\n  I want to say this: In my view, this is an emergency. I want you to \ngo back home and explain to those who are busting their ass to fight \nthis war, who can't fly equipment because it is too dangerous, who are \nhaving to cannibalize planes to keep some planes in the air, who are \nstretched so thin that it is creating high risk.\n  Here is what the Chief of Staff of the Army said: ``I characterize us \nat this current state at high military risk.'' This is the Chief of \nStaff of the Army telling all of us that the Army is in a high state of \nrisk because of budget cuts.\n  This $18 billion will restore money that has been taken out. That \nwill have a beneficial effect now and is absolutely essential. It will \ngive us 15,000 more people in the Army. And if you are in the Army, you \nwould like to have some more colleagues because you have been going \nback and forth, back and forth. So we need more people in the Army, not \nless.\n  We need 3,000 more marines. If anybody has borne the burden of this \nwar, it is the U.S. Marine Corps. Here is what I say: Let's hire more \nmarines.\n  Let's start listening to what is going on in the military.\n  The whole theory of this amendment is that we have let this \ndeteriorate to the point that we have an emergency situation where we \nare putting our men and women's lives at risk because they don't have \nthe equipment they need and the training opportunities they deserve to \nfight the war that we can't afford to lose, and you are going to vote \nno because you are worried about budget caps.\n  Oh, we love the military. Everybody loves the military. Well, your \nlove doesn't help them. Your love doesn't buy a damn thing. If you love \nthese men and women, you will adequately fund their needs. If you care \nabout them and their families, you will adjust the budget so they can \nfight a war on our behalf.\n\n  We are up here arguing about everything. The state of politics in \nAmerica makes me sick. This looks like one thing we can agree on--\nLibertarians, vegetarians, Republicans, and Democrats--that those who \nare fighting this war deserve better than we are giving them.\n  So I want to tell you, when you come and vote against this amendment \nbecause you are worried about the budget caps, well, the Budget \nCommittee is not going to fight this war.\n  To my friends at Heritage Action, I agree with you a lot. You are \nsaying this is a bad vote. Nobody at Heritage Action is going to go \nover to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, or Libya to protect this country.\n  You talk about a head-in-the-sand Congress. You talk about people who \nare not listening, who are so worried about special interest groups and \nconcepts that have absolutely no basis in reality.\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\n  If you fully implement sequestration, all you will do is gut the \nmilitary and some nondefense programs that really matter to us. You \nwon't change the debt at all. So don't go around telling people you are \ngetting us to a balanced budget. You are not. The money is in \nentitlements, and we are not doing a damn thing about it.\n  Ryan-Murray added some money, and I want to thank him, but it wasn't \nenough. I want to thank the appropriators for adding $7 billion, but it \nis not nearly enough. The $18 billion that is in this amendment goes to \nbuy airplanes--14 F-18s, 5 F-35s, 2 F-35Bs. There is $200 million to \nhelp the Israelis with their missile defense program.\n  What this buys is more people, more equipment, more training \nopportunities at a time when we need all of the above. It breaks the \ncap because we are in an emergency situation. These caps are straining \nour ability to defend this Nation. I hate what we have done to the \nmilitary. This is a small step forward. This is not nearly what we \nneed, but this $18 billion will provide some needed relief to the \npeople who have been fighting this war for 15 years.\n  I hope and pray that you will start listening to those we put in \ncharge of our military and respond to their needs, and this is a small \nstep in the right direction.\n  If we say no to this amendment, God help us all. And you own it. You \nown the state of high risk. If you vote no, then as far as I am \nconcerned, you better never say ``I love the military'' anymore because \nif you really loved them, you would do something about it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also point out to my colleague that, as a sign of \npriorities around this place, yesterday we had a vote on medical \nresearch--nearly $1 billion that had nothing to do with the military \nbut was a place where the Willy Sutton syndrome took place, and it was \na 5-percent increase. The appropriators could increase by 5 percent \nmedical research which has nothing to do with the military, but they \nwon't add money that the military could use to defend this Nation. \nThere is no greater example of the priorities around this place.\n  I see my colleagues are waiting. I just want to point out what voting \nno means.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of another year where the pay for \nour troops doesn't keep pace with inflation or private sector \nadvocates. For the fourth year in a row, the military will receive less \nof a pay raise than the rate of inflation. If you vote no, that is what \nyou are doing.\n  If you vote no, it would be a vote in favor of cutting more soldiers \nand more U.S. marines at a time when the operational requirements for \nour Nation's land forces for the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Asia \nare growing. Every time you turn around, you will see that there are \nmore troops deployed in more places, whether it be Iraq, Syria, Libya, \nthe European Reassurance Initiative. Every time you turn around, there \nis more deployment--more deployments in the Far East and the Asian-\nPacific regions. Every time you turn around, there are more obligations \nthat we ask of the military, albeit incrementally. Yet we are going to \ncut the funding while we increase the commitments we have. So you would \nbe voting in favor of cutting more soldiers and marines at a time when \nthe operational requirements of our Nation's land forces are growing.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of continuing to shrink the number \nof aircraft that are available to the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps \nat a time when they are already too small to perform their current \nmissions and are being forced to cannibalize.\n  We have people who are having to go to the boneyard in Tucson, AZ, \nand take parts from planes that haven't been operational for years. \nThat is how bad the system has become thanks to sequestration. Our \nmaintainers--these incredible enlisted people--are working 16 to 18 \nhours a day trying to keep these planes in the air.\n  When an Air Force squadron came back, of their 20 airplanes, 6 were \nflyable.\n  There was a piece on FOX News the other day about how, down in \nBeaufort, SC, the F-18 squadron--they are having to have a plane in the \nhangar that they can take parts from so that they can keep other planes \nflying. They are exhausted. They are exhausted, these young marines. \nAnd by the way, don't think they are going to stay in when they are \nsubjected to this kind of work environment.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of shrinking the number of \naircraft. They are too small, and their current missions are being \nforced to cannibalize their own fleets.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of letting arbitrary budget caps \nset the timeline for our mission in Afghanistan instead of giving our \ntroops and our Afghan partners a fighting chance at victory.\n  Voting no is a vote in favor of continuing to ask our men and women \nin uniform to perform more and more tasks with inadequate readiness, \ninadequate equipment, inadequate numbers of people, and unacceptable \nlevels of risk in the missions themselves. It is unfair to them. It is \nwrong. It is wrong.\n  For the sake of the men and women in the military who put their lives \non the line as we seek to defend this Nation, I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will make the right choice. For 5 years we have \nlet politics, not strategy, determine what resources we give our \nmilitary servicemembers. Our military commanders have warned us that we \nrisk sending young Americans into a conflict for which they are not \nprepared.\n  I know that the vast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle recognize the mistakes of the past 5 years in creating this \ndanger. This is a reality. This is the reality our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines are facing. So I say it doesn't have to be this \nway. It doesn't have to be this way. And if you vote no, as my \ncolleague from South Carolina said, don't say you are in favor of the \nmilitary. Don't be that hypocritical. Just say that you are continuing \nto put the lives of these men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary, in the words of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, ``in \ngreater danger.'' That is your responsibility. But just don't say--\ndon't go home and say how much you appreciate the men and women in the \nmilitary, because when you vote no, you are depriving them of the \nability to defend this Nation and themselves.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by the senior Senator from Arizona. What it comes down to is \nthat Republicans and Democrats have fundamentally different approaches \nto providing for our troops, our national security agencies, and our \ngovernment.\n  Democrats are committed providing the funds necessary to protect our \nNation, grow our economy, invest in research, and shelter the most \nvulnerable. Republicans have a different approach. They accept massive \ncuts to almost every agency and only provide defense funding through an \naccounting trick which the Defense Department's own leadership has \nrejected as inadequate.\n  This is a debate about how best to protect our national security. And \nmy Republican colleagues are on the wrong side of it.\n  Senate Democrats are committed to defeating ISIS on the ground in \nIraq and Syria, dismantling its terror network, and protecting our \nhomeland. The only way we can do that is by supporting budget relief \nfor all of our national security agencies, including Homeland Security, \nthe FBI, and many others. Republicans haven't been willing to do that \nso we must figure out how to allocate funding with the existing budget \nagreement.\n  The amendment offered by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nis a return to gridlock. Last year's attempt to provide only the \nDefense Department with additional OCO funds resulted in a stalemate \nand a 3-month long continuing resolution. Do we have to repeat this \nfailed strategy again?\n  The answer is no. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and I \ntook a different approach in drafting the Defense appropriations bill: \nno poison pill riders, stick to the budget deal, eliminate wasteful \nspending proposals, and reinvest in our priorities.\n  If you compare the results in the Defense appropriations bill to the \namendment proposed by the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nhere is what you will find: His proposal violates last year's budget \ndeal with $18\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nbillion more in spending. Our bipartisan Defense appropriations bill \ninvests $15 billion in important programs while adhering to the deal.\n  The pending amendment relies on an OCO gimmick to authorize increases \nfor Israeli missile defense programs. However, every cent requested by \nthe Israeli Government, all $600.9 million, is funded in the Defense \nappropriations bill without using OCO funds.\n  This amendment authorizes OCO funding for a littoral combat ship and \na DDG-51 destroyer. This would be the first time that OCO funds would \nbe used to buy ships for the Navy.\n  The appropriations bill goes even further in supporting shipbuilding \nby providing $1 billion for a new icebreaker to support our Arctic \nstrategy, an item not included in the pending amendment.\n  The amendment also adds various aircraft--more F-18s, F-35s, C-130s, \nhelicopters, and so on--that are also funded in the Defense \nappropriations bill without running up the Nation's OCO charge card.\n  The bottom line is that, in the Defense appropriations bill, we were \nable to fund most of the items in Senator McCain's OCO gimmick \namendment, but we were able to it within the budget caps. It wasn't \neasy, but we made it work.\n  I would prefer that we find a way to increase both defense and \nnondefense funding so we can invest more in all of the agencies that \nwork together to keep America safe.\n  The Reed amendment does exactly that. It amends last year's budget \ndeal to include $18 billion more for defense and $18 billion more for \nimportant nondefense programs.\n  The Reed amendment includes $2 billion more to address cyber security \nvulnerabilities to stop the type of attacks that resulted in the theft \nof millions of personnel records from the Office of Personnel \nManagement. It includes $1.4 billion for more law enforcement efforts, \nincluding more security screeners at airports, more FBI agents and \npolice officers on the street, and more grants to State and local first \nresponders.\n  The Reed amendment addresses public health emergencies, including \n$1.9 billion for the response to Zika. It also provides $1.9 billion to \nfix our broken water infrastructure, which would help ensure we don't \nface another lead contaminated water crisis like what happened Flint, \nMI.\n  Finally, the Reed amendment includes $3.2 billion in funding to \naddress infrastructure problems at VA hospitals, fix our roads and \nbridges, and invest in our rail and transit systems.\n  Last year, Congress voted to provide fair and balanced relief to our \nDefense and our nondefense agencies. The Reed amendment is consistent \nwith that agreement, and it deserves our support.\n  In conclusion, we should be supporting all of our national security \nagencies as they work to protect this Nation, including cyber security, \nhomeland security, and local law enforcement, the FBI, and TSA.\n  We also should support critical issues like the opioid epidemic, \nwater infrastructure, the Zika outbreak, and research across the \nFederal Government among other items.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Ranking Member Reed's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Request--Presidential Nomination\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session and the Banking Committee be discharged \nfrom consideration of PN1053, the nomination of Mark McWatters for the \nBoard of Directors at the Export-Import Bank; that the Senate proceed \nto its consideration and vote without intervening action or debate; \nthat if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any statements related to \nthe nomination be printed in the Record; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, we would like to engage in a discussion \nof what this means to American workers, to American exports, and to \nAmerican manufacturing. I think we have worked very, very hard over the \nlast several months to try and move this nomination forward. We fought \nthis fight. Many appearing with me today fought this fight, whether it \nwas on TPA or whether it was just simply trying to get reauthorization \nof the Ex-Im Bank advanced and furthered.\n  We won this fight. Today we are losing the fight again by this \nrestriction, by this inability to move this nomination forward. So we \nwant to talk about this today. I am going to yield to several of my \ncolleagues here for their short comments. We will start with Senator \nSchumer who has a commitment with the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want to thank my dear friend, the \nSenator from North Dakota, for her leadership on this issue, as well as \nour two great Senators from the State of Washington, Maria Cantwell and \nPatty Murray.\n  I support my colleague from North Dakota and echo her comments. We \nshould have a full complement of Board members at the Ex-Im Bank and, \nat the very least, they must have enough to reach a quorum and continue \nto conduct its business. I also want to thank my three colleagues who \nare here for their tireless efforts to get the Ex-Im Bank reauthorized \nlast year. The legislation to reauthorize was carried by the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, as well as Senators Cantwell and Murray, after \nRepublican obstruction caused it to lapse for the first time in its 80-\nyear history.\n  What a shame it was that it lapsed. The Ex-Im Bank is one of the key \ntools in our toolbox for supporting and growing manufacturing jobs \nacross the country. We talk about increasing good-paying manufacturing \njobs. Both sides of the aisle do that regularly. Then, when it comes to \nsupporting the Ex-Im Bank, they obstruct one of the best tools we have. \nThey vote no. Now they have found a clever way to stop it from working, \nbecause it won't have a quorum.\n  The Ex-Im Bank provides necessary financing for domestic \nmanufacturers to compete with foreign companies that are heavily \nsubsidized or are owned entirely by their government and simply to have \naccess to their own domestic import bank. To purposefully prevent the \nEx-Im Bank from being able to properly function is like having America \nunilaterally disarm in the global competition for exports and good-\npaying manufacturing jobs here at home.\n  But there are a small band of folks--ideologues--so ideologically \nopposed to the Bank that they will do anything to see that it can come \nto a screeching halt. They will use every trick in the book to do it. \nThat is what they are doing now. Opponents of the Bank are hamstringing \nthe agency by denying it the staff it needs to operate.\n  We are losing $50 million a day in exports. Some of these come from \nmy home State of New York. We have not only GE, which makes turbines, a \nlarge percentage of which are exported. They are losing business to \nSiemens and other foreign companies.\n  We have lost some little companies that depend even more on the Ex-Im \nBank because it gives them the ability to find markets overseas. So I \ndon't want to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk \nabout how they care about jobs, how they care about building America \nand building our exports, as long as they continue to play this trick \nand hamstring the Ex-Im Bank from functioning. Mr. President, as I \nsaid, I rise today to support my friend and colleague the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and echo her comments: We should have a full complement of \nBoard members at the Ex-Im Bank, and at the very least they must have \nenough to reach a quorum and continue to conduct its business.\n\n  I also want to thank her for her tireless efforts to get the Export-\nImport Bank reauthorized last year. The legislation to reauthorize the \nbank was carried by the Senator from North Dakota and several other \ncolleagues of ours, like Senators Cantwell and Murray, after Republican \nobstruction caused it to lapse for the first time in its 80-year \nhistory.\n  And it was a shame that it ever lapsed.\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n  The Ex-Im Bank is one of the key tools in our toolbox for supporting \nand growing manufacturing jobs across the country. It provides the \nfinancing necessary for domestic manufacturers to compete with foreign \ncompanies that are heavily subsidized or owned entirely by their \ngovernments or simply have access to their own domestic Ex-Im Bank.\n  To purposefully prevent the Ex-Im Bank from being able to properly \nfunction is like having America unilaterally disarm in the global \ncompetition for exports.\n  But there is a small band of folks who are so ideologically opposed \nto the bank that they will do anything they can to see it come to a \nscreeching halt. And they will use every trick in the book to do it.\n  That is what we are seeing now.\n  Opponents of the bank are hamstringing the agency by denying it the \nstaff they need to operate.\n  Right now, the Export-Import Bank is unable to approve any of the \nfinancing deals over $10 million because the Bank only currently has \ntwo members serving on its five-member board.\n  This is a problem because the Board needs at least a quorum of three \nto approve financing for large deals.\n  But the Banking Committee has so far refused to even consider a third \nnomination to the Board of the Export-Import Bank and has given no \nindication that it even plans to hold a hearing on the nomination any \ntime soon.\n  It can't be because the chairman opposes the nominee's politics or \nviews--the nominee is a Republican, irony of ironies. The President has \nput forward Mark McWatters, a former staffer for Republican Hensarling, \nthe Republican Chairman of House Financial Services.\n  The delay on the nomination has nothing to do with the nominee or his \nqualifications and everything to do with keeping the Ex-Im Bank from \ndoing its job.\n  The delay, as Senator Heitkamp pointed out, has real consequences:\n  30 major projects in the pipeline valued at more than $10B are now \nmired in uncertainty.\n  The Peterson Institute estimated that each day the confirmation is \ndelayed, the US is losing $50 million in exports.\n  This impacts major companies in my home State of New York like GE, \nwhich makes turbines near Schenectady and employs over 7,000 folks in \nthe Albany area alone.\n  GE not only employs thousands of people in my state, it supports an \nentire supply chain in the capital region. So when a contract or sale \nabroad is not approved or bids are not even sought because of the \nuncertainty surrounding the Ex-Im Bank, there is a real cost to the \neconomy.\n  I understand there are those on the other side of the aisle, \nincluding the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, who \noppose the very existence of the Export-Import Bank.\n  But the fact of the matter is the Bank exists. The full Senate voted \nto reauthorize it. And it is our jobs as legislators to ensure that \ngovernment agencies have the staff they need to do the job we ask them \nto do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here today to support the strong \nstatement from the Senator from North Dakota and the strong support for \na fully functioning Export-Import Bank because it creates American jobs \nand helps our businesses, large and small, and, in fact, reduces our \nnational debt. But right now, political posturing has handicapped the \nEx-Im Bank, one of our countries most reliable tools to increase \nAmerica's economic competitiveness in our global economy.\n  In my home State of Washington, there are nearly 100 businesses, the \nmajority of them small or medium-sized, that used the Bank's services \nlast year to help sell their products overseas. We are talking about \neverything from apples to airplane parts, beer, wine, software, medical \ntraining supplies, and beyond.\n  The reality is that people in other countries want American-made \nproducts. That is a great thing because these businesses support tens \nof thousands of jobs in our country and keep our economy moving.\n  The Export-Import Bank is the right kind of investment because it \nexpands the access of American businesses to emerging foreign markets \nthat create jobs right here at home.\n  Do you know what it costs taxpayers? Not a single penny. In fact, the \nEx-Im Bank reduces our national debt.\n  So here is the bottom line. The Bank creates jobs. It strengthens our \nbusinesses. It helps our economy grow from the middle out, not just the \ntop down.\n  So it is time for my colleagues to put ideology aside, to allow this \nproven program to operate at its full capacity, and to allow a vote \nthat we were denied today to get the Ex-Im Board operating again \nbecause it is critical that the Bank continue to receive the strong \nbipartisan support we have seen in the past as we work to build on its \nsuccess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues this morning on the \nSenate floor in an effort to wake up the Senate to the fact that, \nwithout action by this body and specifically the Senate Banking \nCommittee, Members are literally supporting shipping jobs overseas. I \nbelieve in a manufacturing economy. I believe in a manufacturing \neconomy because so many people in the State of Washington work in \nmanufacturing and because aerospace is an industry in which the United \nStates is still a world leader.\n  Yet, by not filling the board of the Export-Import Bank we are \nputting the Bank out of business when we should be making sure that it \ncan issue credit for manufactured U.S. products to be sold in overseas \nmarkets.\n  Why is manufacturing so important? Manufacturing is important because \nit pays a decent wage. It allows American workers to go from working \nclass to middle class. It helps secure jobs in our economy that are \nstable for families who are sending their kids to school, and because \nit helps people move up to a better quality of life.\n  I am competitive in general. I don't want to lose a manufacturing \nbase. But I also don't want to lose a middle class. What has happened \nis that the conservative views of the Heritage Foundation have thwarted \nthe Export-Import Bank, and U.S. manufacturers have decided to put \ntheir manufacturing overseas. Think about it. How long is a company or \na business going to put up with the fact that they don't have an export \ncredit agency here in the United States?\n  Now, can a big manufacturer get its own credit? Sure it can. Sure, it \ncan go and get credit. But can you ask it to sell in a global market? I \nwill give you an example of a manufacturer in our State, SCAFCO, which \nsells manufactured grain silos to many countries in South America, in \nAfrica, in Asia, and all across the world. Do you think they are going \nto finance every single deal they do? No, because they have to put \nmoney into their manufacturing facilities so they can stay competitive, \nand so they can have the best silos being produced.\n  So if they limited their business to only deals they could finance, \nthey would have very limited business. Think about it. Whom do we make \nthat requirement of? It is the customer who is buying the exported \nproduct who needs the business to get credit. It is the customer who is \nout there that wants to purchase what are great U.S. products who is \nhaving trouble. Think about it. You could be a small African nation \ntrying to change your economy toward agriculture or you could be a \nsmall Asian country that is trying to upgrade the quality of life.\n  It could be, just as Prime Minister Modi said yesterday, that they \nwant to diversify their energy portfolio. Well, guess what? We are \nholding that up and not allowing all of those countries to buy U.S. \nenergy products simply because we refuse to have a working board at the \nexport credit agency. How ludicrous is that? It is so ludicrous, \nbecause what happens if a U.S. manufacturer--an aerospace manufacturer \nlike Boeing for example--wants consumers to buy GE engines and make \nsure that a South American company purchases U.S. manufactured Boeing \nand GE engines?\n  Well, they can go and purchase Rolls-Royce engines instead, and the \nEuropean credit agency can fund the deal. Now, what has happened? GE \nhas lost out on deals. Do you think all of those U.S. manufacturers are \ngoing to stay in the United States if there is no way to have credit \nfinancing? No--they are\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\ngoing to go where credit financing exists. So, by not moving forward on \na fully functioning export credit agency in the United States, all you \nare doing is helping to ship jobs overseas. It has to stop.\n  We make great products in the United States. We are competitive. Our \nworkforce is skilled. I will be the first to say that we need a more \nskilled workforce. I am all for providing our workforce with education \nand skills and every resource our country has because innovation is our \ncompetitive advantage.\n  But if we make great products and then we hamstring the financing of \nthose great products--developing countries don't have the same banking \nand financial tools and edge that we have in the United States--you are \nbasically saying: We are not going to sell our products.\n  I am a big proponent of winning in the international marketplace. I \nam a big proponent of saying that the middle class is growing around \nthe globe, and one of the United States' biggest economic opportunities \nis to sell products to that middle class outside of the United States. \nThat rising middle class means they can purchase more U.S. products. \nWell, they can't if we don't have a credit agency that finances \nexports. So why are we down here this morning as it relates to the \nDefense bill that is now being discussed?\n  Well, we are here because there are more than $10 billion of deals \nand transactions that are in the Export-Import Bank pipeline. \nYesterday, Prime Minister Modi was here. The Indian Government has \nannounced that Westinghouse would finalize contracts with the Nuclear \nPower Corporation of India to build six nuclear reactors by 2030. Well, \nthose deals won't get done if you don't have an export credit agency to \nfinance those deals.\n  The United States Senate is currently considering the National \nDefense Authorization Act. Last month, the Aerospace Industries \nAssociation and the National Defense Industrial Association wrote \nletters to Senate leadership urging them to make sure that we had a \nfunctioning bank. They pointed out that without a quorum, multimillion-\ndollar exports of aircraft, satellite, and other things won't get done.\n  So we just had this little argument on the Senate floor about how we \nare going to pay for things in the Defense bill and whether we are \ngoing to have balance with our other domestic spending. By not \nsupporting and moving forward on the export credit agency, you are also \nmaking defense in the United States more expensive. You are making our \nsecurity more expensive because you are not allowing that same \ntechnology--that we have decided meets our export controls, but we are \nwilling because these are partners of ours--to sell that defense. You \nare making that difficult.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis letter from the Aerospace Industries Association and the National \nDefense Industrial Association, basically saying you are making it more \nexpensive for us to do business as a country in defense because you \nalso will not allow the export of this product.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Aerospace Industries Association, National Defense \n           Industrial Association,\n                                                     May 17, 2016.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senate Majority Leader McConnell, and Senate Minority \n     Leader Reid: On behalf of the American aerospace and defense \n     industry and our dedicated workforce, we are writing to urge \n     Senate hearings and confirmation on the nomination of J. Mark \n     McWatters to the Board of Directors for the U.S. Export-\n     Import (Ex-Im) Bank. If his nomination is successfully \n     approved, a fully functioning bank will play an important \n     role in leveling the playing field for U.S. exports, creating \n     new opportunities for U.S. companies, and strengthening our \n     strategic alliances throughout the world.\n       Last year, we were heartened to see a bipartisan, bicameral \n     supermajority vote overwhelmingly in favor of long-term \n     reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank. However, the Bank remains \n     effectively inoperable for large-scale export activities. \n     While the Bank is accepting new applications, the Bank's \n     Board of Directors must have a quorum to act on transactions \n     valued at $10 million or more. In the absence of a quorum, \n     potential multi-million dollar export sales of aircraft and \n     satellites are at risk, hurting not only major manufacturers, \n     but the small and medium-sized companies that support them.\n       The global market is fiercely competitive. U.S. \n     manufacturers need fair trade policy measures to level the \n     playing field. Other countries are aggressively utilizing \n     their Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) as a tool to advance \n     their national trade interests, and availability of financing \n     (instead of the quality of products) is a key discriminator \n     if we do not have our own ECA. Our competitors also enjoy a \n     greater range of support from their ECAs, including--but not \n     limited to--a broader scope of programs.\n       Without the Bank supporting some of these investment-heavy \n     exports, U.S. industrial production will decline, reducing \n     revenue, innovation, and high-skilled, high-wage jobs \n     throughout the aerospace and defense supply chain. The fact \n     that this will lead to higher unit costs for the military \n     systems our armed forces buy seems to be dismissed or \n     ignored. Also, we are only now recovering lost capacity and \n     market share in the commercial satellite market caused by \n     over-restrictive export controls, which had a similar \n     detrimental impact on our national security space industrial \n     base.\n       In addition to supporting U.S. export sales, the Bank is an \n     important foreign policy tool for the U.S. government as it \n     bolsters American presence and influence abroad. By \n     developing closer economic ties to other countries, we \n     enhance not only our economic power, but also our national \n     security. Countries which engage in close trading and \n     commerce with each other increasingly align around common \n     interests in global stability and security.\n       The Board is instrumental to the agency's day-to-day \n     operations, since it manages the Bank's reforms and approves \n     its transactions. The long-term reauthorization approved by \n     Congress in 2015 contained risk-management provisions that \n     require action or approval from Ex-Im Bank's Board of \n     Directors in order to be implemented, including the \n     appointment of a Chief Ethics Officer and the establishment \n     of a Risk Management Committee. The agency cannot implement \n     those provisions--or consider any other reforms--without a \n     quorum. We urge the Senate to move swiftly on the pending \n     nomination for the Ex-Im Bank's Board of Directors.\n           Sincerely,\n     David F. Melcher,\n       Lieutenant General, USA (Ret.), President & CEO, Aerospace \n     Industries Association.\n     Craig R. McKinley,\n       General, USAF (ret), President & CEO, NDIA.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am on the floor with my colleague from \nNorth Dakota because we feel passionately about this issue. We are \nfrustrated with the shenanigans that have gone on with the export \ncredit agency. I say ``shenanigans'' because for a long time people \nsaid: Oh, well, there aren't the votes. We can't get this done. We \ndon't have the votes.\n  Well, when you lift the veil behind some very conservative, \nthreatening tactics, there is majority support, in both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives, for this export credit agency.\n  Now, one committee is trying to bottle up a nominee--if he doesn't \nlike the nominee, come up with a different name. Come up with two \nnames. Who cares? But what really is happening is that those on the \nother side of the aisle are enabling one individual to thwart the \nbiggest manufacturing economic opportunity our country has to secure \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States of America. Let's build great \nproducts. Let's have a credit agency that can finance deals to \ndeveloping nations, and let's get those countries buying U.S. products. \nWhy on Earth are we continuing these shenanigans so somebody can say to \nthe Heritage Foundation: I got you one more trophy for your shelf.\n  That is not what America is about. America is about competing, \nsucceeding, and growing economic opportunity.\n  I thank my colleague from North Dakota for her leadership on the \nBanking Committee in trying to move this effort forward and all of my \ncolleagues who care about manufacturing who are willing to come to the \nfloor and make this point.\n  Time is running out this session, before the summer recess, for us to \nget this done. It is time to get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I say thank you to my colleague from Washington.\n  Mr. President, the level of frustration we have over this issue is \nunparalleled. We hear platitudes in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\nThey usually start with: We believe in the will of the people. Let's do \nthe will of the people.\n  Guess what. We had this debate. We had the debate about whether we \nshould have an entity called the Export-Import Bank. We had that \ndebate. It was long fought. We shut down the bank for the first time in \n60 years. We shut down the bank, stopping exports for the United States \nof America, costing jobs in the United States of America.\n  We won that fight, and we didn't win it by a little. We didn't win it \nby just a margin. We won supermajorities--supermajorities--in the \nSenate and supermajorities in the House. When we were told the House \nwould never pass a stand-alone bill, they passed a stand-alone bill by \n70 percent--70 percent--of the vote.\n  Doesn't that tell you the people of this country should have a vote \nthrough their elected representatives? Today do you know what is \nstopping that vote, the will of the people to have this entity, beyond \nall of the arguments for why this entity is critically important? One \nperson--one person, for whatever reason.\n  This is why people have lost faith with their government. This is why \npeople don't believe we can get anything done here anymore--because \neven though we fight the fight, even though we win the fight, we don't \nwin the fight because we need a quorum at the Bank to do any deal over \n$10 million.\n  We have a nominee. You must say: Well, it must be a raving liberal, \nright? This nominee? No, it is the Republican nominee who represented \nand worked for one of the most conservative Members--in fact, an anti-\nExport-Import Member of the House of Representatives. That is our \nnominee. There is nothing wrong with this nominee. It is not our side \nwho is debating the legitimacy of a Republican nominee. It is not our \nside.\n  How do we believe in manufacturing, believe in the American dream, \nand believe we can be part of a global economy, when 95 percent of all \npotential consumers in the world--guess what. They don't live here.\n  If we are going to be competitive, if we are going to be \nparticipating in that global economy--which we must--then we must be \ncompetitive. We cannot be competitive without an export credit agency. \nIt is just that simple, and we are not going to be competitive. So \ndon't say you are for trade or manufacturing, when you are not willing \nto take a risk because some ideologue on the other side has decided \nthat is a black mark.\n  Earlier, Senator McCain made a passionate plea and Senator Lindsey \nGraham talked about Heritage. Who is running this place? When the \nHeritage Society can stop a deliberation by simply putting a checkmark \nnext to a piece of legislation and when once again we have this being \nheld up in the backrooms of the Senate--not openly, but in the back \nrooms--who is running the place and who really believes in trade? Who \nreally believes in manufacturing? Who really believes in the middle \nclass?\n  I will tell you, my passion on this doesn't just come because I think \nit is a horrible trajectory for the future, for the future of our \nAmerican economy, my passion on this comes when I hear stories. These \nare real. They are not pretend stories. When I hear stories that ``We \nare going to take our manufacturing out of this country.'' We are going \nto lose jobs, and we are going to lose those jobs very quickly. In \nfact, when we shut down the Bank, we already lost jobs--but we are \ngoing to lose jobs.\n  Do you know what I think about? Because this is where I live. This is \nwhere I am from. I think about that factory worker on the floor of that \nmanufacturing facility being given a pink slip and being told his job \nis going overseas, her job is going overseas because they have a better \nbusiness climate.\n  Think about that. You have a good job, providing for your family, \nbelieving you are doing everything right, and because of a simple \nglitch here, because of, really, one person, that person is getting \nhanded a pink slip. Where is the accountability for that? Where is the \naccountability to that family? When are we going to learn that it is \nthis disruption in American lives that has cost this body and this \nCongress its reputation for no good reason?\n  I wish to close before I turn it over to my colleagues with just a \ncouple of statistics because, quite honestly, I get sick and tired of \nthe characterization that this only applies to large facilities like \nBoeing, GE, and Caterpillar. I am tired of that. Let me tell you. In \nNorth Dakota, we have 16 suppliers. These are small businesses. These \nare people who have done creative things in an environment that you \nwouldn't think would be successful. They are suppliers to Boeing. What \nhappens when Boeing cannot do a deal? What happens when Boeing moves \ntheir operation someplace else and the requirement is that those parts \nbe manufactured in that country? What happens? Guess what. Those 16 \nmanufacturers are injured. Those 16 manufacturers have their lives \ndisrupted, through no fault of their own, not because they didn't \nproduce a quality product, not because they didn't do everything they \nneeded to do to be successful.\n  Just last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that 350 high-paying \nAmerican manufacturing jobs are headed to Canada. That is a direct \nresult of the last reauthorization back in 2015. I think we can clearly \nexpect many more of these stories. I would ask my colleagues: Who is \ngoing to go to that manufacturer or worker? Who is going to talk to the \nchildren who now have a father who no longer has a job or a mother who \nno longer has a job and say: Because someone told me, I am not going to \ndo it. I am not going to support you. I don't represent you. I \nrepresent an ideology here.\n  This is a tragedy at so many levels. I guess I naively thought, when \nyou win, you win, and when you win by big majorities, you ought to win \nfor at least more than a day.\n  I stand ready to fight this fight. I stand ready to attach and do \neverything I can to either get this nomination or to get a patch or \nlegislation that will, in fact, provide opportunities for the Bank to \nfunction. I will do everything I can because when I go to bed at night, \nI don't think about the Boeing and the GE executives. That is not whom \nI think about. I think about that person on the factory line who is \nworking every day putting food on the table for their children and how \nthis dysfunction here is costing them their livelihood and their \nsecurity. That is a tragedy we can't ignore.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, I echo the words of my colleague from \nNorth Dakota.\n  I have 6.5 million bosses in Indiana. These think tanks out here, \nthese other organizations, they are not my boss. That family who wants \nto make sure there is a paycheck coming into the house, and all mom and \ndad wants is a chance to go to work, they are whom we should be working \nfor--for the same people my colleague from North Dakota works for in \nBismarck, in Fargo, in Muncie, in Richmond, in Maryville, in Lafayette, \nand all of these suppliers around my State whose jobs are dependent on \nthese export opportunities that we are walking away from by standing \nagainst the Export-Import Bank.\n  Here we are again, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, talking about our \nresponsibility to do our job and to consider the President's nominees \nto important Federal offices. The nominee we are talking about, Mark \nMcWatters, is a Republican nominee for the Board of Directors for the \nExport-Import Bank, and we are all lined up on this side to support \nhim. It is the official export credit agency of the United States. It \nhelps American companies--so many in my State of Indiana--create jobs, \nan opportunity, and a chance for people to go to work, put a roof over \ntheir kids' heads, to be able to retire with dignity, and to be able to \ncompete in a global economy.\n  That is what this is about. Every other country you look at has one \nof these export-import banks. It is helping their organizations, their \nbusinesses, and their countries compete.\n  Each of us speaking today worked closely with Senator Heitkamp last \nyear to reauthorize the Bank. It was a strong, overwhelming bipartisan \nvote in support of reauthorization. It demonstrated the need for this \nentity that helps create American jobs at no cost to taxpayers and, in \nfact, sends money back to the Treasury.\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n  In 2014, the Ex-Im Bank supported 164,000 American jobs. That is \n164,000 moms and dads who are able to have dignity, a job, take care of \ntheir children, and be a tremendous credit to their community. That is \nwhat this is about; $27.5 billion in exports and it returned $675 \nmillion to the U.S. Treasury. It creates jobs, reduces the deficit, and \nspurs economic growth. Despite widespread support, our inaction here \nkeeps the Bank from being in operation. In order to approve certain \nfinancing, the Bank needs a minimum of three Senate-approved Board \nmembers. We have two.\n  McWatters' nomination has been pending in the Senate Banking \nCommittee for 5 months. All it takes is a vote. Requests to confirm the \nnominee by unanimous consent have been rejected.\n  American companies are struggling to compete against foreign \ncompetitors that benefit from currency manipulation, illegal trade, \nintellectual property theft, and other foreign barriers. Yet a handful \nof Senators are making life more difficult by not considering this \nnomination. If we are not willing to stand up for our own companies, \nfor our own workers, then what are we doing?\n  It is disappointing that an important tool for economic growth isn't \nbeing utilized simply because some in the Senate refuse to do our job. \nThe American people expect better, the American people deserve better, \nand the workers of this country deserve better.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, what my distinguished colleagues from North \nDakota and Indiana are proposing is to unleash the Export-Import Bank \nfrom the constraints under which it currently must operate and to begin \nauthorizing transactions above $10 million. Between 2007 and 2014, 84 \npercent of the Bank's subsidy and loan guarantee deals exceeded $10 \nmillion--84 percent--and the vast majority of those were given to the \nwealthiest, most well-connected businesses in America that should have \nno problem at all obtaining financing in the open market.\n  The Export-Import Bank represents so much of what the American people \nresent and despise about Washington, DC. This is a Great Depression era \nrelic, one that lives on today and has grown into one of the most \ntreasured relics for favoring banks. It is a favored relic for well-\nheeled lobbyists, big government, and politically favored businesses. \nIt is an 82-year-old case study in American corporate welfare, and for \nsome reason this Senate continues to support it.\n  Ex-Im has managed to live through more than 30 corruption and fraud \ninvestigations into its system of doling out taxpayer-backed subsidies \nand loan guarantees to foreign buyers of U.S. exports. In 2013, for \nhalf of the financing deals within the Export-Import Bank's portfolio, \nEx-Im was either unable or unwilling to provide any justification \nwhatsoever connected to its mission. That is $18.8 billion in estimated \nexport value that apparently had no connection to Ex-Im's mission or, \nif it did, Ex-Im didn't bother to offer that up.\n  Many of Ex-Im's supporters claim the Bank's main function is to \nsupport small business. That sounds nice, but the problem with it is \nthat this claim doesn't stand up to even a modest amount of scrutiny. \nLook at the institution's track record. Only one-half of 1 percent of \nall small businesses in America benefit from Ex-Im financing--one-half \nof 1 percent. And even that tiny figure may well be an overestimation, \nmay well overstate the case, because Ex-Im uses such a broad definition \nof the term small business.\n  Confirming this nominee would allow Ex-Im to return to its old ways \nof approving massive financing deals for the largest corporations, in \ncoordination with the largest banks, all with the backing of American \ntaxpayers.\n  Permanently ending the Export-Import Bank would be a small but \nimportant and symbolic step toward restoring fairness to our economy \nand fairness to our government. It would prove to the American people \nthat their elected representatives in Congress have the courage to \neliminate one of the many Federal programs that foster cozy \nrelationships between political and economic insiders, providing a \nbreeding ground for cronyism and for corruption. So long as this Senate \nremains unwilling to close Ex-Im, we should, at the very least, make \nsure it does not have the ability to further advance its cronyist \nagenda.\n  If you want to talk about harming competitiveness, let's talk about \nthat. If we want to have that discussion, let's have that discussion \nnow. If you want to know what harms competitiveness in America, \nincluding and especially the kind of competitiveness that has tended to \nfoster the development of the greatest economy the world has ever \nknown--the kind of competitiveness that makes it possible, where it \nexists, for small businesses to make it onto the big stage--let's look \nat Federal regulations.\n  Federal regulations are a big deal in this country. I remember being \nappalled 20 years ago to learn the Federal regulatory system was \nimposing some $300 billion a year in corporate compliance costs--\nregulatory compliance costs. Those regulatory compliance costs might be \nborne immediately and initially by big corporations, by small \ncorporations, mostly by businesses, but you know who pays for it? Hard-\nworking Americans. In fact, some have described this effect as sort of \na backdoor, invisible, and very regressive tax on the American people.\n  So when I first learned of this problem, I started thinking of it \nthis way. This is an additional $300 billion a year the American people \nare essentially paying into the Federal Government because everything \nthey buy--goods and services--becomes more expensive. They also pay for \nit in terms of diminished wages, unemployment, and underemployment, but \nthey do pay for it. And they pay for it disproportionately at the \nmiddle and at the low end of the economic spectrum in America.\n  Unlike our actual tax system--our visible tax system--which is highly \nprogressive, our backdoor invisible tax system--our regulatory system--\nis highly regressive. Some have estimated this regulatory compliance \ncost--just complying with Federal regulations--today costs the economy \nsome $2 trillion a year, meaning this has multiplied roughly sevenfold \njust in the last 20 years.\n  If you don't think that is a significant impediment to \ncompetitiveness in America, I don't know what is. This is a problem. \nAnd some have estimated that each and every American household pays \nsome $15,000 more each year for goods purchased simply because of \nFederal regulations. This hurts competitiveness. So do our high tax \nrates; these harm competitiveness.\n  So I stand with the senior Senator from Alabama and I support him in \nhis objection.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I share my colleague's concerns about \noverregulation and the burden of regulation. I have been fighting \nregulation that makes no sense here in Congress, and so I agree with \nhim. But that is not what we are talking about today. We are talking \nabout the Export-Import Bank.\n  I would ask my colleague: What percentage of all transactions at the \nExport-Import Bank goes to small business, as defined by the Bank?\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as my colleague is asking the question, I \nassume she has the answer.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. I do.\n  Mr. LEE. And I am sure she is prepared to tell us that.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Well, obviously, I do want to maybe make some points \nthat are contrary to some of the discussion that my colleague just had.\n  Ninety percent of all Ex-Im transactions are with small businesses \nthat are under $10 million. The amount of transactions over $10 million \nis huge, I will give you that. But, again, we talk about the supply \nchain that goes into those transactions over $10 million.\n  The Peterson Institute recently estimated the United States is losing \n$50 million in exports each day this nomination is not confirmed.\n  We have had disagreements with the Senator from Utah over the Ex-Im \nBank--disagreements we debated when\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nwe reauthorized the Bank. So I would ask the Senator from Utah: Why not \nmove the confirmation of McWatters to the floor so my colleague can \nhave a full-throated debate about the Bank? Why not have a full-\nthroated debate instead of hiding that nomination in the Banking \nCommittee and using that structure to thwart what in fact a majority of \nboth bodies of the Congress and the President have done when they \nreauthorized the Bank?\n  Mr. LEE. I am grateful to respond to both points made by my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from North Dakota.\n  In the first place, as to the need to have a full-throated debate, I \nwelcome that. That is exactly what we need. It is what I have been \nwanting to have for a long time. But last year, instead of having a \nfull-throated debate specifically about Ex-Im, we saw Ex-Im attached to \na much larger package--a much larger package that a lot of people were \ndetermined to support, regardless of what else was in there. So a lot \nof people voted for that package, regardless of how they might feel \nabout the Export-Import Bank. But as for a full-throated debate, yes, \nthat is exactly what we need. We would get that if we could actually \ndebate the reauthorization of Export-Import on its own merits, as we \nshould have done last year. We were deprived of that opportunity, so \nnow we are using every opportunity we can to have a real full-throated \ndebate. That is why we are doing this. That is exactly the reason we \nneed to do that.\n  As to the figure the Senator cited with respect to the percentage of \nloans going to small business, sure, if one wants to talk about the \nnumber of actual loans made, one can make that number look pretty good. \nBut look at the number that I think is more significant: Only one-half \nof 1 percent of all small businesses in America actually benefit from \nEx-Im financing. That is a pretty significant deal when one looks at \nhow much of the lending authority in the total dollar amount the \nExport-Import Bank supplies to larger businesses and to businesses, \nregardless of their size, that could in fact obtain financing in the \nopen market.\n  Again, we are not back in the Great Depression anymore. This is a \nGreat Depression era relic. So regardless of what my colleague may \nthink about the Great Depression era dynamics at play that caused those \nserving in this body and the House of Representatives in the 1930s to \nput this program in place, we have other challenges today. And many of \nthose challenges are created by the government itself--by the \ngovernment being too big a presence within our marketplace, inuring \nultimately to the benefit of big business and harming everyone else.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I see other colleagues here ready to \nmake presentations, but I just want to make two final points.\n  If my colleagues want a full-throated debate, then move the \nnomination onto the floor and out of the committee. Let's have the \ndebate. My colleagues are using the nomination to reemphasize and \nrelitigate the Ex-Im Bank. Let's do it.\n  In the meantime, let's appreciate that, in spite of everything that \nis being said here, we need the Bank to be competitive. We need the \nBank to make sure that we can, in fact, manufacture in this country. \nAnd that is something that gets lost in all the rhetoric.\n  I think one of the things we have an obligation to think about is all \nthose jobs that are going to go someplace else and all those Americans \nwho are going to stand in the line for unemployment benefits and who \nare going to get their pink slips. And who in the U.S. Senate wants to \nline up at the factory door as they are walking through the last time \nand shake their hand and say: You know, too bad you lost your job.\n  So I yield the floor, and I intend to have further debate about the \nExport-Import Bank.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would note that Senator Klobuchar is here \nand she, I believe, wanted to participate in the discussion about the \nIMF, but we shortly have a vote, and we would very much like to \nproceed. The majority leader is here also.\n  I am prepared to speak now on the pending Reed amendment that we are \ngoing to go to a vote on at 11:15.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We need to talk on the bill.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has the floor.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4549\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to make some brief remarks with \nrespect to the Reed amendment that is pending, before our vote. Senator \nMikulski would like to also, and I note the chairman is here. But I ask \nunanimous consent that when I finish my brief remarks, Senator Mikulski \nbe recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have had a very extensive and very thoughtful \ndebate about the underlying amendment by Senator McCain to increase OCO \nspending by $18 billion strictly for Department of Defense operations \nand functions, and those are very critical and very important.\n  There have been two principles we have followed over the last several \nyears when it comes to trying to push back the effects of \nsequestration. Those principles have been that the security of the \nUnited States is significantly affected by the Department of Defense's \noperations, but not exclusively. Indeed, there are many functions \noutside the parameters of the Department of Defense that are absolutely \ncritical and essential to the protection of the American people at home \nand abroad: the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the CDC. So \nthat has been one of the principles. The other principle we recognize \nis that that in lifting these temporary limits, we have to do it on an \nequal basis.\n  What the amendment Senator Mikulski and I have offered does is \nembrace\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nthese two principles. We would add an additional $18 billion to the \nchairman's $18 billion. That would encompass the broader view of \nnational security, and do so in a way that I think is very sensible, \nand allow us to go forward as we have in the past.\n  All of us recognize the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces and the fact that they continue to serve as \nthe frontline of the defense in so many different aspects. But we also \nrecognize that defending our interests means agencies outside the \nDepartment of Defense--the State Department, Homeland Security--that \nhave absolutely critical and indispensable roles in our national \nsecurity.\n  Reflecting on the comments before about the potential for incidents \nboth here and abroad, if we go back to 9/11, that was not a result of a \nfailure to have trained Army brigades or marine regiments or aircraft \ncarriers at sea; that was a deficiency in the screening of passengers \ngetting on airplanes; that was a failure to connect intelligence that \none FBI office had that was not shared effectively. Those threats to \nthe United States will not be directly remedied even as we increase \nresources to the Department of Defense. Resources have to go to these \nother agencies as well. I think that is something we all recognize, and \nthat is what is at the heart of what we are doing.\n  In addition, over the last decade we have seen a host of other \nthreats, particularly cyber threats, which were rudimentary back in \n2001, 2002, and 2003. Now we see them as ubiquitous--not rudimentary--\nand threatening and with an increasing sort of sophistication.\n  I recall that in a hearing Senator Collins and I had with the \nDepartment of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, we asked the IG: What is the biggest issue that you think \nis facing your Departments right now? Both said it is the issue of \ncyber security--protecting the data we have, protecting the records we \nhave, protecting ourselves from being an unwitting conduit into even \nmore sensitive government systems.\n  So within our amendment, we propose significant resources for cyber \nprotections throughout the Federal Government--Homeland Security, \nHealth and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, et cetera. \nThese are essential, and I think the American people understand that.\n  We also understand that our infrastructure is critical to our \neconomic well-being and our economic growth. Part of our dilemma going \nforward and one of the reasons we are locked in this sequestration \nbattle is that unless we are growing our economy, we will be \ncontinually faced with difficult challenges about what we fund, how we \nfund it, how we provide the revenue to meet these obligations. One of \nthe surest ways to increase our growth is to invest in our \ninfrastructure.\n  I think what we are proposing makes sense in two fundamental ways. It \nrecognizes--as I think everyone does--that our national security is not \nexclusively related to the programs and functions of the Department of \nDefense and that our national security is a function not just of our \nmilitary, intelligence, and other related agencies, but the vitality \nand strength of the country, the ability to grow and to afford these \ninvestments in defense, in homeland security, and others. We make it \nclear. We make it clear in this legislation that that is our proposal. \nAnd the stakes are clear: We want to go ahead and support a broad-\nranged increase in resources.\n  The final point I will make is that this is all in the shadow of the \nultimate issue, which is getting rid of sequestration--not just for one \npart of the government but for the entire government. If we don't \naddress that next year, we are going to be in an extraordinarily dire \nsituation.\n  With that, I ask my colleagues sincerely and very fervently to \nsupport the Reed-Mikulski amendment. I think that would put us on the \ntrack to true national security.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no divided time. We have a vote \nscheduled at 11:15 a.m. but no divided time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Well, I will be quick in my remarks.\n  First, I just want to comment about real leadership and how blessed \nwe are to have what we have. I compliment both the chairman and the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee. The chairman, Senator \nMcCain, is a graduate of the Naval Academy and is a well-known and \nwell-respected war hero who for his entire life has stood for defending \nAmerica. Our ranking member, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, is a \nWest Point graduate and a paratrooper, so he knows what it is like to \nmake big leaps for the defense of the country. They have done their \nbest to do a bill. They find that their budget allocation is very \ntight, and we understand that.\n  What we seek here is parity in what the gentleman from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, is offering as his amendment, and he has spoken \nthoroughly and eloquently about it. Senator Reed has spoken eloquently \nabout how not all national security is in the Department of Defense, \nand we need more money for the State Department, Homeland Security. \nThere are others in our part of the bill, the nondefense discretionary \npart, related to research and development and also investments in \nhealth and education.\n  There are those who would say: Well, Senator Mikulski, you know what \nSenator McCain wants to do.\n  Yes.\n  You know what Senator Reed wants to do. Not all defense is in DOD.\n  Yes.\n  But aren't you being squishy?\n  No, I am not being squishy at all when we talk about the needed \nnondefense discretionary for research and others.\n  Very quickly, when we won World War II, Roosevelt made it clear that \nit was our arsenal of democracy that enabled one of the greatest \nfighting machines ever assembled to be successful. We need to continue \nto have an arsenal of democracy. That arsenal of democracy will always \nbe cutting edge and maintain its qualitative edge because of what we \nwill do with research and development, often in civilian agencies, \nwhether it is the Department of Energy that will produce more trucks, \nwhether it is the National Science Foundation working with others to \nmake us even more advanced in computational capacity so that we have \nthe best computers to defend us, not only in cyber security but in \nothers. There is a new kind of arsenal of democracy, and we need to \nhave a strong economy and we need to have continued research and \ndevelopment to maintain our qualitative edge.\n  Let's go to the wonderful men and women who serve our military. Only \n2 percent of the population signs up, but when they sign up, boy, are \nwe proud of them. We share that on both sides of the aisle. But what \nGEN Martin Dempsey, the former head of the Joint Chiefs--himself a \ndecorated hero--said to me was this: Senator Mikulski, out of every \nfour people who want to enlist in our military, only one is taken \nbecause only one will be fit for duty. One category can't pass because \nthey can't pass the physical fitness. They have too many physical \nproblems.\n  Well, why is that?\n  Then the other won't be taken by the military because they fail the \nliteracy and the math--a failure of education. Third, there is another \ncategory because of issues with either addiction or emotional problems.\n  So we need to look at our total population. We need a totally strong \nAmerica to have a strong defense.\n  I know some people say what I want to do and some of my colleagues \nwant to do--we not only want to maintain parity in the Budget Act \nconsistent with our votes and our principles, but look at that. Also, \nwhen we vote, know why we are doing this. We want to maintain our \narsenal of democracy. We want to maintain our cutting edge and our \nqualitative edge. We also want our young men and women to be fit for \nduty, whether it is for military service or other service to the \nNation.\n  I know the gentleman from Arizona is waiting. I have now completed my \nremarks, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland. She is \ntough and principled, a great representative of her State, and she has \nbeen a friend for many years. I thank\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nher for her words. I also respectfully, obviously, disagree.\n  This vote is obviously one that places domestic considerations on the \nsame plane as national security. As we look around the world, I think \nit is pretty obvious that since 2011--the world was a very different \nplace when sequestration was enacted. We need to have a military that \nis prepared to fight and is not unready, planes that can fly, ships \nthat can sail, and men and women who are trained to fight. All of those \nhave been impacted by sequestration.\n  With the Director of National Intelligence telling the Armed Services \nCommittee and the world that there will be attacks in Europe and the \nUnited States of America, we cannot afford an $18 billion cut from last \nyear and an over $100 billion cut since 9/11.\n  Every one of our military leaders has told us that we are putting the \nmen and women who are serving in uniform at greater risk. That is not \nfair to them, I say to the Senator from Maryland. It is not fair. So I \ndon't put our domestic needs on the same plane as our national \nsecurity. I believe our national security is our first obligation, and \nthat is what my amendment is all about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes on the \nDemocratic side and 3 minutes on my side prior to the second vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 43, the nays are \n55.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 6 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I will vote against Senator \nMcCain's amendment No. 4229, the $18 billion of additional spending for \nthe Department of Defense.\n  I support the troops and their mission, especially Maryland's nine \nmilitary bases. While there are many items I would like to see more \nmoney for, I believe we can meet the needs of our national defense \nwithin the budget caps. For fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill reported unanimously by the Appropriations \nCommittee last week did that.\n  The Defense appropriations bill accomplishes many objectives without \na budget gimmick. It uses base funding to provide $600 million to meet \nIsrael's missile defense, an increase of $455 million above the \nrequest. The McCain amendment offers only $465 million. Appropriations \nwill add $600 million to Israeli defense.\n  Let's look at new, modern ships. The McCain amendment authorizes $90 \nmillion less for the littoral ships than what we do. We put in $475 \nmillion. The McCain amendment adds nothing to an account for the \nNational Guard and Reserve. The Defense appropriations bill adds $900 \nmillion for the Guard and Reserve equipment account so they can \nrecapitalize themselves, so they can be part of our fighting military \nfor our Commander in Chief.\n  Also, we can look at something like the Arctic. There is a threat to \nthe Arctic. Senator Murkowski from Alaska has spoken eloquently about \nit. We have money in here for polar icebreakers. The Russians have 6, \nand we have 1 in Antarctica. This helps the shipbuilding industry and \nso on.\n  We can do this in Defense appropriations. I urge the rejection of the \nMcCain amendment. We can meet our national defense without a budget \ngimmick.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, facts are stubborn things. They add $7 \nbillion. We want $18 billion to restore the cuts from last year.\n  So I say to the Senator from Maryland: Facts are stubborn things. The \nfact is this amendment increases spending by $18 billion, which brings \nus up to last year's level.\n  Look at how the world has changed in the last year. Look at the \ncommitments that this Nation has assumed as a result of a failed Obama \nforeign policy.\n  It increases the military pay raise to 2.1 percent. The current \nadministration budgets 1.6. It fully funds our troops in Afghanistan. \nIt stops the cuts to end strength and capacity. For example, it cancels \na planned reduction of 15,000 active Army soldiers. It prevents cutting \nthe 10th carrier air wing. It includes additional funding for 36 \nadditional UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters, five Apaches, and five \nChinooks. It provides an additional $319 million for Israeli defense \nprograms and $2.2 billion for readiness.\n  We have ships that can't sail and planes that can't fly and pilots \nthat can't train. Do you know our pilots are flying less hours than \nRussian and Chinese pilots are, thanks to sequestration?\n  It addresses the Navy's ongoing fighter shortfall and USMC aviation \nreadiness. It supports the Navy's shipbuilding programs, necessary to \nfund the additional DDG-51, and restores the cut of 1 littoral ship. \nThat is the job of the authorizers. You are doing the job of the \nauthorizers, I say to the Senator from Maryland, and that is wrong. It \nis up to us to authorize, not you. It is your job to fund, not to \nauthorize.\n  So what is a ``no'' vote going to do, my friends?\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n  It is going to be a vote in favor of another year where the pay for \nour troops doesn't keep pace with inflation. In voting no, you are \ncutting more soldiers and marines in operational requirements. Voting \nno will be a vote in favor of continuing to shrink the number of \naircraft that are available to the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. \nVoting no would be a vote in favor of letting arbitrary budget caps set \nthe timeline for our mission in Afghanistan. Voting no is a vote in \nfavor of continuing to ask our men and women in uniform to continue to \nperform more and more tasks.\n  As the Chief of the U.S. Army has said, if we continue these cuts, we \nare putting the lives of the men and women in the military in danger. \nIf you vote no, don't go home and say you support the military, because \nyou do not.\n  I yield.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the provision on share-in-savings contracts)\n\n       On page 508, strike line 10 and all that follows through \n     ``(d) Training.--'' on line 15 and insert the following:\n       Section 2332 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Training.--\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I believe we are waiting for the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n      Unanimous Consent Request--Authority for Committees to Meet\n\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I have five unanimous consent requests \nfor committees to meet during today's session of the Senate. They have \nthe approval of the majority and minority leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these requests be agreed to and that \nthese requests be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the benefit of my colleagues, until \nwe finish this bill, I don't want anybody doing anything but finishing \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, while we are waiting, I believe that one \nof the Senators is coming to the floor for a unanimous consent request.\n  I would like to talk for a minute with my friend from Rhode Island, \nthe ranking member, about a provision that is being held up, \nunfortunately, and that has to do with our interpreters, who have \nliterally placed their lives on the line in order to help Americans and \nliterally save American lives. That amendment is being held up for \nextraneous reasons.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, I, and everybody on a bipartisan \nbasis, and with fervent pleas from people such as GEN David Petraeus, \nGEN Stanley McChrystal, and Ambassador Ryan Crocker--later on I will \nread all of these individuals' letters that are almost wrenching \nbecause, in the words of, I believe, General McChrystal, it is not just \na regular obligation, it is a moral obligation. Are we going to not \nallow these people to come to the United States, these people who \nliterally laid their lives on the line for us and saved American lives, \nin the view of our military leadership who testified to that? General \nPetraeus wrote a very compelling letter. All the most respected \nmilitary and diplomatic leaders have asked for this, and it is being \nheld up for extraneous reasons.\n  I alert my colleagues that the Senator from Rhode Island and I are \ngoing to ask unanimous consent to move to that amendment because there \nare 99 votes in favor of it.\n  We cannot do this. We cannot do this to people who are allies. What \nmessage does it send to anybody who wants to assist the U.S. military \nand government--not just the military; the government--in carrying out \ntheir responsibilities and missions? If we send the message that we are \ngoing to abandon those people, what will happen in the next conflict? \nWhat will happen in Afghanistan today?\n  I hope an objection will not take place. I would like to alert my \ncolleagues that in the next 15 or 20 minutes we will be moving that \namendment, asking unanimous consent. Anyone who opposes it, I suggest \nthey come to the floor and be prepared to object. This is really a \nmatter of what America is all about. As important as an amendment that \nis not connected to that is, I don't know of a higher obligation we \nhave than to care for those who have, as I say for the third time, laid \ntheir lives on the line and saved American lives in our pursuit of \ntrying to achieve our goals.\n  So I would alert my colleagues that in 15 minutes we will be \nproposing a\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nunanimous consent agreement to pass that amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I join the chairman. He has very \neloquently and passionately described the situation we are in. We have \nthousands of Afghans who have come forward and helped our forces--not \njust our military forces but our diplomats and our AID workers. They \nhave been the translators. They have been on the frontlines, and they \nhave exposed themselves to risk. Many of them are in danger of \nretaliation. What they want and what I think is owed to them is the \nopportunity to relocate to the United States.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has proposed an amendment and has \nworked incredibly hard to satisfy objections from many different \nquarters, both technical and substantive, and I think has reached a \nvery principled approach that would recognize our obligations to these \nindividuals. It would, in a very controlled and very careful way, allow \nthem to relocate to the United States.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his passionate leadership and the \nSenator from New Hampshire for her extraordinary and tireless efforts, \nfor the last 24-plus hours and throughout the larger process.\n  The other point I wish to make, and it does echo what the chairman \nsaid, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, but particularly in Afghanistan, if \nwe are going to sustain our presence there, as I believe we must, we \nhave to be able to recruit additional Afghans to help us. If the \nmessage they are getting is ``You are going to put your life on the \nline, and when you are no longer useful to them, they don't even \nremember you. You are not even a name; you are just a nobody,'' we are \ngoing to have a difficult time. If we can't recruit these highly \nskilled interpreters and other Afghans, our personnel--diplomatic, \nmilitary, and others--will be in jeopardy. In addition to supporting \nour troops, some of these interpreters have been involved with FBI \nagents who were in Kabul and other places on counterterrorism \noperations. It is very dangerous work. Work that couldn't be done \nwithout these interpreters.\n  Again, the Senator from New Hampshire has done the bulk of the work, \nand we have done good work in getting to the point where we really need \nto get this passed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I join Chairman McCain and Ranking \nMember Reed in the very eloquent remarks they have provided in support \nof the Special Immigrant Visa Program for Afghans who have assisted our \nmen and women on the ground serving in Afghanistan.\n  Chairman McCain mentioned the letter from GEN Stanley McChrystal. I \nwould like to read a few sentences from this letter that was sent to \nall the Members of Congress.\n  General McChrystal says:\n\n       The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan relies on allies \n     who serve as translators, security personnel, and in a \n     multitude of other functions. All of these actors are vital \n     to the U.S. mission, whether [they] work directly or \n     indirectly with U.S. forces. Afghans who served the United \n     States in non-military capacities or in support of the \n     Department of State face serious threats as a result of their \n     service.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If this program falls far short of the need, it will have \n     serious national security implications.\n\n  We have received similar letters from GEN John Campbell, who was head \nof the forces in Afghanistan, and from General Nicholson, who is \ncurrently the general and commander of resolute support of United \nStates Forces-Afghanistan. Ryan Crocker, a former Ambassador in \nAfghanistan, has been very eloquent in the need to continue to support \nthis program and make sure those Afghans who have stood with our \nAmerican soldiers can come to the United States.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord these letters and this article from Ryan Crocker.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        McChrystal Group, LLC,\n\n                                Alexandria, Virginia, May 1, 2016.\n     Hon.

Representative John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Rayburn House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators and Representatives: I write today to express \n     my support for the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) \n     program and to express my opinion that additional SIVs are \n     desperately needed.\n       Throughout my service in the U.S. military, I have seen \n     just how important a role our in-country allies play in our \n     missions. Many of our Afghan allies have not only been \n     mission-essential--serving as the eyes and ears of our own \n     troops and often saving American lives--but have risked their \n     own and their families' lives in the line of duty. Protecting \n     these allies is as much a matter of American national \n     morality as it is American national security. I ask for your \n     help in upholding this obligation by appropriating additional \n     Afghan SIVs to bring our allies to safety in America.\n       It is crucial that Congress act to provide additional visas \n     for the SIV program. The most recent figures from the State \n     Department suggest that at least 10,000 applicants remain in \n     the SIV processing backlog; as our troop presence in \n     Afghanistan continues, we can only expect more endangered \n     Afghan allies to seek our help, adding to the backlog. The \n     Department of State has indicated that an additional 4,000 \n     Afghan SIVs for the year would allow it to continue to \n     process and issue visas in Fiscal Year 2017. If this program \n     falls far short of the need, it will have serious national \n     security implications.\n       I am also concerned that Congress may limit eligibility for \n     SIV applicants. The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan \n     relies on allies who serve as translators, security \n     personnel, and in a multitude of other functions. All of \n     these actors are vital to the U.S. mission, whether the work \n     directly or indirectly with U.S. forces. Afghans who served \n     the United States in non-military capacities or in support of \n     the Department of State face serious threats as a result of \n     their service. They are currently eligible for the SIV \n     program and their eligibility should remain intact.\n       Thank you for your support of the Special Immigrant Visa \n     program. Congress must ensure that the SIV program for our \n     Afghan allies--one of the only truly non-partisan issues of \n     the day--meets the needs of those we seek to help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Stanley A. McChrystal,\n     General, U.S. Army (Retired).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Headquarters,\n\n\n                                             Resolute Support,\n\n                                 Kabul, Afghanistan, May 20, 2016.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for \n     the continuation of the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program. \n     It is my firm belief that abandoning this program would \n     significantly undermine our credibility and the 15 years of \n     tremendous sacrifice by thousands of Afghans on behalf of \n     Americans and Coalition partners. These men and women who \n     have risked their lives and have sacrificed much for the \n     betterment of Afghanistan deserve our continued commitment. \n     Failure to adequately demonstrate a shared understanding of \n     their sacrifices and honor our commitment to any Afghan who \n     supports the International Security Assistance Force and \n     Resolute Support missions could have grave consequences for \n     these individuals and bolster the propaganda of our enemies.\n       During my previous three tours in Afghanistan, I have seen \n     many Afghans put themselves and their families at risk to \n     assist our forces in pursuit of stability for their country. \n     The stories of these interpreters and translators are heart-\n     wrenching. They followed and supported our troops in combat \n     at great personal risk, ensuring the safety and effectiveness \n     of Coalition members on the ground. Many have been injured or \n     killed in the line of duty, a testament to their commitment, \n     resolve, and dedication to support our interests. Continuing \n     our promise of the American dream is more than in our \n     national interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-\n     standing tradition of honoring our allies.\n       Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from both the Afghan \n     insurgency and extremist networks. We must remain committed \n     to helping those Afghans who, at great personal risk, have \n     helped us in our mission. This is the second year the Afghan \n     National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) are in the lead \n     for security. They are fighting hard and\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n     fighting well for a stable, secure Afghanistan. The vast \n     majority of the SIV applicants have served as interpreters \n     and translators for our troops. They have exposed themselves \n     and compromised the safety of their families to provide \n     critical situational awareness and guidance, both of which \n     have helped save countless Afghan, American and Coalition \n     lives.\n       Thank you for your continued support of American troops in \n     Afghanistan.\n           Very Respectfully,\n     John W. Nicholson,\n       General, U.S. Army, Commander, Resolute Support/United \n     States Forces--Afghanistan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Headquarters,\n\n\n                             United States Forces-Afghanistan,\n\n                                               Kabul, Afghanistan.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing you to express my strongest \n     support for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.\n       Since our arrival in Afghanistan, U.S. Forces have relied \n     upon our Afghan partners, especially our linguists, to \n     perform our mission. They have consistently been there with \n     us through the most harrowing ordeals, never wavering in \n     their support for our soldiers, our mission, and their own \n     country. Many have been injured or killed in the line of \n     duty.\n       Unfortunately, their support of our mission has resulted in \n     our Afghan partners facing threats from insurgent groups \n     throughout the country. They frequently live in fear that \n     they or their families will be targeted for kidnappings and \n     death. Many have suffered this fate already. The SIV program \n     offers hope that their sacrifices on our behalf will not be \n     forgotten.\n       After several ups and downs, the program remains an \n     extremely important way for the United States to protect \n     those who assisted us. By December 2014, the Department of \n     State had issued all 4,000 Afghan SIVs allocated under the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. As \n     you know, the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act \n     provides 4,000 additional SIVs for Afghan applicants. The \n     State Department's Status of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa \n     Program report in April 2015 shows there are more than 8,000 \n     SIV applications that have been submitted. Each week, I \n     receive several personal requests and inquiries from \n     linguists and others who have worked with, or continue to \n     work with, U.S. Forces, seeking assistance with the Afghan \n     SIV program. I inform them how we are working closely with \n     Congress to obtain adequate SIV allocations each year. This \n     shows just how important this program remains to our Afghan \n     partners, as well our own forces.\n       Since I assumed command of the Resolute Support Mission/\n     U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, much has changed and the Afghan \n     National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) are in the lead to \n     secure the country. We have a willing and strategic partner \n     whose interests are aligned with our own. The ANDSF is taking \n     the fight to the enemy this fighting season and are \n     performing well. Our prospects for long-term success and a \n     strategic partner have never been better. We would not be in \n     this position without the support and leadership of the U.S. \n     Congress, the American people, the men and women who have \n     served here with distinction, and our Afghan partners.\n       I urge Congress to ensure that continuation of the SIV \n     program remains a prominent part of any future legislation on \n     our efforts in Afghanistan. This program is crucial to our \n     ability to protect those who have helped us so much.\n       Thank you for your support for America's Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John F. Campbell,\n     General, U.S. Army, Commanding.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 2016]\n\n   Don't Let the U.S. Abandon Thousands of Afghans Who Worked for Us\n\n                           (By Ryan Crocker)\n\n       The House will soon consider the National Defense \n     Authorization Act, an annual piece of legislation that sets \n     policy for the military. If the bill becomes law in its \n     current form, the United States will break faith with the \n     Afghans who served with U.S. troops and diplomats.\n       This is a very personal issue for me. I was the U.S. \n     ambassador to Iraq from 2007 to 2009 and the U.S. ambassador \n     to Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012. I observed firsthand the \n     courage of the citizens who risked their lives trying to help \n     their own countries by helping the United States. During my \n     time in Afghanistan, I had the pleasure of working with the \n     859 Afghan staffers at our embassy who risked their lives \n     every day to work for the betterment of their country and \n     ours. It takes a special kind of heroism for them to serve \n     alongside us.\n       Two men continue to stand out in my memory for their \n     service to our nation. Taj, for instance, worked for the U.S. \n     government for more than 20 years; he returned from Pakistan \n     after the fall of the Taliban as the first local staffer in \n     the reopened embassy. He was there when I first raised our \n     flag in early 2002. His outreach to imams to discuss \n     religious tolerance and women's rights under the Koran has \n     achieved measurable results in fighting extremism. Another, \n     Reza, helped connect embassy leadership with politicians and \n     thought leaders, supporters and critics, to hear their \n     concerns and ideas. To protect these brave men and their \n     families, I can use only their first names here.\n       As a result of their service, many allies like Taj and Reza \n     have faced--and continue to face--security threats so serious \n     that they are unable to remain in their home countries. From \n     2006 to 2009, I worked closely with the Congress to establish \n     special immigrant visa (SIV) programs for Afghans and Iraqis \n     that enable our brave partners to come to safety in the \n     United States because of the sacrifices they made on our \n     behalf. Although Iraqi and Afghani ``special immigrants'' do \n     not technically come as refugees under the law, that is \n     exactly what they are, in essence: people persecuted because \n     of their political actions and in urgent need of protection. \n     Reza, for example, faced Taliban death threats for his work \n     assisting our embassy and now lives in the United States.\n       In an era of partisan rancor, this has been an area where \n     Republicans and Democrats have acted together. Congress has \n     continued to support policies aimed at protecting our wartime \n     allies by renewing the Afghanistan SIV program annually--\n     demonstrating a shared understanding that taking care of \n     those who took care of us is not just an act of basic \n     decency; it is also in our national interest. American \n     credibility matters. Abandoning these allies would tarnish \n     our reputation and endanger those we are today asking to \n     serve alongside U.S. forces and diplomats.\n       By welcoming these Afghans, we would offer a powerful \n     counter-narrative to the propaganda of the Islamic State and \n     other extremist groups, which claim that the United States is \n     hostile to Muslims. Turning our backs on people who worked \n     with us would appear to give credence to the extremists' \n     lies.\n       The need for help is particularly great this year as the \n     U.S. military has reduced its presence in Afghanistan. There \n     are 10,000 Afghans in the SIV application backlog. But the \n     State Department has fewer than 4,000 visas remaining, which \n     would leave more than 6,000 Afghans stranded in a country \n     where their work for the United States means they are no \n     longer safe. State requested 4,000 additional visas so that \n     it can continue to process applications. Yet even these \n     additional visas are not enough to protect all the Afghans \n     and Iraqis who have worked and continue to support the United \n     States abroad.\n       But the legislation, as it passed the House Armed Services \n     Committee last week, goes in the opposite direction. Despite \n     this backlog, the bill has no provision to increase the \n     number of visas. It restricts the criteria for eligibility to \n     military interpreters and translators who worked off-base and \n     individuals who worked on-base in ``trusted and sensitive'' \n     military support roles, excluding Afghans who worked in non-\n     military roles such as on-base security, maintenance and \n     support for diplomats and other government entities. Neither \n     Taj nor Reza would have qualified under such revised \n     criteria. When deciding whom to kill, the Taliban do not make \n     such distinctions in service--nor should we when determining \n     whom to save.\n       There is still time to save and strengthen this essential \n     program. This week, the Senate Armed Services Committee is \n     considering the bill. In past years, the bipartisan efforts \n     of leaders like Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Jeanne \n     Shaheen (D-N.H.) have kept these essential visa programs \n     intact, and I hope they can do the same this year. Congress \n     should both expand this essential program and work to fix the \n     delays in processing that are weakening it.\n       This is truly a matter of life and death. I know hundreds \n     of people who have been threatened because of their \n     affiliation with the United States. Some have been killed. \n     Today, many are in hiding, praying that the United States \n     keeps its word. We can and must do better.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, as Senator Reed said, the amendment we \nhave offered has been very carefully crafted. It has been a compromise \namong those who have had concerns about the program and those of us who \nbelieve it is critical we continue to support it. This is something all \nof those who have been watching this program have now agreed to, and I \nhope the objection we are hearing from some, that I think is unrelated \nto this issue, can be addressed.\n  I close with a story that says to me how important this program is. \nSenator McCain and I had the opportunity 2 years ago to sit down with a \nformer Army captain, a man named Matt Zeller, and his interpreter, an \nAfghan named Janis Shinwari, who had just been allowed into the United \nStates. When I asked Matt Zeller how he met Janis and about the help he \nhad provided him, his response was that they had met basically when he \nand his unit were under attack from the Taliban and he was knocked out \nin that attack. When he woke up, it wasn't he and fellow unit members \nof the military who were dead, it was the Taliban, and they were dead \nbecause Janis Shinwari was there and had protected Matt and the fellow \nmembers of his unit.\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\n  I think that says so much about how important these interpreters and \nthose who have provided support to our men and women on the ground in \nAfghanistan have been. What will we say the next time we want somebody \nto help, when we need help in a country where our men and women are \nfighting, if they can look back and say: You didn't keep your word, \nUnited States, so why should we help you now?\n  This is our opportunity to continue to keep our word, to continue to \nmake sure those people who helped us in Afghanistan, who protected our \nmen and women on the ground there, are able to come to the United \nStates when they are threatened, when their families are threatened, \nand be safe.\n  I certainly hope we can work out the objection we are hearing from \nsome Members and that we can support this very carefully crafted \ncompromise to make sure we protect those who have helped protect us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                      Industrial Hemp Farming Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, we are working on the very important \nDefense bill, but I just wanted to take a few minutes to discuss \nanother topic.\n  For some time, with the support of the Senate majority leader, Mr. \nMcConnell, Senator Merkley and Senator Paul and I have all been trying \nto change Federal law so farmers across the country can secure the \ngreen light to grow hemp in America.\n  About a year ago, I came to the floor of the Senate with a basket of \nhemp products to highlight that this is a particularly important time \nin the debate--a time in history when we have kind of reflected on what \nthis issue has been about. I have talked about how hemp products are \nmade in this country, sold in this country, and consumed in our \ncountry, but they are not 100-percent American products. They can't be \nfully red, white, and blue products because the law says the hemp used \nto make them cannot be grown on a large-scale basis here at home.\n  Another year has gone by since the majority leader, Senator Merkley, \nSenator Paul, and I teamed up, and unfortunately industrial hemp \ncontinues to be on the controlled substances list. Because of that \nunjustified status, hard-working farmers in Oregon and across our \ncountry have been deprived of the opportunity and benefits of a crop \nthat has enormous economic potential--all because there has been this \nmisinterpretation that in some way this is affiliated with marijuana.\n  Industrial hemp and marijuana come from the same plant species. \nSomeone could say they have a similar look, but they are, in fact, very \ndifferent in key ways. First and foremost, industrial hemp does not \nhave the psychoactive properties of marijuana. You would have about as \nmuch luck getting high by smoking cotton from a T-shirt as you would by \nsmoking hemp. In my view, the hemp ban looks like a case of illegality \nfor the sake of illegality.\n  Four Members of the United States Senate, including the Senate \nmajority leader, want to bring an end to this anti-hemp stigma that \nhas, in effect, been codified in the law. We have talked about a whole \nhost of hemp products--foods, soap, lotion supplements, hemp milk, and \nyou can even use a hemp product to seal the lumber in a deck.\n  If you just look at the variety of products--the kinds of products I \nhave shown here before--you can certainly see the ingenuity of American \nproducers. You see a growing demand of American consumers for hemp \nproducts. My view is our hard-working farmers ought to have the \nopportunity to meet that demand.\n  Unfortunately, 100 percent of the hemp used in the kinds of products \nI brought to the floor have to be imported from other countries. So \nthis ban on hemp is not anti-drug policy, it is anti-farmer policy. I \nhave held this belief. I remember going to a Costco at home, when my \nwife Nancy was pregnant with our third child, and I saw there were hemp \nproducts available there at the local Costco, and I announced what was \ngoing to be a guiding principle of mine on this; that is, if you can \nbuy it at a local supermarket, the American farmer ought to be able to \ngrow it. Quaint idea, but I think if you walk through a Costco or any \nother store, you say to yourself: Must be pretty exasperating for \nAmerican farmers to not have an opportunity to be part of generating \nthat set of jobs associated with the ag sector because the jobs are \ncoming from people overseas.\n  There has been a bit of progress. The 2014 farm bill puts the first \ncracks in the Federal ban. It okayed growth research projects led by \nuniversities and agriculture departments in States such as Oregon and \nKentucky that take a smarter approach to hemp. These projects have \nproven successful. Farmers are ready to grow hemp, but the first cracks \nin the Federal ban do not go far enough, and these projects are still \njust tied up, tied up, and tied up in various spools of redtape.\n  In my view, what is needed is a legislative solution. So what we now \nhave, in addition to the four of us--the Senators from Kentucky, the \nSenators from Oregon--is a bipartisan group of 12 Senators on the \nIndustrial Hemp Farming Act. Once and for all, what we would say is, as \na matter of law, let's remove hemp from the schedule I controlled \nsubstances list and give a green light to farmers from one end of the \ncountry to another who believe they would like to have a chance putting \npeople to work growing hemp.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect on the history of this time, to learn \nmore about the safe and versatile crop and the great potential it holds \nto giving a boost to American agriculture and our domestic economy.\n  This is a bipartisan bill. The Senate majority leader, Mitch \nMcConnell; my colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley; Senator \nMcConnell's colleague from Kentucky, Rand Paul--the four of us, both \nSenators from Oregon, both Senators from Kentucky--say this is common \nsense. Twelve Members of the Senate are on board. It is time to turn \nthis into law and give our hard-working farmers--and I note the \nPresiding Officer knows a bit about farming--I want to give our farmers \nanother opportunity to generate profit and revenue for their important \nenterprises in America, and I hope my colleagues will support the \nlegislation.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have been moving very steadily through \nthis authorization bill. I once again commend the leadership of \nChairman McCain. It really began months ago when the Chairman decided \nthat he was going to do an indepth analysis of the Department of \nDefense, calling upon experts from an extraordinary range of academic, \nmilitary, and diplomatic leaders. As a result, we became much more \nknowledgeable than we were previously about things within the \nDepartment that we should very carefully review and perhaps change. In \nfact, because of his leadership, this is the most fundamental revision \nof the Goldwater-Nichols procedures that were adopted three decades \nago. We have spent a lot of time discussing important issues, but I \ndon't think we have given quite enough credit to the work that the \nChairman and our colleagues have done with respect to some of these \nimportant reforms.\n  One area that we worked on together is developing statutory authority \nfor cross-functional teams within the Office of the Secretary of \nDefense. One of the challenges that Goldwater-Nichols faced, and faced \nsuccessfully, was to try to integrate operational units. They came up \nwith the concept of jointness, which now we assume has always been \nthere, but that was not the case 30 or 40 years ago. Because of the \ninspiration of the concept and because of the emphasis in the \nassignment process of moving forward and having an assignment not in \nyour branch of service but in a job that required the integration of \nother services, that approach made a significant, fundamental change on \nthe effective operations of military forces today, and we take it for \ngranted.\n  Similarly, we want to take that type of approach not just in the \nservices and\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nthe operational command but within the headquarters of the Secretary of \nDefense. We have organized cross-functional teams that the Secretary--\nhe or she--can adopt. These cross-functional teams exemplify the real \nmission of the Secretary. It is not to organize personnel or logistics. \nIt is to achieve an outcome which requires every component to work \ntogether. This is just one example of the innovation that is being \npromoted in this legislation. Again, I think it is not only building on \nGoldwater-Nichols, but it is really going much further more \neffectively.\n  One of the inspirations for this approach is what has been done in \nprivate industry. Private industry has faced some of the same \nchallenges as every large institution--and the Department is a large \ninstitution. They have lots of functional areas, but they didn't have a \ncommon operational technique, a common team, et cetera. Looking at the \nprivate sector, this model has become prevalent because it has reduced \ncosts, increased efficiency, and delivered products on time--in fact, \neven faster than they thought they could do. We hope this approach will \nsimilarly provide the kinds of organizational structure and incentives \nfor the Department of Defense that will make the Office of the \nSecretary of Defense much more efficient. That is just one aspect but \nthere are other aspects that are critical too.\n  Some of the other aspects involve trying to focus research and \nengineering in one particular focal point in the Department of Defense. \nThis is in reaction to the phenomenon that we have all observed, and \nthat is that our technological superiority--which we took for granted \nfor decades and decades and decades--is now being slowly eroded because \nof research that is going on across the globe. Part of our proposal is \nto have a very centralized figure with significant rank to focus on \nthis research and engineering effort.\n  Other duties in terms of management of the program, operation of the \nDepartment of Defense, and testing issues could be coordinated with \nother elements. That is another important aspect of these proposals.\n  Again, we have spent a great deal of time discussing important \nissues, but I think we should not fail to note these important changes.\n  In addition to structure changes at the Department of Defense level, \nwe are also creating a much more organizationally streamlined structure \nin order to more appropriately deliver services.\n  In addition, we worked closely with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to get \ntheir input about how the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs can be more \neffective as the principal adviser to the President of the United \nStates. That is an important change to be made. We have also been very \ncareful to get feedback from professionals within the Chairman's office \nso that we are doing things that make sense, that work, and that \nfunction appropriately.\n  Another important aspect to note in talking about very fundamental \nGoldwater-Nichols reform is the role of the Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. That person has the responsibility to head the Joint \nRequirements Oversight Council--JROC--which I am well familiar with. \nEssentially, the JROC lays out for all the services what types of \nequipment they need, what requirements they are fulfilling--whether it \nbe an undersea craft or a new aviation platform. After listening to the \nnumerous experts that came before us, our observation was that the Vice \nChairman might have been in a sense first among equals, but there were \nmore consensus decisions without a focal point of leadership. What we \nhave done in this legislation is make it clear that the Vice Chairman \nis indeed the leader of that group, so he or she will someday have the \nability to make decisions after getting advice from the other members \nof the JROC.\n  But it will not be what is perceived today as a sort of quid pro quo \nbetween services: The Navy might want a particular ship, and in return \nfor that particular ship, they will be amenable to a proposal by the \nAir Force for a particular aviation platform. What we have now is that \nthe Vice Chair will be able--not only as the official formal head of \nthis but also as the chief adviser to the Chairman--to say: No, we have \nlooked at this not from the perspective of the service but from the \nperspective of the Joint Chiefs and our role as giving advice to the \nPresident so that we can go ahead and give a decision that is not based \nupon anything else.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4603 to Amendment No. 4607\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, at this juncture I call up Reid amendment \nNo. 4603.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4603 to amendment No. 4607.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       This Act shall be in effect 1 day after enactment.\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, to continue briefly, we are again spending \na great deal of time on an important issue, and we have more important \nissues that will emerge. But I think it is long overdue to cite what we \nhave done in just a small part under the leadership of the chairman to \nmake fundamental changes to the operation of the Department of Defense. \nI am confident that years from now, when they talk about Goldwater-\nNichols, they will talk about McCain, what the McCain amendments did \nand what the McCain bill did. I think that is a fitting tribute to the \nchairman. I also think it is ultimately what we are all about here. It \nis going to make sure that the men and women in the field who wear the \nuniform of the United States have the very best leadership, from the \nSecretary's level, to the Chairman's level, all the way down to their \nplatoon leader and commander.\n  I want to make sure we noted that.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, may I say to my very modest friend from \nRhode Island that anything that has the McCain name on it has a \nhyphened name and the Reed name on it because what we have accomplished \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee would be absolutely impossible \nwithout the partnership we have. I cannot express adequately my \nappreciation for the cooperation and the friendship we have developed \nover many years. As I have said probably 200 times, despite his poor \neducation, he has overcome that and has been a very great contributor \nto----\n  Mr. REED. Will the chairman yield? If I had the opportunity to go to \na football school and not an academic institution, I would be better \noff today.\n  Forgive me, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, hopefully we are going to pass the \nresolution that will allow interpreters to come to the United States \nunder a special program.\n  I have received letters, and correspondence from literally every \nmilitary leader and diplomatic leader who has served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record copies of those \nletters and correspondence.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Headquarters,\n\n\n                                             Resolute Support,\n\n                                 Kabul, Afghanistan, May 20, 2016.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my support for \n     the continuation of the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program. \n     It is my firm belief that abandoning this program would \n     significantly undermine our credibility and the 15 years of \n     tremendous sacrifice by thousands of Afghans on behalf of \n     Americans and Coalition partners. These men and women who \n     have risked their lives and have sacrificed much for the \n     betterment of Afghanistan deserve our continued commitment. \n     Failure to adequately demonstrate a shared understanding of \n     their sacrifices and honor our commitment to any Afghan who \n     supports the International Security Assistance Force and \n     Resolute Support missions could have grave consequences for \n     these individuals and bolster the propaganda of our enemies.\n       During my previous three tours in Afghanistan, I have seen \n     many Afghans put themselves and their families at risk to \n     assist our forces in pursuit of stability for their country. \n     The stories of these interpreters and translators are heart-\n     wrenching. They followed and supported our troops in combat \n     at\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\n     great personal risk, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of \n     Coalition members on the ground. Many have been injured or \n     killed in the line of duty, a testament to their commitment, \n     resolve, and dedication to support our interests. Continuing \n     our promise of the American dream is more than in our \n     national interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-\n     standing tradition of honoring our allies.\n       Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from both the Afghan \n     insurgency and extremist networks. We must remain committed \n     to helping those Afghans who, at great personal risk, have \n     helped us in our mission. This is the second year the Afghan \n     National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) are in the lead \n     for security. They are fighting hard and fighting well for a \n     stable, secure Afghanistan. The vast majority of the SIV \n     applicants have served as interpreters and translators for \n     our troops. They have exposed themselves and compromised the \n     safety of their families to provide critical situational \n     awareness and guidance, both of which have helped save \n     countless Afghan, American and Coalition lives.\n       Thank you for your continued support of American troops in \n     Afghanistan.\n           Very Respectfully,\n     John W. Nicholson,\n       General, U.S. Army, Commander, Resolute Support/United \n     States Forces--Afghanistan.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Headquarters,\n\n\n                            United States Forces--Afghanistan,\n\n                                               Kabul, Afghanistan.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Armed Services Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, I am writing you to express my strongest \n     support for the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.\n       Since our arrival in Afghanistan, U.S. Forces have relied \n     upon our Afghan partners, especially our linguists, to \n     perform our mission. They have consistently been there with \n     us through the most harrowing ordeals, never wavering in \n     their support for our soldiers, our mission, and their own \n     country. Many have been injured or killed in the line of \n     duty.\n       Unfortunately, their support of our mission has resulted in \n     our Afghan partners facing threats from insurgent groups \n     throughout the country. They frequently live in fear that \n     they or their families will be targeted for kidnappings and \n     death. Many have suffered this fate already. The SIV program \n     offers hope that their sacrifices on our behalf will not be \n     forgotten.\n       After several ups and downs, the program remains an \n     extremely important way for the United States to protect \n     those who assisted us. By December 2014, the Department of \n     State had issued all 4,000 Afghan SIVs allocated under the \n     Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. As \n     you know, the FY15 National Defense Authorization Act \n     provides 4,000 additional SIVs for Afghan applicants. The \n     State Department's Status of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa \n     Program report in April 2015 shows there are more than 8,000 \n     SIV applications that have been submitted. Each week, I \n     receive several personal requests and inquiries from \n     linguists and others who have worked with, or continue to \n     work with, U.S. Forces, seeking assistance with the Afghan \n     SIV program. I inform them how we are working closely with \n     Congress to obtain adequate SIV allocations each year. This \n     shows just how important this program remains to our Afghan \n     partners, as well our own forces.\n       Since I assumed command of the Resolute Support Mission/\n     U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, much has changed and the Afghan \n     National Defense Security Forces (ANDSF) are in the lead to \n     secure the country. We have a willing and strategic partner \n     whose interests are aligned with our own. The ANDSF is taking \n     the fight to the enemy this fighting season and are \n     performing well. Our prospects for long-term success and a \n     strategic partner have never been better. We would not be in \n     this position without the support and leadership of the U.S. \n     Congress, the American people, the men and women who have \n     served here with distinction, and our Afghan partners.\n       I urge Congress to ensure that continuation of the SIV \n     program remains a prominent part of any future legislation on \n     our efforts in Afghanistan. This program is crucial to our \n     ability to protect those who have helped us so much.\n       Thank you for your support for America's Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John F. Campbell,\n     General, U.S. Army, Commanding.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: David Petraeus\n     Date: May 12, 2016.\n\n       Dear Chairman, I write to express my support for the Afghan \n     Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program and to state that \n     additional SIVs are desperately needed.\n       Throughout my time in uniform, I saw how important our in-\n     country allies are in the performance of our missions. Many \n     of our Afghan allies have not only been mission-essential--\n     serving as the eyes and ears of our own troops and often \n     saving American lives--they have risked their own and their \n     families' lives in the line of duty. Protecting these allies \n     is as much a matter of American national morality as it is \n     American national security. I ask for your help in meeting \n     our obligation by appropriating additional Afghan SIVs to \n     bring our allies to safety in America.\n       It is crucial that Congress act to provide additional visas \n     for the SIV program. The most recent figures from the State \n     Department suggest that at least 10,000 applicants remain in \n     the SIV processing backlog; as our troop presence in \n     Afghanistan continues, we can expect more endangered Afghan \n     allies to seek our help, adding to the backlog. The \n     Department of State has indicated that an additional 4,000 \n     Afghan SIVs for the year would allow it to continue to \n     process and issue visas in Fiscal Year 2017. If this program \n     falls far short of the need, it will have serious national \n     security implications.\n       I am also concerned that Congress may limit eligibility for \n     SIV applicants. The U.S. military presence in Afghanistan \n     relies on local partners who serve as translators, security \n     personnel, and in a multitude of other functions. All of \n     these individuals are vital to the U.S. mission, whether they \n     work directly or indirectly with U.S. forces. Afghans who \n     served the United States in non-military capacities or in \n     support of the Department of State face serious threats as a \n     result of their service. They are currently eligible for the \n     SIV program and their eligibility should remain intact.\n       Thank you for your support of the Special Immigrant Visa \n     program. Congress must ensure that the SIV program for our \n     Afghan allies--one of the only truly non-partisan issues of \n     the day--meets the needs of those we seek to help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Dave Petraeus.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. For the sake of illustration, I would like to quote from \na couple of the letters I have. One is from General Nicholson, who \ntoday is our commander of resolute support, United States Forces-\nAfghanistan. I won't read the whole letter, but I would like to quote \nit because I think it is very compelling.\n  General Nicholson says:\n\n       During my previous three tours in Afghanistan, I have seen \n     many Afghans put themselves and their families at risk to \n     assist our forces in pursuit of stability for their country. \n     The stories of these interpreters and translators are heart-\n     wrenching. They followed and supported our troops in combat \n     at great personal risk, ensuring the safety and effectiveness \n     of Coalition members on the ground. Many have been injured or \n     killed in the line of duty, a testament to their commitment, \n     resolve, and dedication to support our interests. Continuing \n     our promise of the American dream is more than in our \n     national interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-\n     standing tradition of honoring our allies.\n\n  I would like to repeat General Nicholson's last sentence: \n``Continuing our promise of the American dream is more than in our \nnational interest, it is a testament to our decency and long-standing \ntradition of honoring our allies.''\n  I could not put it any better than General Nicholson did.\n  Finally, I would like to quote from a letter by General Campbell, who \nwas his predecessor. General Campbell said:\n\n       I am writing you to express my strongest support for the \n     Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.\n       Since our arrival in Afghanistan, U.S. Forces have relied \n     upon our Afghan partners, especially our linguists, to \n     perform our mission. They have consistently been there with \n     us through the most harrowing ordeals, never wavering in \n     their support of our soldiers, our mission, and their own \n     country. Many have been injured or killed in the line of \n     duty.\n       Unfortunately, their support of our mission has resulted in \n     our Afghan partners facing threats from insurgent groups \n     throughout the country. They frequently live in fear that \n     they or their families will be targeted for kidnappings and \n     death. Many have suffered this fate already. The SIV program \n     offers hope that their sacrifices on our behalf will not be \n     forgotten.\n\n  Again, those are two compelling statements.\n  I will not go further because I see the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia waiting, but I would like to quote from correspondence from an \nindividual who I think is the finest military leader among the many \noutstanding military leaders whom I have had the opportunity of \nknowing. This is from GEN David Petraeus, Retired. It is a letter he \nwrote. He said:\n\n       Throughout my time in uniform, I saw how important our in-\n     country allies are in the performance of our missions. Many \n     of our Afghan allies have not only been mission-essential--\n     serving as the eyes and ears of our own troops and often \n     saving American lives--they have risked their own and their \n     families' lives in the line of duty. Protecting these allies \n     is as much a matter of American national morality as it is \n     American national security. I ask for your help in meeting \n     our obligation by appropriating additional Afghan SIVs to \n     bring our allies to safety in America.\n\n  It is signed ``Sincerely, David Petraeus.''\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\n  Both of the individuals I just quoted served multiple tours--not one, \nnot two, sometimes as many as five--in Iraq and Afghanistan over the \nlast 14 years. These leaders know what the service and sacrifice of \nthese Afghans and Iraqis have provided to our military at the very risk \nand loss of their lives since they are the No. 1 target of the Taliban \nin Afghanistan.\n  I hope my colleagues, by voice vote, will agree to increase the visa \nprogram so that we can allow these people to come to the United States \nof America.\n  I will end with this. I know that some people come to our country \nwhom we have some doubts about--their citizenship, their commitment to \ndemocracy, their adequacy, the kind of people they are.\n  Well, these people have already proven their allegiance to the United \nStates of America because they have put their lives on the line. Some \nof them had their family members murdered. I have no doubt as to what \nkind of citizens of this country they will be.\n  I believe that an overwhelming majority of my colleagues agree that, \nas General Nicholson said in his letter, it is a moral obligation. I \nthink we will all feel better after we get this done.\n  I note the presence of probably the most well-informed Member of the \nU.S. Senate on budgetary issues, the Senator from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, first, I want to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Reed, for their tireless work in doing \nGod's work here, and that is making sure we provide for the needs of \nour men and women in uniform around the world.\n  There are only 6 reasons why 13 Colonies got together in the first \nplace. One of those six was to provide for the national defense. That \nis what we are talking about this week.\n  As we debate the National Defense Authorization Act this week, I \npersonally would like to add a little different perspective to this \ndebate.\n  In my opinion, today the world is more dangerous than at any time in \nmy lifetime. We have major threats from various perspectives. No. 1, we \nsee the rise of traditional rivals--Russia, China--and ever-more \naggressiveness from both. We see the rise of ISIS and attendant \nnetworks around the country supporting terrorism and the Islamic State. \nWe see the proliferation of nuclear capability among rogue nations, \nsuch as North Korea and Iran. We see the hybrid warfare, including \ncyber warfare, that is being perpetrated today. What we are not talking \nabout is the growing arms race in space. All this adds to a very \ndangerous world and makes it very mobile and puts people right here in \nthe United States in danger, as we have seen already.\n  As we face these increasing threats, though, at the very time we need \nour military to be strongest, we are disinvesting in our military.\n  You can see from this chart that over the last 30 years or so, we \nhave had three Democratic Presidents, and all have disinvested in the \nmilitary for different reasons. First we had President Carter, then we \nhad President Clinton, and now we have President Obama. We have \ndisinvested in the military to the point that today we are spending \nabout 3 percent of our GDP on our military. That is about $600 billion \nin round numbers. The 30-year average is 4 percent. That difference, \nthat 1 percentage point of difference, is $200 billion.\n  What I am concerned about is that as we sit here facing these \nadditional threats today, we have the smallest Army since World War II, \nthe smallest Navy since World War I, and the oldest and smallest Air \nForce ever. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the current \nplan is even worse than that. It says that in the next 10 years we will \ncontinue to disinvest in our military down to 2.6 percent of our GDP. \nThat is another estimated $100 billion of reduction. This is a new low \nthat I believe we cannot allow to happen.\n  As we look at our overall defense spending authorization levels today \nin this NDAA bill, we are falling short of where we need to be based on \nthe threats we face. Don't just take my word for it. The last defense \nbudget that Secretary Bob Gates actually proposed was in 2011. That was \nthe last one proposed before sequestration took place, and that was the \nlast defense budget that was based on the actual assessment of the \nthreats against our country, not arbitrary budget limitations. His \nestimate at that time for this year, fiscal year 2016, was $646 \nbillion. As for 2017, our top-line estimate right now--what we are \ntrying to get approved--is $602 billion. That is a far cry.\n  By the way, Secretary Gates' estimate was before ISIS, before the \nBenghazi attacks on our Embassy, before Russia seized Crimea, before \nRussia went into the Ukraine, and before China started building islands \nin the South China Sea. I can go on. How did we get here?\n  Today, financially, we have an absolute financial catastrophe. In the \nlast 7 years, we have borrowed about 30 percent of what we have spent \nas a Federal Government. It is projected that over the next 10 years we \nwill again borrow about 30 percent of what we spend as a Federal \nGovernment.\n  My argument has been that we can no longer be just debt hawks; we \nhave to also be defense hawks. By the way, those two can no longer be \nmutually exclusive.\n  In order to solve the global security crisis, I believe we have to \nsolve our own financial debt crisis. We all know we have $19 trillion \nof debt today. What is worse, though, is that CBO estimates that is \ngoing to grow to $30 trillion over the next decade unless we do \nsomething about it.\n  This chart shows the real problem. Right now, the problem is not \ndiscretionary spending, which is actually down from around 2010--about \n$1.4 trillion--down to about $1.1 trillion today. So discretionary \nspending--now, we may have gotten there the wrong way. We used the \nsequestration to do that. But I would argue that discretionary spending \nis not where the major problem is today. The major probably is in the \nmandatory spending--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, pension and \nbenefits for Federal employees, and the interest on our debt.\n  We have been living in an artificial world where interest rates have \nbeen basically zero. We are paying fewer dollars on the Federal debt \ntoday--fewer dollars than we were in 2000 when our debt was one-third \nof what it is today.\n  To deal with the global security crisis, we need to be honest about \nwhat our military needs. That gets difficult sometimes. Today we have \nnational security priorities that aren't getting properly funded, and \nyet we know we are spending money inefficiently.\n  First of all, we have missions that we are not able to maintain. Take \na look at the marine expeditionary units around the world. These are \nthe MEUs around the world. I visited a couple of these, by the way. \nBecause of defense cuts, there aren't enough amphibious ships for the \nmarines to have what is known as theater reserve force, also known as \nMEUs. As a result, for missions like crisis response and Embassy \nprotection in Africa, for example, we now have a Special Purpose MAGTF \ncovering this task based on the ground in Moron, Spain.\n  I personally visited with those people. The best--I mean the very \nbest of America is in uniform around the world taking care of our \nbusiness and protecting our interests and our freedom here at home. \nEven this force in Moron, Spain, is seeing a cut in their fleet size of \nairplanes. They are self-contained. They can get themselves from where \nthey are to the point of crisis very quickly, but we are cutting their \nability to do that because of limitations from a financial standpoint.\n\n  Another example is the recapitalization program for the Joint \nSurveillance Target Attack Radar System, or what we call JSTARS, the \nNo. 4 acquisition priority for the Air Force and a critical provider of \nISR ground targeting and battlefield command and control to all \nbranches of our military in almost every region of the world.\n  As the old fleet is reaching the end of its service life, we will \nhave to have a new fleet come online quickly. The problem is we are \nseeing a projected gap of 7 years where that capability will no longer \nbe available in full force for the people who need it the most--people \non the ground and in harm's way.\n  We are not able to fund the military at the force size we need \neither. As a\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nresult, we are putting greater pressure on personnel, burning up our \ntroops, putting pressure on families, and elongating our deployments. \nThey spend more time on rotations internationally and not enough time \nwith their families at home, and it is causing problems. It is causing \nturnover, problems with families, and so forth.\n  The forces we have are not getting the training they need. For \nexample, two-thirds of Army units are only training at the squad and \nplatoon levels, not in full combat formations. We have Air Force pilots \nactually leaving the service today because they cut back so \ndramatically on training flights. These examples highlight why we need \nto scrutinize every dollar we spend on defense so we can ensure these \ndollars go to our critical requirements of protecting our men and women \naround the world.\n  To that end, we need to improve fiscal accountability at the DOD and \nhighlight the needs we are not currently fulfilling. For example, our \nDepartment of Defense has never been audited. Even today, we cannot \ndictate to the DOD that they provide an audit.\n  Can you imagine Walmart doing that? First of all, the answer is this: \nWe are too big, too complicated, and it is just too difficult to do. \nCan you imagine Walmart calling the SEC and saying: Sorry, we are not \ngoing to comply with your requirements. The DOD is not that much bigger \nthan Walmart.\n  I think we should withhold funds to the accountable agency until a \nplan is produced that would also allow the Pentagon to keep track of \nits military equipment. It has been 13 years since that law was passed, \nand yet they are still not in compliance. This is all just about \nfunding our military, but we also have to be responsible. The men and \nwomen in uniform and on the frontlines deserve that.\n  Finally, to address a critical need we discussed earlier, JSTARS, \nSenator Isakson and I have been working to get the replacement fleet \nready to go sooner rather than later to eliminate this gap. This fleet \nmust get online faster than the current plan or we face a potential 7-\nyear gap.\n  I am committed to ensuring that we have what we need to support our \nservice men and women around the world. These efforts will make the \nPentagon accountable and focus funds on critical priorities. This \ndebate is all about setting the right priorities, not just here at home \nwith the military but also with other domestic programs and mandatory \nexpenditures. This debate is all about setting the right priorities to \nmake sure we can do what the Constitution calls on us to do, and that \nis to provide for the national defense.\n  The national debt crisis and our global security crisis are \ninterlocked inextricably. We are not going to solve the dilemma of \nproviding for national defense until we solve this national debt \ncrisis. Our servicemen, servicewomen, and combatant commanders don't \nhave and will not have the training, equipment, and preparation they \nabsolutely need to fulfill their missions as they face growing threats. \nIt is time that Washington faces up to this crisis.\n  This is not just about the NDAA. This is about the defense of our \ncountry and the future of our very way of life. We simply have to come \nto grips with this NDAA, pass it, and make sure we find a way to \naddress this debt crisis so every year going forward we don't have this \ndrama of finding a way to fund our military to protect our country. We \nsimply have to come to grips and set the right priorities required to \ndefend our country.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, for more than 23 years, I had the great \nhonor of serving in the Army Reserve and National Guard. It was during \nthis time that I was able to gain firsthand experience of working \nalongside the unbelievable men and women in uniform, whose character, \nhonor, and love of our country has led them to sacrifice so selflessly \nfor it. During my time in the military, I had the honor of serving a \ntour in Kuwait and Iraq.\n  As a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom, what was so \nimportant to me, other than bringing everyone home, was ensuring my \ntroops received what they needed when they needed it. Unfortunately, \ngiven the nature of war and the learning curve our military had in its \nfirst large-scale military deployment since Operations Desert Shield \nand Desert Storm, that did not always happen. However, as the war went \non, our military adapted and our troops were able to receive the \nequipment they needed to do the job.\n  Even though I am now retired from the military, I still have the \nprivilege of serving our men and women in uniform, just in a different \ncapacity, as a Senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee. It \nhas been an honor to work with Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, \nand the other distinguished members of the committee on another vital \nannual Defense bill.\n  Over the past year, my colleagues and I have worked to produce a bill \nthat enhances the capabilities of our military to face current and \nfuture threats. This bill will impart much needed efficiencies in the \nDepartment of Defense that will result in saving American taxpayer \ndollars and allow the Department to provide greater support to our \nwarfighters through eliminating unnecessary overhead, streamlining \nDepartment functions, reducing unnecessary general officer billets, and \nmodernizing the military health care system.\n  Furthermore, we have found ways to enhance the capabilities of our \nwarfighters, ensuring our troops have the training opportunities in \norder to be prepared to execute their assigned missions. This means \nmore rotations to national training centers and more effective home \nstation training for our troops who are being sent into harm's way \naround the world.\n  Our military leaders have stressed that readiness is their top \npriority. Adequately funding their request for readiness keeps faith \nwith our servicemembers and ensures that our men and women in uniform \nhave the best chance to come home to their loved ones. However, while \nwe have adequately funded the Department's readiness needs, \nsequestration has led us to prioritize readiness over DOD \nmodernization. I believe this is a risky proposition with respect to \nensuring our servicemembers will have the advanced equipment, vehicles, \nships, and aircraft to confront technologically advanced adversaries, \nsuch as Russia and China, in a potential future conflict.\n  Unfortunately, I believe many have taken our decades-long \ntechnological dominance for granted. If we continue to fail to \nadequately fund modernization, our servicemembers may pay the price for \nthat decision with their lives, something none of us want.\n  While I fully agree with the need to identify and reduce government \nspending--and especially to eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in the \nDOD--we must also ensure funds are allocated in the proper areas so our \ntroops have the resources they need so they are not outclassed by our \nadversaries, who are currently modernizing their capabilities with aims \nto defeat our country in a potential conflict.\n  Due to sequestration and the Bipartisan Budget Act, this bill is \nshort of what our troops need to defend our country next year and in \nfuture years. I believe it is important to keep that in mind while we \nconsider this bill.\n  I was sorely disappointed that the Senate did not come together in a \nbipartisan fashion and stop shortchanging our troops and their families \nthrough the arbitrary caps set through sequestration. That was a missed \nopportunity. The threats the Nation and our troops face are too great \nfor partisan bickering, shortsightedness, and the abdication of one of \nour core responsibilities, which is to provide for our military.\n  I wish to talk also about a few of the provisions included in the \nNDAA that I crafted. During the process, I was able to author nearly \ntwo dozen provisions ranging from improving the professionalism of \nmilitary judge advocates and military intelligence professionals to \nmaking retaliation against sexual assault victims its own crime and \nenhancing DOD program management.\n  As I stated repeatedly, one area of focus for me is working to \nprevent sexual assault in the military. While we have seen progress, \nthere are still steps that must be taken to improve the system and the \noverall culture. One of my provisions would help enhance the military \nprosecutors and JAGs to better ensure that victims of sexual assault \nand other crimes will know their\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\ncase is in good, well-trained, and experienced hands.\n  Also included in this bill is a provision I authored with Senator \nMcCaskill of Missouri, which combats retaliation within our military. \nWe cannot allow any retaliation against survivors who come forward \nseeking justice, and this provision will work to curb the culture of \nretaliation in our ranks.\n  Other provisions I pushed to have included in the committee report \nseek to bring greater military intelligence support to our warfighters \nby ending growth in headquarters elements and pushing that support down \nto those military intelligence units providing direct support to our \nwarfighters. Not only do these report language provisions seek to \nenhance support to our men and women defending our Nation on the \nfrontlines, but they would also create safeguards which will help \nensure your taxpayer dollars are being spent properly within the DOD.\n  This bill also includes my Program Management Improvement \nAccountability Act, which is a bipartisan piece of legislation that \nsolves problems with program and project management that have plagued \nthe Federal Government for decades, especially in the Department of \nDefense. We have read about these failures in the media, IG reports, \nand the GAO High Risk List. Many projects are grossly overbudget, \ndelayed, or do not meet previously stated goals.\n  Ultimately, by strengthening its program management policies, the DOD \nand other Federal agencies will better account for and utilize taxpayer \ndollars. It will also improve its ability to complete projects on time \nand on budget, which leads to getting our troops the advanced equipment \nand weapons they need as soon as possible.\n  In closing, I want to thank again my colleagues for their work on \nthis bill, but most of all, I thank our men and women in uniform, and I \nwant them to know that we stand with them in their defense of this \ngreat country and all that it stands for.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, as we continue to debate this year's \nNational Defense Authorization Act on the floor this week, I want to \ntake a few minutes as the ranking member of the Armed Services \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee to discuss provisions of the bill that \nrelate to our Nation's nuclear deterrent and nonproliferation programs, \nmissile defense, and space programs.\n  I want to start by thanking all the members of the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee for putting in another year of hard work. I would \nespecially like to thank our Subcommittee Chairman, my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, for the strong partnership we have built \nover the past 2 years in leading this committee together. I want my \ncolleagues to note that Senator Sessions and his staff worked closely \ntogether with me and my staff in developing elements of the bill \npertaining to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.\n  Together with our colleagues on the subcommittee, we have built \nbipartisan consensus on some of the most important issues in this \nbill--no small feat when we are talking about things like nuclear \nweapons and defending against missile threats from Iran and North \nKorea.\n  I also thank the tremendous professionals on our staff, both \nRepublican and Democratic, whose expertise and dedication to serving \nthe national interest are essential to this bill's success.\n  In developing the base language for the NDAA, the Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee held five hearings and a number of briefings on topics \nranging from nuclear policy and deterrence, to missile defense, to \nprotecting our satellites in space during a time of increasing threats \nfrom potential adversaries who seek to exploit the fragile nature of \nthese assets.\n  In the area of nuclear forces, our subcommittee has prioritized the \nneed to update our Nation's nuclear command and control infrastructure \nto ensure our ability to communicate with our nuclear forces in times \nof national crisis.\n  We have also examined the role of our Nation's deterrence policy \ntoward Russia and made available $28 million to shore up our NATO \nnuclear mission, over and above the funding for the European \nReassurance Initiative. These funds will help provide much needed \nupgrades to the readiness of our dual-capable aircraft and other \nactivities to exercise our nuclear mission in support of NATO.\n  Within the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, we continue to fully authorize the W-76 submarine \nmissile warhead life extension program, where upward of two-thirds of \nour deterrent will exist upon full implementation of the New START \nTreaty.\n  We also continue to life-extend the B61 gravity bomb in support of \nour NATO allies, and we have fully authorized the life extension of the \nW80 cruise missile warhead, which will support the air leg of our \ntriad.\n  The subcommittee has continued full support for the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, which marks its 25th anniversary \nthis year. I would like to thank Senator Lugar and Senator Nunn for \ntheir extraordinary service to this Nation. This program, named for my \nfellow Hoosier predecessor, Senator Richard Lugar, combats nuclear \nproliferation by helping nations detect nuclear materials crossing \ntheir borders and by securing nuclear materials in their countries to \nkeep them out of the hands of terrorists.\n  In addition to working with nuclear material, the program also \naddresses biological threats, helping other nations secure dangerous \npathogens. In the case of the Ebola epidemic, the program was able to \nhelp the 101st Airborne Division develop rapid field diagnostics to \nquickly screen infected patients from those who simply had a fever \nunrelated to the disease. Many have credited this program's quick \nresponse, combined with the capabilities of the 101st Airborne, with \nreversing the tide of the Ebola epidemic before it spread to large \ncities.\n  In the area of cutting-edge hypersonic systems, the bill provides \nfull funding for programs like conventional prompt strike that aim to \neven the global playing field on hypersonic systems development.\n  According to public reports, Russia and China are prioritizing the \ndevelopment of hypersonic weapons and making troubling progress \nrelative to our own. If we are to maintain our Nation's technological \nedge over our potential adversaries, we need to invest in this critical \narea of research and development.\n  While the House authorizers and appropriators have also fully funded \nconventional prompt strike, I am surprised and troubled to see that the \nSenate Appropriations Committee has proposed cutting this program by \nalmost half. I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to address this issue and restore full funding to conventional \nprompt strike in the coming months.\n  In the area of electronic warfare, our subcommittee has required the \nCommander of U.S. Strategic Command to coordinate and develop joint \nexecution plans to operate and fight in a domain that includes \nelectronic jamming and other means that disrupt our fragile electronic \nsystems. Russia has a long-established doctrine in this area, but ours \nhas been lacking. This provision will help reverse that trend.\n  In the area of missile defense, the subcommittee has fully authorized \nthe President's budget request for the Missile Defense Agency and \nauthorized additional funding for key development areas, including the \nredesigned kill vehicle, the multi-object kill vehicle, and an improved \nground-based interceptor booster.\n  The NDAA also requires a review of DOD's strategy and capabilities \nfor countering cruise and ballistic missiles before they are launched, \nand it directs the MDA to conduct a flight test of the GMD system at \nleast once each fiscal year. The bill provides funding above and beyond \nthe President's budget request for our collaborative missile defense \nprograms with Israel, including Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow \nsystems. However, given the threat posed by Iran's growing ballistic \nmissile arsenal, I believe these programs require additional funding, \nparticularly for procurement related to David's Sling and the Arrow \nsystems. These programs are more important than ever and have my full \nsupport.\n\n  In the area of space, the NDAA addresses a number of important issues\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nrelated to our critical satellite-based capabilities. This week we \ncommemorated the 72nd anniversary of D-day. Anyone who knows the \nhistory of the Normandy invasion knows how critical a role weather \nforecasting can play in the success or failure of a mission. This \nyear's bill pays close attention to DOD's ability to provide weather \ndata to our troops around the world, particularly in CENTCOM's area of \nresponsibility. Our current fleet of weather satellites is aging, and \nour subcommittee has taken DOD to task for its failure to adequately \nplan for the upcoming gap in cloud cover data over the Indian Ocean.\n  Whether we are talking about GPS, weather surveillance, or \ncommunications, our Nation's space-based capabilities are fundamentally \ndependent on our ability to get to space. There is no question that we \nmust maintain the ability to send national security satellites into \nspace with launch systems that are affordable and, above all, supremely \nreliable.\n  We learned a hard lesson on reliability in the late 1990s when we \nlost three national security satellites to launch failures. Those \nfailures cost the taxpayer more than $3 billion and lost our Nation a \ncritical communications capability that we didn't replace for more than \na decade. Subsequently, years of monopoly in DOD space launch taught us \na hard lesson about the necessity of competition for keeping costs \ndown.\n  While we all agree on the need to maintain what is known as assured \naccess to space, how we best meet that goal has become a topic of \ndebate, particularly since our deteriorating relationship with Russia \nput a spotlight on the fact that DOD uses Russian rocket engines in \nmany of its space launches. We need to end our Nation's reliance on \nRussian engines with the development of an American-made alternative. \nWe have studied the facts on this issue in painstaking detail on the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee for not just months, but years. The fact \nis, if we want to end our reliance on Russian engines without \njeopardizing the reliability and affordability that are essential to a \nsuccessful launch program, it is going to take another few years.\n  I am not satisfied with that. I want to see it happen faster. In the \nmeantime, though, we have to take seriously the warnings of our \nmilitary and intelligence community that eliminating access to the RD-\n180 engine prematurely, before a replacement is ready to fly, would \nseriously undermine our national security interests. As it currently \nstands, the NDAA would ban the use of RD-180 engines years before a \nreplacement is ready and instead rely on the more expensive Delta \nrocket to fill the gap. I respect the careful thought behind this \nproposal and the effort to ensure that we don't create a capability \ngap. Ultimately this approach, though, would cost the taxpayer an \nadditional $1.5 billion and divert funds from developing an American-\nmade replacement engine and launch system to paying for these more \nexpensive Delta launches. At a time when we continue to face budgetary \nchallenges in defense and domestic spending, this is a cost and a risk \nwe don't need.\n  With that in mind, I support the bipartisan amendment No. 4509 \noffered by my colleagues Senator Nelson and Senator Gardner. This \namendment grants DOD access to only those Russian engines it needs \nbetween now and 2022, when the Department has said a replacement will \nbe ready. I believe this is the most responsible approach to a very \ndifficult issue.\n  Let me close by again thanking Senator Sessions for the productive \nand bipartisan relationship we have had on the subcommittee. I also \nthank our full committee chairman, Senator McCain, and our ranking \nmember, Senator Reed, for their leadership and their dedication to \nstrengthening our national security and caring for our military.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation and to see it signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield back any remaining time that has been \nallotted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Remembering Cassandra Quin Butts\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, almost a year ago exactly I met with a \nremarkable woman. She was wise, gracious, and funny, but I think what \nstruck me the most about her was her idealism. Cassandra Quin Butts \nbelieved in the revolutionary promise on which our Nation was founded; \nthat all men and women are created equal. She spent her entire working \nlife trying to expand that premise.\n  On the day we met, her nomination to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the \nBahamas had been blocked for more than a year for reasons entirely \nunrelated to her qualifications. That did not make her cynical. It did \nnot diminish her desire to serve. She just wanted to know if there was \nanything she could do to help. It was typical. Cassandra Butts asked \nthe question, How can I help?\n  Sadly, Ms. Butts will never receive the vote she deserved on her \nnomination to be Ambassador. She died over a week ago at the far-too-\nyoung age of 50. She felt ill for a few days, had seen a doctor, and \ndied peacefully in her sleep before learning of her diagnosis, acute \nleukemia.\n  Cassandra Butts was a longtime friend of President Obama and First \nLady Michelle Obama. Ms. Butts and the future President met during \ntheir first days of Harvard Law School in the financial aid office. \nNeither one of them came from families that could simply write checks \nfor tuition. In a statement mourning her passing, the President and \nFirst Lady remembered Ms. Butts and said as ``a citizen, always \npushing, always doing her part to advance the causes of opportunity, \ncivil rights, development, and democracy.''\n  ``Cassandra,'' the Obama's wrote, ``was someone who put her hands \nsquarely on that arc of the moral universe, and never stopped doing \nwhatever she could to bend it toward justice.''\n  They continued. ``To know Cassandra Butts was to know someone who \nmade you want to be better.'' Ms. Butts began her distinguished career \nin public service about a year after graduating law school. She worked \nas legal counsel to U.S. Senator Harris Wofford. After the Senate, she \nwent to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, following in the \nfootsteps of one of her heroes, former U.S. Justice Thurgood Marshall.\n  She returned to Capitol Hill in 1996 as a senior adviser to House \nMajority Leader Dick Gephardt and the House Democratic policy \ncommittee. From 2004 to 2008, she served as Senior Vice President for \nDomestic Policy at the Center for American Progress--with a few breaks \nin service to help her old friend. When Barack Obama was elected to the \nSenate in 2004, Cassandra Butts was there, helping him to get his \noffice up and running.\n  Later, she helped her old friend the President launch his historic \nPresidential campaign. When he won, Cassandra Butts was there again to \noffer advice on transition. She stayed on to serve the President as \nDeputy White House Counsel. Among the lasting marks she leaves on our \ndemocracy, Cassandra Butts helped shepherd through this Senate the \nnomination of the first Latina ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor.\n  Ms. Butts was a remarkably humble person, especially for one who \nworked so close to power. She left the White House in November 2009 to \nserve as Senior Advisor at the Millennium Challenge Corporation. During \nher time there, she kept an exhausting schedule, traveling to some of \nthe poorest places on Earth, searching for innovative ways to use \nAmerica's leadership and ingenuity to help lift desperately poor \npeople, especially women and children, out of crushing poverty.\n  It saddens me that Ms. Butts never had the opportunity to serve as \nAmbassador because she could have had so many ideas that she would have \nbrought to represent America's values and help the people of the \nBahamas.\n  She had hoped that being an African-American woman, it would help to \nunderscore America's commitment to equality. While he waited for a vote \non her nomination, Cassandra Butts represented our Nation well on the \nworld\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\nstage in a different capacity. She served with distinction as Senior \nAdvisor to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.\n  Accounts of her life will always lead off with the fact that she was \na close friend of the President and First Lady, but that was only part \nof the story. Cassandra Butts was a friend to countless people around \nthe world, from the famous to the voiceless. She was a seeker of truth \nand justice. She was also warm and funny, smart and passionate, deeply \ndecent. She loved jazz, the UNC Tar Heels, fast cars, especially her \nBMW.\n  She left this world too soon and she will be missed. Loretta and I \nwish to extend our condolences to her many friends and family, \nespecially her mother Mae Karim, her father Charles Norman Butts, her \nsister and brother-in-law, Deidra and Frank Abbott, her two nephews \nwhom she adored, Austin and Ethan Abbott.\n  It is a sad reality that as I stand here today and pick up this \npublication on the desk of every Senator, the Executive Calendar for \nthe Senate of the United States, and turn to look at it closely, I find \nin this calendar, on page 5, the name of Cassandra Butts, waiting for \nthe Senate to approve her position as the Ambassador to the Bahamas.\n  She waited and waited and waited. Eventually she passed away, waiting \non the Senate Calendar to serve this country. When the Senators who had \na hold on her for all this period of time were asked: Why? Why did you \nhold up this woman, one of them was very candid and said: We knew she \nwas close to the President, and if we stopped her, we knew the \nPresident would feel the pain. I hope today we all feel the pain that \nthis lady can no longer have the distinction of ending her fabulous \npublic career as our Ambassador representing the United States to the \nBahamas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to talk about \nan issue I have worked on for a number of years and something I feel \nvery strongly about; that is, our detention and interrogation policy. \nSince this administration has gotten into office, based on a campaign \npromise, the President has sought to close Guantanamo Bay.\n  This administration has continued to release individuals held at \nGuantanamo--dangerous terrorists, with backgrounds, whether it is \ninvolvement with Al Qaeda or involvement with the Taliban or other \ngroups. Just recently, they have released another 11 individuals from \nGuantanamo Bay. One of the issues that has troubled me most about this \nis that I think it is very important the American people know what is \ngoing on, but so much of this is happening in the cloak of darkness. So \nmuch of it is an unwillingness of this administration to level with the \nAmerican people about the terrorist affiliations and activities of \ncurrent and former Guantanamo Bay detainees.\n  We have seen the most recent example of that which is troubling. On \nMarch 23 of 2016, Paul Lewis, the Special Envoy for Guantanamo \nDetention Closure, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee \nthat there have been Americans who have died because of Guantanamo Bay \ndetainees. He was asked about this in this House hearing. My assumption \nis one of the reasons he was asked about it is because 30 percent of \nthose who were held at Guantanamo--terrorists who have been released \nfrom Guantanamo--are suspected or confirmed of reengaging in terrorism. \nApparently, Mr. Lewis was asked, and he said there have been Americans \nwho have died because of Guantanamo detainees who have been released.\n\n  So a fair question--a very important question--is to understand what \nthese former detainees have done in terms of attacking Americans or our \nNATO allies who have worked with us to fight terrorists in places \naround the world. That was a question I posed to this administration. \nBased on what Mr. Lewis, who is the Special Envoy for Guantanamo \nDetention Closure said, I asked the administration for information \nabout those who have been killed by Guantanamo detainees. On May 23 the \nadministration responded to me, but their answers to my questions were \nclassified in such a way that even my staff with a top secret security \nclearance could not review the response. I was able to review the \nresponse.\n  What I want to be able to do is to give information to the American \npeople so they can understand the response, because this administration \ncontinues to push to close Guantanamo. They continue to release \nterrorists from Guantanamo to countries around the world, and they \ncontinue to refuse to tell the American people--hiding behind \nclassification--who the people are who are being released in terms of \ntheir backgrounds and in terms terrorist affiliations. They have been \nreleasing a name and the country they are transferred to--but no \ninformation to the American people about the terrorist background of \nthese individuals, no information to the American people about how \nthese individuals have been released, what they have been engaged in, \nand whether they have been engaged in prior attacks on Americans or our \nallies. I believe the American people have a right to know.\n  On Tuesday I also wrote a followup letter to the President urging him \nto provide without delay an unclassified response to understand how \nmany Americans and our NATO partners have been killed by former \nGuantanamo detainees and which former detainees committed these \nterrorist attacks, so we can understand what we are facing.\n  Unfortunately, we don't know. But in the Washington Post today there \nwas an article that reported that 12 former Guantanamo detainees were \ninvolved in attacks on Americans after their release. The estimate in \nthe Washington Post report says that these detainees have killed about \na half dozen Americans.\n  Why should the American people have to rely on the ability of the \nWashington Post to talk to people off the record to try to find out \nexactly what the activities are of these terrorists whom the \nadministration continues to release without full information to the \nAmerican people? I appreciate the reporting of the Washington Post, but \nI believe the American people deserve an answer directly from this \nadministration. Since Mr. Lewis testified that Guantanamo detainees \nhave been involved in killing Americans, the administration has \nreleased 11 more detainees from Guantanamo, with more than two dozen \nlikely to be released in the coming months. Again, 30 percent are \nsuspected or confirmed of reengaging in terrorism--people such as \nIbrahim al-Qosi, affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, who \nwas released by this administration in 2012 to Sudan. He has joined \nback up with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is headquartered \nin Yemen.\n  Previously, what has been revealed about him publicly is that he \ntrained at a notorious Al Qaeda camp as a member of Osama bin Laden's \nelite security detail.\n  What is more troubling is that he is now back with Al Qaeda in the \nArabian Peninsula. He is a leader and a spokesman for this group, and \nhe is urging attacks on American and our allies. That is what is at \nstake when we think about the security of the American people. Yet the \npolicy that this administration and this President keep pushing is to \nclose Guantanamo. They are trying to take de facto steps to close \nGuantanamo by releasing people without information to the American \npeople.\n  In this Defense authorization bill that is pending on the floor, in \nthe Armed Services Committee I have included a provision that would \nprohibit international release or transfer of any detainee from \nGuantanamo until the Department of Defense submits to Congress an \nunclassified report on the individual's previous terrorist activities \nand affiliations, as well as their support or participation in attacks \nagainst the United States or our allies.\n  The administration keeps claiming that it is in the best interests of \nthe United States--in our national security interests--to close \nGuantanamo.\n  I fully disagree with that argument. But if that is what they really \nbelieve, why have they not told the American people, when they release \nthe terrorists who are held at Guantanamo, whom these people have been \ninvolved with and whether they have been involved with attacks on \nAmericans or our allies. Instead, they give the name and\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nthe country they are going to. That is all they are telling the \nAmerican people. If it is in our national security interests, they will \nfully tell the American people why they believe in transferring or \nreleasing these terrorists to third-party countries, and they will tell \nthe American people the truth about who is being released and what they \nhave been involved in. I think the American people, if they know that \ninformation, will side with my view of this, which is that to close \nGuantanamo--especially by releasing dangerous individuals who are \nthere, with 30 percent of them suspected or confirmed of getting back \ninto battle--is against our national security interests and makes us \nless safe.\n  I ask, no matter where you stand in this body on the closure of \nGuantanamo, don't we owe it to the American people to tell them? When \nthey are releasing individuals from Guantanamo, doesn't the \nadministration owe to the American people what terrorist group this \nperson is affiliated with? Has this person ever been involved with the \nattack of Americans or our allies? Don't the American people deserve \nthis basic information?\n  The American people need to know who is being released, why they are \ndangerous, and what is happening in terms of our national security \ninterests, because I believe they are being undermined greatly by \ncontinuing to release terrorists who get back in the fight. The last \nthing our men and women in uniform or any of our allies should see is a \nterrorist whom we had previously captured and was at Guantanamo.\n  I hope the administration will live up to its transparency policy, \nbecause when it comes to releasing dangerous detainees from \nGuantanamo--some of whom have gotten back in the fight, and 30 percent \nare suspected or confirmed of getting back in the fight of terrorism \nagainst us--the American people deserve information about what is \nhappening and what danger these individuals pose to us and our allies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I think it is very obvious that in the \nauthorization bill we placed limitations on the use of Russian rocket \nengines. It is already known that in the appropriations bill there is \nbasically an unlimited purchase of Russian rocket engines, much to the \ntestimony of the military-industrial-congressional complex.\n  I will be showing how Russians who have been sanctioned by the United \nStates of America, under Vladimir Putin, will directly profit from the \ncontinued purchase of these Russian rocket engines. And in the \nnegotiations that I have been trying to move forward so I could satisfy \nthe appropriators, there is no doubt who has the veto power. We know \nwho they are talking to--the people I am negotiating with--Boeing, \nLockheed, and the outfit called ULA, which is the two of them.\n  This is a classic example of the influence of special interests over \nthe Nation's priorities. But more importantly, they are so greedy that \nthey were willing to put millions of dollars into the pockets of these \nindividuals, two of whom have been sanctioned by the United States of \nAmerica and one of whom has been sanctioned by the EU--cronies of \nVladimir Putin. It is really remarkable, this nexus of special \ninterests that end up profiting for these individuals millions of \ndollars, which I will talk about in a minute.\n  Really, my friends, I say again that this is why we see the American \npeople being cynical about Washington--this tight relationship between \nthis conglomerate of two of the biggest defense industries in America--\nBoeing and Lockheed--and we end up with an expenditure of tens of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars. It is really remarkable.\n  In the authorization bill we put a strict limit on it, and in the \nCommittee on Appropriations, which we already know about, it is \nbasically an open door. So that is why I was trying and will continue \nto try to have a simple amendment which says that we will not provide \nmoney to any company or corporation that would then profit these people \nwho have been sanctioned by the United States of America in two cases, \nand in one case by the European Union. Why have they been sanctioned? \nBecause of their invasion of the Ukraine.\n  So when we talk about things that are unsavory, this is probably one \nof the most unsavory issues I have been involved in during my many \nyears here. It was 2 years ago when Vladimir Putin began his campaign \nin Eastern Europe, dismembering a sovereign nation. Today, we are \nfacing an increasingly belligerent Russian Government, and we know that \nPutin continues to occupy Ukraine, he threatens our NATO allies, and he \nbombs U.S.-backed forces in Syria that are fighting against Bashar \nAssad's murderous regime. His tactical fighter jets buzz, with \nimpunity, U.S. ships in the Baltic, putting the lives of U.S. personnel \nat risk, and all the while American taxpayers continue to spend \nhundreds of millions of dollars to subsidize Russia's military \nindustrial complex.\n  You don't have to take my word for it. You don't have to take my word \nfor it. Here is a letter I received a few days ago. And let me tell you \nwho has signed it before I read it: The Honorable Leon Panetta, former \nSecretary of Defense; GEN Michael Hayden, former Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, former Director of the National Security \nAgency; Michael J. Morell, former Deputy Director and Acting Director \nof the Central Intelligence Agency; Michael Rogers, former chairman of \nthe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; ADM James \nStavridis, former Supreme Allied Commander at NATO. These individuals \nhave some credibility--more on this issue, I think, than almost anybody \nelse.\n  Let me tell you what they write. And this letter is to Senator Reed \nand me:\n\n       We write to endorse the bipartisan effort you both have led \n     to include language in the National Defense Authorization Act \n     to phase out U.S. reliance on Russian technology for the \n     space launch systems that deliver our vital and most \n     sensitive satellites.\n\n  They go on to talk about how important reliable access to space is. I \nam continuing to quote now from their letter:\n\n       Fortunately, we now have an American industrial base with \n     multiple providers that can produce All-American-made rocket \n     engines.\n\n  And these are people such as the head of the Central Intelligence \nAgency saying, ``There is no need to rely on Putin's Russia for this \nsensitive, critical technology.''\n  The letter goes on to talk about Russia's aggressive intervention in \nUkraine and Crimea, and meddling in Syria. Quoting again from the \nletter:\n\n       The threat from Russia is rising, as the committee knows \n     well. Last summer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     General Joseph Dunford said that Russia poses an \n     ``existential'' threat to the United States, calling \n     Russia's actions ``nothing short of alarming.''\n\n  The list goes on and on about other things. But here is a very \nimportant point from these experts:\n\n       For years, Russia has helped fund its growing military with \n     capital derived from the sale of rocket engines to the United \n     States. Russian officials have referred to U.S. purchases of \n     these engines as ``free money'' for modernizing its missile \n     sector, and have frequently leveraged the Department of \n     Defense's dependence on these engines as a bargaining chip in \n     unrelated foreign policy disputes.\n\n  They go on to talk about the Defense authorization bill for the last \n2 years passing new legislation to address this national security \nchallenge. And they say:\n\n       Under a proposed congressional transition plan, the Russian \n     engine would be phased out no earlier than 2020.\n       We believe this proposed policy is wise and would prevent \n     unnecessary expenditures on Russian-made rocket engines in \n     support of Russia's industrial base. This policy guarantees \n     assured access to space by increasing reliance on existing, \n     American-made systems, providing an eminently reasonable \n     solution to ending Russia's involvement in the Department of \n     Defense's space launch program.\n\n  I want to tell my colleagues that this comes from both sides--\nRepublican and Democrat administrations--and from some of the most \nreliable intelligence people we have ever had serve our country: Leon \nPanetta, General Hayden, Michael Morell, Michael Rogers,\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nAdmiral Stavridis. I have heard from many others in the same way.\n  So here we are with a clear influence of ULA, which is Lockheed and \nBoeing--two of the largest defense industries in America with, guess \nwhat, their launches in Alabama and, guess what, their headquarters in \nIllinois. Guess who is leading the charge to continuing to place \nbasically unending dependence on Russian rockets. Guess who. You can \ndraw your own conclusion.\n  So let me go on. Let's talk about these individuals for a minute. I \nwould like to discuss how continuing to buy these RD-180 engines would \nhave us do business with a Russian Government and directly enrich \nPutin's closest friends who are a group of corrupt cronies and \ngovernment apparatchiks, including persons the United States and the \nEuropean Union have sanctioned in relation to Russia's invasion of \nUkraine and the annexation of Crimea.\n  With the swift stroke of a pen just a few days ago, on May 12, 2016, \nPutin signed a decree that reorganized Russia's entire Russian space \nindustry and consolidated all of its assets under a massive ``state \ncorporation'' called Roscosmos. Under Putin's directive, Roscosmos \nswallows up these other outfits--the Russian launch company that \nsupplies the rockets to, guess who, United Launch Alliance. This new \nstate-owned space corruption, in fact, swallows up dozens of other \nRussian companies.\n  To be clear, Roscosmos is not a privately owned corporation \nfacilitating business with the Russian Government. It is the Russian \nGovernment. As a state corporation, it furthers state policy and is \ncontrolled by apparatchiks who have agency authority from Putin to do \nhis bidding. So there should be no confusion; Roscosmos is part of the \nvery same military industrial base that conducts bloody operations in \nUkraine and Syria.\n  Under Roscosmos, Putin is no longer using Russian shell companies or \noffshore corporations to sell Russian rocket engines to line the \npockets of his most trusted friends. Roscosmos is directly controlled \nby many of them. If you look at their highest level, the individuals \nwho control the company look like a who's who of U.S. sanctions--\nofficers and directors who have been individually sanctioned by the \nUnited States or the European Union or control other companies that \nhave been similarly sanctioned in connection with Russia's invasion of \nUkraine.\n  Let's start with Sergey Chemezov. There he is. Sergey Chemezov is the \nman at the very top of this chart. Chemezov is the most influential \nmember of the Roscosmos supervisory board and appears to finance \noperations of Roscosmos through a bank he controls as part of his \ngiant, state-owned defense corporation, Rostec.\n  As CEO of Rostec, Chemezov controls roughly two-thirds of Russia's \ndefense sector and employs more than 900,000 people, which is \napproximately 1.2 percent of the whole Russian workforce. This has led \nsome in the Russian government to refer to him as the ``shadow defense \nindustry minister.''\n  More importantly, Sergey Chemezov is a former KGB agent who was \nstationed with Putin in Communist East Germany during the 1980s. The \ntwo lived together in an apartment complex in Dresden. Chemezov is said \nto be Putin's KGB mentor. Chemezov acknowledges that his ties to Putin \ngave him a competitive business advantage, but the truth is that his \nmeteoric rise was fueled by a series of Kremlin-backed takeovers of \nprominent Russian companies, and now Roscosmos has been added to the \nlist. Both Chemezov and his state-owned defense corporation Rostec are \ntargeted by U.S. sanctions. I repeat, they and his company are targeted \nby U.S. sanctions, as is the Rostec-owned bank Novikombank, which \nfinances Roscosmos's operations.\n\n  Next in the organizational chart we have Igor Komarov, who will serve \nas Roscosmos' chief executive officer. He has been sanctioned by the \nEuropean Union. Recently, he was the head of Russia's largest car \nmanufacturer. This car manufacturer also happened to be taken over by \nChemezov's behemoth defense corporation Rostec, and Chemezov later \nserved on the company's board as both chairman and deputy chairman. \nKomarov is Chemezov's protege.\n  To put it simply, Chemezov handpicked Komarov--a man with little or \nno experience in the space industry--to run Roscosmos. Chemezov \nleveraged his position as CEO of Rostec and his access to Putin to make \nsure that Roscosmos's new head is someone he can control. This gives \nChemezov the ability to manage Roscosmos from the shadows, much as he \nhas done with Russia's defense industry. Think of Komarov's \nrelationship to Chemezov as Dmitry Medvedev's relationship to Putin.\n  Finally, we have Dmitry Rogozin. Yet another target of U.S. \nsanctions, Rogozin has served as Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian \nFederation and as the so-called space czar since 2011. Remember, he has \nbeen sanctioned by the United States of America; he is now the space \nczar in Russia. He is also the chairman of Roscosmos's board of \ndirectors and has overseen the transition of Roscosmos into its new \nform, a massive state-owned corporation.\n  Not surprisingly, during his tenure, Rogozin has been part of a \nperiod of unprecedented corruption. He has publicly acknowledged ``a \nsystemic crisis from which the space agency is yet to emerge.'' He also \nattributes recent financial scandals and criminal activities to a \n``moral decline of space industry managers.'' I want to emphasize this. \nThese are Rogozin's words, not mine. The Russian space czar, who has \noverseen the restructuring of Roscosmos, publicly admits that \nindividuals running the state-owned corporation are hopelessly and \nfatally corrupt.\n  In May 2015, the Russian Audit Chamber reported that in fiscal year \n2014 alone, Roscosmos misallocated approximately $1.8 billion. In fact, \nthe money wasn't misallocated; it simply disappeared. The report cited \ngross financial violations, such as improper use of funds, misuse of \nappropriated funds, and violations in financial reporting methods. The \nnumber was so high that Russian auditors at first thought they must be \nwrong. They finally concluded that ``[the original Roscosmos \norganization] is among the biggest and least disciplined [of government \nagencies] that blatantly ignore regulatory requirements and best \npractices in state procurement orders.'' And this is from Russia's own \ninternal government watchdog, the rough equivalent of the U.S. \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO.\n  My friends, as conscientious Americans, we simply cannot continue to \ndo business with this group of self-admitted swindlers and crooks. We \ncannot support a Russian space agency that is financed by a sanctioned \nRussian bank, owned by a sanctioned Russian defense company, and \ncontrolled by a sanctioned Russian CEO who also happens to be a former \nKGB agent and close personal friend of Vladimir Putin's.\n  It is time we found the moral courage to end our reckless dependency \non Russian technology before the Russian Government ends it for us. \nRogozin has already threatened to cut off our access to space. Just \nlast year, he declared:\n\n       We are not going to deliver the RD-180 engines if the \n     United States will use them for non-civil purposes. We also \n     may discontinue servicing the engines that were already \n     delivered to the United States.\n\n  Despite these threats, we still manage to funnel hundreds of millions \nof dollars to Chemezov, Komarov, Rogozin, and countless other Russian \nstooges just like them. We continue to supply Vladimir Putin with the \nvery capital he needs to wage his deadly shadow war in Europe and the \nMiddle East. We don't need to buy any more engines from Russia. The \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Director \nof National Intelligence have all testified to that point before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. Former Secretary of Defense and \nDirector of the CIA Leon Panetta, former CIA Director and NSA Director \nMichael Hayden, former Deputy CIA Director Mike Morell, and others, \nincluding the former European Command commander and others, all endorse \nour efforts in this bill to responsibly end our reliance on Russian \nrocket engines.\n  I am here to tell you that we are subsidizing the Russian military \nindustrial complex at the expense of our own national interests, and we \nmust end this dangerous addiction before it is too late.\n  So here we are, my friends, with a blatant, incredible story of \npeople who\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nare so involved in the Russian invasion of Ukraine that they were \nsanctioned. They were sanctioned by the United States of America and \nother countries. They are now in charge of the Russian rocket program. \nThey are the ones into whose pockets go the hundreds of millions of \ndollars we spend on these Russian rockets.\n  We have this incredible alliance of Boeing and United that is \nunbelievable in this consortium of the two biggest defense industries \nin America that has such control over this body that we will continue \nto subsidize and pay hundreds of millions of American dollars to \ncorrupt crooks--people and money that will fuel Putin's activities. And \nwe all know that his indiscriminate bombing in Syria is slaughtering \nthousands of innocent people and driving thousands into refugee \nsituations. It is Vladimir Putin who is bombing the people we train and \nequip.\n  By the way, as we might have seen in the last couple of days, Bashar \nal-Assad has said that there is going to be no peace, that he is going \nto regain control of the entire country of Syria, making a farce and a \njoke out of the so-called ceasefire that was orchestrated by our \nSecretary of State, who went to Moscow on bended knee to beg his buddy \nLavrov to agree to a ceasefire that really never existed.\n  The point is, we do have a supply of rocket engines. Admittedly, they \nare more expensive. I will freely admit that. But we also have a number \nof other corporations--not just SpaceX but Blue Origin, and there are a \nnumber of others--that are developing rocket engines. If we look at \nwhat SpaceX just did, they were able to land a rocket for the first \ntime so it is reusable. Their space launch--they were reusing it. There \nwill be other breakthroughs thanks to these entrepreneurs like Elon \nMusk and Jeff Bezos and others who are taking charge, when this old \nconsortium, this old military industrial complex called ULA, is running \nthings and we are paying them $800 million a year to do nothing but \nstay in business.\n  My friends, I would also point out one other aspect of this. The \nAppropriations Committee's job is to appropriate. It is the authorizing \ncommittee that does the authorizing. What was in the appropriations \nbill in numerous places was a gross violation of the area of \nresponsibility of the authorizing committee.\n  I don't know exactly what we can do about this creeping policymaking \non the part of the appropriators, but I hope that at some point--the \nmajority on both sides are not members of the Appropriations Committee, \nbut they are members of various authorizing committees. Sooner or \nlater, they are going to get tired of authorizing certain programs and \nauthorizing after debate and hearings and all the things that--for \nexample, I guarantee you that the Senate Armed Services Committee has \nhad 10 times the number of hearings and debates and amendments and \nmarkups that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has had. I \nguarantee you that. So they take it upon themselves on an issue such as \nthis to put in their own version, which is obviously controlled by \nAlabama and Illinois.\n  So that is what is wrong with this system. That is what is wrong with \nthis body. That is what is wrong. And the American people are beginning \nto figure it out, and they don't like it, and they shouldn't like it.\n  I pointed out yesterday--and lost a vote--that in 1992 we spent $20 \nmillion on medical research out of the Defense appropriations, out of \nAmerican tax dollars. Today, it is $1 billion worth of medical \nresearch, most of which has nothing to do with the men and women who \nare serving this country.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Colorado. I am sure he may \neven know these individuals. I would like for him to meet them, because \nthey are crooks. They are crooks, they are corrupt, and they are \nbutchers. So I would like for him to meet them as he continues to \nadvocate for the status quo, which is a totally unacceptable \nexpenditure of American tax dollars which, indeed, are used to kill \nAmericans. That is a heavy responsibility, I would say to my new friend \nin the Senate, the Senator from Colorado. That is a heavy \nresponsibility. These guys are killing people, and we are subsidizing \nthese murderers and thugs. That is not something I would be proud of.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleague \nfrom Arizona. The service he has given to this country and the \nsacrifices he has endured are tremendous, and nobody can underestimate \nwhat he has done for this Nation.\n  I don't think anybody here would ever think they have done that in \nwhatever legislative action they take. So while we may disagree on \ncertain issues or agree with a different course of action, I believe \neverybody wants to do what is best for their Nation.\n  When it comes to this particular issue of having access to space, \nhaving reliable access to space, maintaining competition in our \nindustry so that we can provide the best value and cost savings to the \nAmerican taxpayer while achieving the level of security we need, that \nis where I believe this debate is rightfully focused, and that is also \nwhere the debate from our own Department of Defense is focused.\n  Nobody in this Chamber wants to continue the status quo. In fact, I \nhave filed an amendment with Senators Nelson, Bennet, Hatch, Inhofe, \nand Sessions--a number of people who believe we should end the status \nquo and go in a new direction. In fact, that is what this entire debate \nis about, to make sure we no longer have to rely on the rocket as we do \ntoday. But we cannot leave the security of this country blind to \ncapacities that we would lose if we pursued the direction of the \nDefense Authorization Act as it is written today, because if we pass \nthis legislation, there are assets that will protect the people of this \ncountry that we may not be able to put into space. And if we do, in \nthis bill is language that will cost up to $1.5 billion because that is \nwhat this bill will force to be done--legislation that will result in a \n$1.5 billion to $5 billion tax increase.\n  I just supported an amendment to add dollars to our defense and \nsecurity because I believe it is important that the men and women of \nthis country have the tools and the resources they need to protect and \ndefend themselves. I supported that--billions of new dollars. Yet the \nactions under this bill would cost the American taxpayers somewhere \nbetween $1.5 billion and $5 billion in more money. While we are adding \nmore money, we are taking it away with passage of this act, while \nreducing reliability, reducing access to space, and reducing \ncompetition. I believe as organizations like the Tea Party Patriots, \norganizations like AEI, organizations across the country that believe \nwe can do better, that we should keep competition, that we should keep \nreliability--those are the things we believe in.\n\n  Let me read comments by Defense Secretary Ash Carter, the Secretary \nof Defense, who is truly interested in making sure we protect the \npeople of this Nation from bad actors:\n\n       We have to have assured access to space, so we have to have \n     a way to launch our national security payloads into space so \n     our country's security depends on that. One way to do that \n     which is reflected in our budget is to continue to use the \n     Atlas booster including a limited, but continuing number of \n     RD-180 engines.\n\n  Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James on January 27, 2016:\n\n       Maintaining at least two of the existing systems until at \n     least two launch providers are available will be necessary to \n     protect our Nation's assured access to space.\n\n  This is coming from somebody who believes we need to protect this \ncountry and the people of this country from bad actors. She goes on to \nsay:\n\n       As we move forward, we respectfully request this committee \n     allow the Department the flexibility to develop and acquire \n     the launch capabilities our warfighters and Intelligence \n     Community need.\n\n  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, William LaPlante, July 16, \n2015:\n\n       We believe authorization to use up to 18 RD-180 engines in \n     the competitive procurement and award of launch service \n     contracts through Fiscal Year 2022 is a reasonable starting \n     point to mitigate the risk associated with assured access to \n     space and enable competition.\n\n  This is somebody who is interested in protecting the people of this \ncountry from bad actors--people who would do harm, people who would do \nevil acts to this country and our allies.\n  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Katrina McFarland, \nJune\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n26, 2015, talks about the need for this program.\n  Intelligence Director James Clapper and Defense Secretary Ash Carter \non May 11, 2015, together said:\n\n       We are working diligently to transition from the Russian-\n     made RD-180 rocket engine onto domestically sourced \n     propulsion capabilities, but are concerned that section 1608 \n     presents significant challenges to doing so while maintaining \n     assured access to space.\n\n  They care about the security of this Nation. They care about the \nsecure future of this Nation.\n  In fact, just a few days ago, in an article from former General \nShelton, four-star commander in the U.S. Air Force, he talked about the \nneed to move away from these rockets to transition to an American-made \nrocket but in the meantime not allow our capacity, our capability, or \nour competition to suffer.\n  Here is what it would cost. This is what it would cost. Here is the \ngraph. This is what the American taxpayers would be paying--35 percent \nmore, $1.5 billion to a $5 billion increase in spending if the language \nof the bill, as it is written today, goes into law. That is not some \nstaffer in the cloak of darkness in the mailroom trying to come up with \nfigures. That is what the experts agree will happen.\n  While this body is talking about there is not enough money to fund \ndefense, while this body is voting on amendments to increase spending \non defense, the same policies enshrined in this bill would cost up to \n$5 billion more. If we truly want to make sure we have the resources \nneeded to defend this country, let's not self-inflict $5 billion worth \nof harm when we all agree to transition to an American-made system. \nLet's do so in a way that relies on the ability to do what is right \nwith competition, with reliability, instead of transitioning to a \nsystem that can't even reach 60 percent of projected NSS needs--\nnational security space mission needs--unless you use a 35 percent more \nexpensive rocket.\n  General Shelton believes we should keep this rocket--a five-star \ngeneral in the U.S. Air Force, Russian rocket engines are essential for \nnow. General Shelton begins: ``The U.S. Senate is debating the 2017 \nNational Defense Authorization Act.'' An amendment proposed ``would \nprovide relief'' from restrictions that we are facing right now, \n``recognizing that the current draft legislation would significantly \nharm the national security space program.''\n  A four-star general in service to our Nation has said that if we \ndon't change the bill as it is written, it would significantly harm the \nnational security space program. General Shelton is the former \ncommander of Air Force Space Command. I think he knows what he is \ntalking about. I think he is an expert.\n  I could read more quotes from others. The NASA Administrator believes \nthat without this language, we are going to increase costs in NASA, not \njust the Department of Defense, and we are going to hurt our ability to \naccess space and access launches.\n  You talk to the intel communities--intel communities that believe \nthey would lose the capacity to launch satellites that provide missile \nlaunch detection that can protect our people and our country.\n  Yes, let's make sure we transition, yes, let's make sure we change \nthe status quo, but let's do it in a way that is smart, good policy, \nand protects the interests of the American people. That is what this \namendment is about, and we can all agree to that.\n  Mr. President, I would like to change topics quickly, if I could.\n\n\n               Marion Konishi and Camp Amache Pilgrimage\n\n  Mr. President, just a couple of weeks ago in Colorado, Channel 9 News \nin Denver reported that a bus was going to leave Denver to make a 4-\nhour drive to a place called Amache. It is where some 7,000 people \nlived, worked, and called home during much of World War II. Ten weeks \nafter the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt \nsigned Executive Order 996, creating internment camps for people of \nJapanese descent. One of those camps was in Colorado.\n  Just a couple of weeks ago marked the 40th year that Japanese \nAmericans have made a formal pilgrimage to that camp. Those 7,000 \npeople lived in barracks, formed their own schools, planted gardens, \nand had beauty parlors and Boy Scout troops. Their sons volunteered to \nfight and die for the country that imprisoned their parents. Many of \nthe visitors to the camp were elderly, in their nineties. There were \nsome college students who made the visit as well, but amongst the \npeople who visited Camp Amache just a couple of weeks ago was the \nvaledictorian of the 1943 Amache Senior High School class. Her name is \nMarion Konishi. It was her first visit to Camp Amache since she left \nthe camp more than 70 years ago. She was a valedictorian, and 73 years \nago she gave a speech as the head of her class. Just a few weeks ago, \nshe returned to Camp Amache where she reread that speech again for the \nfirst time.\n  I thought I would read excerpts of that speech today, her speech \ntitled ``America, Our Hope is Anew,'' June 25, 1943.\n\n       One and a half years ago I knew only one America--an \n     America that gave me an equal chance in the struggle for \n     life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If I were asked \n     then--``What does America mean to you?''--I would answer \n     without any hesitation and with all sincerity--``America \n     means freedom, equality, security, and justice.''\n       The other night while I was preparing for this speech, I \n     asked myself this same question--``What does America mean to \n     you?'' I hesitated--I was not sure of my answer. I wondered \n     if America still means and will mean freedom, equality, \n     security, and justice when some of its citizens were \n     segregated, discriminated against, and treated so unfairly. I \n     knew I was not the only American seeking an answer.\n       Then I remembered that old saying--all the answers to the \n     future will be found in the past for all men. So unmindful of \n     the searchlights reflecting in my windows, I sat down and \n     tried to recall all the things that were taught to me in my \n     history, sociology, and American life classes. This is what I \n     remembered.\n       America was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, and for \n     167 years it has been held as the hope, the only hope, for \n     the common man. America has guaranteed to each and all, \n     native and everyone foreign, the right to build a home, to \n     earn a livelihood, to worship, think, speak, and act as he \n     pleased--as a free man equal to every other man.\n       Every revolution within the last 167 years which had for \n     its aim more freedom was based on her constitution. No cry \n     from an oppressed people has ever gone unanswered by her. \n     America froze, shoeless in the snow at Valley Forge, and \n     battled for her life at Gettysburg. She gave the world its \n     greatest symbols of democracy: George Washington, who freed \n     her from tyranny; Thomas Jefferson, who defined her \n     democratic course; and Abraham Lincoln, who saved her and \n     renewed her faith.\n       Sometimes America failed and suffered. Sometimes she made \n     mistakes, great mistakes, but she always admitted them and \n     tried to rectify all the injustice that flowed from them. . . \n     . Her history is full of errors but with each mistake she has \n     learned and has marched forward onward toward a goal of \n     security and peace and a society of free men where the \n     understanding that all men are created equal, an \n     understanding that all men whatever their race, color, or \n     religion be given an equal opportunity to save themselves and \n     each other according to their needs and abilities.\n       I was once again at my desk. True, I was just as much \n     embittered as any other evacuee. But I had found in the past \n     the answer to my question. I had also found my faith in \n     America--faith in the America that is still alive in the \n     hearts, minds, and consciences of true Americans today--faith \n     in the American sportsmanship and attitude of fair play that \n     will judge citizenship and patriotism on the basis of actions \n     and achievements and not on the basis of physical \n     characteristics.\n       Can we the graduating class of Amache Senior High School, \n     still believe that America means freedom, equality, security, \n     and justice? Do I believe this? Do my classmates believe \n     this? Yes, with all our hearts, because in that faith, in \n     that hope, is my future, our future, and the world's future.\n\n  To Marion Konishi, today Marion Kobukata, her husband Kenneth, who \nserved in the 442nd, thank you for sharing these words 73 years later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, you have a choice here. You can believe \nthe Senator from Colorado where there is substantial presence of ULA--\nan outfit that makes a lot of money--or you can believe Leon Panetta, \nformer Secretary of Defense, former Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency; Gen. Michael Hayden, former Director of the CIA, \nformer Director of the National Security Agency; Michael Morrell, \nformer Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency; Michael Rogers, former chairman of the House Select Committee \non Intelligence; ADM James Stavridis, and there are many more. All of \nthem are saying they support what I am trying to do. It is interesting \nthat the\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\nSenator from Colorado would completely ignore the view and position of \nthe most respected people in America.\n  I respect the Senator from Colorado. I do not compare his credentials \nto that of the former Secretary of Defense. By the way, Americans for \nTax Reform is in opposition to the proposal to lift the ban on the \nrocket engines. They point out America has spent over $6 billion--$1 \nbillion that they have spent on this.\n  Also, there was an interesting incident that happened maybe a couple \nof months ago where an individual who is an executive from this outfit \ncalled ULA made a speech that had a lot of interesting comments in \nit. He obviously didn't know that it was being recorded. The \ninteresting thing is that this man, Brett Tobey, vice president of \nengineering for ULA, said during a lecture at the University of \nColorado in Boulder, CO, last week that the Department of Defense had \n``bent over backwards to lean the field to ULA's advantage in a \ncompetition with new market entrant SpaceX.'' An executive of ULA \nalleges that the Defense Department bent over backwards to lean the \nfield in favor of ULA. If that isn't a graphic example of what is going \non here, then I don't know what is. He also said that because of the \nSpaceX competition, they were going to have to make cuts in their \nworkforce and change the way they do business. For all of these years \nthey have not had any competition, but the Defense Department has bent \nover backwards to lean the field to ULA's advantage in a competition \nwith the new market entrant Space Exploration Technologies.\n\n  I wish to remind the Chair that about 10 years ago there was an idea \nfor Boeing to build a new tanker. It smelled very bad. I, my staff, and \nothers pursued it, and it ended up with executives from Boeing going to \njail. Unfortunately, this is another one of those examples that \ncontributes to the profound cynicism of the American people about how \ntheir money is spent.\n  My colleagues have a choice. They can believe the Senator from \nColorado, and I am sure that the Senator from Illinois will come to the \nfloor because that is where Boeing is headquartered. They will talk \nabout all of these things, and then you can compare that with Leon \nPanetta--probably one of the most respected men in America and one of \nthe great Secretaries of Defense--General Hayden, Michael Morell, \nMichael Rogers, James Stavridis, and all of these people who have no \ndog in this fight. They don't have anything based in their State that \nwould affect their State's economy. They have a wealth of experience. I \nwould imagine there is at least a century worth of experience in \ndefense amongst these individuals. In no way do I disparage the \nexperience of the Senator from Colorado, but I will match these guys \nagainst his any day of the week. They have no dog in this fight nor do \nthey have a corporation based in their State.\n  After all of these years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \nknow when something smells bad, just as I did with the Boeing tanker, \nand people ended up in jail. This stinks to high heaven.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I will continue to state the number of \npeople who believe it is important that we approach this from the \nstandpoint of an amendment that Senator Nelson and I have filed, along \nwith a bipartisan group of legislators.\n  I will begin with Gen. Mark Welsh, Air Force Chief of Staff. This is \ntestimony before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee in \n2015.\n\n       [V]irtually everybody agrees that we would like to, as the \n     United States of America, not be so reliant on a Russian \n     engine going forward into the future. . . . But the question \n     is how to do it and when will we be ready, because we don't \n     want to cut off our nose to spite our face. . . . all of the \n     technical experts with whom I've consulted tell me this is \n     not a one or two or three-year deal. You're looking at maybe \n     six or seven years to develop an engine and another year or \n     two beyond that to be able to integrate.\n\n  Of course, our amendment would cut it off at 2022 because we believe \nthat is the transition we would need in order to provide the kind of \nsecurity that the people of this country expect.\n  Let me show some of the national security missions that will be \ndelayed if we don't have the ability to use all of the components of \nour current rocket set today.\n  The space-based infrared system warning satellites that are designed \nfor ballistic missile detection from anywhere in the world, \nparticularly countries like North Korea, would be delayed. I had the \nopportunity to go to South Korea just last week where I met with \nGeneral Brooks who talked about the need for us to provide more \nintelligence over North Korea. The day we were there, North Korea once \nagain tried to launch a ballistic missile. Thankfully it failed, but \nwhat happens if it doesn't fail? Are we going to be able to have the \nspace-based infrared system in place that we need to be able to protect \nthe people of this country? Because if they succeed and we don't know, \nthat is catastrophic.\n  The Mobile User Objective System and Advanced Extremely High \nFrequency satellite system designed to deliver vital communications \ncapabilities to our armed services around the world would both be \ndelayed. According to a letter dated May 23 from the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense--again somebody who is very much interested in the future \nand current security of this country--``losing/delaying the capability \nto place position and navigation, communication, missile warning, \nnuclear detection, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance \nsatellites in orbit would be significant.''\n  The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration said before the Senate when asked about what would \nhappen with the loss of these rockets: They are counting on these \nrockets to be able to get the number of engines that would satisfy the \nrequirements for NASA to fly the Dream Chaser when it comes around in \n2019.\n  The Dream Chaser already has a resupply service contract for the \nInternational Space Station. It is designed to fly on top of one of \nthese rockets. If we were to change that, it would no longer have that \nrocket available, and they would undergo significant cost and delay in \ntrying to retrofit the rocket just like the Orion space program.\n  We can talk about more experts. In April of 2015, the Under Secretary \nof Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics said:\n\n       There's going to be a period of time where we would like to \n     have the option, possibly, of using RD-180s if necessary. \n     There are much more expensive options available to us but we \n     prefer not to go that way.\n\n  We have shown the chart of how expensive it would be, and now I want \nto show one final chart.\n  When we talk about how much money is being spent on rocket engines, I \nwould like to point out this chart. If we are concerned about cronies \nfrom Russia, then let's talk about other areas where we are importing \nfrom Russia.\n  This is from 2013. If you look at where we are, engines and motors \nrepresent .32 percent of this pie chart. That is how much money is \nbeing spent on importing engines and motors from Russia. Let's look at \nsomething like nickel. Nickel is .59 percent of our imports from \nRussia. Arms and ammunition are .56 percent, more than engines and \nmotors. Here is an interesting one. Fish, crustaceans, and aquatic \ninvertebrates are 1.2 percent of our imports from Russia. Engines and \nmotors represent only .32 percent of that.\n  We are going to continue to have a very good debate in this body. I \nthink Members can come at this from a different approach, and I look \nforward to working out a solution that all Members can be proud that we \nhave done what is best for our country, our taxpayers, and our \nsecurity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know the Senator from Utah is waiting.\n  We have a choice: Believe those who have a vested interest in \ncontinuing this purchase of Russian rocket engines or believe some of \nthe most respected people in America who say we don't need to do it. \nThat is what the choice is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss and urge my \ncolleagues to support amendment No. 4448, the due process guarantee \namendment.\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\n  This amendment addresses a little known problem that I believe most \nAmericans would be shocked to discover even exists. Under current law, \nthe Federal Government has proclaimed the power--has arrogated to \nitself the power to detain indefinitely, without charge or trial, U.S. \ncitizens and lawful, permanent residents who are apprehended on \nAmerican soil.\n  Let that sink in for just a minute. If you are a U.S. citizen or a \nU.S. green card holder and you are arrested on American soil because \nyou are suspected of supporting a terrorist group or other enemy of the \nUnited States, the Federal Government has claimed the power to detain \nyou indefinitely without formally charging you or without offering you \na trial.\n  I am not talking about American citizens who travel to foreign lands \nto take up arms against the United States military and are captured on \nthe battlefield. I am talking about U.S. citizens who are apprehended \nright here in the United States of America.\n  Under current law, even they can be imprisoned for an unspecified--in \nfact, unlimited--period of time without ever being charged and without \nthe benefit of a jury trial to which they are entitled.\n  You don't need to be a defense attorney to recognize what an outrage \nthis is. Arresting U.S. citizens on American soil and then detaining \nthem indefinitely without charges or a trial are obvious deviations \nfrom the constitutional right to due process of law.\n  The last time the Federal Government exercised such power and did so \nwithout congressional authorization was during the internment of \nJapanese Americans during World War II. Congress responded by passing a \nlaw to prevent it from happening again. Of course, such legal \nprotection should not need to be codified into Federal statute in the \nfirst place, but they did it anyway.\n  The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution states in no uncertain terms \nthat no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without \ndue process of law. Then again, as James Madison reminded us, if men \nwere angels, no government would be necessary.\n  In the wake of World War II, Congress passed and President Nixon \nsigned the Nondetention Act of 1971, which states: ``No citizen shall \nbe imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except \npursuant to an Act of Congress.'' Those last few words are absolutely \ncrucial: ``except pursuant to an Act of Congress.'' The Nondetention \nAct of 1971 recognized, as I believe most Americans do, that in some \ncases--in some grave, treacherous, unfortunate cases--indefinite \ndetention of U.S. citizens may, in the eyes of some, be deemed \nnecessary, but the point is that the Federal Government does not \ninherently possess the power of indefinite detention. The extent to \nwhich such power can even be said to exist within our constitutional \nframework at all is a question that many of us would regard as at least \ndebatable.\n  Certainly only an act of Congress, such as an authorization for the \nuse of military force, or AUMF, or perhaps a declaration of war can \ngive the Federal Government that power. Fast forward 40 years, and this \nimportant legal protection has eroded.\n  In 2011, 40 years after the passage of the Nondetention Act of 1971, \nCongress passed its annual National Defense Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 2012, the predecessor of the bill that we are considering \ntoday. In that version of the NDAA, there was a provision, section \n1021, giving the Federal Government the power to detain U.S. citizens \nindefinitely without trial, even those who were apprehended on American \nsoil. It may sound as though section 1021 meets the ``Act of Congress'' \nthreshold established by the Nondetention Act of 1971, but importantly \nit does not. It does no such thing. Here is why: The language of \nsection 1021 merely presumes that the 2001 AUMF gives the Federal \nGovernment the right to detain U.S. citizens indefinitely without \nhaving to prove anything, even though an explicit grant of such power \nappears nowhere at all in the 2001 AUMF.\n  My amendment would resolve this problem. In clear and straightforward \nlanguage, my amendment clarifies that a general authorization to use \nmilitary force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority on its \nown, shall not be construed to authorize the imprisonment or detention \nwithout charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent resident of \nthe United States apprehended in the United States. This means that if \nCongress believes it is necessary to have the power to indefinitely \ndetain U.S. citizens who are captured in the United States, then \nCongress must expressly say so in any authorization it passes.\n  My amendment recognizes that the due process protections of U.S. \ncitizens are far too important to leave up to implied legal \ncontemplation.\n  The 2001 AUMF does not expressly state that the Federal Government \nhas the power to indefinitely detain U.S. citizens who were apprehended \non American soil. It just doesn't say it. You can look at the 2001 AUMF \nand you will not find that. For those who believe it is somehow in the \nnational security interests of the United States for the Federal \nGovernment to have that power, they should file an amendment to the \nAUMF that says so explicitly, and then we can see what the American \npeople think and we can find out, just as importantly, what their \nelected representatives in the House and in the Senate think, or they \ncan file an entirely new AUMF that expressly provides such authority.\n  This amendment--the one I am discussing today--should not be \ncontroversial. In fact, in 2012--just a year after the initial \noffending provision that I described a moment ago was passed--the \nSenate passed this amendment with 67 votes, in large part thanks to the \ntireless efforts of my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, who today joins me as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  Unfortunately, the due process guarantee amendment was stripped from \nthat version of the NDAA passed in 2012 for 2013 during the conference \nprocess. At the time, some opponents of the amendment were under the \nimpression that it would extend due process provisions to citizens \noutside of the United States, but that is undeniably false. The due \nprocess guarantee amendment applies only to U.S. citizens and lawful \npermanent residents who are apprehended on U.S. soil.\n  It has been 4 years since that misunderstanding prevented Congress \nfrom passing this commonsense bipartisan reform. That is more than \nenough time for this institution to gain clarity on what this amendment \ndoes do and, just as importantly, on what this amendment does not do. \nSo it is time that we finally pass this amendment, and I urge each of \nmy colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEE. Yes.\n  Mr. PAUL. Four years ago we passed legislation under the Defense \nauthorization that allows the American Government to detain an American \ncitizen without a trial. Think about that. One of our basic rights, one \nof our most important rights is the right to a trial, to be \nrepresented, to have a jury of our peers.\n  You say: Well, it will never be used. Well, President Obama \nrecognized this. He said: This is a terrible power, and I promise never \nto use it. Any power that is so terrible that a President says he is \nnot going to use it should not be on the books.\n  As the Senator from Utah said, it is not about having laws that \nrequire angels to be in charge of your government. Someday there will \nbe someone in charge of the government who makes a grievous mistake, \nlike rounding up the Japanese. So we have to be very careful about \ngiving power to our government. That is what the challenge is here.\n  Many will say: Well, we are at war, and when at war you have to have \nthe law of war.\n  What is the law of war also known as? Martial law. But this is a war \nthat does not seem to have an end. They are not asking for a 1- or 2-\nyear period in which there won't be trials; they are asking you to \nrelinquish your right to trial for a war that may have no end.\n  I want you to imagine this. Who could these enemy combatants be who \nmay not get trials? Imagine you are an Arab-American in Dearborn, MI, \nand you send an email to someone overseas. Maybe that person is a bad \nperson and maybe there is a connection, but shouldn't a person in \nDearborn, MI,\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nhave a right to defend themselves in court and say: I was just sending \nan email to them and I said a few stupid things, but I am not a \nterrorist. Shouldn't they get the right to defend themselves?\n  We need to be very careful that, as we fight this long war, we don't \nwake up one day and say we won the war, but we lost what we stood for. \nWe lost the Bill of Rights. We lost it to our soldiers. I know soldiers \nwho lost two arms and a leg fighting for us, and they come back and say \nthey were fighting for the Bill of Rights. That is what this should be \nabout--protecting the Bill of Rights while they are gone.\n  So the question I have for my esteemed colleague is--some will say: \nWell, they get a hearing. They get a habeas hearing. They go before a \njudge. Isn't that due process?\n  Is a habeas hearing equivalent to due process?\n  Mr. LEE. No. No. Due process can include habeas, but someone might \nsay habeas corpus is the beginning of due process, not the end. \nSometimes it occurs at the beginning, sometimes at the end, but \nregardless of when in the process it occurs, a habeas proceeding does \nnot represent the sum total universe of what due process means.\n  You can't read the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments of the \nU.S. Constitution to see that what happened in the version of NDAA that \nwe passed in 2011 was an affront to the constitutional order. It was an \naberration.\n  We are not asking for anything drastic. All we are asking here is \nthat before the government takes this step--the type of drastic step \nyou are describing--that at minimum we require Congress to expressly \nauthorize that. Is that really too much?\n  For those who would say that we are at war, we are in danger--and I \nunderstand that. There are those who don't like our way of life. They \neven perhaps want to do us harm. For those who would say that we are at \nwar and we have to take that into account and consider that, my \nresponse is, OK, if that is the case, then let's at least do it the way \nwe are supposed to do it. Let's at least have that discussion rather \nthan doing it by subterfuge, rather than doing it under a cloud of \nuncertainty, rather than doing it by implication. We need to do so \nexpressly. That is all this amendment does.\n  Mr. PAUL. Let me clarify in a followup question. If an American \ncitizen goes to Syria and fights with ISIS and is captured on the \nbattlefield, this amendment would not mean they get a trial.\n  Mr. LEE. No.\n  Mr. PAUL. They could still be held as an enemy combatant.\n  Mr. LEE. That is correct. This wouldn't cover them at all because \nthat person is outside the United States. That person is captured on a \nbattlefield outside the United States. That person wouldn't be covered \nunder this amendment.\n  Mr. PAUL. Let's also be clear on what we are talking about. People \nwho have been defined as enemy combatants are not always holding a \nweapon. You can have a propagandist. We have had propagandists who have \nbeen killed overseas who were propagandists for the enemy. So it is \nconceivable that an American citizen could be exchanging information \nand saying something derogatory about us or something in favor of the \nenemy, and that could be considered to be--that person is now a \npropagandist.\n  My point is, shouldn't they have a day in court to determine the \nfacts and have representation as opposed to being plucked up and \nsaying: You are going to Guantanamo Bay for the rest of your life \nbecause you made some criticism, and now the state has deemed you an \nenemy.\n  Mr. LEE. That is absolutely right, and that is precisely why we need \nthese protections. That helps illustrate the slippery-slope nature of \nthis problem. And it also emphasizes why it is that there are some in \nour body who want to make sure this power exists in the government, \nthat we must pass legislation affirmatively making it so, expressly \nproviding that power rather than doing it indirectly. That is all our \namendment does.\n  This is indeed a slippery slope. If all you have to do to \nindefinitely detain someone without charge, without trial, suspending \ntheir rights under the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth amendments--if \nthat is all you have to do, is charge them in a certain way, then our \nconstitutional protections have become weakened, indeed, to a dangerous \ndegree.\n  Mr. PAUL. Is it currently true that this amendment is being blocked \nby one Senator from gaining a vote?\n  Mr. LEE. We are trying to get a vote. This got a vote in 2012. It \nreceived 67 votes from people of both parties, votes from some \nMembers--including at least one person whom you may be thinking of who \nhas objections to it now. We need this to get a vote. If we are voting \non other amendments, which we should be doing, this should get a vote. \nNobody has explained to me why this should not at a minimum receive a \nvote. If somebody doesn't like this, fine, let them vote against it. \nBut we should have a vote on this because this is relevant to the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It was the National Defense \nAuthorization Act passed in 2011 that was the vehicle for enacting this \ninto law.\n  Mr. PAUL. One concluding point I would make would be that we have \ntime in the Senate body to vote about which rockets we are going to \nuse, made in which State and in which country. Shouldn't we take time \nto vote about the abrogation or possible abrogation of the Bill of \nRights, of the right to a trial by jury?\n  I think this is an eminently important issue, should not be pushed \nunder the rug, and that no one should be afraid to take a stand. Not \neveryone will agree, but we should be allowed to take a stand on the \nSenate floor, openly debate, and have a vote on whether you will have \nyour right to trial by jury or whether we are going to abbreviate that \nright and say we are at war. But realize that if you think your rights \ncan be abbreviated in times of war, this is a war--that the people who \ntell you they are going to abbreviate your rights are also telling you \nthat this war has no end, that there is no conceivable end to this war, \nand that the diminishment of your liberty, the loss of your right to \ntrial by jury, will go on and on without end.\n  I wholeheartedly support the amendment by my fellow Senator from \nUtah, and I advocate for having a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. LEE. I agree.\n  I note the presence of my distinguished colleague from California, \nand I yield the floor so that she can address the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senators, and I thank the \nPresiding Officer.\n  I have listened to this debate, and I rise to urge my colleagues to \nallow a vote on this due process guarantee amendment.\n  Senator Lee has filed it, I am a cosponsor, and I am delighted to be \na cosponsor. We actually voted on an earlier version of this amendment \nin 2012, so this is nothing new. What Members may not recall is that it \npassed with 67 votes as an amendment to this bill for fiscal year 2013.\n  I would also note that thanks to then-Chairman Leahy, the bill on \nwhich this amendment is based had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee \non February 29, 2012.\n  So this bill has come before this body before. It got 67 votes, and \nit had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee 4 years ago. Unfortunately, \nthe amendment was taken out of the NDAA in conference that year.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will pass this amendment again this \nyear and that the House will support it so that the law will clearly \nprotect Americans in the United States from indefinite detention by \ntheir own government.\n  Members may say: Well, this isn't going to happen. We are not going \nto do this.\n  But we have done it. I remember as a small child going just south of \nSan Francisco to a racetrack called Tanforan. It was no longer a \nracetrack; it was a detention center for Japanese Americans during \nWorld War II, and there were hundreds of families housed there for \nyears against their will.\n  To prevent this from ever happening again, Congress passed and \nPresident Nixon signed into law the Non-Detention Act of 1971 which \nclearly states: ``No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained \nby the United States\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nexcept pursuant to an act of Congress.'' That sounds good, but it \ndidn't go far enough.\n  Despite the shameful history of the indefinite detention of Americans \nand the legal controversy since 9/11, some in the Senate have advocated \nfor the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens during debate on the \nDefense authorization bill in past years. These Members have argued \nthat the Supreme Court's plurality decision in the 2004 case of Hamdi \nv. Rumsfeld supports their view. However, the Hamdi case involved an \nAmerican captured by the United States military on the battlefield in \nAfghanistan. Yaser Esam Hamdi was a U.S. citizen who took up arms on \nbehalf of the Taliban. He was captured on the battlefield in \nAfghanistan, not on United States soil. That is the difference. While \nthe Supreme Court did effectively uphold Hamdi's military detention, \nthe Supreme Court did not accept the government's broad assertions of \nexecutive authority to detain citizens without charge or trial.\n\n  In fact, the Hamdi decision says clearly that it covers only \n``individuals falling into the limited category we are considering,'' \nand did not foreclose the possibility that indefinite detention of a \nU.S. citizen would raise a constitutional problem at a later date.\n  Since Hamdi was decided in 2004, decisions by the lower courts have \ncontributed to the legal ambiguity when it comes to the detention of \nU.S. citizens apprehended in our very own country. You can look at the \ncase of Jose Padilla. He is a U.S. citizen arrested in Chicago in 2002. \nPadilla was initially detained by the Bush administration under a \nmaterial witness warrant based on the 9/11 terrorist attacks and was \nlater designated as an enemy combatant who allegedly conspired with Al \nQaeda to carry out terrorist attacks, including a plot to detonate a \ndirty bomb inside our country.\n  Padilla was transferred to a military brig in South Carolina, where \nhe was detained for 3\\1/2\\ years while seeking his freedom by filing a \nwrit of habeas corpus in Federal court. Now, it is important to note \nthat Padilla was never charged with attempting to carry out the dirty \nbomb plot. Instead, he was released from military custody in November \n2005 and transferred to civilian Federal custody in Florida, where he \nwas indicted on other charges in Federal court related to terrorist \nplots overseas.\n  In a 2003 decision by the Second Circuit known as Padilla v. \nRumsfeld, the court of appeals held that the 2001 authorization for use \nof military force, which we call the AUMF, did not authorize Padilla's \nmilitary detention. The decision stated: ``We conclude that clear \nCongressional authorization is required for detentions of American \ncitizens on American soil, because 18 U.S.C. Section 4001(a), the Non-\nDetention Act, prohibits such detentions absent specific Congressional \nauthorization.''\n  So the Padilla case bounced back and forth from the Second Circuit up \nto the Supreme Court and then to the Fourth Circuit. The legality of \nhis military detention was never conclusively resolved. Thus there \nremains ambiguity about whether a congressional authorization for the \nuse of military force permits the indefinite detention of United States \ncitizens arrested on United States soil.\n  So let me say that 12 years--let me repeat, 12 years--after Padilla \nwas initially arrested and detained, he was finally sentenced to 21 \nyears in prison in 2014.\n  The simple point is that we can protect national security while also \nensuring that the constitutional due process rights of every American \ncaptured within the United States are protected.\n  That is what this amendment would do. Like the amendment that passed \nhere in 2012 with 67 votes on this floor, this amendment would prevent \nthe government from using a general authorization for the use of \nmilitary force to apprehend Americans at home and detain them without \ncharge or trial indefinitely. So no one could be picked up and not \ncharged and held indefinitely.\n  It states very simply in our legislation: ``A general authorization \nto use military force, a declaration of war, or any similar authority, \non its own, shall not be construed to authorize the imprisonment or \ndetention without charge or trial of a citizen or lawful permanent \nresident of the United States apprehended in the United States.''\n  The amendment also modifies the existing subsection (a) of the Non-\nDetention Act, so it covers lawful permanent residents of the United \nStates and ensures that any detention is consistent with the \nConstitution.\n  So new subsection (a) will read: ``No citizen or lawful permanent \nresident of the United States shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained \nby the United States except consistent with the Constitution and \npursuant to an Act of Congress that expressly authorizes such \nimprisonment or detention.''\n  Now, let me explain the impact of these changes to the law. First, \nthe U.S. Government will continue to be able to detain U.S. citizens or \nlawful permanent residents on a foreign battlefield pursuant to an \nauthorization to use military force, like what we passed after 9/11. \nThat AUMF provides the authority to detain Al Qaeda, ISIL, and \naffiliated terrorist fighters.\n  In other words, if the government needs to detain an enemy combatant \non a foreign battlefield under a post-9/11 congressional authorization \nto use force, that is not barred, even if the enemy combatant is, in \nfact, a U.S. citizen. Indeed, the Supreme Court held in Hamdi that the \nAUMF is ``explicit authorization'' for that limited kind of detention. \nSo the amendment does not disturb the Hamdi decision.\n  Second, when acting with respect to citizens or lawful permanent \nresidents apprehended at home, the amendment makes clear that a general \nauthorization for the use of military force does not authorize the \ndetention, without charge or trial, of citizens or green card holders \nlike Padilla, who are apprehended inside the United States. Instead, \nthey should be arrested and charged like other terrorists captured in \nthe United States.\n  Now, the simple point is that indefinite military detention of \nAmericans apprehended in the United States is not the American way and \nmust not be allowed. In the United States, the FBI and other law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies have proven time and again that \nthey are up to the challenge of detecting, stopping, arresting, and \nconvicting terrorists found on United States soil.\n  Our law enforcement personnel have successfully arrested, detained, \nand convicted literally hundreds of terrorists, both before and after \n9/11. Specifically, there were 580 terrorism-related convictions in the \nFederal criminal courts between 9/11 and the end of 2014. That is \naccording to the Department of Justice.\n  More recently, Federal prosecutors have charged 85 men and women \naround our country in connection with ISIL since March of 2014. \nSuspected terrorists can still be detained within the U.S. criminal \njustice system using at least the following four options: One, they can \nbe charged with a Federal or State crime and held. Two, some can be \nheld for violating immigration laws. Three, they can be held as a \nmaterial witness as part of a Federal grand jury proceeding. Or, four, \nthey can be detained under section 412 of the PATRIOT Act, which \nprovides that an alien may be detained for up to 6 months if their \nrelease ``will threaten the national security of the United States or \nthe safety of the community or any person.''\n  Simply put, there is no shortage of authority for U.S. law \nenforcement to take the necessary actions on our soil to protect the \nhomeland. Some may ask why this legislation protects green card holders \nas well as citizens. Others may ask why the bill does not protect all \npersons apprehended in the United States from indefinite military \ndetention.\n  Let me make clear that I would support providing the protections in \nthis amendment to all persons in the United States, but the question \ncomes: is there political support to expand it to cover others besides \nU.S. citizens and green card holders? We went through this in 2012, I \nbelieve, before the Presiding Officer was here. The overriding \nsituation is to prevent the Federal Government from moving in and \npicking up Americans and holding them without charge or trial, as was \ndone with Japanese Americans after World War II.\n  Finally, with the passage of this, we will close out that chapter \nonce and for all. So this is not about whether citizens apprehended in \nthe United States,\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\nlike Jose Padilla or others who would do us harm, should be captured, \ninterrogated, incarcerated, and severely punished. They should be to \nthe fullest extent the law allows, but not an innocent American picked \nup off the street and held without charge or trial--perhaps because of \nthe person's name or looks or heritage.\n  So what about how a future President might abuse his or her authority \nto indefinitely detain people militarily here in the United States? Our \nConstitution gives everyone in the United States basic due process \nrights. The Fifth Amendment provides that ``no person shall be deprived \nof life, liberty, or property without due process of law.'' This is a \nbasic tenet of our Constitution and our values.\n  People are entitled to notice of charges, to an opportunity to be \nheard, and to a fair proceeding before a neutral arbiter. In criminal \ncases, the accused also has a right to a speedy and public trial by a \njury of their peers. So these protections are really a sacred part of \nwho we are as Americans. I think it is something we all take great \npride in, and now it is, once again, the time. We did this in 2012, in \nthe fiscal year 2013 NDAA bill.\n  It received 67 votes on this floor. I would hope that we would not be \nblocked from taking another vote on this. We experimented with \nindefinite detention during World War II. It was a mistake we all \nrealize and a betrayal of our core values. So let's not repeat it.\n  I want to thank Senator Lee, Senator Tom Udall, Senator Paul, Senator \nCruz, and others who have worked with us on this issue over the years. \nI urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, when we ask the men and women of this \ncountry to go to war on our behalf, we make a solemn promise to take \ncare of them, to support them while they are abroad, and take care of \nthem when they come home. As a daughter of a World War II veteran, this \nis a promise I take very seriously, and I know that my colleagues do \ntoo.\n  One aspect of this promise that I have been proud to fight for is the \nidea that we should help warriors who have sustained grievous injuries \nachieve their dream of starting families. This is something that is \nhard for many people to think about, but it is a reality for far too \nmany men and women, people like Tyler Wilson. He is a veteran I met who \nis paralyzed and nearly died in a firefight in Afghanistan.\n  After years of surgeries and rehab and learning an entirely new way \nof living, he met Crystal, the woman he wanted to spend the rest of his \nlife with. Together, they wanted to start a family. I believe we have \nan obligation as a nation to help them. That is why I have been \nfighting to expand VA care to pay for IVF treatments for people like \nTyler. It is why I was so encouraged that 6 months ago the Pentagon \nannounced a pilot program to allow servicemembers who are getting ready \nto deploy--the very men and women who are willing to put their lives on \nthe line in defense of our country--an opportunity at cryopreservation.\n\n  That is a practice already widely used among the general population. \nIt gives our deploying members not only the ability to have options for \nfamily planning in the event they are injured on the battlefield, but \nit gives them peace of mind. It says they don't have to worry about \nchoosing between defending their country or a chance at a family \nsomeday. As Secretary Ash Carter said himself, this was a move that \n``honors the desire of our men and women to commit themselves \ncompletely to their careers, or to serve courageously in combat, while \npreserving their ability to have children in the future.''\n  I couldn't agree with that sentiment more. While the pilot program \nwas not groundbreaking and, in fact, has been used by the British Armed \nForces for years, I believe the Pentagon's announcement spoke volumes \nabout having respect for servicemembers who are willing to risk \nsuffering catastrophic injuries on our behalf to tell them: No matter \nwhat happens on the battlefield, your country will be there for you \nwith the best care available.\n  I applaud Secretary Ash Carter for his leadership. It is the right \nthing to do for our young men and women who have big plans after their \nservice is complete. That is why I was so shocked by one line in this \nmassive NDAA bill before us, a line that brings me to the floor today. \nBlink and you will miss it. On page 1,455 of the 1,600-page bill, in \none line in a funding chart, you will find an attempt to roll back \naccess to the care members of our military earned in their service to \nour country.\n  That line--that simple little line--will zero out the very program \nthat helps men and women in our military realize their dreams of having \na family, even if they go on to suffer catastrophic injuries while \nfighting on our behalf. The very program that Secretary Carter got off \nthe ground just 6 months ago, the promise the Pentagon made, this bill \nthrows in the trash.\n  Taking away that dream is wrong. It is not what our country is about. \nWhile I don't know how or why that line got into this bill, I am here \ntoday to shine a light on it in the hopes that we can get this fixed \nbefore it is too late.\n  In the past day, I have talked to both the chair and ranking member, \nand I am hopeful that we can change course. We simply cannot allow this \nprovision or others like it to slip through the cracks and continue to \nchip away at the care that these servicemembers deserve. That is not \nwhat this country is about. Many of my colleagues are so quick to honor \nour military members with their words, but our servicemembers need to \nsee that same commitment with their actions.\n  That is why I am here today urging my colleagues to keep this vital \nservice intact for members of our military. We can take action that \ntruly shows our servicemembers and our veterans that we understand this \nservice is a cost of war and it is a cost that we, as a country, are \nwilling to take on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I am going to try to make sense out of \nsome of the discussion that has been going on, which has been quite \ndetailed and very esoteric, with regard to the Russian rocket engine \nwhich is the main engine in the tail of the Atlas V rocket--the first \nstage of the Atlas V.\n  Why is there a Russian engine? In the early 1990s, at the time of the \ndisintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States went in to try to \nhelp secure the nuclear material and nuclear weapons. It was clearly in \nthe interests of the United States and her allies that loose nukes not \nget into the hands of rogue nations or rogue groups.\n  At the same time, it was clearly in the interests of the United \nStates that we try to prevent all of the experts, the Russian \nscientists and engineers that had been involved in the Russian or the \nSoviet Union's rocket program--and it was an exceptional program--from \ngoing to rogue nations or to rogue groups. Read: Iran.\n  Thus it became apparent, when U.S. scientists, engineers, and space \npioneers visited the Russian engine plant, that it was this \nextraordinary engine that had this high compression with liquid oxygen \nas a fuel and also kerosene. As a result, it was clearly in the \ninterests of the United States not only to prevent loose nukes and \nscientists leaving but to keep them interested and employed. Remember, \nthis was in a Soviet Union that was disintegrating at the moment. \nTherefore, it was in the interest of keeping that Russian rocket engine \nmanufacturing facility employing those engineers and scientists. In one \ninstance, that facility has been called Energomash, and in another \ninstance, it has been made reference to as Roscosmos.\n  Therefore, private companies in the United States arranged to buy the \nRussian engines and keep them employed and, at the same time, to obtain \nthe plans with the idea that down the road the United States would \nmanufacture the same Russian engine, but its manufacture would be done \nin the United States. That intention was never carried out.\n  As a result, that leads us to where we are today. Today, we still buy \nthe Russian engines. On average, that is costing us $88 million a year. \nHow much is that of the total expenditures that we buy from Russia in \nother goods? It is less than a percent. In fact, that $88 million a \nyear, on average, is one-third of 1 percent that is purchasing this \nexcellent engine. That excellent engine happens to be the workhorse \nengine of\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\nthe Atlas V, which is our most reliable rocket for military launches, \nas well as future NASA launches, as well as commercial launches of \ncommunications satellites in orbit.\n  The whole fracas that has been engulfing this Defense bill here is \nbecause now that same Russian Federation, where it was so important for \nus to keep employing its scientists and engineers 25 years ago,--today \nis being led by a former KGB agent, Vladimir Putin. He is doing things \nthat we don't like. He runs over Ukraine and he takes a part called \nCrimea. He is pushing into eastern Ukraine and he is doing all kinds of \nbad things there that is threatening the freedom of the people of \nUkraine.\n  As articulated by Senator McCain, naturally we would not want to \ncontinue to buy those Russian engines, which is basically helping \nVladimir Putin, even though it is minuscule--less than one-third of 1 \npercent of the total goods that we buy from Russia.\n  So that brings us to this point: How do we get out of the mess? How \nwe get out of the mess is that we build our own engine. We should have \ndone that years ago. But now we can actually build a better engine and \nnot plug into the same rocket, because if it is a different engine you \ncannot plug into the same rocket in the Atlas V. You have to basically \nplug it into a different rocket. As we speak, there is now a \ncompetition going on to develop a replacement engine. In one case, it \nis called the BE-4. In another case it is called an Aerojet Rocketdyne \nengine. That competition is going to continue, but we can't do it \novernight. So it is going to take some time.\n  An optimistic estimate might say that the engine is ready in about \n2019, and then you have to test-fire in the new rocket that you have \ndeveloped. So a realistic time of when the new engine is available is \nat the end of the year 2022.\n  So what do we do to make sure we have the rockets to have assured \naccess to space between now and the end of 2022? That is what all this \ndiscussion is on the floor.\n  On the one hand, there is a very successful company called SpaceX. \nThey are now certified with a rocket called the Falcon 9, and that \nrocket has won some competitions and has put payloads in space, \nincluding one defense payload that I know of. There may be more, but I \ndo know that they have been certified for the Department of Defense.\n  Its competitor is the other company, United Launch Alliance, which is \na combination of Boeing and Lockheed. They have been successfully \nlaunching the Atlas V without a miss for years and years. I think the \nsuccessful number of rocket launches is something in excess of 50 or \nmaybe 60. Thus, it is a proven workhorse.\n  We never want to get to the position where we have just one rocket \ncompany, because if something happened, you want to have a backup \nbecause we have to get satellites into space to protect our national \nsecurity, and we have to do it over this period of time from now until \nthe end of 2022. Therefore, how do you keep them going alive if you \neliminate the ability of being able to buy the Russian engine?\n  That is what all of the very emotional and very well-meaning speeches \non the floor have been about--in one case, United Launch Alliance, and \nin another case, SpaceX. For the good of the country, we have to have \nboth until we can develop, test, and successfully fly the replacement \nengine for the Russian engine.\n  As we speak, these discussions, by the way, that have been going on \nover the past several weeks, and with intensity over the past few days, \ncontinue. It is certainly my hope that we are going to get resolution \nand can get an agreement on this and a way to go forward so that we can \nget this issue behind us and move on with a defense bill that is so \nimportant to the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to lay out the predicate of what this is all \nabout. When you start getting into the weeds about this number of \nlaunches and that number of launches, all of it boils down to what this \nSenator has just shared. So I hope we get resolution. And since I am \nbasically an optimist, I think we will.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just to continue--and I do with some \nreluctance--on this whole issue of rocket engines, as I mentioned \nearlier, there is an individual who is one of the head executives of \nULA who was recorded, and in the recording he talks about ULA and the \nrelationship and how they have an ``in'' with the Department of \nDefense, and I just want to quote from his recording. He was talking \nabout the rocket engine. He said:\n\n       But unfortunately, it's built by the Soviet Union, and \n     there's a couple of people, one person in particular, this \n     guy right here, John McCain, who basically doesn't like us.\n\n  Remember, this is an employee of ULA.\n  He continues:\n\n       He's like this with Elon Musk, and so Elon Musk says, why \n     don't you guys go, why don't you go after United Launch \n     Alliance and see if you can get that engine to be outlawed. \n     So he was able to get legislation through that basically got \n     our number of engines down that we could use for national \n     security space competitions down to four; we needed nine. . . \n     . And so, then, we got his friend, I told you about that big \n     factory down in Alabama, in Decatur, and basically this is \n     Richard Shelby, Senator Richard Shelby, from Alabama, both \n     Republicans, and he basically at the last minute, at December \n     of last year, they were doing an omnibus bill to keep the \n     government running. And what he did is talk to John McCain \n     and parachuted in, in the middle of the night, and added some \n     language into the appropriations. . . . Shelby's in charge of \n     appropriations. He says ignore McCain's language and \n     basically allowed United Launch Alliance to pick any engine \n     they want from any country abroad.\n\n  Then he goes on to say:\n\n       But we can't afford that any more because the price points \n     are coming down as low as 60 million dollars per launch \n     vehicle, and on the best day you'll see us bid at 125 million \n     dollars, or twice that number, and if you were to take and \n     add in that capabilities cost, it's closer to 200 million \n     dollars. . . . SpaceX will take them to court if they don't, \n     so they have demonstrated ability to say, if you do not allow \n     us to compete on an apples-to-apples basis, that we will take \n     you to court, and you will lose.\n       So if you saw just recently, they bid the second GPS-III \n     launch, ULA opted to not bid that. Because the government was \n     not happy with us not bidding that contract because they had \n     felt that they'd bent over backwards to lean the field in our \n     advantage.\n\n  I repeat, this is what an executive of ULA said. ``Because the \ngovernment was not happy with us not bidding that contract because they \nhad felt that they'd bent over backwards to lean the field in our \nadvantage.'' That is from an executive of ULA. Is there any better \nevidence of what he said?\n  Continuing the quote from the recording:\n\n       But we even said we don't bid, because we saw it as a cost \n     sheet up between us and SpaceX, so now we're going to have to \n     take and figure out how to bid these things much lower cost. \n     And the government can't just say ULA's got a great track \n     record, they've got 105 launches in a row, and 100 percent \n     mission success and we can give it to them on a silver \n     platter even though their costs are two or three times as \n     high.\n\n  Two or three times as high. Mr. President, this is what makes the \nAmerican people cynical about the way we do business.\n  Before I suggest the absence of a quorum, let me just say that we are \ngoing to be moving the amendments on interpreters and Guantanamo, and \nso I alert my colleagues that we will be doing that shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of what we \nhave been doing on the Senate floor the past 2 weeks--moving forward on \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. I wish to pay a compliment and \nmy deepest respect to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to \nthe ranking member, and to all the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee who have been focused on this bill that we have been putting \nforward in this Congress and every Congress for the last half century.\n  Our forces are under strain at a time when Henry Kissinger said \nbefore the Armed Services Committee that ``the United States has not \nfaced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end of the \nSecond World War.''\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\n  Here is what some of our top military officials have told our \ncommittee about the threats that are rising globally and the dramatic \nreduction in our military forces. Chief of Staff of the Army, GEN Mark \nMilley, recently stated that due to cuts and threats, our Army is at a \nstate of ``high military risk'' when it comes to being ready enough to \ndefend our interests. That is a very serious statement by the Chief of \nStaff of the Army, ``high military risk'' for our military and the \nability of the U.S. Army to do its mission. He also said that when it \ncomes to Russia and its new aggressiveness, we are ``outranged and \noutgunned.''\n  Let me spend a little bit of time on the new challenge from Russia. \nThere are many provisions in this bill--which is why it is so \nimportant--that will strengthen our military threat with regard to \nRussia--something that, as a Senator from Alaska, I am very concerned \nabout.\n  Nobody spoke more eloquently and compellingly about our country's \ncredibility than President Reagan when he stated that his philosophy of \ndealing with our potential adversaries was that ``we maintain the peace \nthrough our strength; weakness only invites aggression.'' And he \nmatched his rhetoric with credible action. That is what we need to do \nwith regard to the NDAA, and that is why it is so important that we \nmove forward and pass this bill.\n  But the Russian threat is not just in Europe, it also in the Arctic, \nand those threats--we are hearing more and more in committee testimony \non and what the Russians are doing. For example, there are 4 new Arctic \nbrigades; a new Arctic command; 14 operational airfields in the Russian \nArctic by the end of this year; up to 50 airfields by 2020; a 30-\npercent increase in Russian special forces in the Arctic; 40 Russian \nGovernment and privately owned icebreakers, with 11 additional \nicebreakers in development right now, including 3 new nuclear-powered \nicebreakers; huge land claims in the Arctic; increased long-range air \npatrols with Bear bombers--the most since the Cold War--and pilots in \nAlaska are intercepting these Russian bombers on a weekly basis; and a \nrecent deployment of two sophisticated S-400 air defense systems again \nto the Arctic. Why are they doing this? Because it is a strategic \nplace, new transportation routes, enormous resources.\n  Our own Secretary of Defense stated in testimony that he realized we \nwere late to the Arctic given how strategic and important it is. Right \nnow we have no Arctic port infrastructure; two icebreakers--that is it; \nno plans to increase Arctic-capable special forces; and a lack of \nsurveillance capabilities in this strategic region of the world.\n  Why do I mention this? Because in this NDAA we start to address the \nproblem. Just as we did in last year's NDAA, we start to lay the \nfoundation for having a strategic vision of what is going on in the \nArctic, the way the Russians are, and we are beginning to be prepared \nin an area of the world that is absolutely critical to U.S. security. \nProvisions include the first steps to build up an appropriate strategic \nArctic port. We will also build up our Arctic domain awareness, and we \nwill have a much better sense of what is going on in this region not \nonly with regard to the Russians but what the Chinese are doing in this \ncritical area of the world.\n  Make no mistake--America is an Arctic nation. We are an Arctic nation \nbecause of my State, the State of Alaska. This NDAA begins the \nimportant process to start addressing the strategic concerns we are \nseeing in the Arctic and securing our Nation in a way that is important \nfor all of us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after discussions with the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, the Senator from Missouri, the Senator from South \nCarolina, and the Senator from Kansas, I ask unanimous consent to have \na colloquy with these Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We are going to propose a unanimous consent request that \nthe Senate take up and pass both the issue of the interpreters to our \nAfghan allies and the issue of Guantanamo Bay. I know there is \nobjection, so we will await those individuals since it would require \ntheir presence on the floor.\n  I will say a few words about the SIV Program. The fact is, the \nSenator from Colorado, maybe the Senator from Alabama, maybe the \nSenator from someplace else, has an axe to grind here: They didn't get \na vote on their amendment. They didn't get their vote, so, by God, \nnobody is going to get a vote.\n  Do you know what they neglect here? We are talking about our men and \nwomen in the military who literally saved their lives. And they are \nusing their parochial reasons, because they didn't get their vote, to \nobject. My friends, that is not what the job of a United States Senator \nshould be.\n  GEN David Petraeus:\n\n       Throughout my time in uniform, I saw how important our in-\n     country allies are in the performance of our missions. Many \n     of our Afghan allies have not only been mission-essential--\n     serving as the eyes and ears of our own troops and often \n     saving American lives--they have risked their own lives and \n     their families' lives in the line of duty. Protecting these \n     allies is as much a matter of American national morality as \n     it is American national security.\n\n  So the Senators who have come and objected disagree with an effort we \nare making on the issue of American national morality, in the eyes of \nGEN David Petraeus.\n  General Nicholson is over there now. He says basically the same \nthing:\n\n       They followed and supported our troops in combat at great \n     personal risk, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of \n     Coalition members on the ground. Many have been injured or \n     killed in the line of duty, a testament to their commitment, \n     resolve, and dedication to support our interests. Continuing \n     our promise of the American dream is more than in our \n     national interests, it is a testament to our decency and \n     long-standing tradition of honoring our allies.\n\n  That is from General Nicholson, who is over there now.\n  There is no more admired diplomat in America than Ryan Crocker. He \nstates:\n\n       This is a very personal issue for me. I was U.S. Ambassador \n     to Iraq from 2002 to 2009 and to Afghanistan from 2011 to \n     2012. I observed firsthand the courage of the citizens who \n     risked their lives trying to help their own countries by \n     helping the United States. It takes a special kind of heroism \n     for them to serve alongside of us.\n\n  GEN Stanley McChrystal:\n\n       I ask for your help in upholding this obligation by \n     appropriating additional Afghan SIVs to bring our allies to \n     safety in America. They have risked their own and their \n     families' lives in the line of duty.\n\n  I will stop with this. General Campbell says the same thing:\n\n       They frequently live in fear that they are or their \n     families will be targeted for kidnappings and death. Many \n     have suffered this fate already. The SIV program offers hope \n     that their sacrifices on our behalf will not be forgotten.\n\n  I would hope that a Senator who comes to object to this act of \nhumanitarian--a moral obligation, as stated by these respected military \nleaders, that they wouldn't object because they didn't get a vote on \ntheir amendment. That would be a reason to stop this act that is a \nmoral obligation of this country? Well, if they come over and object, \nthen they have their priorities badly screwed up. If these people are \nkilled, they will have nobody to answer to but their families.\n  I hope we will pass this by unanimous consent and not have--for a \nparochial, their own selfish reason--some Senator come and object.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I say thank you to Senator McCain. Thank you for your \nleadership and thanks to Senator Jack Reed for his leadership on this \nissue. As the Senator points out, there are real lives at stake. If we \nare not able to continue the Special Immigrant Visa Program for those \nAfghans who have helped us during the conflict in Afghanistan, then--we \nknow the Taliban has already murdered a number of them, their family \nmembers. As the Senator points out, to have someone object to going \nforward with this amendment--not related to the program at all but \nbecause people have other personal issues they want to address--it \nwould be unfortunate and not in this country's interest.\n  What we are actually hoping we can vote on today is a carefully \ncrafted amendment. It addresses the legitimate concerns that people \nhave raised about this program. We spent hours over the last few days \nand last night\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\ntrying to come to some agreement to address those issues, and I think \nthe legislation before us does that.\n  The concern, as I understand, isn't about this program and about what \nis in this program; it is about individuals who have their own issues \nunrelated to this program that they want to see addressed. I understand \nthat. We all have our issues, but that is not what we ought to be \nvoting on at this point.\n  The Senator pointed out that Ryan Crocker, who served both in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, has talked about the importance of this program, \nas have so many of our generals and those who have served. I want to \nquote from an op-ed piece he wrote last month about the importance of \nCongress addressing this program. He said:\n\n       In an era of partisan rancor, this has been an area where \n     Republicans and Democrats have acted together. Congress has \n     continued to support policies aimed at protecting our wartime \n     allies by renewing the Afghanistan SIV program annually--\n     demonstrating a shared understanding that taking care of \n     those who took care of us is not just an act of basic \n     decency; it is also in our national interest. American \n     credibility matters. Abandoning these allies would tarnish \n     our reputation and endanger those we are today asking to \n     serve alongside U.S. forces and diplomats.\n\n  As we all know, this country owes a great debt to the Afghans who \nprovided essential assistance to the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. \nThousands of brave men and women put themselves and their families at \nrisk to help our soldiers and diplomats accomplish their mission and \nreturn home safely. We must not turn our back on these individuals. We \nmust not imperil our ability to secure this kind of assistance in the \nfuture, and a ``no'' vote today would do exactly that.\n  I urge this body to move forward to allow a vote on a compromise that \nhas been supported by everybody who was raising concerns about this \nprogram.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague from South Carolina.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Moran first.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Sorry. Senator Moran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank you very much, and I appreciate the \nopportunity to be here on the Senate floor today with my colleagues.\n  I, too, have an amendment to strike section 1023 of this bill, the \nnational defense authorization bill, S. 2943. This is amendment No. \n4068. We will seek unanimous consent for this amendment to be \nconsidered, but what it does is strike section 1023, which provides for \nthe design and planning related to construction of a facility in the \nUnited States to house detainees. This is part of the constant effort \nby some to close Guantanamo Bay and bring the detainees to the United \nStates.\n  In my view, it is essential for the United States to maintain the \nability to hold terrorists, both those who were captured in 2002, as \nwell as those whom we may find on the battlefields of terrorism with \nISIS today. Since 2008, the effort has been to close Guantanamo Bay \nwith the objective of bringing those detainees to the United States. \nThis Congress, this Senate has spoken time and time again both in the \npredecessors' legislation to this bill we are considering today, NDAA \nof past years, as well as the appropriations process in which we \nprohibit those detainees from being brought to the United States and \nhoused in a facility in the United States.\n  In fact, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense have, on \nnumerous occasions, confirmed that the President has no legal authority \nto close Gitmo or to transfer detainees to the United States. For some \nreason, the national defense authorization bill, as it came out of the \ncommittee, provides for the planning and designing related to \nconstruction of a facility here.\n  This amendment strikes that language, and it reaffirms what we have \nsaid before. In fact, in last year's national defense authorization \nbill, we said there had to be a plan provided by the administration \nthat outlines, in significant criteria and detail, what would be \ninvolved in bringing those detainees to the United States. I am opposed \nto that in the first place. I am opposed to that in the second place. I \nwould add that plan that we keep looking for, it has yet to be, in any \nspecificity, granted to us to see in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my colleagues to allow, at the appropriate \ntime, that this bill be made in order for consideration for a vote by \nthe Senate as an amendment to this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There are a number of Members on both sides of the aisle \nwho have had the honor of serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, and \nparticularly some of the newer members have added enormously to the \nArmed Services Committee. There is also one member of the committee who \nI believe, in his many years of Active Duty, has served in Afghanistan \nas many as 33 times. He has had an up close and personal relationship \nwith these brave interpreters who literally put their lives on the line \nin assisting people like Colonel Graham and all others as they were \nable to accomplish their mission, which they would not have been able \nto do if it had not been for the outstanding service and sacrifice of \nthese interpreters.\n  Senator Graham.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. I compliment Senator Shaheen and all those \ninvolved in trying to get to yes. The people who had concerns about \nyour amendment, I understand their concerns. You are able to find a way \nto accommodate those concerns. This is sort of how the legislative \nprocess works. You get to yes when you can. But why this is important \nto America and particularly to me--Senator Sullivan served some time in \nAfghanistan as a marine working in the Embassy dealing with detainee \noperations.\n  I did about 140 days on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, mostly in \nAfghanistan, as a Reservist. I did my Reserve duty, 1 week, 2 weeks at \na time, with Task Force 435 that was in charge of detainee operations \nat Bagram prison. That unit's job was to advise the commanders about \nwho to put in Bagram, what requirements there were to hold somebody in \nBagram prison under U.S. custody, and also to build up the rule of law, \nwhere the rule-of-law field forces would go out to different parts of \nAfghanistan and work with the police and the judiciary to try to build \ncapacity.\n  During my experience in Afghanistan, I learned something that is, \nquite frankly, overwhelming to this day, how brave some people in \nAfghanistan are to change their country. There was one interpreter--and \nI am certainly not going to use his name--who was there the entire time \nI did my Reserve duty. I retired last year. This man was invaluable. It \nis not just interpreting the language and repeating what we said. It is \nthe context that he made over time to make sure the coalition forces \ncould accomplish their mission. Of all the people we owe a debt to as \nAmericans, it is these interpreters and those who have assisted our \nforces. They have come out of the shadows. They have taken a skill set \nwe did not have, which is local knowledge, and they have applied that \nskill set to helping our efforts to protect America but, equally \nimportant, to protect their homeland, Afghanistan.\n  All the letters from those who were in command can say it better than \nI can. I had a small glimpse as a military lawyer over about a 5-year \nperiod coming in and coming out, and all I can tell you is what I saw \nwas amazing, and it moved me beyond measure. I got to meet their \nfamily. The interpreters had families. I got to know them. They have \nchildren. They have wives. All the ones I know were male, but I know \nthere were females who were helping too. I can tell you, if there is \nany way for this body to pass Senator Shaheen's amendment, you would be \ndoing our country and those who helped us under the most dire situation \na great service.\n  As to how the body works, I wish I could get everything I wanted. I \nhave not been able to do that in life or in the Senate. I wanted to \nhave a vote on the Ex-Im Bank because the Ex-Im Bank is not operating \nbecause we don't have a quorum. I asked for an amendment on this bill \nto change that to get us back in the game in terms of the Ex-Im Bank \nbecause it shut down. It was objected to because it is not germane. I \nunderstand that. I am disappointed, but I am not going to stop the \nwhole bill because I didn't get what I want.\n  There are other people who are offering amendments that are very \nimportant to them. Ex-Im Bank is very important to people of South \nCarolina, but there is a process. The Ex-Im Bank is about jobs that are \nimportant to Americans. This is about lives. This is about the here and \nnow. This is not\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nabout what might happen one day. Maybe if something happened, maybe we \nwill do this or maybe we will do that. This is about people who have \nalready stepped out. This is the here and now. There is nothing \nhypothetical about this debate. There are thousands of people in \nAfghanistan who have risked their lives to help us, and we are trying \nto get some of them out of Afghanistan to the safety of the United \nStates, honoring their service to make sure other people in the future \nwould also want to do the same.\n  The one thing I tell my colleagues, the war is not over. Since 2012, \n2011, the last time we had some of these debates, has it gotten better? \nThe world is on fire right now. The threats to our country are at an \nalltime high, in my opinion. In 2012, ISIL didn't even exist. Today \nthey are trying to penetrate the homeland. The Homeland Security \nSecretary said what keeps him up at night is homegrown terrorism.\n  The enemy is actively involved in trying to get people on their side \nwho live among us. All I can say is, the things that have changed over \nthe last few years are all for the worse, not the better, and this \namendment is literally life and death. I honest to God beg and plead \nwith the Members of this body, if you can't get everything you want, \nplease don't stop this. I did not get everything I want. This really \nmatters.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Suppose this unanimous consent request is objected to by \na Member. Would my colleague say the blood of these interpreters who \nwill be killed and their families murdered is on their hands? Would my \nfriend say that just because they didn't get their amendment--by the \nway, I offered Senator Lee the chance to bring up his amendment on the \nissue of women in the Selective Service, and he turned that down. He \nsaid he wanted to take up his other amendment first.\n  Let the record be clear that I immediately approached him and asked: \nWhen do you want to take up the amendment on Selective Service? He \nsaid: That is not my priority. My priority is this one here, which \napparently he will object to.\n  If we don't do this and those people are killed by the Taliban \nbecause they have to stay in Afghanistan--the Senator from South \nCarolina would agree they are the No. 1 target--wouldn't you say that \nthose who objected to their having freedom in the United States of \nAmerica have blood on their hands?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the first thing I would say is I blame the \nTaliban. They are the ones who are doing the killing. What I would say \nto Senators is, where you can help people who make our country safer, \nyou should. All of us should try to find a way to get to yes at least \nsometimes if you can't do it all the time.\n  I can tell the Members of this body that I have been to Iraq and \nAfghanistan 37 times--probably 20 times in Afghanistan. I spent close \nto 100 days on the ground in Afghanistan. I have seen in person what \nthey do. They get outside the wire, make the mission possible, risk \ntheir lives, and Senator Shaheen has been able to navigate a very \nthorny issue and get a solution that is not 100 percent of what she \nwanted. She had to give up thousands of visas just to find a way to \nmove forward.\n  All I can say is that this really is a big deal. People's lives are \nat stake. This is not a hypothetical issue. All I can say is that I \nhope we can find it among ourselves to get to yes on this and what \nSenator Moran is trying to do. If we can't, we can't, but let me tell \nyou this: Senator Lee objected to my Ex-Im Bank amendment in committee. \nHe had every right to do so. It wasn't germane. It is very important to \nme. We are losing thousands of jobs. South Carolina is losing hundreds \nof jobs because the Bank shut down. I will still fight to get the Ex-Im \nBank operating, but what I will not do to help the people of South \nCarolina is to put the lives of those in Afghanistan at risk. I don't \nthink I am helping the people in South Carolina by making it harder for \nus to fight and win a war we can't afford to lose. I can't live with \nmyself knowing what is coming their way.\n  This is not a matter of ``what if'' to me. I have been there, I have \nseen it, and people are literally going to die. My amendment is \nimportant to me, and it is important to the economy of South Carolina \nand the Nation. I did not get my way, but I am not going to stand in \nthe way of people being able to avoid being killed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, will my colleague from South Carolina \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would be glad to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, the Senator from South Carolina talked \nabout the fight against ISIL and how that is spreading across the \nMiddle East. What kind of message does it send to the Taliban, ISIL, \nand other terrorist groups, should they hear that we are defeating this \nprogram that was designed to help those people who helped us?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, that is a great question. They are called \nnight letters. Let me tell you how this works. I was in Kandahar with \nthe rule of law field forces, and we were trying to build up the \ncapacity of their judges in Kandahar. The judges were being killed in \nlarge measure, so it was pretty hard to find anybody who wanted to be a \njudge.\n  We hardened the site, and we put some American troops, along with \nAfghan soldiers, to try to get a judiciary up and running in a really \nhot spot. We had a couple of police stations that were being overrun, \nand we tried to get people to go back to the police stations.\n  The night letter was delivered to some of the leaders who were buying \ninto what we were doing. I don't speak Pashto, but these night letters \nwere from the Taliban saying: We are watching. The Americans will leave \nyou. They will leave you, and we will remember you.\n  I know what the night letter looks like because I saw one, but here \nis the difference--I never got one. Imagine what it would be like if \nyou woke up tomorrow and the enemy of your country, which is trying to \ntake your country down, is telling you and your family: We are watching \nyou. We are coming after you. You are hiding behind the Great Satan, \nand the Great Satan will abandon you.\n  I can tell you what it would do. It would make those letters real, \nand they will take this failure to help people who helped us and make \nit really hard in the future for us to defend our Nation.\n  The night letters are going to increase. We had to sit down with \nthese people and say: No, we are not going to abandon you.\n  It is funny the Senator from New Hampshire mentioned that. I have a \nresolution that Senator Reed has agreed to which urges the President, \nif he chooses, to keep troops at 9,800 based on conditions. If he felt \nthat was the right thing, we would all support him and let the next \nPresident find out if we need to go down in size. I am all for leaving. \nI just want to make sure the conditions are right to leave, and I don't \nthink it is right to go from 9,800 to 5,500.\n  All I can say to Senator Shaheen is that these night letters will be \nlarger in number, and the people who get the letters are watching what \nwe are doing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be in order to be offered: Shaheen No. 4604 and Moran No. \n4068; I further ask there be 5 minutes equally divided between the \nmanagers or their designees and that the Senate then proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendments in the order listed with no second-degree \namendments to these amendments in order prior to the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I sat here and \nI heard some fairly hyperbolic arguments--arguments suggesting somehow \nthat anyone who has other amendments they would like to have considered \nare somehow unpatriotic or unsympathetic if they don't allow these \namendments to go through.\n  The fact is, I have no problem with either of these amendments. I \nwill gladly not only allow a vote on them, but I will also vote for the \namendment from Senator Shaheen and the amendment from Senator Moran. I \nsupport\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\nboth of them, but I would like a vote on my amendment as well. This is \nan issue I have worked on for 5 years. This issue arose 5 years ago \nwhen a provision was slipped into the NDAA that we passed that year \nthat I think raises significant concerns.\n  I have worked with my colleague, the senior Senator from California, \nand Senators on both sides of the aisle, and put together a proposal to \ndeal with that language. We put that in and had a vote on it in 2012, \nand 67 Members of this body voted for it, including some of the people \nwho have spoken in the last few minutes. This is an issue that became a \npart of our law because of the NDAA 5 years ago. It is appropriate to \nbring this up now.\n  Moments ago, the Senator from South Carolina made reference to an \nobjection I made to an amendment of his within the Senate Armed \nServices Committee on which he and I serve. It is true that I made an \nobjection because in the committee we have some jurisdictional rules. \nThere are reasons why certain amendments aren't jurisdictionally proper \nwithin the committee. There was a reason I didn't bring up the \namendment that I wanted to vote on within the committee because of a \njurisdictional issue. I was told last year and this year that if this \nis an amendment you want to bring up, the appropriate time to do so is \non the floor and not in committee. The reason I did that is that there \nare jurisdictional issues present within the committee.\n  Again, I don't have a problem with the Shaheen or Moran amendments. I \nwill support both of them. All I am asking for is to give me a vote on \nmy amendment as well.\n  Therefore, I ask that the unanimous consent be modified to include my \namendment--amendment No. 4448.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Arizona so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, No. 1, I will object, and let me tell you \nwhy. The last time we had a hearing about the issue of whether or not \nan American citizen can be held as an enemy combatant if they \ncollaborate with Al Qaeda was 2012. Since 2012, things have changed all \nfor the worse.\n  To my friend from Utah, your amendment should be in the Judiciary \nCommittee. That is where primary jurisdiction exists. I am chairman of \nthe Crime, Terrorism Subcommittee. I promise that we will have a \nhearing about your idea that never made it in the NDAA, and we will see \nwhat has changed from 2012 till now. I think that is much better than \nhaving a debate on the floor of the Senate about something this \nimportant that will last 30 minutes or an hour.\n  I would argue to the American people that the rise of ISIL has \nchanged the game. If you read their literature, they are talking about \nhow it is easier to penetrate America than it is to get somebody to \ncome here. When you listen to the FBI and Homeland Security director, \ntheir No. 1 fear is homegrown terrorism.\n  Here is my view: We will debate the substance of this later. I think \nthe best thing we can do is pass these two amendments. The Ex-Im Bank \nwas brought up by Senator Schumer, and Senator Shelby objected. He has \nevery right to do so. Senator Lee came on the floor and talked about \nwhat a bad idea the Bank is, and he has every right to do so.\n  In order to allow these two people to go forward, the Senator has to \nget a vote on his amendment. That is what this is all about. I didn't \nget my amendment. I wish that we could have had a vote on the Ex-Im \nBank reauthorization. It really does matter to me. I didn't get that.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could finish my thought, what I would \nsuggest to Senator Lee is that the prudent thing for us to do is to \nhave another hearing because the last one we had was in 2012. Listen to \nthe FBI Director and Homeland Security Secretary and see why they feel \nso strongly about homegrown terrorism and see if we can find a way to \nmove forward. But what the Senator from Utah and others have said--\nthere is not one American being held as an enemy combatant today. There \nare thousands of people who have helped us in Afghanistan who will be \nkilled if we don't do something about it.\n  The Senator from Utah and I will never agree on this issue, and I \nrespect my friend greatly. I believe we are fighting a war, not a \ncrime. I will never agree that because you are an American citizen, you \ncan collaborate with the enemy and work actively with Al Qaeda and ISIL \nto attack your homeland and not be held under the law of war, which we \nhave been doing for decades in other wars.\n  I do believe in due process. As the law is written today, if our \nmilitary or intelligence community picks up someone they believe is \ncollaborating with ISIL or Al Qaeda, someone covered as an enemy \ncombatant, they can be held, but they can be held only if a Federal \njudge allows the continued holding. You do get a hearing under the \nhabeas corpus statute. The government has to prove you are, in fact, an \nenemy combatant.\n  The last time we had this debate, it was suggested this was a \nslippery slope. What prevents you from being held as an enemy combatant \nif you went to a tea party rally? That was pretty offensive to me then, \nand it is really offensive to me now. The idea that somehow American \nsoil is not part of the battlefield blows me away.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will in a moment.\n  Let me make this real to you. We will have a big debate. I would love \nto have a hearing.\n  This guy pictured here is Anwar al-Awlaki. He is dead, thank God. He \nwas an American citizen and head of Al Qaeda in Yemen. President Obama \nput him on the kill list, and we killed him. That is good. Well done, \nMr. President.\n  If you are an American citizen and you go to Yemen and join Al Qaeda, \nI hope you get killed too. If we capture you, you will have your day in \ncourt to argue that you are not part of Al Qaeda, that we have it all \nwrong, and the government has to prove that you in fact are. But if the \ngovernment can make that argument, the last thing I want somebody like \nthis to hear is ``Hey, you have a right to remain silent.'' I don't \nwant these people to remain silent; I want to hold them as enemy \ncombatants and gather intelligence. I don't want to torture them. I \ndon't want to beat them up. But I don't want to put them in Federal \ncourt and act like it is not part of the war. I don't want to \ncriminalize the war; I want to make sure you have due process \nconsistent with being at war.\n\n  What Senator Lee and others are suggesting is that if this guy made \nit to America, came back to his homeland, and we shot him on the steps \nof the Capitol and he survived, we would have to read him his Miranda \nrights and we couldn't hold him to find out under military \ninterrogation what he knows about this attack and future attacks. So \nwhat you do when you go down this road is you stop the ability to \ngather intelligence at a time we need more information, not less.\n  I am not going to belabor this point any more. As you can tell, I \nstrongly disapprove of having this debate now without another hearing, \ngoing down this road, because so much has changed. And I hope you \nrespect where I am coming from. I respect your passion. I hope you \nrespect my passion on this.\n  Here is the point: I didn't get all I want, and I am not going to \nstop the process for others who have done a good thing. Here is what \nyou are going to do because you are worried about something that is not \nreal at this moment because nobody is in custody. You are objecting to \nfinding a solution for something that is real for the moment.\n  Senator Moran, what you are worried about is real.\n  So all I am asking is that before we can get to yes, let's get to \nyes, and if you can't get everything you want because somebody is \npassionate on the other side, don't stop everybody else from getting \nwhat they want. That, to me, just makes a stronger country, a better \nSenate.\n  As you know, I respect you, but I am never going to agree with you, \never, because I have been a military lawyer for 33 years. What you are \nsaying makes\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nno sense to me. I am sure you are sincere about it. I think it weakens \nthe ability to defend this Nation at a time when we need all the \ndefenses we can get.\n  I am not suggesting that you would be rounded up by your government, \nthrown in jail, accused of being an Al Qaeda or ISIL member, and nobody \never hears from you again and you never get a chance to speak. That is \nnot the law, and it has never been the law.\n  I plead with the Senator, please, please, let's take this issue to \nthe Judiciary Committee where it belongs. Let's have a hearing, mark up \nthe bill in Judiciary, and then do whatever you want to do. Don't stop \nthese two amendments. That is all I am asking.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me also mention a couple of facts. As \nof 10 o'clock this morning, there were 537 amendments that had been \nfiled--537 amendments--which is always the case with the Defense \nauthorization bill. I am sure that every Member who filed those \namendments wanted a vote and a debate on every single one of them, as \nis their right, but the fact is that we can't do that for a whole \nvariety of reasons, including objections, et cetera. So if every \nSenator blocked every vote because his or her amendment is not being \nconsidered, obviously we would never do anything, which is why we have \ndone so little here on this bill.\n  Now we are talking about the lives of men who have put it on the line \nfor the men and women who are serving. Don't we have some sense of \nperspective and priority here? People are going to die, I tell the \nSenator from Utah. They are going to die if we don't pass this \namendment and take them out of harm's way. Don't you understand the \ngravity of that? Can't you understand that your issue on extended \ndetaining is an important one, but don't you understand these people's \nlives are in danger as we speak? They have been marked for death. They \nhave been marked for death. Why do you think General Petraeus and \nGeneral Nicholson and Ryan Crocker and all our most respected military \nleaders say with great urgency--they say with urgency that we have to \ndo this because they are going to die. They are going to be killed. \nDoesn't that somehow appeal to your sense of compassion for these \npeople?\n  Mr. LEE. If the Senator will yield, I will answer----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me finish.\n  Don't you understand what is at stake here? Do you respect General \nPetraeus, General Nicholson, and General McChrystal? Every one of them \nhas written to us and said that these people's lives are in danger and \nthat this is a moral issue.\n  So you are going to object because your amendment is being blocked, \nas so many amendments are blocked. Many, many amendments are blocked. \nIf that is good or bad, I don't know, but people object.\n  Now we are talking about a compelling humanitarian issue that is far \nmore important than humanitarian because we abandon these people, and \nyou can't expect people in future conflicts or in these conflicts we \nare in to cooperate and help the United States of America if we are \ngoing to abandon them to a cruel and terrible death.\n  This is a serious issue. This is not something that we like to \nmaneuver around what the steering committee wants and how we are going \nto do all these kinds of things we get mired down in, and we will have \nthe Heritage Foundation write a letter or something like that. This is \na matter of life and death, and that issue and challenge is immediate.\n  So I appeal to the Senator from Utah's humanity, for his compassion, \nfor his ability to save lives here, and let this go through, as the \nmost respected military and diplomatic leaders in the world have urged \nus to do. I appeal to the life-or-death situation that will entail a \nlot of deaths if you block this legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection to the modification is heard.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. LEE. I object to the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have been asked by a couple of my \ncolleagues why it is that I couldn't just have the good sense to let \ntheir amendments go through. I say let's do it. Let's have it right \nnow. I support the amendment. Let's vote on it right now. Let's vote on \nSenator Moran's amendment right now, and let's vote on mine right now.\n  Now the comparison has been made by the Senator from South Carolina \nthat because he didn't get his vote because someone objected this \nmorning to his amendment dealing with the Export-Import Bank, that I \nshould also have my amendment blocked.\n  It is important to realize that the Export-Import Bank was not \ncreated by a previous iteration of the National Defense Authorization \nAct. The provision I am objecting to here and the provision I am trying \nto address here was, in fact, created by a previous iteration of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It was passed in 2011 with, I \nbelieve, far too little consideration, without the American people \nbeing aware of what they were doing, and it remains on the books to \nthis day.\n  The next argument made by my friend from South Carolina is an \ninteresting one, which is that this needs more of an airing, needs more \nof a hearing. He has promised me now a hearing on the Judiciary \nCommittee which he chairs. As much as I appreciate that gesture, that \nis not enough.\n  Let me replay a couple of things. First of all, I have been working \non this for 5 years. I got a vote on it 4 years ago, and 67 Senators \nvoted for it. It was removed in a conference committee. Someone said \nthere was confusion as to why it was removed in a conference committee; \nregardless, it was removed. I have been trying ever since then, in \nsubsequent iterations of the Defense authorization act, to get another \nvote on it.\n  I served on the Armed Services Committee, and I was told by the \nchairman, my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Arizona \nlast year--I told him I wanted to bring it up in committee. He said: \nYou can't bring it up in committee because there is a jurisdictional \nissue with the Judiciary Committee. That is better dealt with on the \nfloor.\n  I said: OK. I will deal with it on the floor.\n  We got to the floor. I was blocked from operating on the floor. It \ndidn't happen.\n  So this year I was told: You can't bring it up in committee. There is \na jurisdiction issue. You are best served waiting for the floor for \nthat.\n  I said: OK. I will wait for the floor.\n  I brought it up again this year. Now I have been told by the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, the senior Senator from Arizona, that \nwe will deal with it next year. I have been told by the Senator from \nSouth Carolina that he will deal with it at some unknown point in the \nfuture in a hearing--not markup, just a hearing--in a subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee which he chairs.\n  So we are talking about an issue now that was brought up 5 years ago, \nand I am being told again and again to wait, to wait, to wait more. \nThis is an issue that got the vote of 67 Members of our body 4 years \nago. This is an issue that was brought about by a previous iteration of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. This is the appropriate vehicle \nin which to address this.\n  This is not a frivolity. This is not just some nicety. This is not \nsome parochial interest. This is a basic human rights interest. This is \nan interest that relates to some of the most fundamental protections in \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  When you say that you want to lock up American citizens detained on \nU.S. soil without charge, without trial, without access to a jury, \nindefinitely, for an unlimited period of time, you are implicating at a \nminimum the Fourth, the Fifth and the Sixth and Eighth Amendments to \nthe Constitution. These are very significant.\n  My friend from South Carolina says we just need to take a deep breath \nand deal with this another day. Why does the status quo--the status quo \nwhich is insulting to the history, the traditions, the text, the \ncontext of the U.S. Constitution--why should that be the status quo? \nWhy should we wait to deal with this? Why should the status quo be one \nthat is insulting to the American people, one that is insulting to the\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\ndescendents of those Japanese Americans who were interned in World War \nII indefinitely without charge, without access to trial, without access \nto the jury system, without access to their fundamental rights under \nthe Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments under the Constitution, \namong others? Why should that status quo prevail?\n  Why, moreover, should someone who is concerned about these issues--\nthese fundamental human rights issues, these fundamental constitutional \nrights issues--why should someone who is concerned about those be \nmaligned and accused of not caring about individuals who would be \nharmed by the non-passage of another amendment? Why should that person \nbe blamed when that person--I--is willing to allow a vote on the \nShaheen amendment, on the Moran amendment, as long as they give me a \nvote on my amendment--an amendment that was allowed a vote 4 years ago, \nan amendment that received 67 votes--a veto-proof supermajority--only 4 \nyears ago?\n  So, having been told again and again n, wait until next year, wait \nuntil next year, wait until the next committee process, wait until the \nnext floor process, after a while, one begins to discern a pattern. \nThat is a pattern that I am discerning.\n  There is another pattern that I discern, which is a pattern in which \nwhen you allow government to exercise a certain power, even if it might \nnot being exercised at the moment, eventually it will. That is why we \nput precautionary language within our laws. That is why we have rights \nin our laws. What are rights, after all, but statements of law that \nrestrict action by the government?\n  As Madison noted in Federalist 51, the government is a reflection of \nhuman nature. To understand government, you have to understand human \nnature. If men were angels, we would have no need of a government. And \nif government could be administered by angels, we would have no need \nfor these external constraints on government, on its ability to \nexercise power. But we have learned through sad experience that when \nhuman beings get power and when they get excessive power, sometimes \nthey abuse that power, so we have to constrain it. And it is important \nthat we decide that we are going to constrain it before the moment \narrives, lest we see another Korematsu moment, lest we see the \ninternment of more American citizens without charge, without trial, on \nan indefinite basis, on the basis of mere accusations--accusations \nunproven, accusations untested by a jury.\n  The whole reason for having a Constitution rests on this \nunderstanding. This fundamental understanding is that when government \npower grows, when it expands, it does so at the expense of individual \nfreedom, and it sometimes does so at great risk to the human soul, at \ngreat risk to the ability of an individual to remain free.\n  I am all in favor of the Shaheen amendment. I am all in favor of the \nMoran amendment. Let's have a vote on those two amendments and on the \namendment that I have proposed, an amendment that is limited and an \namendment, I should note here, that would not foreclose the ability of \nthis body down the road to identify the changed circumstances of the \nsort that some of my colleagues have referred to. It simply says that \nif the government is going to do this, there has to be a plain \nstatement, a clear statement; that it has to do so expressly; that \nCongress must expressly authorize this kind of action either in a \ndeclaration of war or an authorization for the use of military force. I \ndon't think that is too much to ask, especially given the types of \nconstitutional protections we are dealing with.\n  If, in fact, we are going to call the American homeland--if, in fact, \nwe are going to call the territorial jurisdiction of the United States \nof America part of the battlefield, ought we not to have a declaration \nof war, an authorization for use of military force that identifies it \nas such? I mean, after all, the precedents that we are talking about, \nthe precedents upon which this theory is based are premised on this \nidea that you have enemy combatants who become part of an enemy's \nfighting force, as was the case of Ex parte Quirin, where you had \nAmerican citizens going over to Germany, putting on a German uniform, \nand fighting for the Germans. That was part of that war. They were \nenemy combatants on the battlefield.\n\n  There was Ex parte Milligan, where you had Confederate rebel soldiers \nwho were enemy combatants on the battlefield fighting against the \nUnited States. So if we are willing to do that, we need a declaration \nof war. We need an authorization for the use of military force that \nstates so expressly. That is the sole purpose of my amendment. I don't \nthink that is unreasonable. In fact, I think that is necessary.\n  So I would like to get this done. I would like to get this done. We \ncan get this done today. Let's have votes on all three amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I guess, finally, I woke up in the middle \nof the night last night thinking about this issue. It made me think of \na long time ago when I saw a lot of brave Americans die, some of them \nin aerial combat. Several times I thought that perhaps I could have \nprevented their deaths by being a better airman or taking certain \nactions. It bothers me to this day.\n  I can't imagine how it must bother someone who is literally signing \nthe death warrants of some people who in their innocence decided they \nwould help the United States of America. I could not bear that burden. \nI believe that what we are doing here by blocking this amendment that \nallow would these wonderful people, as described by all of our leaders, \nto leave a place where death is almost certain--at least in the case of \nsome of them--because of some exercise that would have no immediate \neffect, is that we are blocking this ability to save lives. I do not \nunderstand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, as the Senate continues to consider the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, the NDAA, I rise today to discuss \nan amendment in support of my constituents who are military retirees, \nas well as military retirees in many other States.\n  My amendment would change a provision being proposed in this bill \nthat requires military retirees and their families who don't have easy \naccess to a military treatment facility, such as on a base, to unfairly \npay higher copays for their prescription medications. TRICARE provides \nhealth care services for our servicemembers, our military retirees, and \ntheir families.\n  Using TRICARE, military retirees can get free prescription drugs at a \nmilitary treatment facility. In other words, our military retirees who \nlive close to a base have no copays for their prescription drugs. \nHowever, if they draw these prescriptions from a retail pharmacy or \nthrough the TRICARE-approved mail order system, they are required to \nmake a copayment.\n  My amendment deals with a provision in today's bill that directs the \nDepartment of Defense, or DOD, to increase these copayments that \nmilitary retirees obtain from a retail pharmacy or through mail order \nrather from a military treatment facility. The provision will require \nthose military retirees who live far away from a base, without easy \naccess to a military treatment facility, to get their prescriptions and \nto pay more for their use of retail pharmacies and mail order.\n  Why would anybody seek to make it more expensive for our military \nretirees to receive a benefit they have been promised just because they \nlive far away from a military treatment facility? The answer is simple. \nIt is sequestration. We are making cuts to an existing budget. This \nprovision was inserted as a cost-savings measure, one that tries to \nbalance and measure out the costs based upon or demanded by \nsequestration.\n  But we are doing it on the backs of military retirees. It is being \ndone to try to make some tough budget decisions. But this arbitrary \ncost-cutting measure is estimated to cost our military retiree families \nin rural areas--\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nand I emphasize ``in rural areas''--$2 billion over the next 10 years. \nI don't think it is fair for us to make those who live in rural areas--\nrural years like South Dakota--to pay a higher copay because of where \nthey live.\n  We have made promises to these men and whom who made incredible \nsacrifices to protect our country that they would be able to have \nadequate health insurance coverage, including access to prescription \ndrugs and medicines. It is not fair to make them bear a $2 billion cost \nfor prescription drugs simply because of where they live. My amendment \nwould stipulate that if a military retiree lives more than 40 miles \nfrom a military treatment facility, they would not be saddled with this \nadditional copay.\n  Further, my amendment would require an assessment by the Department \nof Defense of the added costs that would be borne by these military \nretirees and their families as a result of increased TRICARE \nprescription drug copays. This will enable Congress to make reasonable \nfuture decisions with regard to increased TRICARE prescription drug \ncopayments that may have a disproportionate impact on those living \ndistant from military treatment facilities.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my amendment, which would \nrectify a serious effect on military retirees and their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                             Foreign Policy\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, like many people in this body, I was \nhome last week in Wyoming honoring the sacrifice of America's veterans. \nEvery day we see evidence of just how much America relies on our men \nand women in uniform to keep us safe, to keep us free, to fight for our \nfreedoms, to fight for our safety. Every day we get fresh reminders \nthat the world continues to be a very dangerous place.\n  So to me it is disturbing that the Democrats in Washington have done \nso much to slow down our efforts to provide for America's troops--\ntroops we need for our national defense. The National Defense \nAuthorization Act that we are debating here sets important policies and \npriorities that have a great effect on our national security.\n  A strong American military is absolutely essential--essential as we \nneed to address the world's dangers that we face overseas before they \nbecome direct threats here at home.\n  So when I consider legislation like this, I try to keep one thing in \nmind: If we want to make America safe and secure, then we need to \nprovide the greatest possible security for our country while \nmaintaining the greatest possible freedom for the American people and \nalso at the same time improving America's standing in the world.\n  So when I look back over the past 7 years, I have to ask the Obama \nadministration--ask of the Obama administration and ask all Americans \nand anyone listening in today--how the Obama administration's foreign \npolicies have met the goals of greatest possible security, greatest \npossible freedom, and improving our standing in the world.\n  I just think that in far too many cases, in too many parts of the \nworld, the only honest conclusion is that the policies of the Obama \nadministration have actually failed. Now, I am not the only one that \nthinks so. I found it very interesting when you take a look at what \nformer President Jimmy Carter has to say when he was asked about this. \nHe said this about President Obama: ``I can't think of many nations in \nthe world where we [the United States] have a better relationship now \nthan we did when he [President Obama], took over.''\n  He went on to say that the United States' influence, prestige, and \nrespect--think about this: influence, prestige and respect--in the \nworld is probably lower now than it was 6 or 7 years ago. This is a \nformer President of the United States, a Democratic President of the \nUnited States, Jimmy Carter.\n  So let's look at some examples. It has been more than 5 years since \nthe start of the uprisings in Syria. In August of 2011, President Obama \nresponded by calling on Bashar Assad to step aside. A few months later, \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said that it was only ``a matter of \ntime before the Assad regime would fail.'' Well, that was more than 4 \nyears ago. Assad is still there. ``A matter of time,'' she said.\n  The Obama administration did not back up its words, and any \nmeaningful support for the moderate opposition in Syria was not there. \nThey did nothing. The President did nothing to enforce the so-called \nredline that he drew on Assad's use of chemical weapons against his \npeople. Assad used the chemical weapons, and the President of the \nUnited States did nothing.\n  The administration's weak response in Syria essentially gave a green \nlight for Assad to continue and a green light for Russia to come in and \npump up and protect Assad. So I find it interesting when you take a \nlook at what the President of the United States has done. If you go to \nthe Washington Post for Tuesday, June 7, this was the headline:\n\n       Empty words, empty stomachs.\n       Syrian children continue to face starvation as another \n     Obama administration promise falls by the wayside.\n\n  That is what we see with Barack Obama, another Obama administration \npromise falling by the wayside. Thousands and thousands and hundreds of \nthousands killed. The President's redline became a green light. So the \ninvitation came for Russia to come in. They have done that.\n  Well, what else has Russia done over the past 7 years? Remember how \nthe Obama administration launched its so-called Russian reset? \nPresident Obama was so intent on resetting the U.S. relations with the \nKremlin that he showed a complete lack of resolve. He gave Russia one \nconcession after another in the new START treaty. That was in 2010. He \nhad only become President in 2009. In 2010, there was one concession \nafter another.\n  President Obama showed Vladimir Putin that the American President, \nBarack Obama, could easily be pushed around. Under this treaty, America \nis cutting our nuclear arsenal while Russia is expanding theirs. It was \nallowed by the treaty. This is the President's ``best he could do.'' \nRussia responded to the reset. We remember Hillary Clinton there \npressing the reset button. Russia responded to the reset of relations \nby sending troops into Ukraine, by annexing Crimea. Russia moved.\n  President Obama shows weakness, and Russia moves. Yes, Vladimir Putin \nis a thug. When President Obama shows weakness, Putin does the things \nthat thugs do. But that is the Obama administration for you. The \nadministration's policy on Russia has not provided the greatest \npossible security for America--not at all.\n  But let's look at Iran. Last week President Obama gave a very \npolitical speech at the graduation ceremony at the U.S. Air Force \nAcademy in Colorado Springs.\n  He criticized Republicans for questioning the treaties he negotiates. \nTo me, it seems more like capitulates rather than negotiates. While \nPresident Obama negotiated a major treaty with Iran over their illicit \nnuclear weapons program, he said it was this or war. He thought the \ntreaty was so great he didn't want the Senate to have a chance to \nreview it. That was it, his way or no.\n  In his State of the Union Address in January, he said that because of \nthe nuclear deal with Iran, ``the world has avoided another war.'' \nThese are President Obama's words.\n  This is complete fiction, complete fiction. The choice was never \nbetween his deal and another war. It was a choice between a bad deal \nand a better deal, and President Obama chose a bad deal.\n  As they say in the military, if you want it bad enough, you get it \nbad. And that is what we got, a lesson President Obama apparently never \nlearned.\n  We have learned from an interview with one of the President's top \nadvisers that this was something the administration knew all along. \nThis adviser, Ben Rhodes, bragged about creating an echo chamber to \nhelp deceive--intentionally designed to deceive the American people \nabout the agreement.\n  Let's go back. Before the nuclear deal, there was actually an \ninternational ban on Iran testing ballistic missile technology. A ban \nwas in place. What is happening today? Well, Iran is right back to \ndoing the tests.\n  I remember the administration promising the inspectors would get \naccess to\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\nIran's nuclear facilities. They said anywhere, anytime, 24/7. That is \nwhat Ben Rhodes said. It turns out it is more like 24 days, not 24/7. \nThat is the kind of notice that now is needed prior to access.\n  So how is it working for Iran? Well, the Iranian economy is \nbenefiting from access to $100 billion because the Obama administration \ngave them sanctions relief. What are they going to do with the money--\nbuild roads, build hospitals, help educate the young? Don't count on it \nbecause even the President's National Security Advisor admits some of \nthis money is going to be used by Iran to keep supporting terrorist \ngroups. We see it. We know it--Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in \nYemen.\n  President Obama wanted to get a deal with Iran so badly that he got a \nvery bad deal, a bad deal--not for him--for the American people, for \nour country. The President and his foreign policy team were willing to \nsay anything to sell this deal to the American people. The \nadministration's policy in Iran has not provided the greatest possible \nsecurity for America.\n  I could go on and on talking about more places around the world. \nMembers of this body are fully aware. The American people are fully \naware of the failures of this administration. There are so many places \nwhere America does not have a better relationship now than we did when \nPresident Obama came into office--just like Jimmy Carter said: ``I \ncan't think of many nations in the world where we have a better \nrelationship now than when [President Obama] took over.''\n  So President Obama is going to spend the rest of his time in office \ntrying to create an echo chamber. He will try to convince people around \nthe world that his foreign policy has been a success, but The Economist \nmagazine recently noted America, under President Obama, has been a \nforeign policy--in their words--``pushover.''\n  As the Senate considers this vital national security legislation, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act, I think it is important that we \nhonestly evaluate what the President's record really is, and today the \nworld is less safe, less secure, and less stable than it was 7 years \nago. The President and all the people who have been a part of his \nforeign policy team over the years will say whatever it takes to try to \nhide and disguise the facts. It is time to block out the echo chamber. \nIt is time to ignore the spin. We need to make sure we are providing \nthe greatest possible security for America while maintaining the \ngreatest possible freedom for the American people and improving \nAmerica's standing in the world. That is our responsibility as a \nlegislative body.\n  For decades upon decades, America has been the most powerful and \nrespected Nation on the face of the Earth. Under President Obama, \nAmerican power has declined and respect around the world has \nevaporated.\n  President Obama was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. It was \ncompletely undeserved, and it deserves to be removed from him if \nsomething like this could actually be done. Unfortunately, it is not \npossible to revoke a Nobel Peace Prize. In this case it should be. That \nprize remains undeserved.\n  American men and women in uniform deserve better than what they have \ngotten from their Commander in Chief. It is now up to Congress to make \nsure they receive the support, the equipment, and the technology they \nneed to protect our country and our citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the Federal Government's No. 1 \nresponsibility is to protect the American people. As the Obama \nadministration approaches its final months, the American people still \ndo not feel, with any degree of confidence, that Washington is taking \nthe proper steps to carry out that responsibility. The Islamic State \nterror group has repeatedly encouraged sympathizers in the West to \nlaunch domestic attacks. In the group's self-declared caliphate in \nSyria and Iraq, it continues to carry out atrocities on a daily basis.\n  ISIS has no intention of letting up, and the President's strategy of \nscattered attacks is doing little to slow the terror groups' strength. \nA group President Obama once dubbed the JV team has become a clear and \nserious threat during his watch.\n  That is just one of the many failures during this administration's \nforeign policy which is rooted in wishful thinking rather than grounded \nin reality. The idea that we can wish away the Nation's threats that \nour Nation faces by passively withdrawing from the international stage \nis a dangerous approach. It is this mentality that the President and \nhis aides used to justify not calling jihadi attacks what they are, \nradical Islamic terrorism. The President has convinced himself that \nradical Islamic terrorism will not be a threat if we just call it \nsomething else. Clearly, this is not true.\n  It is the same mindset that thinks closing Gitmo and moving dangerous \nterrorists to U.S. soil is the right thing to do, and it is how we \nended up with a deal that does nothing to prevent Iran from going \nnuclear but instead emboldens it to belligerently threaten the United \nStates, our allies like Israel, and its neighboring Arab States.\n  The regime in Tehran acts as if it is virtually untouchable as a \nresult of the Obama administration's agreement. Iran has no intentions \nof being a responsible, peaceful player in the international community. \nEven before the deal's implementation, Iran shamelessly violated U.N. \nSecurity Council mandates. Now, free from sanctions, the Iranians are \nflush with resources to build an arsenal to fund terror across the \nregion. None of this seems to matter to the White House, which was bent \non making this deal the cornerstone of its foreign policy.\n  The administration was so determined to sell this deal that it \nengaged in a propaganda campaign, enlisting outside groups to create an \n``echo chamber'' and feeding material to a press corps that White House \nstaffers said ``knew nothing'' about diplomacy. The administration even \ntook extreme steps to keep the uncomfortable truths from the American \npeople by removing a damaging exchange about whether officials lied \nabout secret talks with Iran in 2012.\n  All of this just adds to the perception that the Obama administration \nwas willing to go to any length to get this deal done, no matter how \nbad it is for our national security.\n  Senate Republicans have tried to correct this, of course. We wanted \nto stop this ill-advised Iran deal, but the minority leader forced his \ncaucus to protect the President's legacy.\n  We have taken efforts to force the President to present a coherent \nplan to defeat ISIS abroad and to protect Americans here at home. That \nplan is still nonexistent.\n  We have inserted language into law after law to prevent the closure \nof Gitmo. In fact, the President is once again threatening to veto the \nbill we are currently considering, in part, due to the language that \nprevents closure of the facility.\n  We shouldn't be moving dangerous terrorists out of Gitmo. If \nanything, we should be moving more terrorists into Gitmo. The state-of-\nthe-art facility is more than serving its purpose for detaining the \nworst of the worst, obtaining valuable intelligence from them, and \nkeeping these terrorists who are bent on destroying America from \nreturning to the battlefield.\n  A report from the Washington Post yesterday indicates that the Obama \nadministration has evidence that about a dozen detainees released from \nGitmo have launched attacks against the United States or allied forces \nin Afghanistan that have resulted in American deaths.\n  As the threat posed by ISIS grows, Gitmo remains the only option to \nhouse these terrorists. Any facility on U.S. soil is not an option. It \nnever was with Al Qaeda terrorists, nor can it be with ISIS terrorists.\n  The President has failed to understand the gravity these terrorists \npose to our homeland. Radical Islamic terrorists around the globe are \npledging allegiance to the group and, as we have seen in Paris, \nBrussels, and San Bernardino, they are committed to and capable of \nhitting Westerners at home.\n  The President has never presented a strategy to Congress for \neliminating ISIS, and our sporadic airstrikes have done little to stop \nthe group from pressing forward and attempting to strengthen its global \nreach.\n  While ISIS grows and the United States sits idly by, Iran, Russia, \nChina, and North Korea have ramped up their belligerent actions, \nputting our security at risk around the world. This will\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nonly continue to increase if we continue to chase the diplomacy to the \npoint where it puts the safety of the American people at risk, to the \npoint where any leverage the United States started with is gone, and to \nthe point where we withdraw from conflicts with enemies because it is \neasier to allow someone else to fight the battle.\n  We are trying to fix the problems created by the Obama \nadministration's failures so we can restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people that their government is working to protect them here \nand abroad. Passage of the bill before us this week is a good step in \nthe right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am not on the floor to interrupt any kind \nof debate relative to this bill, but given the fact we are at a \nstalemate situation and nobody is on the floor, I thought I would at \nleast highlight a foreign policy speech I have been wanting to give. I \nplan to do it in significant detail on Monday, if the hours work out as \nI think they will.\n  Let me just take this short amount of time to summarize some of what \nI have been thinking and that I think is something my colleagues and \nall of us ought to be thinking about in terms of our foreign policy. Of \ncourse, it is related to our national defense, and that is what we are \ndebating today, supporting our military. It is unfortunate we are in \nthe situation we are in, but nevertheless I wish to take a few minutes \nto discuss what the next President will be inheriting--whomever that \nPresident turns out to be, a Republican or Democrat and potentially, I \nguess I should say, an Independent, although I don't think that will \nhappen.\n  The next President is going to be faced with a bucket full of foreign \npolicy issues that President is going to have to deal with. As I said, \nI hope to speak next week at some time in greater length about the \nchallenges our President will face, but let me summarize a few key \npoints that deserve further discussion among my colleagues, and, \nhopefully, by the Presidential candidates during the election campaign.\n  It is clear to me, and I believe it is clear to my Senate colleagues, \nthat the President has failed to clearly define America's global role \nand a coherent strategy to pursue that goal. It is equally clear that \nhis vision of America's role has been woefully inadequate to respond to \nthe growing crises throughout the world.\n  Someone earlier here mentioned, and I had mentioned before, that the \nworld is on fire. The Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \nwith 51 years of service in the intelligence world, has said he has \nnever seen anything like this in his 51 years of service--the multitude \nof crises that exist around the world and that we are confronted with. \nAs the world's leading Nation--the Nation that has provided freedom for \nhundreds of millions, if not billions, of people by taking the lead to \nfight terrorism, to fight the evil that exists in this world--it is \nimportant we understand America's decisions. The decisions made by \nAmerica's leaders have enormous impact on events around the world.\n  For nearly 8 years, we have been trying to read the President's \nforeign policy tea leaves to divine his purposes and methods of a \nforeign policy that, to me and to many, seems chaotic, ad hoc, and \ndirectionless. We don't know what the administration is trying to \naccomplish--whether we should or should not engage and at what cost it \nwould be. These all remain mysteries--mysteries to us here in the \nSenate, where we have an obligation to advise and consent on foreign \npolicy, and to the American people, who continue to ask us: What is \ngoing on here? What is America's role? What are we doing? What should \nwe be doing? What is the debate?\n  The task is made even more daunting by the crisis-ridden world we now \nface. The next President will face foreign policy challenges from \nacross the globe, but three stand out that I would especially like to \ntouch on this evening and that I think are especially dangerous. Those \nthree are the Middle East, Europe, and Russia.\n  Let's look at the Middle East. The region is disintegrating. We are \nnow in the midst of the most profound and dangerous redefinition of the \nregion since the end of the Ottoman Empire in 1917. Borders, regimes, \nstability, and alliances are all being swept away with no clear \nsuccessors.\n  In the center of all of it is ISIS--the most lethal, best funded, \ndangerous terrorist organization in history--created and metastasized \nin a vacuum largely, unfortunately, of our own making.\n  At the same time, the civil war in Syria is continuing into its sixth \nyear. The war has created nearly 300,000 dead, with millions of \nrefugees and internally displaced persons and with no end in sight.\n  Iran continues its long history of destabilizing, hostile activities \nin the region, now growing its disruptive capacity in the wake of the \nmisbegotten nuclear deal.\n  Europe is dealing with the largest refugee migrant flow since World \nWar II. This migration is entirely unsustainable and unmanageable, \nthreatening European unity and individual state stability. This crisis \ncould unravel the EU itself and cost trillions of euros. More than \nthat, it is a humanitarian disaster.\n  The Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Breedlove, in a \ndiscussion I had with him not that long ago, correctly said the \nmigration flow has been ``weaponized.'' He argues the migration crisis \nhas become a cover for flows of dangerous terrorists to Europe and \nbeyond.\n  Our Russia policy is one of the biggest and most long-term failures \nof American leadership in our age. The administration's infamous reset \nof Russian policy, loudly championed at the time by Mrs. Clinton, by \nthe way, preceded Russia's invasion and annexation of a neighbor.\n  Since the so-called reset with Russia, Russia has acquired a vastly \ngreater role in the Middle East, where Russia had not before been \npresent, much less dominant. It has demonstrated reliability as a \nmodern capable military partner, in contrast with our own \nunreliability.\n  These are just three of the crises the next President will face. \nJames Clapper, speaking at a public hearing before the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, handed out the current assessment of the \ncrises the world faces. It was 29 pages long, with eight regional \ncrises--I named three of them--and each one of them posing a \nsignificant threat to world order and to our own people here in the \nUnited States.\n  Since that reset, Russia has acquired a vastly greater role, as I \nhave said. The next President is going to have to face not just these \nthree major crises but many, many more, and I will talk about some of \nthem next week.\n  We need a policy from this President and from the White House that is \nbased on a clear linkage to U.S. national interests and that will \narticulate a coherent strategy to guide policy and actions that we \ntake; that will be an accurate assessment of consequences, both short-\nterm and long term; that will be transparent, with candor and realism; \nthat will have ensured resources adequate to secure the defined policy \nor task that is being laid out; and that will show strength and \nleadership coming from the Nation that every other free nation in the \nworld depends upon for guidance, for strength, as an ally or coalition.\n  The American people are yearning for a coherent foreign policy that \nis clear-eyed, articulate, transparent, and with common sense. They \nwant to see it, and they want to understand it, and we have an \nobligation to let them know what it is. We are not going to get that \nout of this administration. That is clear. There continues to be \nconfused, behind-the-curve reaction to world events and a lack of a \nsolid policy to deal with it.\n  If the next President can give the American people a coherent foreign \npolicy that is clear-eyed, articulate, transparent and with common \nsense, we will once again begin to reassert ourselves in terms of being \na nation dedicated to finding peace and solutions to major crises \naround the world. But if we remain guessing about purpose and \ndirection, while the world disintegrates around us, our sons and \ndaughters will pay a great price. As a consequence, America will \ncontinue to be a nation in retreat, and the free world will be confused \nand looking for a leader.\n  With that, I yield the floor, as I notice another of my colleagues on \nthe floor to speak.\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Gaspee Days\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come here, as I do every year in the \nSenate, to commemorate the anniversary of a brave blow that Rhode \nIsland struck for liberty and justice--the Gaspee Affair of 1772.\n  On the night of June 9, and into the morning of June 10, 1772, in the \nwaters of Rhode Island, a band of American patriots pushed back against \ntheir British overlords and drew the first blood of the struggle that \nwould become the American Revolution.\n  American schoolchildren, the pages here in this room, and all of us \nno doubt learned in their history books of the Boston revelers who \npainted their faces and pushed tea into Boston harbor. But those same \nhistory books often omit the tale of the Gaspee, a bloodier saga, which \noccurred more than a year earlier.\n  As tensions with the American colonies grew, King George III \nstationed revenue cutters, armed customs patrol vessels, along the \nAmerican coastline to prevent smuggling, enforce the payment of taxes, \nand impose the authority of the Crown. One of the most notorious of \nthese ships was the HMS Gaspee, stationed in Rhode Island's \nNarragansett Bay. The Gaspee and its captain, Lieutenant William \nDudingston, were known for destroying fishing vessels, unjustly seizing \ncargo, and flagging down ships that had properly passed customs \ninspection in Newport only to interrogate and humiliate the colonials.\n  ``The British armed forces had come to regard almost every local \nmerchant as a smuggler and a cheat,'' wrote author Nick Bunker about \nthat era. Rhode Islanders chafed at this egregious disruption of their \nliberty at sea, for ``out of all colonies, Rhode Island was the one \nwhere the ocean entered most deeply into the lives of the people.'' \nSomething was bound to give.\n  The spark was lit on June 9, 1772, when the Gaspee attempted to stop \nthe Hannah, a swift Rhode Island trading sloop that ran routes to New \nYork through Long Island Sound, bound that afternoon for Providence \nfrom Newport. When the Gaspee sought to hail and board the Hannah, the \nHannah's captain, Benjamin Lindsey, ignored Lieutenant Dudingston's \ncommands. As the Gaspee gave chase, Captain Lindsey veered north toward \nPawtuxet Cove, toward the shallows off Namquid Point--known today as \nGaspee Point--knowing that the tide was low and falling and that the \nHannah drew less water than the Gaspee. The Hannah shot over the \nshallows off the point, but the larger Gaspee ran dead into a sandbar \nand stuck fast in a falling tide.\n  Captain Lindsey wasted no time in reporting the Gaspee's predicament \nto his fellow Rhode Islanders, who rallied at the sound of a beating \ndrum to Sabin's Tavern in Providence. They resolved to end once and for \nall the Gaspee's menace in Rhode Island waters.\n  That night, the men shoved off from Fenner's Wharf, paddling eight \nlongboats quietly down Narragansett Bay, under a moonless sky, toward \nthe stranded Gaspee. As told by LCDR Benjamin F. Armstrong in Naval \nHistory Magazine, they were led by Captain Lindsey and Abraham Whipple, \na merchant captain who had served as a privateer in the French and \nIndian War and who would go on to command a Continental Navy squadron \nin the Revolution. Armstrong describes the excursion as ``an \nincreasingly rowdy group of Rhode Islanders who were ready to strike \nout at the oppressive work of the Royal Navy.''\n  Beware, increasingly rowdy groups of Rhode Islanders will be our \nlesson.\n  The boats silently surrounded the Gaspee, then shouted for Lieutenant \nDudingston to surrender the ship. Surprised and enraged, Dudingston \nrefused. Armstrong recounts the fierce, if brief, fight that ensued:\n\n       Dudingston shouted down the hatch, calling for his crew to \n     hurry on deck whether they had clothes on or not, and then \n     ran to the starboard bow, where the first of the raiding \n     boats were coming alongside the ship. He swung at the \n     attackers with his sword, pushing the first attempted boarder \n     back into the boat. Then a musket shot rang out. The ball \n     tore through the lieutenant's left arm, breaking it, and into \n     his groin. He fell back on the deck as the raiders swarmed \n     over the sides of the ship. Swinging axe handles and wooden \n     staves, the raiders beat the British seamen back down the \n     hatchway and kept them below decks. Dudingston struggled aft \n     and collapsed in his own blood at the companionway to his \n     cabin at the stern of the ship.\n\n  The struggle was over. One of the Rhode Islanders, a physician named \nJohn Mawney, tended to Dudingston's wounds. The patriots commandeered \nthe Gaspee, loaded the British crew onto the longboats and took them \nashore, and then set combustibles along the length of the Gaspee. They \nset her ablaze, and watched from a hillside onshore as the ship burned.\n  When the fire reached the ship's magazine, this is what ensued. The \nGaspee was no more.\n  You can be sure that the British authorities immediately called for \nthe heads of the American saboteurs. An inquiry was launched and a \nlavish reward was posted. But even though virtually all of Rhode Island \nknew about the attack, investigators were able to find no witnesses \nwilling to name names. The entire colony seemed afflicted with a \nterrible case of amnesia.\n  William Staple's ``Documentary History of the Destruction of the \nGaspee'' describes this distinct cloudiness of Rhode Island memories.\n  James Sabin said: ``I could give no information relative to the \nassembling, arming, training or leading on the people concerned in \ndestroying the schooner Gaspee.''\n  Stephen Gulley said: ``As to my own knowledge, I know nothing about \nit.''\n  John Cole said he ``saw several people collected together, but did \nnot know any of them.''\n  William Thayer was asked: ``Do you know anything?''\n  He said a simple ``No.''\n  D. Hitchcock said: ``We met at Mr. Sabin's, by ourselves, and about 8 \no'clock, I went to the door, or, finally, kitchen, and saw a number of \npeople in the street, but paid no attention to them.''\n  Arthur Fenner said: ``I am a man of seventy-four years of age, and \nvery infirmed, and at the time said schooner was taken and plundered, I \nwas in my bed.''\n  Completely frustrated by the Rhode Islanders' stonewalling, the \nBritish commissioners dropped the inquiry, finding it ``totally \nimpossible at present to make a report, not having all the evidence we \nhave reason to expect.''\n  Nick Bunker wrote, ``The British had never seen anything quite like \nthe Gaspee affair. . . . Like the Boston Tea Party, their attack on the \nship amounted to a gesture of absolute denial: A complete rejection of \nthe empire's right to rule.''\n  Rhode Islanders had grown accustomed to and fiercely protective of a \nlevel of personal freedom unique in that time. ``Even by American \nstandards,'' says Bunker, Rhode Island ``was an extreme case of popular \ngovernment.''\n  As Frederic D. Schwarz noted in American Heritage magazine, one of \nthe exasperated British investigators even scorned the Rhode Island \nColony as ``a downright democracy.''\n  This Rhode Island independence streak was well known to the British \nimperialist. But the burning of the Gaspee foretold greater struggles \nto come. In the words of Commander Armstrong:\n\n       [British officers] were beginning to realize there was \n     something more dangerous out on the water and in American \n     harbors. Alongside the salt air and the smell of wet canvas \n     was the scent of treason. A revolution began on the sandbar \n     of Namquid Point--in the spot that bears the name Gaspee on \n     today's charts of the Narragansett.\n\n  Oh, and Boston: Nice job a year later with the tea bags.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to stand once again with \nSenator Gillibrand in support of the Military Justice Improvement Act.\n  Two years ago, Congress enacted a number of commonsense reforms as \npart of the National Defense Authorization Act. These changes were \nmostly good, commonsense measures, and I supported them; however, they \nwere not sufficient.\n  As I said at that time a year ago, we are past the point of tinkering \nwith the current system and hoping that does\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nthe trick. I urged the Senate at that time to support bold actions that \nwould make sexual assault in the military a thing of the past.\n  Unfortunately, those of us arguing for the Military Justice \nImprovement Act did not prevail. We were told to wait and see if the \nreforms that were included would work, while leaving in place the \ncurrent military justice system. Well, we have had time to see if \nthings have really changed. They have not. The rate of sexual assault \nin the military is unchanged.\n  Forty-two percent of servicemember survivors who reported retaliation \nwere actually encouraged to drop the issue by their supervisor or \nsomeone else in the chain of command. That means a crime was committed, \nand you shouldn't bother to report the crime.\n  A majority of servicemember survivors indicated that they were not \nsatisfied with the official actions taken against the alleged \nperpetrator.\n  Three out of four survivors lacked sufficient confidence in the \nmilitary justice system to report the crime. Isn't that awful. If we \ndidn't have confidence in the local police to report a crime, we know \njust how high the crime rate would go. I suppose somebody is going to \ntell me that can't apply to the military, but it does. In fact, there \nhas been a decrease in the percentage of survivors willing to make an \nunrestricted report of sexual assault.\n  Two years ago, when military leaders were arguing against the reforms \nSenator Gillibrand and I and others were advocating, Congress was \nprovided with data from military sexual assault cases that we now know \nwas very misleading. But those statistics and data, quite frankly, \ncarried great weight with a lot of our colleagues here in the Senate. \nWe were told at that time that military commanders were taking cases \nthat were ``declined'' by civilian prosecutors. The implication was \nvery clear, as we were told that things will be all right; the military \nsystem results in prosecutions that civilian prosecutors turn down.\n  An independent report by Protect Our Defenders and reported by the \nAssociated Press shows that there was no evidence that the military was \ntaking cases that civilian prosecutors would not take.\n  When Senator Gillibrand and I wrote to the President asking for an \nindependent investigation of how this misleading information was \nallowed to be presented to Congress, guess what. We received a response \nfrom Secretary Carter, and that response said it was all a \nmisunderstanding. The Secretary's response went into a semantic \ndiscussion of the meaning of certain terms.\n  Apparently, in the military justice system, when a civilian \nprosecutor agrees to defer to the jurisdiction of the military to \nprosecute a case, it is listed as a ``declination.'' Such a situation \nis very different--very different--from a civilian prosecutor refusing \nto prosecute a case. If the military asks the civilian prosecutor to \ndefer to the military's jurisdiction or if it is done by mutual \nagreement, it is not a case of a civilian prosecutor turning down a \nprosecution.\n  As I said, a review of the cases used to back up the Department of \nDefense's claims last year found no evidence that civilian prosecutors \nhad refused those same prosecutions. Nevertheless, that was the clear \nimplication of the statistics supplied to Congress by the Pentagon last \nyear, and we were all sucked into that.\n  The response to our letter to President Obama claimed that the \nauthors of that review just didn't understand the meaning of the term \n``declined'' as it is used in the military justice system. The reality \nis that the information the Pentagon provided to Congress was obviously \npresented in a very misleading way.\n  So this question: When military leaders claimed that civilian \nprosecutors had declined to prosecute cases that the military then \nprosecuted, would it have had the same impact if they added a footnote \nsaying that, in this context, ``declined'' doesn't really mean \ndeclined?\n  To summarize, the reforms we were told would reduce military sexual \nassaults haven't worked. And, folks, a rape is a rape, and a rape is a \ncrime, and it needs to be reported, and it needs to be prosecuted. And, \nof course, a chief rationale for opposing our reform of the military \njustice system was based on very misleading data, as I hope I have made \nvery clear.\n  So how many more lives need to be ruined before we are ready to take \nbold action? If a sexual assault isn't prosecuted, predators will \nremain in the military, and that results in a perception that sexual \nassault is actually tolerated in the military culture. That destroys \nmorale, and it also destroys lives. The men and women who have \nvolunteered to place their lives on the line deserve better.\n  Taking prosecutions out of the hands of commanders and giving them to \nprofessional prosecutors, who are independent of the chain of command, \nwill help ensure impartial justice for the men and women of our armed \nservices. That is what Senator Gillibrand's and my amendment is all \nabout.\n  Let's not wait any longer. Let's not be sucked into certain arguments \nthat we have been sucked into in the past. Let's stand up and change \nthe culture of the military so that people are prosecuted when they do \nwrongdoing. Let's get it done, and get it done on this reauthorization \nbill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, one of the issues being discussed this \nweek is the restrictions on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the \nUnited States. In November 2015 and in previous years, President Obama \nhas signed annual defense bills that include a prohibition on the use \nof Federal funds to close Guantanamo. The National Defense \nAuthorization Act, NDAA, for 2017 keeps this crucial prohibition.\n  Today I want to discuss one of the often-overlooked reasons why that \nprohibition should continue: the troubling immigration implications of \ntransferring dangerous terrorist detainees from Guantanamo to the \nUnited States.\n  This is a serious issue with serious consequences, and it is one that \nhasn't always been considered as prominently as it should be. A March \n2016 report by the Center for Immigration Studies highlighted this \nproblem, and I will mention that report again in a moment.\n  About 80 detainees remain at Guantanamo today. In April of this year, \nnine detainees were released and returned to Saudi Arabia. According to \nmedia reports, one of the most dangerous terror suspects at Guantanamo \nwas among those released, and he was still committed to jihad and \nkilling Americans. He and the rest of the nine released terrorists \ncould very well return to the battlefield after their so-called \nrehabilitation program in Saudi Arabia.\n  Rowan Scarborough of the Washington Times writes that this is exactly \nwhat has happened with about 30 percent of the detainees that were \nreleased from Guantanamo: they have resumed or are suspected of \nrestarting, terrorist activity.\n  In fact, Obama administration officials have admitted that these \ndetainees are killing Americans. As the Washington Post reported \nearlier this week, ``at least 12 detainees released from the prison at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, have launched attacks against U.S. or allied \nforces in Afghanistan, killing about a half-dozen Americans.'' These \nnumbers will likely increase as our intelligence agencies continue to \nobtain information. Clearly, these detainees are a deadly group who \nshould be held in Guantanamo for as long as necessary.\n  Fortunately, right now the NDAA specifically forbids spending \ntaxpayer funds to transfer any of these detainees to the United States. \nThat is why, in a CNN interview earlier this year, Secretary of Defense \nAsh Carter stated that transferring Guantanamo prisoners to the United \nStates is against the law.\n  But Secretary Carter also said ``there are people in Gitmo who are so \ndangerous we cannot transfer them to the custody of another government \nno matter how much we trust that government . . . we need to find \nanother place and it would have to be the United States.'' But if these \nindividuals are too dangerous for any other country, aren't they too \ndangerous to bring to the U.S. as well? Why would we bring these \njihadist terrorist detainees into the United States when this would \npose significant national security risks to the American people?\n  What particularly worries me about Secretary Carter's statement is \nthat\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\nany transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the United States would apply \nhighly ambiguous legal doctrines that could mean these terrorists would \neventually be released on the streets in our homeland.\n  Very serious questions arise from this proposition, as the \nimmigration implications of such a potential transfer are far from \nclear. Some of those questions include: What sort of immigration status \nwould the Guantanamo detainees have? May Guantanamo detainees be \ndetained indefinitely? Could Guantanamo detainees apply for asylum? \nWhat immigration benefits would the Guantanamo detainees be eligible \nfor? Perhaps most important, how would U.S. courts rule on these \nissues, particularly if a future court decides that the war on terror \nhas ceased? We've seen Federal courts in the past grant Guantanamo \ndetainees greater rights than Congress intended.\n  It is my understanding that if these detainees were to be transferred \nto the United States, it would likely be done by granting them \n``parole'' status. Immigration parole does not constitute an admission \nto the United States, but provides permission to enter the United \nStates. It is supposed to be provided on a case-by-case basis, based on \n``urgent humanitarian reasons'' or ``significant public benefit.''\n  As an initial matter, I don't see how paroling any of these \nterrorists into the country could be said to be either a humanitarian \ngesture or one that constituted a ``significant public benefit.'' But \nin addition to that concern, there is almost no precedent for \nimmigration parole being used as a means of indefinite detention of \naliens on U.S. territory. It should be used as a means to an end, such \nas bringing a criminal to the U.S. to serve as witness in a trial or \nallowing certain individuals in the U.S. to obtain emergency medical \ncare.\n  Consequently, as the Center for Immigration Studies report I \nmentioned before recently put it, ``If the Guantanamo detainees are \ntransferred to the United States, we are faced with the very real \nlikelihood of open-ended immigration paroles, which rely on indefinite \nimprisonment under undefined, little-understood rules and protocols.''\n  Given these legal uncertainties, the most likely results for \ndetainees brought to the United States who will not be tried for their \nterrorist activities, or who the administration otherwise intends to \nhold indefinitely, are writs of habeas corpus and complaints of \nviolations of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n  The war on terror has no end in sight, so these legal actions would \ninevitably arise as a result of the detainees' newly established \npresence on American soil and the indefinite nature of their detention.\n  I would further expect Federal courts to be particularly willing to \nentertain such writs or other legal actions if any of the detainees are \ntried for their crimes but not found guilty. And the risk of finding \nsympathetic, activist judges surely is heightened in the cases of the \n28 detainees already cleared for transfer but who have not yet been \nreleased.\n  Even if some detainees are prosecuted and found guilty, they would \nserve a sentence, be ordered removed from the United States, and, \nideally, be removed from our country upon the sentence's completion. \nBut what happens if no other country--particularly their home country--\nis willing to take them? This would be very likely, as statistics \nprovided by the Department of Homeland Security show there are many \ncountries who will simply not allow the hardcore terrorist Guantanamo \ndetainees back into their country. Countries like Iran, Pakistan, \nChina, Somalia and Liberia, just to mention a few, won't take custody \nof these enemy combatants. Alternatively, what if their home country, \nor another country, is willing to take them but that country is also \nlikely to mistreat them to gain information about their terrorist \nactivities? In that case, our obligations under the Convention Against \nTorture would prohibit us from returning the detainees to those \ncountries.\n  If any of those removable detainees do remain in the United States, \nwe won't be able to keep them detained for very long. The U.S. Supreme \nCourt ruled in Zadvydas v. Davis that the United States may not \nindefinitely detain removable aliens just because no other country \nwould accept them. In order for the U.S. Government to justify the \ndetention of foreign nationals longer than six months, the basic rule \nis that the government must show that there is a ``significant \nlikelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.'' The \nZadvydas decision has thus set a precedent that dangerous, deportable, \nconvicted criminal aliens who have completed their sentences, but who \ncannot be deported to other countries, cannot continue to be \nindefinitely detained and must be released.\n  Equally concerning, if a trial were to take place that resulted in a \nsentence of anything other than capital punishment or life in prison, \nthen the Zadvydas precedent would most likely require the release of \nthe terrorist within 6 months of the completion of his or her sentence. \nThe danger any such releases could present has unfortunately already \nbeen illustrated. The Zadvydas decision has already resulted in \nextraordinary violence against Americans and threats to public safety.\n  In the last 3 years alone, almost 10,000 criminal aliens have been \nreleased from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody because \nof Zadvydas. Too many of these aliens are released because the U.S. \ncannot obtain travel documents from home countries. This has real \nconsequences.\n  For example, in Hillsdale, NY, a criminal alien who had been \nconvicted of sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl was released onto \nAmerican streets when his home country of Bangladesh refused to take \nhim back after he had served his sentence. After his release, he \nproceeded to go on a rampage of theft and violence culminating in the \nbrutal murder of a 73-year-old woman.\n  Given that the Obama administration already allows the release of \nconvicted, dangerous, criminal aliens into our communities, I am deeply \nconcerned that a similar situation would arise from transferring the \nterror suspects from Guantanamo to the United States. Bringing these \nhardcore terrorists to the United States would be tantamount to \ninjecting a disease into our society.\n  As you can see, the potential transfer of these detainees presents a \nreal problem with serious consequences. Many decisions will have to be \nmade and discussions had regarding the viability of transferring these \nhardcore terrorist detainees to the United States.\n  If the Obama administration decides to transfer these detainees to \nthe continental United States, this illegal action would force serious \nconstitutional issues that could lead to an impasse. The matter of \nbringing hardcore terrorists into the United States would undoubtedly \ngo before the Supreme Court. Pushing to close Guantanamo and bringing \nthese hardcore terrorists to the United States without exhausting all \nalternative options is especially risky to the American people as it \npertains to national security and public safety.\n  I refer my colleagues to the Center for Immigration Studies Web site \nand the March 2016 report by Dan Cadman entitled, ``The Immigration \nImplications of Moving Guantanamo Detainees to the United States.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in a moment I am going to ask unanimous \nconsent to address an amendment of mine to the national defense \nauthorization bill, amendment No. 4066.\n  There is legislation I have introduced with a number of my colleagues \nthat then is reflected perhaps identically in the amendment I hope we \nwill consider this evening. This amendment is related to the National \nLabor Relations Act, which was enacted in 1935. That legislation \nexempted Federal, State, and local governments but did not explicitly \nmention Native American governments from the purview of the National \nLabor Relations Act. Despite that not being mentioned for 70 years, the \nNLRB honored the sovereign status of tribes accorded to them by the \nU.S. Constitution. In fact, there is a good argument that the reason \ntribal governments were not listed in the Labor Relations Act was \nbecause the Constitution made clear the sovereign nation of tribes. So \nfor 70 years, they were not affected by the NRLB. Unfortunately, in my \nview, beginning in 2004,\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nthe NLRB reversed its treatment of tribes and legally challenged the \nright of tribes to enact so-called right-to-work laws.\n  The amendment I have offered to this bill is pretty straightforward. \nThe National Labor Relations Act is amended to provide that any \nenterprise or institution owned and operated by an Indian tribe and \nlocated on tribal lands is not subject to the NLRA.\n  This narrow amendment protects tribal sovereignty and gives tribal \ngovernments the ability to make the best decisions for their people. \nThe amendment seeks to treat tribal governments no differently from \nother levels of government, just like we treat cities and counties \nacross the country.\n  Sovereignty is an important aspect of tribal relations with their \ntribal members. It is something tribes take very seriously, and in my \nview, it is something Members of the Senate should take very seriously, \nin part because it is the right policy, and perhaps even more \nimportantly, it is the right moral position to have. And of equal \nvalue, it is what the Constitution of the United States says.\n\n  The legislation on which this amendment is based was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives in a bipartisan vote. Even our former \ncolleague, the late Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, wrote in 2009 that \n``Congress should affirm the original construction of the NLRA by \nexpressly including Indian tribes in the definition of employer.''\n  This amendment presents Congress with an opportunity to reaffirm the \nconstitutional recognition of tribes and the rights accorded to them \nunder the supreme law of our land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up my amendment, amendment No. 4066; that there be \n10 minutes of debate, equally divided; and that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate vote in relation to the amendment \nwith no second-degree amendment in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nexplain if I could.\n  First of all, this doesn't belong in NDAA. This is not a defense \nissue, but I would like to talk more substantively about it and then \nmake another statement.\n  I strongly support tribal sovereignty. I know my colleagues \nappreciate Senator Moran's genuine interest in this. He is my friend. \nWe have worked on a number of issues in banking together. We don't \nagree on this, but that is the way things are. I do believe both sides \nof the aisle do support tribal sovereignty.\n  This amendment, though, is not about tribal sovereignty. It is about \nundermining labor laws--laws that protect the rights of workers to \norganize and collectively bargain--one of America's great values that \nmore than almost anything--other than democratic government--created \nand maintained a middle class, organizing and bargaining collectively. \nSpecifically, the amendment attempts to overturn NLRB decisions that \nhave asserted the Board's jurisdiction over labor disputes on tribal \nlands.\n  The Board has methodically evaluated when they do and don't have \njurisdiction on tribal lands by using a very carefully crafted test to \nensure that the Board's jurisdiction would not violate tribal rights \nand does not interfere in exclusive right to self-governance.\n  In a June 2015 decision, the NLRB employed the test and did not \nassert jurisdiction in a tribal land-labor dispute. Instead, the \namendment is part of an agenda to undermine the rights of American \nworkers. We have seen it regularly. We see it in State capitols. We saw \nit in my State capitol 5 years ago when the Governor went after \ncollective bargaining rights for public employees.\n  For the first and only time in American history, voters in a \nstatewide election said no to rolling back collective bargaining \nrights. It was the only time it ever happened, and it was by 22 \npercentage points.\n  The amendment is part of an agenda to undermine the rights of \nAmerican workers, including 600,000 employees of tribal casinos--75 \npercent of them are not nonnative Indians, non-Indians. Courts have \nupheld the application to the tribes of Federal employment laws, \nincluding Fair Labor Standards Act, the Operational Safety and Health \nAct, the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, and title III of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  In addition to harming the thousands of already organized workers at \ncommercial tribal enterprises, this amendment would establish a \ndangerous precedent to weaken longstanding worker protections on tribal \nlands.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MORAN. I regret the objection from the Senator from Ohio and \nindicate that we will continue our efforts to see that this issue is \naddressed and the sovereignty of tribes across the Nation is protected.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am on the floor this afternoon, along \nwith my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Connecticut. \nHe is going to be here shortly to speak as well, and I thank him for \nhis leadership throughout the NDAA process.\n  We are here because we strongly believe that in Congress we should be \nworking on ways to boost economic security for more families and help \nour economy grow from the middle out, not from the top down. A \nfundamental part of that is making sure our companies pay workers \nfairly and provide them with safe workplaces and treat them with \nrespect. Unfortunately, Senator Blumenthal and I have come to the floor \nto speak against a provision that would seriously undermine the spirit \nof bipartisanship we have cultivated thus far.\n  As it stands, this bill contains a provision that would help shield \ndefense contractors that steal money out of their workers' paychecks or \nrefuse to pay the minimum wage. It would help protect the companies \nthat violate workplace safety laws while receiving taxpayer dollars, \nand it would allow companies with a history of discriminating against \nwomen, people of color, and individuals with disabilities to continue \nreceiving defense contracts, and to me that is unacceptable.\n  For too long, the Federal Government has awarded billions of taxpayer \ndollars to companies that rob workers of their paychecks and fail to \nmaintain safe working conditions. To help right those wrongs, President \nObama issued the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order, and I \nwas very proud to support him.\n  Under the new proposed guidelines, when a company applies for a \nFederal contract, they will need to be upfront about their safety, \nhealth, and labor violations over the past 3 years. That way, \ngovernment agencies can consider an employer's record of providing \nworkers with a safe workplace and paying workers what they have earned \nbefore granting or renewing Federal contracts. To be clear, the new \nrules do not prevent these companies from winning Federal contracts. \nThe new protections will just improve transparency so government \nagencies are aware of the company's violations and can help them come \ninto compliance with the law. These are worker protection laws that are \nalready on the books, including laws that affect our veterans, such as \nthe Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974.\n  This will have some major benefits for our workers and taxpayers. \nFirst of all, it will help hold Federal contractors accountable. \nAmerican taxpayers should have the basic guarantee that their dollars \nare going to responsible contractors that will not steal from their \nworkers or expose their workers to safety hazards. This will help \nprotect basic worker rights and that in turn will help expand economic \nsecurity for more working families and, finally, this new protection \nwill help level the playing field for businesses that follow our laws.\n  These businesses should not have to compete with corporations that \ncut corners and put their workers' safety\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\nat risk or cheat workers on their paychecks. It will also have another \nbenefit. Some of these same irresponsible companies that exploit their \nworkers are also irresponsible when it comes to staying on schedule and \non budget.\n  One report found that among the companies that had the most egregious \nworkplace violations between 2005 and 2009, one-quarter of them also \nhad significant performance problems like cost overruns and schedule \ndelays. So these new rules will help the Federal Government choose \ncontractors that are actually efficient and effective, which in return \nwill help save taxpayer dollars.\n  Rewarding efficient and effective contractors should be a bipartisan \ngoal, but unfortunately some of my colleagues want to give defense \ncontractors a special carve-out from these crucial accountability \nmeasures and, to me, that is unacceptable.\n  It is time to stop rewarding Federal contractors that have a history \nof violating workers' rights. That is why I support the amendment of my \ncolleague from Connecticut, which will make sure the Defense Department \nconsiders all companies' full record before granting or renewing their \nFederal contracts.\n  Like many of our colleagues, I am focused on leveling the playing \nfield for companies that do the right thing by their workers, protect \nAmerican taxpayers, and boost economic security for our workers. That \nis why I remain strongly opposed to the damaging provision in the \nunderlying bill, and I do hope our colleagues will join us in \nsupporting our amendment to undo the carve-out and allow these critical \nprotections for our workers to be implemented as they were intended.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, the amendment I filed, Blumenthal No. \n4255, will not be made pending, but I want to emphasize the importance \nof the amendment and hope I can work with my colleagues on the \nsubstance of it because it is so profoundly important to fairness in \nthe workplace and the protection of American workers.\n  My friend and colleague, the Senator from Washington, Patty Murray, \nhas spoken on this issue within the last few minutes, and I join her in \nsupporting the critical Executive order issued by the President called \nthe Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order.\n  This effort requires companies doing business by the Federal \nGovernment to disclose whether they violated any of the 14 longstanding \nlabor laws protecting American workers included in this Executive \norder. There is no requirement to disclose a mere allegation or claim \nof a violation of one of those laws, rather, the Executive order \nrequires, very simply, disclosure of a determination by a court or \nadministrative body of an actual violation. In effect, this Executive \norder would be gutted by the National Defense Authorization Act now on \nthe floor of this Congress, and the amendment I was intending to offer \nis the very same amendment that was offered in the NDAA markup and \nsupported by groups like Easter Seals and Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica. They worry that the language in this law that we now have \nbefore us will do a damaging injustice to our veterans and constituents \nwith disabilities and thousands of other employees working under \nFederal contracts.\n  I am proud to be joined in this effort by not only Senator Murray but \nalso Senators Franken, Gillibrand, Brown, Sanders, Leahy, Baldwin, \nMerkley, Boxer, Casey, and the ranking member of the committee with \njurisdiction over this bill, Senator Jack Reed of the Armed Services \nCommittee, where the Presiding Officer and I sit.\n  We need to ensure that the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive \nOrder applies across all Federal agencies and to all workers, or as \nmany as possible at least, strengthening this vital effort to protect \nworkers and taxpayer dollars. It is not only about workers, it is also \nabout taxpayer dollars.\n  The laws that are covered here are sort of the bread-and-butter \nprotections of all Federal workers and all workers, generally, such as \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nand the Civil Rights Act. Other laws that may be more obscure are also \ncovered, but they have been around for decades, and this measure and \nthose laws are designed to protect veterans and women from harmful, \ndebilitating discrimination, among other wrongful practices.\n  Let's be very clear. Most companies covered by Federal contracts play \nby the rules and obey the law. All they would need to do is literally \ncheck a box confirming that they are in compliance. There are no big \nadministrative expenses or elaborate bureaucratic hurdles to overcome. \nThey just need to check a box to confirm that they are in compliance. \nFor the small subset of companies with compliance issues, the \ncontracting agency would take information about violations into \nconsideration in the procurement process. This is not to bar them. They \ncan still be considered, but they would then try to work with the \ncompany to make sure it comes into compliance with the law.\n  The basic theory of this Executive order is a matter of common sense. \nIt is not about blacklisting companies. It is about ensuring that \ncompanies that want to do business with the Federal Government follow \nthe law and provide a safe, equitable, and fair workplace. Those are \nthe companies we can trust in being our partners in carrying out the \nFederal Government's work, as long as they obey the law and are in \ncompliance with it.\n  Companies that violate those laws should not receive taxpayer \ndollars. Companies that violate the law, very bluntly, are creating an \nunlevel playing field and forcing law-abiding companies into an unfair \ncompetition for contracts. They can cut corners, save money by in \neffect skirting the law, present lowball offers, and when they are \nhired, provide poor performance--again, wasting Federal funds to the \ndetriment of taxpayers.\n\n  Of course, it is not just about dollars--important to the taxpayer--\nbut about workers. Every year, tens of thousands of American workers \nare denied overtime wages. Unlawfully discriminated against in hiring \nand pay, they have their health and safety put at risk by Federal \ncontractors who cut those corners on workers' safety or otherwise deny \na basic safe workplace, and that is another reason we need full force \nand effect to this Executive order, not the gutting of it that is \ncontained now in the NDAA before us.\n  Some have called the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive order one \nof the most important advances for workers achieved by this \nadministration, and it is. According to the Department of Labor, one in \nfive Americans are employed by companies that do business with the \nFederal Government, an enormous source of leverage requiring compliance \nwith Federal protections, not just in letter but in spirit. We must \nvery simply allow for consistent and appropriate application of this \nExecutive order to ensure that workers or contractors under the defense \nlaws have the same protections as other workers.\n  The NDAA provision that guts this Executive order must be removed at \nsome point. It may not happen in our consideration of this measure now, \nbut my hope is that we can work with colleagues and overcome the \npotentially harmful effects of this provision.\n  I look forward, in fact, to a collegial effort to make sure that we \nprovide long-term protections to American workers through this \nExecutive order.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, why is it that Washington also jumps \nblindly into culture war fighting? Why is it we first divide into blue \nshirts versus red shirts, retreat into our tribes, and then try to \nfigure out how we can inflict\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\nmaximum damage on each other? That is not how adults in the communities \nacross our country solve their problems, and that is not how they would \nlike us to be solving our problems, but that is actually what is \nhappening right now in this body.\n  The legislation before the Senate is supposed to be about national \nsecurity, which is the first and most important duty of the Federal \nGovernment. Republicans and Democrats, all 100 Members of this body, \ntell ourselves and tell our constituents that we love and want to \nsupport and provide for the troops.\n  I want that to be true. Thus, I think we should be able to agree that \nnational security is far more important than trying to run up partisan \nscores in another culture war battle. By the way, culture war battles \nare almost never settled well by compulsion, by government, and by \nforce.\n\n  But here we are, getting ready to have divide again, this time over \nthe issue of women in the draft, and I want to ask why.\n  Let me ask a question that should be obvious. Why are we now fighting \nabout drafting our sisters, our mothers, and our daughters into a draft \nthat no one anywhere is telling us they need?\n  Seriously, where is there any general who has appeared before us and \nsaid that the most pressing issue or even a pressing issue about our \nnational security challenges and efforts at the present time is that we \ndon't have enough people to draft? Where has that happened? Who has \nsaid it? Because I have been listening, and I haven't heard a single \nperson from the national security community come before us and say: Do \nyou know what we need? We need more people in the draft.\n  I haven't heard that conversation anywhere.\n  This fight about women in the draft is entirely unnecessary, and \nwisdom should be nudging us to try to avoid unnecessary fighting. We \nhave enough big, real, and important fighting we should be doing around \nhere. Why would we take on unnecessary fighting?\n  So before we send out our press releases and before we decide to \ncondemn people that are on the other side of a culture war battle, why \ndon't we just pause and together agree on this one indisputable fact: \nWe have the best fighting force that the world has ever known. In fact, \nit is an all-volunteer force right now. We are not drafting anybody, \nand no one is recommending that we draft anybody. So why are we having \nthis fight?\n  Rather than needlessly dividing the American people over a 20th \ncentury registration process, why wouldn't we do this: Why wouldn't we \npause, stop the expansion of the draft, stop to study the purposes of \nthe draft, and actually evaluate whether we need a draft? Maybe we do, \nbut let's actually evaluate it before we start fighting over the most \ncontroversial pieces of it.\n  Let's not start by fighting about who to add to the draft. Let's not \nstart by trying to import culture warring into a national security \nbill. Let's start by asking if we are really certain we need the draft.\n  I am introducing a simple amendment, and I hope that this body could \nagree that its aim is common sense and its aim is to deescalate our \nbitter conflicts. My simple amendment would replace the NDAA's \ncontroversial draft provisions with three relatively noncontroversial--\nand I think much more important--steps.\n  No. 1, my amendment would ask the Senate to admit that the draft, \nwhich last had a call, by the way--the last call of the draft was in \nDecember of 1972. I was 10 months old, and I think I am 5 years older \nthan the youngest Member of this body. The last time there was a call \nin the draft was December of 1972. We should probably admit that it is \ntime for a reevaluation instead of just continuing on autopilot.\n  No. 2, it would sunset the draft 3 years from now unless this body \ndecides that we have consulted the generals and we can tell the \nAmerican people that we need the draft to continue. So the second thing \nit does is sunset the draft 3 years in the future unless we would act \nto restore the draft.\n  No. 3, it requires the Secretary of Defense to report back to this \nbody--to report back to the Congress--in 6 months on the merits of the \nSelective Service System rather than simply continuing it on status quo \nautopilot, unscrutinized.\n  Again, this isn't asking the Secretary of Defense to wade into the \nculture wars or to take a lead in any social engineering. By the way, I \nam the father of two girls so there is nobody who is going to outbid me \non the limitless potential of young women in American life, but that is \nnot what this is all about. This is about the Secretary of Defense \nreporting back to us after consulting with the generals and telling us \none of three things.\n  I think it was a pretty simple question. We should have the Secretary \nof Defense come back before Congress in 6 months and say to us one of \nthree things. Either, A, the all-volunteer forces we are actually using \nright now are sufficient and they think the draft is obsolete, in which \ncase the sunset would just go into effect; or, B, they would tell us \nthat after consideration they believe the draft is still necessary and \nsome version of the present draft should be continued; or, C, they \nactually think we have a deficit of human capital to potentially draft, \nand they think we need an expansion of the draft. Then this body could \ndebate who do we expand it to.\n  But let's first have the Secretary of Defense consult the generals, \ncome back to us in 6 months, and say: A, an all-volunteer force works; \nB, we have about the right amount of human capital registered for the \ndraft; or C, we think we need to expand the draft.\n  Maybe we will say we should have men who are older than 26 years \nadded to the draft. Maybe we should add women. Maybe there will be some \nother configuration of people we would add to the draft. But until we \nknow we need more people in the draft or that we need a draft at all, \nwhy would we dive headlong into what would be the most controversial \nversion of this debate.\n  Again, the generals are probably going to tell us they are fine with \nan all-volunteer force, but we don't know that. So why don't we have \nthem report back before we start bickering.\n  One of the fundamental purposes of this body is to debate the biggest \nissues facing the Nation and to do so in an honorable way. That is what \nthe Senate is for. The reason we have a Senate is to debate--not \nabstractions--but to address and ultimately solve the meatiest \nchallenges that the Constitution in present circumstances demands we \ntackle. Right now women in the draft isn't really one of those issues, \nso I don't know why we would start fighting about it and dividing so \nmany of the American people about it.\n  If there is any Senator who believes that the purpose of the NDAA \nshould be to have a culture war fight, humbly I would invite him or her \nto come to the floor and please make that case. If there is a reason we \nshould have a culture war fight in the context of the NDAA, tell us why \nwe should do it. But, if not, let's avoid unnecessary cultural division \nand stick with the actual national security tasks that are before us \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JAMES CRASE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished Kentuckian and talented physician who has sadly passed \naway. Dr. James Crase, a good friend of mine who was a veteran and a \nformer State senator, departed this life on May 28. He was 78 years \nold.\n  Dr. Crase, born in Letcher County, KY, practiced medicine for over 53 \nyears, 40 of those years in his beloved hometown of Somerset, KY. He \nserved\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nas chief of staff at the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital.\n  As a Somerset doctor, he provided care to over 10,000 patient \nfamilies and was named ``Citizen Physician of the Year'' by the \nKentucky Academy of Family Practice. He previously practiced medicine \nin Berea, KY, McKee, KY, and in Norfolk, VA with the U.S. Navy.\n  Dr. Crase was elected to the Kentucky Senate in 1994 and became well \nknown for his dedication to constituent service. After retiring from \nhis medical practice, he helped create ClubMD, a healthcare clinic that \nfocused on improving the patient experience.\n  Dr. Crase was deeply involved with the community and committed to \nvolunteer service with many organizations, including the Lake \nCumberland Lincoln Club, the Lake Cumberland Performing Arts, the \nKentucky Medical Association, the Berea College Board of Trustees, the \nSomerset Community College Athletic Directorship, the First \nPresbyterian Church of Somerset, the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital, \nthe Pulaski Civil War Round Table, and the United Way.\n  Elaine and I wish to send our deepest condolences to Dr. Crase's \nfamily and many beloved friends during their time of grief. Dr. Crase \nwas a friend, a caring and empathetic physician, and a devoted public \nservant. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is poorer for his loss.\n  An area publication, the Lexington Herald-Leader, published an \narticle detailing the life and career of Dr. James Crase. I ask \nunanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, June 1, 2016]\n\n           Longtime Somerset Physician James Crase Dies at 78\n\n                            (By Bill Estep)\n\n       James D. Crase, a longtime Somerset physician who served a \n     partial term in the state Senate, died May 28. The Letcher \n     County native was 78.\n       Crase was a U.S. Navy veteran who worked as a physician for \n     53 years, including more than 40 years in Somerset, where he \n     served as chief of staff of the Lake Cumberland Regional \n     Hospital and an elder at First Presbyterian Church.\n       Crase's obituary said he was proud to have provided care to \n     more than 10,000 families during his time in Somerset. The \n     Kentucky Academy of Family Practice named Crase its Citizen \n     Physician of the Year, the obituary said.\n       Crase, a small-government Republican, was elected to the \n     state Senate in December 1994 to finish the term of a \n     lawmaker who had been convicted in a corruption case.\n       Republicans control the Kentucky Senate now, but were in \n     the minority then. In a newspaper commentary, Crase expressed \n     some frustration about the relative lack of power of the \n     minority, and with the legislative process.\n       ``First, one must convince his or her own party to support \n     the measure. Then comes the dubious chore of convincing the \n     opposing party of its merits, thus the trades--you vote for \n     mine, I'll smile upon yours,'' Crase wrote.\n       He did not seek election to a full term in 1996.\n       U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a \n     statement Wednesday said Crase will be missed.\n       ``As a veteran and former state senator, Dr. Crase was \n     well-respected in the community and worked tirelessly to \n     improve the lives of his constituents,'' McConnell said.\n       Crase is survived by three children.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3715-2"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss the issue of \npreemption and ask to engage in a colloquy with Senators Tillis and \nNelson.\n  I come to the floor today to discuss the Federal Aviation \nAdministration Reauthorization Act of 2016, which passed the Senate on \nApril 19 by a vote of 95 to 3. This vote reflects the strong, \nbipartisan work that went into negotiating this bill, and I hope that \nthe House will take it up.\n  However, there is unfinished business with this bill: the need to \nremove section 2152. This provision of the bill would preempt any State \nor local laws related to the operation, manufacture, design, testing, \nlicensing, registration, certification, operation, or maintenance of an \nunmanned aircraft system including airspace, altitude, flight paths, \nequipment or technology requirements, purpose of operations, and pilot, \noperator, and observer qualifications, training, and certification.\n  This provision of the bill would be effective on the date of \nenactment prior to the FAA promulgating any regulations in these areas.\n  When this came to my attention, as a former mayor, I became very \nalarmed about the possible reach of this provision and how it might \nimpact local communities, State parks, schools, infrastructure, and \nother areas with a strong State or local interest.\n  So I filed two amendments, and, ultimately, the managers of this \nbill--Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson--agreed to accept an \namendment to strike the provision from the underlying bill.\n  This is amendment No. 3704, filed by myself and Senator Tillis, and \ncosponsored by Senators Blumenthal, Perdue, Lee, and Markey.\n  I would now like to yield, if I could, to my colleague from North \nCarolina, Mr. Tillis.\n  Mr. TILLIS. As a former State legislator, I very much agree with what \nmy colleague from California has said. In North Carolina, we worked \nhard to get the regulatory and legislative framework right for this new \ntechnology. In fact, we commissioned a legislative research committee \nto propose legislation and obtained input from stakeholders prior to \nthe bill's passage. You see, not all wisdom resides at the Federal \nGovernment. Our system is designed to let States and localities weigh \nfactors that bureaucrats in Washington might not consider, such as \npotential privacy concerns, law enforcement operations, search and \nrescue, natural disaster mitigation, infrastructure monitoring--the \nlist goes on.\n  I would add that it was my understanding as well that Chairman Thune \nand Ranking Member Nelson had graciously agreed to accept this \namendment and that it had been cleared as part of a group of \nnoncontroversial amendments. I was disappointed to see that package \nheld up over a disagreement on unrelated matters between other Members. \nI am encouraged, however, by the chairman's and ranking members' \ncommitment to continue addressing our concerns in conference committee.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from North \nCarolina, Mr. Tillis, is correct. Chairman Thune and I did agree to \naccept this amendment as part of a package of 26 amendments agreed to \nby all but one of our colleagues.\n  While I am disappointed that these amendments could not clear the \nfull Senate, including one that preserves certain State and local \npowers to deal with public safety concerns regarding drones, I will \nwork with Chairman Thune to address this and other issues in the \nconference committee once the House has acted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3716-2"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3716-S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING TERESA SCALZO\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Ms. Teresa Scalzo, \nwho recently passed away after a 23 year legal career focused on public \nservice, supporting the victims of violence and sexual assault, and \nadvancing the prosecution of those horrible crimes. After a battle with \nan aggressive cancer, Teresa passed away on Monday, May 23, 2016.\n  A native of Easton, PA, Teresa earned a law degree from Temple \nUniversity School of Law in 1993. Over the next 23 years, she held \nnumerous legal positions, all focused on giving victims\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\na voice and advancing the prosecution of these complex cases.\n  Most recently, Teresa served as the deputy director of the U.S. Navy \nJudge Advocate General's Corps Trial Counsel Assistance Program. In \nthis position, Teresa helped cultivate and hone the skills of multiple \ngenerations of Navy prosecutors, enhancing the Navy's ability to \nsupport victims of sexual assault and to hold perpetrators accountable. \nAmong the many prestigious and important positions throughout her \ncareer, she also served as senior policy adviser for the Department of \nDefense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, director of the \nNational Center for the Prosecution of Violence Against Women, chief of \nthe sex crimes unit at the Northampton County District Attorney's \nOffice, and a member of the sexual assault response team at the \nNational Sexual Violence Resource Center.\n  Teresa radiated that special balance of determination and compassion \nthat enabled victims of sexual assault and family violence to find \ntheir voices in the pursuit of justice. In recognition of her \naccomplishments, she received the 2009 Visionary Award from Ending \nViolence Against Women International. In 2001, she received the Allied \nProfessional Award for Outstanding Commitment to Victims' Services from \nthe Crime Victims Council of the Lehigh Valley.\n  I would like to recognize Ms. Scalzo's honorable commitment and \nexceptional service to victims, the justice system, and our country. \nShe is survived by her mother Marie; her brother Carl; his wife \nTheresa; and her nephew and nieces, Brett, Paige, and Maggie. It is an \nhonor to stand in recognition of this compassionate advocate and seeker \nof justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3716-3"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING COE SWOBE\n\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to remember a true Nevada \nstatesman and dedicated public servant, former Nevada State Assemblyman \nand State Senator Coe Swobe. I send my condolences and prayers to his \nfamily during this difficult time. Although he will be sorely missed, \nhis legendary influence throughout Nevada will continue on.\n  Mr. Swobe was born in 1929 and raised in northern Nevada. He \ngraduated from the University of Nevada, Reno, after serving in the \nU.S. Air Force during the Korean war. As one of our Nation's \nservicemembers, he made exceptional sacrifices for our country and \ndeserves our deepest gratitude. His service to his country, as well as \nhis bravery and dedication to his family and community, have earned him \na place in history among the many outstanding men and women who have \ncontributed to our Nation and to our State. Mr. Swobe later earned his \njuris doctorate from the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. He \nthen returned to Reno, where he served as assistant U.S. Attorney for \nthe District of Nevada for 2 years and began his career as a true \npublic servant to the Silver State.\n  In 1962, Mr. Swobe was first elected to the Nevada State Assembly. \nShortly thereafter, he became a member of the Nevada State Senate, \nwhere he served from 1966 to 1974. During his tenure, Mr. Swobe was a \nstaunch supporter of the preservation of Lake Tahoe and led the way in \nestablishing the first agreement between then Nevada Governor Paul \nLaxalt and California Governor Ronald Reagan and the two State \nlegislatures in helping to protect the Lake. This agreement later \nestablished the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, TRPA, which continues \nto protect this precious Nevada jewel today. He also helped expand the \nLake Tahoe park system, including the establishment of Sand Harbor \nState Park. In 2007, he was appointed to serve on the governing board \nfor the TRPA, where he worked vigorously to help raise awareness about \nwildfire prevention. Residents across the State of Nevada and the Lake \nTahoe Basin are fortunate to have had someone dedicated to working \ntowards the betterment and protection of our State.\n  In addition, Mr. Swobe cofounded Nevada's Lawyers Concerned for \nLawyers, LCL, to help others struggling with alcohol addiction. For \nover 30 years, he dedicated his time to this program, which is \navailable to lawyers, judges, and anyone else in the legal community in \nneed of support. His legacy and love for Nevada, as well as his genuine \nconcern for others, will live on for generations to come.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Swobe demonstrated only the highest level of \nexcellence and dedication while serving the great State of Nevada. I am \ndeeply appreciative of his hard work and invaluable contributions to \nour State. Today, I join citizens across the Silver State in \ncelebrating the life of an upstanding Nevadan, Coe Swobe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3717-1"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3717-S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CENTENNIAL OF THE WYOMING DENTAL ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the Wyoming \nDental Association as it celebrates its 100th anniversary. This \nhistoric milestone marks the success of the organization's efforts to \nassist its members in their mission of achieving the highest level of \npatient care for Wyoming.\n  Life on the frontier posed many challenges for Wyoming's first \ndentists. Pioneer practitioners often traveled long distances through \nrugged terrain to treat their patients. Armed with rudimentary tools \nincluding forceps, pedal-powered drills, and whiskey to kill the pain, \nthese circuit riders treated patients with little or no oversight. \nSeeing a need for standardization, the Wyoming Legislature created the \nWyoming Board of Dental Examiners, which required all practicing \ndentists to register with the State. In 1916, several licensed dentists \njoined to form the Wyoming Dental Association, an organization \ndedicated to supporting the State's dentists. From that day forward, \nthe association's members dedicated themselves to advancing the \npractice of dentistry.\n  Thanks to extensive progress made in technology and medical care, \nmodern oral health care has dramatically improved. Today there are over \n500 licensed dentists in Wyoming. Our State's dentists are dedicated to \ntheir patients' health, not only providing dental care but also \neducating the public on the importance of oral hygiene. Every dentist \nhas adopted a professional code of ethics and works to maintain the \nhighest standards of excellence.\n  The Wyoming Dental Association is a leader in promoting dental \nhygiene. Through its dedicated advocacy and leadership, the association \ncollaborates with the Wyoming Legislature, local government agencies, \nand nonprofit organizations to help the people of Wyoming. Their \nachievements are impressive.\n  In particular, dentists around the State volunteered hundreds of \nhours to complete Wyoming's Oral Health Initiative, which was designed \nto gauge the overall dental health of residents. The initiative \nprovided stakeholders with valuable data that led to the development of \nstrategies to improve education and access to care. Thanks to the \nWyoming Dental Association's participation in this crucial study, the \nState is advancing dental health care to new levels of success.\n  After 100 years, the Wyoming Dental Association is stronger than ever \nthanks to its incredible leadership. The dedicated efforts of the \nassociation's executive director, Diane Bouzis, and its current board \nof directors continue to improve the services its members receive. \nThank you to President Mike Shane, President-elect Dana Leroy, Vice \nPresident Lance Griggs, Secretary-Treasurer Deb Shevick, and ADA \nDelegates Rod Hill and Brad Kincheloe. We also acknowledge the hard \nwork of the State's district directors, including Lorraine Gallagher, \nBrian Cotant, Steve Harmon, Paul Dona, Aaron Taff, and Leslie Basse. \nThese incredible individuals serve the association and their patients \nwith great integrity.\n  Thanks to the strength of the association's membership, we can always \ncount on Wyoming's dental practitioners to come to Washington. They \nprovide up-to-date information and input about the major concerns and \nissues facing the industry. Our entire State benefits from their \nadvocacy. It is always great to meet with John Roussalis, Earl \nKincheloe, Mike Keim, Bob Pattalochi, David Okano, Tyler Bergien, Brian \nHokanson, and Carl Jeffries. These fine folks are excellent \nrepresentatives of the profession.\n  The Wyoming Dental Association is a remarkable organization committed \nto improving dental health care in all of\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nWyoming's communities. I am pleased to offer my sincere appreciation to \nthe members of the Wyoming Dental Association as they celebrate their \ncentennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3717-2"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL JERKY DAY\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, today I remind my fellow Americans of \nNational Jerky Day on June 12, 2016.\n  Jerky has been a staple of the American diet since the birth of our \nNation because of its portability and high protein content. Early \nsettlers learned bison jerky preparation techniques from Native \nAmericans. Lewis and Clark cured and ate jerky over the course of their \nhistoric expedition. Now, our astronauts consume jerky aboard the \nInternational Space Station.\n  The production of jerky is also an important component of our \nnational economy. Companies from coast to coast employ thousands of \nworkers to produce American-made jerky and distribute it \ninternationally. Our Nation's farmers and ranchers produce high-quality \nproducts that help make the best jerky in the world.\n  Therefore, I encourage my fellow citizens to enjoy a nutritious jerky \nsnack in celebration of National Jerky Day on Sunday, June 12, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3718-1"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                STRATHAM'S 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the 300th \nanniversary of the town of Stratham, New Hampshire.\n  Stratham is located in southeast New Hampshire, in a region inhabited \nby Native Americans for thousands of years before the arrival of \nEuropeans on our shores. It was first settled in 1631, and in 1709, the \nresidents petitioned for the creation of their own town in order to \nbuild a school, church, and meeting house. Lieutenant Governor George \nVaughn granted residents permission, on March 20, 1716, to collect \ntaxes, hold town meetings, elect selectmen, appoint a minister, and \nbuild a meeting house on Kings Grant Highway. The location of the \noriginal Stratham Meeting House is where the Stratham Community Church \nstands today.\n  In 1906, a park was opened in town after Edward Tuck sold 70 acres of \nland to the town of Stratham for $1. Mr. Tuck's major stipulation \nduring the transfer of Stratham Hill Park's land was that ``it was \ngiven for the free use and enjoyment of the residents of Stratham and \nthe surrounding communities.'' In 1966, the town of Stratham celebrated \ntheir 250th anniversary and residents have gathered every year since to \ncelebrate their founding at what is now known as the Stratham Fair. A \nLand Protection Committee was created in 2002, and a decade later, over \n543 acres or nearly 6 percent of the town of Stratham has been \nconserved and protected permanently.\n  Today Stratham is home to the headquarters of the Timberland \nCorporation and to the only Lindt & Sprungli factory in the United \nStates.\n  This year, on the occasion of Stratham's 300th Anniversary of its \nfounding, I join more than 7,000 residents in commemorating the rich \nheritage and valuable contributions to the State of New Hampshire and \nour Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3718-2"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING GARY DiGIUSEPPE\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge the \nlife of Gary John DiGiuseppe whose passion for agriculture and \njournalism helped keep Arkansans informed about the State's No. 1 \nindustry.\n  Gary was a man who knew the importance of dedication and hard work. \nHe was fiercely dedicated to his family and his life's work. He was a \nman who possessed a broad base of invaluable knowledge that he shared \neagerly through his radio shows and literature. He worked as an \nagricultural reporter for 35 years. To others in his field, he was \nknown as a true professional of agriculture.\n  Many knew Gary as the man who started their mornings off with a \nfriendly voice. He was an accomplished talk show host and writer. He \nwas known for doing an excellent job reporting on conferences and \ninterviews. There are few who do not trust his educated opinion. His \nwriting has also been published in the ``Arkansas Money & Politics'' \nmagazine.\n  Gary was often referred to as an asset, trustworthy, and well \ninformed. In addition, he was well versed in other aspects of life. He \nwas an accomplished musician and stood firm on his important principles \nthrough determined discipline.\n  Gary always represented situations clearly and fair in his reporting. \nI was happy to talk with him about the agricultural topics that he was \nresearching and reporting on.\n  He maintained a passion for learning and teaching all aspects of \nagriculture.\n  I am remembering Gary today as a true friend of Arkansas agriculture. \nMy thoughts and prayers go out to Gary's wife, Mary, and his entire \nfamily. I humbly offer my gratitude and appreciation for one of \nArkansas' finest agriculture advocates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3718-3"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO COLTER SCULLY\n\n Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge an \nexceptional Montanan, Colter Scully. Colter is a rising senior at \nPowell County High School and is preparing for his board of reviews to \ncomplete his Eagle Scout application. Three years ago, Colter was \ninspired to create a frisbee-golf course in his community. Thanks to \nhis leadership and perseverance, the course was opened on May 31, 2016.\n  Colter's scoutmaster, Tom Burkhart, describes Colter as a natural \noutdoorsman and leader, who leads quietly and kindly but has earned the \nfollowing and respect of his peers. Tom says, ``What sets Colter apart \nis once he sets his mind to something he's going to do all that he \nneeds to do to see it through.''\n  Eagle Scouts applicants must present a community project that \nrequires planning, coordination, and future thinking. Colter sought out \nthe Deer Lodge Parks Board and a local youth club against corporate \ntobacco, reACT, to coordinate the creation of his frisbee-golf course. \nColter created a dynamic team of individuals who came together to \nprovide the communities of Deer Lodge and Powell with a tobacco-free \nand entertaining activity.\n  The Eagle Scout is one of the highest performance-based achievements \na young man can earn. In fact, only 5 percent of scouts attain this \nranking. Colter had to secure 21 merit badges ranging from first-aid \nand camping to environmental science and family life, while holding \nleadership positions. Colter has humbly served Troop 239 as \nquartermaster, patrol leader, and senior patrol leader.\n  He embodies the boy scout oath to do his best, to serve God and his \ncountry, and to help others at all times in all areas of his life. At \nPowell County High School, Colter is an honor student who puts forth \nhis best work, earning a 4.0 GPA, while juggling three sports: \nfootball, basketball, and track.\n  I have no doubt this young man's hard work and dedication will be \nrewarded. As an Eagle Scout, he will be joining the ranks of impressive \nindividuals such as Neil Armstrong and Gerald Ford. I hope you will \njoin me in wishing Colter the best of luck as he prepares for his Eagle \nScout board of review.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/09/senate-section/article/S3718-4"}, {"day": "09", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3718-S3719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM PARK\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an \nupstanding Nevadan, William Park, who has served as a volunteer \nfirefighter for the Smith Valley Fire Protection District for over 50 \nyears. It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years of hard work \nand dedication to creating a safe environment for the Smith Valley \ncommunity.\n  Mr. Park joined the Smith Valley Fire Protection District as a \nvolunteer firefighter in 1966. He was one of the first Emergency \nMedical Services, EMS, instructors in the State as part of the \nProfessional Rescue Instructors of Nevada, where he trained hundreds of \nemergency medical technicians. In just 10 years, Mr. Park rose in the \nranks and was selected to serve as assistant fire chief and later fire \nchief of the District. In the late 1970s, Mr. Park's construction \ncompany, Park Construction, rebuilt the Smith Valley Fire Protection \nDistrict's Wellington Station, growing the facility to two apparatus \nbays. By 1980, he became the\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\npresident of the Nevada State Firefighters Association, NSFA, while \ncontinuing to serve as fire chief. Mr. Park is truly a role model in \nthe fire services community throughout northern Nevada and across the \nSilver State.\n  In August of 1979, Mr. Park was badly burned during an accident after \na Wednesday night training class and spent weeks recovering in the \nintensive care unit. This incident brought great support from the \nNevada fire family and ultimately led to the creation of the NSFA \nBenevolence Fund and the Smith Valley Fire Protection District \nCommunity Assistance Fund. Even after this traumatic experience, Mr. \nPark showed great resilience and continued to serve the district as \nassistant chief and by instructing EMS training. To this day, Mr. Park \ncontinues to be an active participant with the district and responded \nto over 50 percent of department calls in 2015. Mr. Park stands as a \nshining example of someone who has gone above and beyond for those \naround him.\n  It is the brave men and women who serve in our local fire departments \nthat help keep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put their \nlives on the line every day. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Park \nfor his courageous contributions to the people of Smith Valley and the \nSilver State. His sacrifice and courage earn him a place among the \noutstanding men and women who have valiantly put their lives on the \nline to benefit others.\n  Mr. Park has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, \nand dedication to the highest standards of the Smith Valley Fire \nProtection District.

RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 3045. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to reform \ncertain forfeiture procedures, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the DUE PROCESS \nAct. I am very pleased that Senator Leahy is a cosponsor of the bill. \nThis legislation will make important reforms to the practice of civil \nasset forfeiture.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings last year on the \nproblems associated with civil asset forfeiture. This is a process by \nwhich a person who has been convicted of no crime, and in fact is often \nnot even charged with a crime, can nonetheless lose his property if the \nproperty is suspected to be owned as a result of wrongdoing. Civil \nasset forfeiture has a place in our society, including gaining control \nover assets used to further terrorism and the drug trade. But there \nhave been excesses, and this bill is designed to address many of them.\n  Working together in a bipartisan and bicameral way, we have had \nmonths long discussions about how to draft legislation to improve the \nfairness of civil asset forfeiture. The bill that I am introducing \ntoday has been introduced and passed through the House Judiciary \nCommittee on a bipartisan voice vote. It is the result of these \nbipartisan and bicameral discussions. The Senate should consider the \nsame bill.\n  The DUE PROCESS Act broadens the timelines for an owner to challenge \nforfeitures. It extends protections in existing law to judicial \nforfeitures, not only administrative forfeitures. The government must \nprovide greater notice to owners whose property has been seized, \nincluding notice of the rights that they may invoke to regain their \nproperty and their right to be represented by counsel in contesting a \nforfeiture either judicially or administratively. The property owner is \ngiven more time to respond to the seizure. Very importantly, an owner \nwho challenges the seizure receives an initial hearing, at which time \nshe is further notified of her rights and will have her property \nreleased if the seizure was not made according to law. Under the bill, \nthe government must prove that seizure is warranted by clear and \nconvincing evidence, rather than the current preponderance of the \nevidence standard.\n  Some of these provisions are in the bill because of media reports, \nincluding in my home state of Iowa. For instance, the Des Moines \nRegister has reported that in many instances, innocent motorists \nsurrender the property that law enforcement seizes without always \nhaving an understanding of how the seizure can be challenged. The bill \nwill ensure that those whose assets are seized are given notice of the \nprocess by which the seizure can be contested and their right to have \ncounsel represent them in the forfeiture proceeding.\n  In a change to criminal forfeiture, which can take place after a \ndefendant is convicted of a crime, the bill overturns the Supreme \nCourt's recent decision in Kaley v. United States. A defendant will \nhave the right to ask for a hearing to modify the seizure so as to \ndemonstrate that assets not associated with the charged criminal \nactivity can be used to hire the attorney of the defendant's choice. \nThe court is directed to consider various factors at the hearing.\n  Additionally, the bill makes it easier for those whose assets have \nbeen seized to recover their attorney's fees when they settle their \ncases. The bill requires the Justice Department's Inspector General to \naudit a sample of civil forfeitures to make sure they are consistent \nwith the Constitution and the law. And it directs the Attorney General \nto establish databases on real-time status of forfeitures and on the \ntypes of forfeitures sought, the agencies seeking them, and the conduct \nthat leads the property to be forfeited.\n  Further, the bill codifies DOJARS policy to allow civil forfeiture in \nstructuring cases only when the property to be seized is derived from \nan underlying crime other than structuring, or where it is done to \nconceal illegal activity. Structuring is a crime by which cash deposits \nor withdrawals are made with the intent of avoiding government \nreporting requirements. In Iowa, for instance, prosecutors brought an \naction against a restauranteur, Carole Hinders, who had deposited cash \nfrom her operations without any intention to evade any reporting \nrequirement or to conceal some other illegal activity. After IRS \nchanged its policy, prosecutors dropped the case. The bill will prevent \nthe government from pursuing civil asset forfeiture cases such as these \nin the future.\n  Finally, the bill expands existing protections for innocent owners of \nproperty that is sought to be forfeited. The government will have to \nprove that there is a substantial connection between the property and \nan offense and that the owner of the seized property intentionally used \nthe property, knowingly consented to its criminal use, or reasonably \nshould have known that the property might be used in connection with \nthe offense.\n  Many of these provisions strengthen the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform \nAct. That legislation improved the process and provided greater \nprotection for innocent owners involved in civil asset forfeiture than \nhad previously been the case. But, as we have seen, excesses and \ninjustices still remain. The DUE PROCESS Act is designed to make \nfurther progress in this area to protect the rights of people whose \nproperty has been seized without any judicial finding of criminal \nwrongdoing.\n  The problems associated with civil asset forfeiture need to be \naddressed. In various ways, it would have been preferable to make \nchanges that go even beyond those in this bill. However, we do want to \nwork with law enforcement and address their legitimate interests and \nconcerns.

CONGRESSIONAL DESIGNATION OF THE NATIONAL MEDAL OF \n                   HONOR MUSEUM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medal of Honor Museum will be the only museum in \n     the United States that exists for the exclusive purpose of \n     interpreting the story of the Medal of Honor and all of its \n     recipients.\n       (2) The Medal of Honor Museum will be the only museum to \n     educate a diverse group of audiences through its collection \n     of artifacts, photographs, letters, documents, and first-hand \n     personal accounts of Medal of Honor recipients and the wars \n     they fought in during United States conflicts since the Civil \n     War.\n       (3) The Medal of Honor Museum mission is--\n       (A) to preserve and present the extraordinary stories of \n     individuals who reached the highest levels of recognition, \n     ``above and beyond the call of duty,'' in service to the \n     Nation;\n       (B) to inspire current and future generations about the \n     ideals of the Medal of Honor six columns of character--\n     Courage, Commitment, Integrity, Citizenship, Sacrifice, and \n     Patriotism;\n       (C) to help visitors understand the meaning and price of \n     freedom and what it means to put service above self; and\n       (D) to serve as an education center that, through various \n     programs, reaches out across the country to further the Medal \n     of Honor's ideals among all Americans, especially our \n     Nation's youth.\n       (4) The Medal of Honor was established by an Act of \n     Congress in 1861 and is awarded in its name. The Medal of \n     Honor is the highest award for valor in action against an \n     enemy force which can be bestowed upon an individual serving \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States and is generally \n     presented to its recipient by the President in the name of \n     Congress.\n       (5) The total number of Medal of Honor recipients from the \n     Civil War through the current War on Terrorism is 3,495 (19 \n     individuals are double recipients). Since World War II, the \n     vast majority of recipients from WWII, the Korean War, and \n     Vietnam have been awarded posthumously.\n       (6) As of May 3, 2016, there are only 76 living Medal of \n     Honor recipients, whose average age is 77, creating an urgent \n     need to preserve the stories, artifacts, and heroic \n     achievements of these individuals.\n       (7) The United States has a need to preserve forever the \n     stories, knowledge, and history of the 3,495 recipients of \n     the Medal of Honor to portray that history and the courage, \n     commitment, integrity, citizenship, sacrifice, and patriotism \n     of the recipients to citizens, visitors, and school children \n     for centuries to come.\n       (8) Therefore, it is appropriate to designate The Medal of \n     Honor Museum as ``National Medal of Honor Museum''.\n       (b) Designation of the National Medal of Honor Museum.--The \n     Medal of Honor Museum is hereby designated as ``The National \n     Medal of Honor Museum''.\n       (c) Funding.--The amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under section 2403 for military construction, land \n     acquisition, and military family housing functions of the \n     Department of Defense (other than the military departments), \n     as specified in the finding table in section 4601, is \n     increased by $10,000,000, with the amount of such increase to \n     be allocated for planning and construction of the National \n     Medal of Honor Museum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4616.

and\n       (3) the commitment of the President to enhancing defense \n     and security cooperation with India should be considered a \n     priority in advancing the interests of the United States in \n     South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region.\n       (c) Required Actions.--The President shall take such \n     actions as may be necessary--\n       (1) to recognize the status of India as a global strategic \n     and defense partner of the United States through appropriate \n     modifications to defense export control regulations;\n       (2) to approve and facilitate the transfer of advanced \n     technology in the context of, and in order to satisfy, \n     combined military planning with the India military for \n     missions such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, \n     counter piracy, and maritime domain awareness;\n       (3) to strengthen the effectiveness of the U.S.-India \n     Defense Technology and Trade Initiative and the durability of \n     the ``India Rapid Reaction Cell'' of the Department of \n     Defense;\n       (4) to resolve issues impeding defense trade, security \n     cooperation, and co-production and co-development \n     opportunities between the United States and India;\n       (5) to collaborate with the Government of India to develop \n     mutually agreeable mechanisms to verify the security of \n     defense technology information and equipment, such as \n     tailored cyber security and end-use monitoring arrangements;\n       (6) to promote policies that will encourage the efficient \n     review and authorization of defense sales and exports to \n     India, including the treatment of military sales and export \n     authorizations to India in a manner similar to that of the \n     closest defense partners of the United States;\n       (7) to pursue greater government-to-government and \n     commercial military transactions between the United States \n     and India; and\n       (8) to support the development and alignment of the export \n     control and procurement regimes of India with those of the \n     United States and multilateral control regimes.\n       (d) Bilateral Coordination.--The President is encouraged to \n     coordinate with the Government of India on an ongoing basis--\n       (1) to develop and keep updated military contingency plans \n     for addressing threats to the mutual security interests of \n     both countries;\n       (2) to develop combined military plans for missions such as \n     humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, maritime domain \n     awareness, freedom of navigation, and other missions in the \n     national security interests of both countries;

Votel, the senior military \n     commanders closest to the fight, have testified that the \n     security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating, and that \n     they support a withdrawal of United States forces from \n     Afghanistan only when conditions warrant.\n       (7) In the first three months of 2016, the United Nations \n     reported that Afghanistan documented 600 civilian deaths and \n     1,343 wounded, with almost one-third of the casualties being \n     children.\n       (8) The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has \n     metastasized beyond the borders of Iraq and Syria, announcing \n     its formation on January 10, 2015, in Afghanistan where it \n     has carried out bombings, small arms attacks, and kidnappings \n     against civilians and security forces in a number of \n     provinces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the future trajectory of security and stability in \n     Afghanistan relies significantly upon the continued support \n     of the United States and coalition partners;\n       (2) adjustments to United States and coalition force levels \n     in Afghanistan should be conditions-based and made with all \n     due consideration to the assessment and advice of military \n     commanders on the ground;\n       (3) decisions on United States and coalition force levels \n     in Afghanistan should take into account the capabilities \n     required to preserve and promote the hard-fought gains \n     achieved over the last 15 years;\n       (4) any decisions with regard to changes in United States \n     force levels in Afghanistan should be determined in a timely \n     manner and communicated to allies and partners to afford \n     adequate planning and force generation lead times;\n       (5) the United States should continue its efforts to train \n     and advise the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces \n     (ANDSF) in warfighting functions so that they are capable of \n     defending their country and ensuring that Afghanistan never \n     again becomes a terrorist safe-haven for groups like the \n     Taliban, al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the \n     Levant (ISIL);\n       (6) the United States should continue, in partnership with \n     the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and \n     conducting counterterrorism operations to address threats to \n     the national security interests of the United States and the \n     security of Afghanistan;\n       (7) the decision of the President in October 2015 to \n     continue the missions of training, advising, and assisting \n     the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and \n     conducting counterterrorism operations while maintaining the \n     associated United States force level of 9,800 troops in \n     Afghanistan was in the national security interests of the \n     United States; and\n       (8) Congress should support the President if the President \n     decides to adjust current plans based on conditions on the \n     ground by continuing robust missions to train, advise, and \n     assist the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces and \n     conduct counterterrorism operations and maintain the \n     necessary level of United States forces in Afghanistan.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4662.
