Mr. President, yesterday's House passage of the \nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act represents a vital ray of hope \nfor the countless victims of modern slavery who need our help. Victims \ngroups and advocates tell us that this human rights legislation would \nprovide unprecedented support to domestic victims of trafficking. They \nurged Congress to pass it.\n  We can now say that we have passed it. We can now say that hope is on \nthe way for the victims who suffer in the shadows. Unfortunately, the \nvictims of modern-day slavery had to wait entirely too long for help.\n  Last Congress, the House of Representatives did its job by passing \nseveral pieces of legislation, but the Senate failed to bring any \ntrafficking legislation to the floor.\n  As a new majority, Senate Republicans were determined to make this \nmatter a priority. Senator Grassley promptly reported legislation out \nof the Judiciary Committee, and we quickly put it on the Senate floor.\n  As we all know by now, there was an unforeseen--to put it mildly--\nimpediment to getting this bill done. But we were determined to see \nthis legislation through to successful completion. Success was possible \nbecause the new majority kept its focus on facts, substance, and good \npolicy for the people who remained our focus throughout the debate, and \nthat is the victims of modern slavery.\n  I could not be more grateful to Senator Cornyn for his outstanding \nwork on this issue. I thank the House for passing such an important \nhuman rights bill yesterday. Now I urge the President to sign this \nlegislation from the new Congress as quickly as possible. The victims \nof such terrible abuse have had to wait entirely too long for \nWashington's help. Let's not make them wait a moment longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3089-7", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3089-S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TRADE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday Senator Warner, a Democrat, \nand Senator Ernst, a Republican, joined me in hosting a press \nconference with small business owners on the benefits of trade for \nentrepreneurs. I want to thank them both for coming. I thank Senator \nWarner, in particular, for helping to lead his party on this issue.\n  We were joined by small business owners with some pretty incredible \nstories. These Americans highlighted opportunities that knocking down \nunfair overseas barriers to American products can provide to us here at \nhome.\n  My favorite, obviously, was Chase Robbins, a constituent of mine from \nShelbyville. After Chase was medically discharged from the Army, he was \nable to scrape together $1,600 with a buddy and start the kind of \nbusiness he had already dreamed of as early as 2010. It is a business \nthat specializes in just the kind of thing you would expect a young guy \nsuch as Chase to be into--high-performance auto parts. And, thanks to \ntrade, it is now both a business that exports a percentage of its \nproducts and one that also employs fellow Kentuckians.\n  His is a small business with just three employees for now--just three \nfor\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nnow--but it is a small business that is allowing him to live his dreams \nand to help others live theirs, too. It is a story countless other \nAmericans know all too well and one we should do everything to \nencourage. Yet, while Chase has achieved success thanks to trade, he \nknows there is still a lot more we should be doing if the aim is to \nhelp businesses grow, help his employees earn more, and help other \nKentuckians live their dreams too.\n  Here is what Chase said yesterday:\n\n       As our business has grown internationally, we have been \n     confronted with barriers that compromise global markets. It \n     was not long after sending our first shipment overseas that \n     we realized trade rules were outdated for our business. Most \n     of the agreements and rules were written before small \n     businesses like ours were able to fully utilize the internet \n     to exploit the global market. Trade agreements offer the best \n     chance to lower barriers and increase market access for small \n     companies like mine. We see a bright future for . . . \n     companies like ours in the export market but we need new \n     trade deals to get there.\n\n  And this, Mr. President, is a business with three employees that is \nexporting products.\n  So here was Chase's solution: ``Trade Promotion Authority is the \nfirst step towards modernizing trade agreements,'' he said, ``and I \nencourage Congress to pass TPA as soon as possible.''\n  Entrepreneurs such as Chase know that the United States does not have \nmany trade barriers, but other countries do. They know that many of \nthese barriers are extremely unfair to American workers and American \nproducts. They know that passing trade promotion authority is the way \nto address such an unfair situation.\n  Our friends on the far left may try to cynically spin their war \nagainst the future of something other than what it truly is, but we all \nknow better. It is no wonder President Obama has called them ``wrong'' \nand suggested that they make stuff up. What happens if the far left \nactually succeeds in its apparent quest to retain foreign tariffs that \nunfairly impact American workers and their paychecks? How is that good \nfor us?\n  It would mean lost opportunities for American risk takers such as \nChase and the employees who entrepreneurs such as him care about. It \nwould mean lost opportunities for American manufacturers, lost \nopportunities for Kentucky farmers, and lost opportunities for more \njobs, better wages, and a growing economy that can lift everyone up.\n  Jobs and a better economy are the kinds of things I am going to \ncontinue to fight for. I think the legislation before us represents a \ngreat opportunity to do so. President Obama agrees, as well. So I am \ngoing to keep working to get votes on amendments--both Republican and \nDemocrat amendments.\n  There have been objections from the other side of the aisle. I would \nremind our colleagues that even with my strong support, the Senate \ncannot have a robust amendment process if every single amendment \noffered by Democrats or Republicans is objected to by our friends on \nthe other side.\n  Our bill managers, Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden, are working hard. \nWe hope to get past these objections so that more amendments can be \nconsidered. But we will need cooperation. The Senate cannot vote on \namendments that are being prevented.\n  We hope to see more of that cooperation so we can pass good, fair, \nand enforceable trade legislation that will benefit our country and so \nmany of the people we represent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3090-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, at the end of this month, Republicans will \nhave been in charge of the Senate for almost half a year. After all of \nthis time, what have they done to address issues facing the middle \nclass? Zero.\n  Let's take a quick look at what the Republican leadership has \nachieved this year. The Keystone Pipeline legislation took a month, a \nbill that was nothing more than a favor for billionaires and special \ninterests. It would allow foreign oil to be imported into the United \nStates to be shipped to foreign countries. It has spent almost another \nmonth on the shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security--the \nshutdown of the Department of Homeland Security--during a time when \nISIS is raging and all the other problems around the world, and they--\nthe Republicans--want to shut down the Federal Government as it relates \nto Homeland Security.\n  We spent 3 weeks on a senseless delay over funding for victims of \nhuman trafficking, over an abortion issue that had nothing to do with \nhuman trafficking. I would respond to my friend, the majority leader, \nwe would have passed this last Congress, except that they objected to \nit--short memory, I think.\n  Now, here we are spending the last week considering trade legislation \nthat has done nothing--nothing, not a single thing--to help working \nmiddle-class Americans. In fact, it causes huge job losses. As Einstein \nsaid, if you keep doing the same thing over and over again and you \nexpect a different result, that is the definition of insanity.\n  We can look at these trade bills over the years. Every one of them, \nwithout exception, causes job losses to American workers, millions of \njob losses. Yet they are going to try the same thing again and hope for \na different result. That is insanity.\n  If the Senate is not actively advocating for the well-being of \nmiddle-class Americans, we are wasting our time. When the Republicans \ntook over the Senate, the majority leader promised to make the needs of \nAmericans a priority. Here is what he said last November: ``Under a new \nmajority, our focus would be on passing legislation that improves the \neconomy, that makes it easier for Americans to find jobs, and that \nhelps restore Americans' confidence in their country and their \ngovernment.''\n  Why then have we not moved toward legislation that makes it easier \nfor Americans to find jobs or reforms that help us restore Americans' \nconfidence in their government?\n  A few months after November--actually the beginning of this year--the \nmajority leader reiterated a call for commonsense legislation that puts \nthe middle class first. He said: ``Let's pass legislation that focuses \non jobs and the real concerns of the middle class.''\n  But, again, what have the Senate Republicans done? They have stopped \nany effort made to help the middle class, whether it is minimum wage, \nequal pay for men and women, student debt, and on and on with things \nthat would help the middle class. They have been ignored. We should be \nfocusing on making it easier for Americans to find jobs, addressing the \nneeds of the middle class and restoring Americans' faith in our \ngovernment.\n  It is not enough for the majority leader to mouth these words that he \nsupports jobs. His agenda must reflect it, as well. But it does not. It \ndoes not do anything to help job creation. If we want to create jobs, \nwhy don't we do something with infrastructure, the surface \ntransportation bill?\n  To his credit, the Presiding Officer has an idea regarding how that \nshould be paid for. I have worked with him and, whether his idea and my \nidea are perfect, at least it is an effort to figure out some way to do \nsomething about jobs. Jobs--we have to do something about surface \ntransportation. Some 50 percent of America's roads are in disrepair, \nand 64,000 bridges are structurally deficient. Our railroad systems are \noutdated, and we know that recently from the headlines we have seen \nwith that devastating accident in Pennsylvania. Instead of working with \nDemocrats to provide adequate, long-term investment into our country's \nsurface transportation, Republicans are advocating for short-term fix \nafter short-term fix.\n\n  Repairing our Nation's roads and bridges through long-term \ninvestments could provide thousands of jobs for Americans. If the \nRepublican leader truly has the interests of the middle class at heart, \nhe should be leading the charge for these investments, but he is \nleading the charge against them.\n  Today, the Senate will resume consideration of the trade legislation. \nBecause of Senate Democrats, that trade legislation includes vital \nprograms that help America's workers retrain and find new employment if \nthey lose their jobs because of foreign trade. And\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nthey are going to lose jobs. Even though a majority of the Senators \ndon't support this trade legislation, we have tried hard to improve it, \nand this trade adjustment assistance is one way we can try to improve \nit.\n  What was the Republican's first amendment to the trade bill? It was \nan amendment to strike a program known as trade adjustment assistance, \nwhich I just talked about, from the bill. This program helps those who \nlose their jobs because of trade. And they will lose their jobs.\n  As we talk about opening foreign markets to American products, surely \nwe should do something so that American companies have the tools to \ncompete internationally.\n  The Export-Import Bank is weeks away from expiring. If it expires, \nfinancing for billions of dollars of U.S. exports will disappear and \nthousands of American jobs will be in jeopardy. How much does it cost? \nNothing. Zero. It is an ideological mindset that the Republicans have--\nthey don't like government programs.\n  We are losing internationally. We are losing trade. I don't think \nanyone can call the Boeing Company a leftwing liberal group, as the \nRepublican leader refers to people who are complaining about what is \ngoing on here. Boeing thinks something should be done with the Export-\nImport Bank. Why? Because they can compete with Airbus and all of these \nother companies that build airplanes. If we don't have the Bank, they \ncannot compete.\n  Mr. President, I could pick any State of the 50--I was given here \nthis morning the State of Virginia because the State of Virginia was \nmentioned in some of the remarks by the Republican leader. I have page \nafter page--millions and millions of dollars that benefit businesses in \nVirginia. It is the same all over the country--in Nevada, Kentucky, \neveryplace.\n  We have talked about trade that won't work. Let's talk about the \nExport-Import Bank, which does work. I so admire and appreciate the \npersistence and advocacy of the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell. \nBut for her, this issue would be lost. It would be gone with all the \nother stuff that goes into the trash can because of the Republicans.\n  The Republican leader has said over and over again that he is opposed \nto the Bank. Well, that is too bad. The American people certainly \nsupport it and American businesses support it. Last year, this vital \nprogram sustained 165,000 jobs at no cost to the taxpayers. If we don't \nreauthorize this program, American businesses will be at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  While the majority leader talks about restoring faith in government, \nhe is standing in the way of reforming the National Security Agency's \nillegal spying program. I did not make up the words ``illegal spying \nprogram''; the Second Circuit Court said it. It is an illegal program.\n  These are just a few areas where renewed focus would create jobs and \nproduce positive outcomes for middle-class Americans. The Republican \nleader should revisit his vision, which up to this point has only been \nwords. There has been no action. The direction this Congress has taken \nso far has only focused on the desires of a few at the expense of many.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the numbers I referred to \nfrom the State of Virginia be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   VIRGINIA COMPANIES FINANCED BY EX-IM BANK FY07-FY15\n                                                     Source: Public Information; Ex-Im Bank Web Site\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                   Total insured\n                                                                                                               shipments, guaranteed\n                Exporter                              City              District            Product             credit or disbursed     Total exp value\n                                                                                                                    loan amount\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbb Inc.................................

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I want to take some time today to talk \nabout proposals to include a currency manipulation negotiating \nobjective in trade negotiations and the impact this issue is having on \nthe debate over renewing trade promotion authority, or TPA.\n  Currency manipulation has, for many, become the primary issue in the \nTPA debate. It has certainly gotten the focus of the media and other \noutside observers. Indeed, I suspect that everyone who has an interest \nin the outcome of the TPA debate--both for and against--is watching \nclosely to see how the Senate will address this particular matter.\n  Let me begin by saying that I recognize the frustrations many have \nregarding exchange rate policies of some of our trading partners, and I \nhave committed to working with my colleagues to arrive at ways to \nimprove currency surveillance and mechanisms\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\nfor responding to problems. However, I want to be as plain as I can on \nthis issue. While currency manipulation is an important issue, it is \ninappropriate and counterproductive to try to solve this problem solely \nthrough free-trade agreements.\n  Nonetheless, I do not believe we should ignore currency manipulation, \nwhich is why, for the very first time, our TPA bill would elevate \ncurrency practices to a principal negotiation objective. Now, let's get \nthat. For the first time in any trade bill, we elevate currency \npractices to a principal negotiation objective. We thought that would \nsolve the problem. It means that if the administration fails to make \nprogress in achieving this or any other objectives laid out in the \nbill, then the relevant trade agreement is subject to a procedural \ndisapproval resolution and other mechanisms that would remove \nprocedural protections.\n  Of course, I understand that a number of my colleagues want to see \nmore prescriptive language which would limit the range of tools \navailable and require that trade sanctions be used to keep monetary \npolicies in line.\n  Most notably, we have the Portman-Stabenow amendment, which would \ncreate a negotiating objective requiring enforceable currency standards \namong parties to a trade agreement. The amendment goes on to say that \nthese standards must be subject to the same dispute settlement \nprocedures and remedies as all other elements of the trade agreement. \nWhile this approach may sound reasonable on the surface, there are a \nnumber of very serious and complex policy issues to consider. I will \naddress those specific concerns in some detail in just a few minutes, \nbut first I think we need to step back and take a look at the big \npicture.\n  I think I can boil this very complicated issue down to a single \npoint: The Portman-Stabenow amendment will kill TPA. I am not just \nsaying that; it is at this point a verifiable fact.\n  Yesterday, I received a letter from Treasury Secretary Lew outlining \nthe Obama administration's opposition to this amendment. The letter \naddresses a number of issues, some of which I will discuss later, but \nmost importantly, at the end of the letter, Secretary Lew stated very \nplainly that he would recommend that the President veto a TPA bill that \nincluded this amendment. That is pretty clear. It doesn't leave much \nroom for interpretation or speculation. No TPA bill that contains the \nlanguage of the Portman-Stabenow amendment stands a chance of becoming \nlaw.\n  I want to be clear. I have great respect for the authors of this \namendment. They are my friends, and I believe they are well-\nintentioned. They have spent a lot of time making their case on their \namendment, and I respect their points of view. But at this point, it is \ndifficult--very difficult, in fact--for anyone in this Chamber to claim \nthey support TPA and still vote in favor of the Portman-Stabenow \namendment. The two, as of yesterday, have officially become mutually \nexclusive.\n  For me, this issue is pretty cut and dry. However, I do recognize \nthat perhaps not everyone will view these developments the same way I \ndo. But regardless of what anyone may think of Secretary Lew's letter, \nthe Portman-Stabenow amendment raises enough substantive policy \nconcerns to warrant opposition on its own.\n  Offhand, I can think of four separate consequences we would run into \nif the Senate were to adopt this amendment, and all of them would have \na negative impact on U.S. economic interests.\n  First, the Portman-Stabenow negotiating objective would put the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership--or TPP--Agreement at grave risk, meaning \nthat our farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers, not to mention the \nworkers they employ, would not get access to these important foreign \nmarkets, resulting in fewer good, high-paying jobs for American \nworkers, and I should say higher paying jobs at that.\n  We know this is the case. Virtually all of our major negotiating \npartners--most notably Japan--have already made clear that they will \nnot agree to an enforceable provision like the one required by the \nPortman-Stabenow amendment. No country I am aware of, including the \nUnited States, has ever shown the willingness to have their monetary \npolicies subject to potential trade sanctions.\n  Adopting this amendment will have, at best, an immediate chilling \neffect on the TPP negotiations, and at worst, it will stop them in \ntheir tracks. If you don't believe me, then take a look at the letter \nwe received from 26 leading food and agricultural organizations, from \nthe American Farm Bureau, to the National Pork Producers Council, to \nthe Western Growers Association, urging Congress to reject the Portman-\nStabenow amendment because it will, in their words, ``most likely kill \nthe TPP negotiations.''\n  Put simply, not only will this amendment kill TPA, it will very \nlikely kill TPP--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--as well.\n  Second, the Portman-Stabenow amendment would put at risk the Federal \nReserve's independence in its ability to formulate and execute monetary \npolicies designed to protect and stabilize the U.S. economy. While some \nin this Chamber have made decrees that our domestic monetary policies \ndo not constitute currency manipulation, we know that not all of our \ntrading partners see it that way.\n  Requiring the inclusion of enforceable rules on currency manipulation \nand subsequent trade sanctions in our free-trade agreements would \nprovide other countries with a template for targeting U.S. monetary \npolicies, subjecting our own agencies and policies to trade disputes \nand adjudication in international trade tribunals.\n  We have already heard accusations in international commentaries by \nforeign finance ministers and central bankers that our own Fed--Federal \nReserve, that is--has manipulated the value of the dollar to gain trade \nadvantage. If the Portman-Stabenow amendment is adopted into TPA and \nthese rules become part of our trade agreements, how long do you think \nit will take for our trading partners to enter disputes and seek \nremedies against Federal Reserve quantitative easing policies? Not \nlong, I would imagine.\n  If the Portman-Stabenow amendment objective becomes part of our trade \nagreements, we will undoubtedly see formal actions to impose sanctions \non U.S. trade under the guise that the Federal Reserve has manipulated \nour currency for trade advantage. We will also be hearing from other \ncountries that Fed policy is causing instability in their financial \nmarkets and economies, and unless the Fed takes a different path, those \ncountries could argue for relief or justify their own exchange rate \npolicies to gain some trade advantage for themselves.\n  While we may not agree with those allegations, the point is that \nunder the Portman-Stabenow formulation, judgments and verdicts on our \npolicies will be taken out of our hands and, rather, can be rendered by \ninternational trade tribunals. I don't know anybody who really wants \nthat.\n  I am well aware that in an attempt to address this concern, the \nlatest version of the Portman-Stabenow amendment states that their \nenforceable rules do not apply to ``the exercise of domestic monetary \npolicy.'' But for those of us living here in the United States, that \nclarification does not provide much comfort. After all, the U.S. dollar \nis the global currency--that is, currently the global currency. If we \nfail to pass this bill--we have already seen China start to move toward \nhaving the yuan become the global currency. I will say again that the \nU.S. dollar is a global currency. In fact, it is the primary reserve \ncurrency in the world, and its value has an impact on markets \neverywhere. So for the United States, the question as to what is a \ndomestic monetary policy and what is not is open to a lot of debate, \nand I don't think any of us want those debates being resolved in some \ninternational trade tribunal, which is what is going to happen.\n  Moreover, contrary to what many of my colleagues seem to be arguing, \nno one in international trade--not the Treasury, not the IMF, not the \nG7, not the G20, not anyone in the world--has accurate tools in place \nto measure what is and what is not currency manipulation or what is \npurely domestic policy and what is intended to be international. Even \nif we demanded enforceable currency standards in our trade agreements, \nthis simple fact will not change.\n  Basing trade sanctions on existing methods which have thus far proven \nto\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nbe unreliable is fraught with risks--risks we should not undertake.\n  For example, IMF models recently showed that in 2013, Japan's \ncurrency was anywhere between around 15 percent undervalued and 15 \npercent overvalued. Given that range, what is an international trade \ntribunal to do if asked to set trade sanctions based on allegations of \ncurrency manipulation? Who in the heck knows. But if we insert these \nstandards into our trade agreements, we would not only subject our \ntrading partners to possible trade sanctions based on indefinite \nstandards, the United States would face similar risks. This is a recipe \nfor trade and currency wars--a situation I think we would all like to \navoid.\n  Third, under this amendment--that is, the Portman-Stabenow \namendment--the traditional role of the U.S. Treasury in setting U.S. \nexchange rate policies would be watered down and potentially overruled \nin international trade tribunals. Do we want that? Thus, adoption of \nthe Portman-Stabenow negotiating objective cedes independence and full \nauthority over not only monetary policy for the Federal Reserve but \nalso exchange rate policy for the Treasury.\n  Fourth, the Portman-Stabenow amendment would create incentives for \nour trading partners to evade regular reporting and transparency of \nexchange rate policies. If currency standards become enforceable and \nimmediately subject to sanctions under a trade agreement, the parties \non that agreement would almost certainly start withholding full \nparticipation in reporting and monitoring mechanisms that would \notherwise enable us to identify exchange rate interventions and work \nagainst them.\n  Put simply, we cannot enforce rules against unfair exchange rate \npractices. If we do not have information about them, we can't enforce \nthe rules. Under the Portman-Stabenow amendment, our trading partners \nare far more likely to engage in interventions in the shadows, hiding \nfrom detection out of fear that they could end up being subjected to \ntrade sanctions. I don't think anybody wants that, but that is what is \ngoing to happen.\n  For these reasons and others, the Portman-Stabenow amendment is the \nwrong approach. Still, I do recognize that currency manipulation is a \nlegitimate concern and one we need to address in a serious, thoughtful \nway.\n  Toward that end, Senator Wyden and I have filed an amendment that \nwould expand on the currency negotiating objective that is already in \nthe TPA bill to give our country more tools to address currency \nmanipulation without the problems and risks that would come part and \nparcel with the Portman-Stabenow amendment.\n  The Portman-Stabenow amendment would provide a single tool to address \ncurrency manipulation: enforceable rules subject to sanctions. As I \nthink I have demonstrated, this, for a variety of reasons, is a pretty \nblunt, unreliable, and imprecise instrument, given the realities of the \nglobal economy.\n  By contrast, the Hatch-Wyden amendment would put a number of tools at \nour disposal. Specifically, the amendment calls for enhanced \ntransparency, disclosure, reporting, monitoring, cooperative \nmechanisms, as well as enforceable rules. Our amendment, which would \nprovide maximum flexibility, is a better alternative for addressing \ncurrency manipulation for a number of reasons.\n  First, it would preserve the integrity of our current trade \nnegotiations. Once again, if we insert an absolute requirement for \nenforceable currency rules and required sanctions into the ongoing TPP \nnegotiations, many, if not all, of our negotiating partners will almost \ncertainly walk away. The Hatch-Wyden amendment would pose no threat to \nthe TPP negotiations or any other trade deals.\n  Second, our amendment would not threaten the independence of the \nFederal Reserve or subject our own monetary and exchange rate policies \nto possible sanctions based on indefinite standards. Unlike the \nPortman-Stabenow amendment, it does not give other countries a roadmap \nto accuse the United States of using its policies intended for domestic \ngrowth and stability as tools for currency manipulation.\n  Third, it would increase transparency and accountability of our \ntrading partners' currency practices. This is absolutely crucial. Put \nsimply, we cannot counteract practices that we cannot readily observe. \nThe Portman-Stabenow amendment would tell our trading partners that if \nyou engage in full reporting and transparency, you run the risk of \nhaving an international tribunal detect your actions in ways that will \ngenerate trade sanctions. The incentive, then, is for countries not to \nbe transparent and instead to put their currency policies further in \nthe shadows, hiding away information that could end up being used in \ntrade disputes.\n  Our trade agreements should provide incentives for countries to go in \nthe opposite direction: full disclosure and accountability of currency \npractices. The Hatch-Wyden amendment would provide a more effective \nincentive structure.\n  Finally, and in the current context, most importantly, the Hatch-\nWyden amendment would not result in a veto of the TPA bill. It is, in \nfact, supported by the Obama administration, not to mention business \nand agriculture stakeholders across the country.\n  I suppose one could say we have come full circle. After what I hope \nhas been an interesting discussion of important policy considerations, \nwe are back at the simple, uncomplicated truth. If nothing I have said \nhere today about the complexities of currency and monetary policy has \nresonated with my colleagues, this fact remains: A vote for the \nPortman-Stabenow amendment is a vote to kill TPA.\n  I am sure that sounds good to some of my colleagues who are \nfundamentally opposed to what we are trying to do here, but for those \nwho support free trade, open markets, and high-paying jobs for American \nworkers, this truth is inescapable.\n  But, once again, this doesn't mean we should stand by and do nothing \nabout currency manipulation. The Hatch-Wyden amendment will provide an \neffective path to improve transparency, measurement, and monitoring of \nour trading partners' currency practices, and effective and transparent \nways to counteract anyone seeking to manipulate currencies for unfair \ntrade advantage.\n  The Hatch-Wyden amendment will allow Congress to speak forcefully on \nthe issue of currency manipulation without putting our trade agreements \nand domestic policies in limbo.\n  For Senators who are sincerely concerned about currency \nmanipulation--and I am one of those Senators--the Hatch-Wyden amendment \nwould address these issues in a far more productive way.\n  So, at this point, the choice should be pretty clear. We have strong \nindications that the House cannot pass a TPA bill with the Portman-\nStabenow language. Even if it could pass the House, Secretary Lew has \nmade it very clear that including that provision in our bill would \ncompel President Obama to veto it.\n  The Hatch-Wyden amendment, on the other hand, would strengthen our \nhand by providing a workable set of tools to counteract currency \nmanipulation in a way that would protect our interests and achieve real \nresults and, most importantly, it would preserve our ability to enact \nTPA so we can negotiate strong trade agreements that will help grow our \neconomy and create jobs.\n  That is the choice we face with these two amendments. I call on my \ncolleagues who support TPA to oppose the Portman-Stabenow currency \namendment and support the Hatch-Wyden alternative.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish for colleagues to know \nthat I think Chairman Hatch has made some very important points with \nrespect to the currency issue and for colleagues to know that the \napproach of the chairman and me is to make sure we can have tough, \nenforceable currency rules without doing damage to American monetary \npolicy or the ability to fight big economic challenges in the days \nahead that we think would come about with the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  By the way, I want colleagues to know that currency is going to be in \nthe Customs conference. Chairman Hatch and I have discussed this point\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\nas well. We felt very strongly about making sure there is a Customs \nconference that goes right to the heart of the enforcement agenda. In \nthat Customs conference--and the chairman and I have been able to \nsecure a commitment from the President and from Chairman Ryan--that \nCustoms conference is going to take place right when we get back. The \nPresident of the United States indicated last night that he wants us to \nget this done in June. So we are going to have a chance to tackle \ncurrency in that conference. Senator Bennet worked closely with the \nchairman and I so we got something in the committee that we thought was \na smart, practical step. The chairman and I are talking today about \nsomething that is also strong and enforceable that would not produce \nthe downside I have outlined.\n  So I want colleagues to understand there is an opportunity, \nparticularly on the currency issue, very quickly, to put in place very \ntough, practical rules that get us the upside in terms of protecting \nthe American economy without some of the downsides I have outlined and \nthat Chairman Hatch has described as well.\n  What I want to do particularly this morning is, given yesterday, talk \nabout some of the very positive developments we saw yesterday. I wish \nto express my appreciation to Chairman Hatch again for working closely \nwith me on these issues.\n  I will start by talking about Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez, as \ndo many of us, feels very strongly about human trafficking, about \ncompelled labor, about commercial sex. He has made it very clear he \nwants to stop trafficking and he wants us to come up with a fresh \npolicy. So he offered an amendment in the Finance Committee and it \npassed. All over the press for the next few days--and Chairman Hatch \nremembers this--were accounts: Poison pill is going to end the \npossibility of finding a way forward on the trade promotion act. The \nheadlines were everywhere. The general view in the press was Western \ncivilization was about to end because of the adoption of the Menendez \namendment.\n  Well, Senator Menendez believes in legislating. He believes what we \nought to be doing when there are important issues, contentious issues--\nthat we need to find a way to bring everyone together. So what Senator \nMenendez did--and I was very pleased to be able to play a modest role \nin this--is he brought together all of the groups. He brought together \nthe administration, the U.S. Trade Representative, and outstanding \norganizations that fight trafficking and, without any headlines and \nwithout any drama, did the nuts-and-bolts work to make sure that now we \nare going to have a new process. We are going to have a new process \nthat ensures that the President is going to report to the Congress on \nthe concrete steps the country takes to crack down on trafficking.\n\n  Now, it didn't make headlines this morning. It doesn't make headlines \nwhen you work with both sides and all the parties outside of the bright \nlights. But today we now have an opportunity to move forward, in a \nbipartisan way, on an issue that a couple of weeks ago was described as \na poison pill, the end of TPA, causing the entire Senate to be \nparalyzed because it wouldn't be possible to move forward.\n  I bring this up only by way of saying that I hope today--and I am \ngoing to be here throughout the day trying to work with both sides to \ntry to find a way to get amendments considered and to do as Senator \nMenendez did over the last 10 days or so to actually solve a problem \nand make it possible for us to up the ante against this plague of \ntrafficking but also make it possible to move forward on this \nlegislation.\n  I would also like to note that all this work went on when everyone \nunderstood that Senator Menendez has been opposed to the legislation \nand Chairman Hatch and I have been for it. But the idea was that both \nsides care about trying to fight trafficking. Both sides understood \nthat if we worked together, there was an opportunity to really solve a \nproblem.\n  In my view, Senator Menendez deserves great credit for doing what is \nthe most important work in the Senate, legislating and trying to bring \npeople together of disparate views. In doing so, what Senator Menendez \naccomplished was to show the country and the Senate that we can take \nanother step for trade done right.\n  Trade done right is my vision of where we ought to go. We have heard \nabout free trade and fair trade. What we want is trade done right. \nBecause Senator Menendez was willing to put in all this time on his \ntrafficking bill, we took, on a bipartisan basis, an issue that was a \npoison pill whenever it was discussed just about anywhere in the \ncountry and we turned it into a better approach to fight trafficking. \nWe were able to advance the cause of being able to move forward, and I \nlook forward to seeing that passed.\n  A second area where we made a lot of progress yesterday was on \nenforcing our trade laws. Particularly important about this, because \nvirtually every time I have ever talked about promoting trade--pretty \nimportant in my State where one out of five jobs depends on trade--I \nhave said that passing new trade agreements and doing a better job of \nenforcing the trade laws are two sides of the same coin. The reason I \nreached that judgment was because of what a number of skeptics about \nthis issue brought up--and I think it is a legitimate concern--which \nis: Why is everybody in Washington, DC, talking about new trade laws \nwhen they are not doing everything to enforce the laws we have on the \nbooks? Chairman Hatch and I talked about this many times and both of us \nagreed we needed a robust enforcement package.\n  We were able to get important measures into our Finance bill--\nmeasures that were sought by a number of our colleagues. Senator Brown \nhad a number of provisions. I was particularly interested in what is \ncalled the ENFORCE Act. This is something I developed back when I was \nchair of the trade subcommittee.\n  We had put together a sting operation to catch scofflaws overseas who \nwere trying to avoid our trade laws. In effect, what they were doing \nwas merchandise laundering. They would be found to be in violation of \nour dumping or our trade rules in one country and they would just move \nto another and try to move it through another nation, and we caught \nthem on it. Many parties responded to the sting operation saying: We \nare in. We are anxious to stop this merchandise laundering. So I don't \ntake a backseat to anybody in terms of enforcing our trade laws.\n  So after Chairman Hatch and I got that through the Finance Committee, \nthe second step was we had a separate vote in the Senate on a very \nstrong Customs and Enforcement package. That was step No. 2. But at \nthat time, a number of observers said: Well, nothing is going to \nhappen. It got passed here in the Senate, but that bill is not going \nanywhere, not going to happen. That is the end of the topic.\n  Chairman Hatch and I, working together with Chairman Ryan, said: Of \ncourse we are going to have a conference. We feel very strongly about \nthis. So we put out a statement earlier in this week saying: You bet \nthere is going to be a conference in June, and we are committed to \ngetting this done.\n  Chairman Ryan has indicated that he is going to take each of the \ntrade bills--all four of them--up on the same day in the other body. He \nis going to pass them all, and then we will have a conference. After \nthat happened, I was told that, well, that sounds good, but we are \nstill not going to have much. Is the administration going to be for it?\n  So, yesterday, in consultation with Chairman Hatch and myself and \nothers, the President put out a very strong statement explicitly \nstating what he wanted in that conference, and he wanted it in June. He \ntalked again about Senator Brown's measures, 301, the level playing \nfield, and the ENFORCE Act. I was very pleased he mentioned child \nlabor.\n  So a tough, strong enforcement package is going to happen. I am going \nto insist on it. Chairman Hatch has pledged to me he is going to insist \non it. It is going to happen. All of that was essentially nailed down \nin the last 24 hours.\n  So two big issues, two very significant issues, which were both \nconsidered to be show-stoppers: The Menendez amendment, fixed. All the \nheadlines about poison pills, no longer valid. Senator Menendez has \nfixed it.\n  Chairman Hatch, to his credit, has been willing to work with me and \nwith the President. We are going to have a\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\nstrong enforcement package and we are going to have it in June and it \nis going to become law as part of the Customs conference.\n  The Senate spent a lot of time yesterday debating an important issue, \nwhich is the future of the Export-Import Bank. I want to thank my \nPacific Northwest colleague and friend Senator Cantwell for all of her \nleadership--all of her leadership over the years--in trying to renew \nthe Export-Import Bank. She has been the one who has pointed out: If \nyou have trade laws, which we are trying to promote with the trade \npromotion act, but you aren't using the tools that you need to get the \nmaximum value--wring the maximum value out of those new laws--you are \nmissing opportunities that are important for our Nation. So I urge the \nmajority leader to work closely with Senator Cantwell to make that \nhappen.\n  Finally, I have been pleased to see a robust debate on a number of \nissues, particularly issues that have been important to Senator Warren \nand Senator Brown. What I have said from the very beginning and what I \nam going to be here all day working on is this: There are Senators who \nfeel strongly about promoting the trade promotion act; there are \nSenators who are opposed to it. I am obviously for the agreement, but \nevery single day I am looking for opportunities for both sides to be \nheard and to be able to advance their ideas. It started long before we \nactually had votes in the Senate Finance Committee, and it is going to \ncontinue every single day that I have the opportunity to serve in the \nSenate.\n  These are important issues. I thought it was particularly important \nthat Senator Warren's investor-state provision be able to get a vote \nearly on in the proceeding--obviously an issue that there has been \ngreat debate on--and there are many more important amendments to this \npackage.\n  So I want colleagues on both sides of the aisle to know I am going to \nbe here throughout the day--throughout the day--looking for ways that \nall Senators, whether they are for the agreement or against the \nagreement, will have an opportunity to have their priorities considered \non this trade legislation.\n  I will just wrap up, colleagues, by way of saying that the reason \nthis issue is so important is we debate continually about how to get \nmore high-wage jobs in our country. Continually we debate that because \nwe want higher wages for our constituents. The evidence is that trade \njobs pay better than do the nontrade jobs. We need more of them.\n  There was a report this morning that my State has a significant trade \nsurplus, and we are very proud of that. There are other States that \ndon't. Let's promote legislation that allows us to secure more exports, \nparticularly in the developing world, where there are going to be a \nbillion middle-class consumers in 2025. We want them to ``Buy \nAmerican,'' because when they do, it creates the opportunity for us to \nhave more of those export value-added, high-productivity jobs that pay \nour workers better wages and that strengthen our middle class.\n  It is going to be a busy day, and I look forward to working, again, \nwith both sides so Senators, whether they are for the TPA or whether \nthey are against it, feel they have a chance to raise their issues and \nbe treated fairly.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           National Security\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today, President Obama is heading to \nConnecticut, where I understand he is going to be addressing the \ngraduates at the Coast Guard Academy. He plans to talk about threats to \nour national security.\n  I think many Americans would be astonished to learn the President's \nplanned discussion on national security is going to center on climate \nchange. After all, Americans understand there are much more immediate \nthreats facing our Nation, such as the fall of Ramadi in Iraq and the \nbrutal terrorist attacks by ISIS. These are clear examples of the real \nthreats that must be addressed by President Obama.\n  I would encourage the President to spend this time today addressing \nAmerica's most pressing national security threats. The President and \nhis national security team must deliver strong leadership and an \neffective strategy to fight the terrorists who want to attack our \ncountry and kill more Americans. This should be the focus of the \nPresident's speech today. This should be our most pressing national \nsecurity concern.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to talk about an important issue \nthat is facing Americans and they will soon need to be seeing, which is \nthat next month the Supreme Court is expected to announce a decision in \nthe case of King v. Burwell. This is a case that has been brought on \nbehalf of millions of Americans who have been harmed by the President's \nunlawful expansion of his unworkable and unaffordable health care law.\n  Sometime before the end of June, the Court is going to announce if \nthe law passed by Congress means what it says or if it means what the \nPresident wishes it had said. The law, written by Democrats in \nCongress, written behind closed doors, only authorized insurance \nsubsidies for one group, and the President had the IRS pay subsidies to \nanother group.\n  The President gave bureaucrats much more power to control the health \ncare choices and decisions of people who never should have been caught \nunder the law. The Supreme Court should strike down this alarming \noverreach by the President. If it does, that will give Congress an \nopportunity to address some of the devastating problems the health care \nlaw has caused.\n  It seems like every week we see another headline about another \ndamaging side effect of the President's health care law. Here is one \nexample from a story yesterday morning, the front page of Investor's \nBusiness Daily: ``ObamaCare Rates Will Soar In 2016, Early Data \nSignal.'' Average 18.16 percent hike proposed. It is an astonishing \nfact that people are facing--increasing rates, soaring again in 2016.\n  Insurance companies that sell plans in the ObamaCare exchange are \nstarting to set their rates for next year. There are a series of \narticles that continue to come out. One says that the top ObamaCare \nexchange insurers in six different States where the 2016 rate requests \nhave already been filed--and they will come in every State--are seeking \nrate changes that average 18.6 percent just next year alone. Early \nreports range from an alarming 36-percent hike sought by the dominant \ninsurer in Tennessee to a hefty 23-percent average increase requested \nby Oregon insurers. People across the country saw these rates go up at \nthe beginning of this year, and now they are facing it again. They are \nstarting to learn that it was not just a 1-year deal.\n  There is another story that came out May 7 in the Connecticut Mirror. \nThe article says that insurance companies selling health plans through \nthe State's health insurance exchange are seeking to raise rates next \nyear, with an average increase somewhere between 2 and nearly 14 \npercent.\n  You take a look; it is outrageous.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut has come to the floor saying that \nwe should be celebrating ObamaCare--celebrating it, he said. Well, with \nthese rate increases for families in Connecticut, it looks to me like \nthe party is over. ObamaCare was supposed to bring costs down. That is \nwhat the President promised. He said premiums would go down by an \naverage of $2,500 per year, per family. It has not happened. For an \naverage family who gets coverage through their work, the premiums have \ngone up about $3,500 since the President took office in 2009.\n  Why do we still see headlines about premiums going up by 14 percent \nor even 2 percent? Why are they going up at all? Why are the promises \nDemocrats made about the health care law not coming true? Why are \nObamaCare rates set to soar again in 2016? Why are people in places \nlike Connecticut still seeing headlines about their costs going up by \n14 percent?\n  A few weeks ago, the Democratic leader said on the floor that \nObamaCare is a ``smashing success.'' He stood right over there and said \nit--it is a ``smashing success.'' Is there a Democrat who thinks that a \n14-percent increase to families in Connecticut is a\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\nsmashing success or that an 18.6-percent average across the country is \na smashing success?\n  We are going to see this same story about soaring insurance rates \nrepeated all across America. And it is not just the ObamaCare premiums \nthat are causing problems for families. Here is a headline from the \nWashington Post on Friday: ``Insured, but still not able to afford \ncare.''\n  ``For one in four who bought health coverage, some costs remained too \nhigh.'' So they have insurance, but they are still not able to get \ncare. People who have insurance have been avoiding going to see the \ndoctor. That is according to a new study by the liberal advocacy group \ncalled Families USA. This was an advocacy group who was a huge \nsupporter of the President's health care law and a huge supporter of \nthe President. Even this group has to admit that coverage does not \nequal care. There is a difference. The group's executive director is \nquoted in this article in the Washington Post as saying, ``The key \nculprit as to why people have been unable to afford medical care \ndespite coverage is high deductibles.'' Well, I agree. Many people's \ndeductibles are too high. The reason the deductibles have gotten so \nhigh and so out of hand all of a sudden is that the health care law \nincluded so many coverage mandates.\n  Democrats who voted for this said they know better than the people at \nhome what kind of insurance they need. That is what the President said. \nThe President said: I know better than you do. I know what your family \nneeds. You do not. That is why the deductibles are so high. Insurance \nhad to raise their premiums to cover the cost of all these new \nWashington mandates. They had to raise deductibles as well. This year, \nthe average deductible for an ObamaCare Silver Plan is almost $3,000 \nfor a single person and more than $6,000 for a family.\n  People have Washington-mandated coverage, but they still cannot \nafford to get care. So people are putting off going to the doctor. They \nare skipping tests. They are skipping followup care because of the high \ndeductibles and copays. Why are people across the country having to put \noff getting care? Because they cannot afford it. Is that what Democrats \nmean when they say the law has been a smashing success, when the \nminority leader comes to the floor and says it is a smashing success? \nAll across the country, Americans are struggling with the cost of \nhealth care under this health care law.\n  There was a study out this morning. In the paper The Hill, Sarah \nFerris writes:\n\n       ``Underinsured'' population has doubled in the United \n     States to 31 million.\n       One-quarter of people with healthcare coverage are paying \n     so much for deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that they \n     are considered underinsured.\n\n  Thirty-one million Americans.\n\n       Rising deductibles--even under ObamaCare--are the biggest \n     problem for most people who are considered underinsured.\n\n  Doubled. The number of underinsured people under the health care law \nhas now doubled.\n  People are paying more as a result of the Democrats' health care law, \nand they are going to be paying even more next year and the year after \nthat until we are able to do something to stop it.\n  Republicans are offering real solutions that will end these \ndestructive and expensive ObamaCare side effects. That means giving \nAmericans and giving States the freedom, the choice, and the control \nover their health care decisions once again. Republicans understand \nthat coverage does not equal care. Republicans understand what American \nfamilies were asking for before this health care law was ever passed. \nThat is what they are still asking for today.\n  It is time for Democrats to admit that their health care law did not \nwork--it did not work out the way they promised--and to start working \nwith Republicans on reforms that will give people the care they need \nfrom a doctor they choose at lower costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, returning to the conversation about trade \npolicy and its impact on American workers and businesses, President \nKennedy once said, ``The trade of a nation expresses, in a very \nconcrete way, its aim and its aspirations.'' Well, what are our aims \nand aspirations in crafting a new trade structure? The President says \nthat his aim and aspiration is to be the writer of rules for trade in \nAsia. I have a different aspiration. My aspiration is that we create \ntrade that creates living-wage jobs in America, that puts people to \nwork making things in America. If we don't make things in America, we \nwill not have a middle class in America.\n  So as we contemplate a massive new trade deal, the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, and the bill before us to fast-track consideration of that \nTrans-Pacific Partnership, we should ask ourselves this question: Is \nthis about our geostrategic goal of being the leader in writing the \nrules or is it about writing rules that actually work for working \nAmericans? Because, you see, working America has done very poorly under \nthis goal of geostrategic influence. Oh, yeah, we had NAFTA, the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. We had CAFTA, the Central American Free \nTrade Agreement. What was the result of that? Well, we lost 5 million \njobs in America. We lost 5 million jobs.\n  We lost 50,000 factories. If you go around Oregon, you can see those \nfactory sites. I recently visited the Blue Heron site. Just a few years \nago, there were hundreds of workers at the Blue Heron paper factory, \nbut under the structure of one trade agreement--WTO--those jobs went to \nChina. Paper manufacturing went to China. The equipment was pulled up \nout of that factory, leaving a big hole, and shipped overseas. That is \nwhat happened. We lost our factories. We lost our jobs.\n  There has been a lot of discussion that this is a new trade \nagreement, that it establishes enforceable standards for labor. Well, \nperhaps the single most important standard is minimum wage. Minimum \nwage is about resisting the full exploitation of workers, the full race \nto the bottom. So, of course, I am sure the proponents would say: Well, \nof course we have addressed that. That is central. That is the central \ningredient, is to make sure that there is not a race to the bottom and \nthat we address the fact that every nation that will be part of this \nagreement will have to have a minimum wage, a minimum wage that rises \nover time, a minimum wage that provides a basic standard of living so \nthat we do not have conditions of full exploitation, miserable \nsweatshops, if you will, that are producing the goods we are buying \nhere in America under this agreement.\n  So it may come as a shock to people across America that this most \nfundamental standard of minimum wage is not addressed in this \nagreement.\n  What do we have right now? We have 12 countries. We have two \ncountries--Brunei and Singapore--with no minimum-wage standard at all. \nThen we have Mexico at 66 cents and Vietnam--for Vietnam, they set a \nmonthly minimum wage and they set it regionally. So the number varies \naccording to how you calculate it. Some would call it 57 cents; others \nwould say 74 cents. Let's just put it this way: The minimum wage in \nVietnam is way under $1 per hour. In Malaysia, it is $1.54; Peru, \n$1.55; Chile, $2.25.\n  So does this Trans-Pacific Partnership have a requirement that there \nbe a minimum wage that will rise up workers and stop these sweatshops \nacross the world so that we are not buying products from sweatshops \nwith miserable, slave-like conditions? It does not. It has no such \nprovision. It has no minimum wage, which leads us to another \nfundamental observation.\n  What this trade agreement does is set up a dynamic between these very \nlow wage countries and countries that are developed and aspiring to \ncreate living-wage jobs here. But what happens when you have \nmanufacturing in these high-wage countries, high-environmental-standard \ncountries, high-labor-standard countries and high-enforcement countries \nand the manufacturer looks out and sees a competitor, in a free-trade \nregime, in these very low-wage, low-labor, low-environmental, and low-\nenforcement countries? Well, it is obvious: The manufacturing migrates \nto the place that is the cheapest. That is the way free enterprise \nworks--it goes to where you can make the most profit.\n  So it is not some absurd, unexpected result that NAFTA resulted in \nthe loss of 5 million good-paying jobs in America. It is not some \nunexpected result that we lost 50,000 factories.\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\n  When he was campaigning for President, Ross Perot said: If you adopt \nNAFTA, you will hear the sound of the jobs leaving America.\n  Well, that is exactly what happened--exactly what happened.\n  So is it a fact that this new-generation trade agreement actually \naddress this core problem? Well, the answer is, it does not. It does \nnot do anything to address this disparity between very low wages and \nprosperous countries. This is going to be, as Ross Perot put it, \nanother situation with a giant sucking sound of jobs leaving America.\n\n  Proponents of this treaty say: Well, we have done something very \nsignificant. We have taken the labor and environmental side agreements \nand we have put them in the center of the agreement. This is pretty \nmuch like moving deck chairs on the Titanic. You move them from one \nlocation to another location. How does that change the outcome? Well, \nit doesn't. It just means they are printed in a different part of the \ntext. That is not very good news, if you will, to workers across the \nUnited States of America who have been assured there is something \nfundamentally different about this agreement.\n  These labor standards and these environmental standards that are in \nthe agreement--we have heard a lot about enforcement, and there is \nnothing new to enforce in these labor and environmental standards.\n  I want to take a little detour here because there are some important \nenforcement standards that my colleagues have put forward. My colleague \nfrom Oregon has put forward the ENFORCE Act. This is important for \nenforcing tariffs. This is important for enforcing the movement of \ngoods illegally through third parties in order to bypass tariffs in the \nUnited States. That is a good step forward, but that does not address \nthe core of this issue which is enforcement of the labor and \nenvironmental standards.\n  Now, we have the same basic standards in various trade agreements, \nand they are never enforced because there is no effective mechanism for \nenforcement. Let me expand a little bit on what has gone on and then \npoint out that nothing has been done to fix it. You essentially have a \nset of standards and these standards are the International Labor \nOrganization standards, ILO standards. These ILO standards address a \nseries of things. These ILO standards are things such as child labor. \nThat is a bad idea. It should stop. It addresses that union organizing \nshould be allowed, and that is a good thing. So the standards \nthemselves are solid and respectable.\n  But when a nation becomes part of the trade agreement, how do you \nhave them enforce those standards. That is what is missing--no \nenforcement for these standards.\n  There is a government-to-government process for consultations when \nthe United States is upset that someone is not enforcing. Ultimately, \nthey can file a case. That case can take years and years and years to \nadjudicate, and it never gets done.\n  The number of labor standard enforcement actions that have been \ncompleted is zero. The number of environmental enforcement standards \nthat have been completed is zero--zero, zero. So if we take a broken \nsystem from existing trade treaties and slip it into a new trade \ntreaty, what is the expected result? No enforcement of these standards. \nAll the parties know that. They can put these laws on the books, but \nthere is not going to be enforcement.\n  There is one case--one case alone--that we have sought to proceed to \nenforce and that is with Guatemala. With Guatemala, they have massive \nlabor violations. They are not making the slightest attempt to follow \nthe ILO. We held consultations, more consultations, and more \nconsultations, and finally filed a case. It has gone on and on and on \nand never gotten to a conclusion. So we still have zero, zero \nenforcement.\n  Now, one reason it doesn't get to a conclusion is because there is no \nenthusiasm behind any form of enforcement, and why is that? First, our \ngovernment says: Well, if we try to enforce it, it will create ripples \nin the relationship. That country will be upset with us if we try to \nenforce a labor standard and an environmental standard.\n  Then, second, they will say: No, there be will retaliation. They will \nfile suits against us, and we will have to spend all this time \nresponding, and what is the point of that. That is unproductive. We say \nthey are not meeting it. They say we are not meeting it.\n  Then, third, and very importantly, the companies that have invested \nunder that trade agreement in that nation, they come out and tell the \ngovernment: What are you doing? The goal of the trade agreement was to \ncreate a stable environment for investments. You are destabilizing that \nby filing a grievance against this country, so don't do it. In the end, \nif you ever got to an enforcement action, well, that would hurt us \nbecause we put our factory there, and now we would be subject to \ntariffs.\n  So this combination means that structure is completely dysfunctional, \nand that structure is exactly what is in TPP. So this is why we are \ncoming forward and saying now is the time to fully debate how we tackle \nthis problem so we can stop pontificating about strong labor and \nenvironmental standards and actually have a structure that creates that \nwithin the 12 nations that are considered being part of TPP. So that is \nthe distinction.\n  Significant, valuable attention is being paid to enforcement of \ntariffs and efforts to bypass through third-party shipments, our \nCustoms structure--and that is important. But the labor standards and \nthe environmental standards, enforcement is zero, and that same broken \nsystem is being imported into the TPP.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor and I tried to pull up amendments. We \nare being told the leaders on this bill want to choose, pluck, and pick \njust the amendments they want to allow to be debated, unlike in the \npast, where we have had a situation where people have been invited to \ncome to the floor and make their amendments pending, and then we worked \nthrough those amendments. So we spent time addressing the issues that \nSenators thought were important. That is a robust and open process.\n\n  But despite the promises of the majority leader for an open and \nrobust amendment process, we do not have that. We have a behind-the-\nscenes negotiation with amendments picked and plucked according to what \nthe proponents of this deal want to have, and the rest of us are out in \nthe cold.\n  So I have these four amendments that I would be happy to pull up at \nany time that is allowed. I already tried yesterday, so I will not try \nto do it again, but let me tell you the types of things they address. \nOne is it takes on the core deficiency in the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, which is that it does not have any minimum wage. So it \nsimply says:\n\n       FOR AGREEMENTS THAT SUBJECT UNITED STATES WORKERS TO UNFAIR \n     COMPETITION ON THE BASIS OF WAGES.--The trade authorities \n     procedures shall not apply to an implementing bill submitted \n     with respect to a trade agreement entered into under section \n     103(b) unless the agreement--\n       (A) establishes a minimum wage that each party to the \n     agreement is required to establish and maintain before the \n     trade agreement is implemented; and--\n\n  So it is not something that is done down the road; it is done before \nit is implemented. Second--\n\n       (B) stipulates that the minimum wage required for each \n     party to the agreement increase over time, to continuously \n     reduce the disparity between the lowest and highest minimum \n     wages [in these very low countries and these very high \n     countries].\n\n  Now, currently, the disparity of the minimum wage between the United \nStates and Mexico is about tenfold. Here we are: Mexico at 66 cents, \nthe United States at over $7. Mexico's minimum wage is 9 percent of our \nminimum wage--one-tenth.\n  So, of course, it made sense that factories would be shipped from the \nUnited States to Mexico. Not only do you have poor enforcement, poor \nenvironmental standards that are not enforced, but you have a minimum \nwage that is one-tenth of what it is in the United States.\n  So I don't specify in this amendment that the minimum wage has to be \nset at any particular level. That can be the subject of the \nnegotiations. I don't specify that it has to be raised by 10 percent a \nyear to narrow the difference between the very low countries and the \nhigher countries so we reduce the disparity.\n  This is like taking a playing field that is tilted 10 to 1 against \nthe workers of the United States of America--10\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\nto 1. It is not close to a level playing field. The American minimum \nwage is more than 10 times the Mexican minimum wage. It is a 10-to-1 \ndisadvantage to American workers.\n  That is what we are talking about--the proponents are talking about--\nembedding into this trade agreement. So I am suggesting: OK. At a \nminimum, the negotiated process, where that playing field is gradually \nbrought to a more level situation, where the disparity is decreased, \nshouldn't that be a primary negotiating objective of the United States \nin these agreements? Aren't we right now talking about explaining to \nthe administration what they should negotiate in this agreement?\n  My colleague from Utah spoke earlier about the provision regarding \ncurrency manipulation and explained why he thought it would be \nunproductive to have it here--while it is very important--unproductive \nto have the amendment that Shaheen and Portman, my colleagues, are \npresenting. But that is the purpose of this debate on the floor, to \nallow that amendment to be called up, to hear the views for it, to hear \nthe views against it, and to lay out our vision to the administration.\n  Now, my colleague has pointed out that the administration has said it \nwill not accept establishing a goal of enforceable currency \nmanipulation provisions. Why is that? I can tell you because the \nadministration told me. They said, if we had put this on the table in \nthe beginning, then we could probably raise it and have it be part of \nthe conversation. But, you see, we have already negotiated this \nagreement. It is 95 to 98 percent done, and so we can't possibly \nintroduce something new into this process. That would disrupt all the \ngroundwork we have laid.\n  So this is where the cart came before the horse. The treaty was \nnegotiated without consultation with Congress about what should be in \nit. We all understand currency manipulation is a form of tariff. It is \na form of tariff and subsidy.\n  When I came into the Senate, China's currency manipulation was \ncalculated to be equal to a 25-percent tariff on American products \ngoing to China and a 25-percent subsidy to Chinese products coming to \nthe United States. Well, that is a huge tariff. Combine the two \ntogether--50 percent differential. That is not fair and appropriate in \na trade agreement that was supposed to reduce--under the WTO--barriers. \nNo. So we know it is a problem. Why not fix it, why not address it, why \nnot debate it, why not discuss it, and why not struggle to find a \nsolution. That is what Senators Shaheen and Portman are saying; that \nthat is an important element related to this unbalanced situation that \nis going to remove jobs from the United States.\n  Now, I am pointing out another deficiency; that is, that there is no \nminimum wage, that we are starting out with a 10-to-1 differential with \nMexico, approximately a 10-to-1 differential with Vietnam, that there \nshould be a minimum wage so we can stop the race to the bottom, and it \nshould be gradually raised to decrease the disparity.\n  That is an issue worthy of debate, but I can't get that debate onto \nthis floor because the proponents don't want to allow debates on these \namendments. They just want to choose and pick the subjects that they \nwant to allow to be debated rather than the ones the Senators want to \nallow to be debated. That is not a robust and open amendment process.\n  Now, there is another flaw in this TPA, which is it has negotiating \nobjectives. An objective is simply a wish, a hope, it is a desire, it \nis an inclination, but an objective is not an actual provision.\n  So we can say all the beautiful things we want about what our \nobjectives should be, but instead we should be asking, What are the \nstandards? What are the standards that need to be in a treaty that are \nbrought back in order to benefit from fast-track? What are the actual \nstandards that should be in an agreement that is brought back to the \nSenate under fast-track--because fast-track gets special privileges on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  So setting an objective doesn't do the work because it doesn't define \nwhat will come back to this body under this special privilege. We \nshould convert those objectives into actual requirements. That is what \none of my amendments does.\n  Then we can turn to the situation where the TPA has another deep flaw \nthat many have pointed out that hasn't been addressed, and this deep \nflaw is it sets up an international tribunal, an international tribunal \nthat can essentially assess fines on our local government, it can \nassess fines on our State government, it can assess fines on the U.S. \nGovernment, unless our local government or the State government or the \nFederal Government change their laws.\n  Establishing a judicial organization with no accountability to the \nU.S. judiciary, that is a grant of sovereignty. That is our courts' \nsovereignty being shipped to a tribunal of three corporate lawyers who \nget to decide whether there are massive fines levied against our local, \nState, and national governments. Well, that is certainly something that \nshould be deeply concerning to us.\n\n  Now, the goal of this was to have some sort of judicial process \nsubstitute in countries that have a dysfunctional judicial process, and \nthereby encourage international investment. So you could have a \nsituation where Vietnam and Malaysia would say: We know our judicial \norganization is corrupt or dysfunctional, so we will opt in for this \ndispute resolution structure because we want investment to come to our \ncountry. But why would we give away U.S. judicial powers to an \ninternational tribunal of three corporate lawyers--corporate lawyers \nfor whom there is no conflict of interest standard? They could be the \nadvocates on one case and the judge on the next. That is really not in \naccordance with our norms of judicial conduct. So we aren't even \nrequiring our norms of judicial conduct to be applied to this \ninternational tribunal.\n  Furthermore, when we pass at the State or local or national level \nlaws designed to protect the health and safety of our citizens, foreign \ninvestors are granted special privileges under this agreement because \nthey can file and say: Your laws for consumer protection or the health \nand welfare of your citizens or to take on significant environmental \nhazards have hurt our investment, and we want to be compensated.\n  That is just wrong. Sure, if there was an unfair expropriation of \nsomeone's assets, that is judicable under American law. It doesn't \nrequire an international tribunal.\n  But what about when something is done for the safety and wellness of \nour citizens? Take, for example, asbestos. We tried to regulate \nasbestos in 1991. It was the last time any toxic chemical was \nconsidered under the Toxic Chemicals Act. We have done nothing in the \nintervening years. But let's say we get over the hurdles that existed \nin 1991, and we have a new law, a new process, such as has been debated \nin the Committee on Environment and Public Works. That bill had \nbipartisan support. If we create that structure and we regulate \nasbestos, now the foreign investor says: Oh, we have an asbestos \nfactory so you have to compensate us. That is a privilege that the \ndomestic--the United States; the red, white, and blue--investor would \nnot have.\n  Let's say we regulate e-cigarettes--an effort by the tobacco company \nto addict our children to become lifetime users of nicotine and to do \nso through fancy flavors--chocolate, strawberry, cotton candy, and \nevery candy flavor on Earth. You name it, they have a flavor of e-\ncigarette liquid designed to addict our children. So let's say we ban \nthat, and the foreign investor gets special privileges because they \nsay: Oh, well, I set up a factory, and I was going to make $1 billion \nover the next 20 years, so I need $1 billion of compensation.\n  That is the type of structure that is embedded in here. So at a \nminimum, I think this international tribunal should be opt-in. If we \nwant to attract investment and we have a poor judicial system, opt in \nto this substitute to encourage investment. Maybe that is a win-win for \na country with a poor judicial system and an investor who wants a \nstrong way to make sure their rights are protected. But the United \nStates would not opt in because we don't have a dysfunctional judicial \nsystem.\n  Here is an even more narrow provision. This narrow provision talks \nabout when we do laws at the local, State or Federal level that are \nabout consumer protections and wealth-stripping predatory loans. For \nexample, we ended\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\nthose loans in the mortgage market. We don't want a foreign investor \nsaying: Well, our whole business was built on that; you owe us $1 \nbillion. No, we are ending predatory wealth- stripping practices and \nreplacing them with fairer, 30-year amortizing mortgages with full \ndisclosure and no kickbacks, which were allowed under the previous law. \nThey were called steering payments. We ended steering payments.\n  Or on this issue of e-cigarettes, we are ending an effort to directly \naddict our children, which is terrible for their health and certainly \nterrible for the cost of our health care system. It is a lose-lose. We \nshould be regulating it. We passed a law to regulate it, but we just \nhave never gotten the regulations done. The FDA has now completed those \nregulations. They have shipped them to OMB--Office of Management and \nBudget. We hope someday that regulation will be in place. When it is in \nplace, a foreign investor should not have special privileges to be \ncompensated because we are protecting our citizens.\n  Therefore, we should carve out and say that our laws related to the \nenvironment and public health and consumer protection cannot be the \nsubject of ISDS--that is the name of the tribunal, ISDS--attacks.\n  Then let us look at basic consumer information, such as the labeling \nof products. A lot of manufacturers don't like it when products are \nlabeled. They consider that labeling might have information that might \nbe prejudicial because consumers might prefer the content of one \nproduct, when honestly labeled, over the product of another.\n  We had a law in Oregon that took on growth hormones in milk. The \nbasic compromise was that we printed on every package of milk. If it \nhad growth hormones, it had to say it contained growth hormones; and \nthen there was a little clause saying it was not shown to have ill \nhealth effects. But consumers wanted to choose the milk that didn't \nhave the growth hormones in it. That was the value of labeling. It \nempowered choice by the consumer, by the individuals exercising their \nrights as to what they put into their body, their right as to what they \nfeed their children.\n  We have a very similar situation with regard to meat. Americans often \nwant to know whether their meat was made or grown in America. So we \nhave a law called COOL--country-of-origin labeling. Well, COOL is very \nwell received. People like to choose meat grown in America. Not \neveryone cares, but some do. That is their right. They know there are \ndifferent standards for how animals are treated overseas. There are \ndifferent rules for what type of ingredients go into the feed in other \nnations. So wanting to support good practices, they might choose \nAmerican meat. Wanting to support something healthy for their children, \nthey might want to choose American meat.\n  And what just happened this week? Well, one of these tribunals, in a \ndifferent trade agreement, struck down America's country-of-origin \nlabeling law. That is what I am talking about when I say we are giving \nthe sovereignty of our judicial branch away to an international \ntribunal of corporate lawyers who can make decisions that affect our \nfundamental rights. That is simply wrong. We must fix this.\n  So I have an amendment that I would like to hear debated on this \nfloor. Others may disagree with me. We have been elected to carry our \nviews forward. There will be people here saying: No, it is fine we \nstrip consumers of the ability to know where their meat is grown. It is \nfine to strip consumers of the knowledge of what ingredients have gone \ninto their milk, if milk is imported, and so on and so forth. But I \nfundamentally disagree. I want to see us debate.\n  We are here to debate, so let us get these amendments up. Let us \ndebate them, and let us quit stalling. Let us quit engaging in this \nprocess of trying to rush this through in a manner where these \nfundamental issues have not been addressed--fundamental issues such as \nthe fact that there is no minimum wage in this agreement, and that the \nplaying field is tilted deeply against manufacturing in America; \nfundamental issues such as that there are negotiating objectives that \nshould be negotiating requirements for a bill to have the privilege of \ngetting fast-track here on the floor of the Senate; fundamental issues \nsuch as that we should not have our environmental, public health, and \nconsumer laws subject to an international tribunal; fundamental issues \nsuch as Americans having the right to label their products the way they \ndecide, according to their statutes, and not have that overruled by an \ninternational group.\n  I would love to see this Senate function and to actually debate these \namendments. I hope that happens. And any effort to shove this bill \nthrough without having those types of debates is certainly not the open \nand robust amendment process that was promised by the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                        Renewable Fuel Standard\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, while reading through the pages of the \nWall Street Journal last week, I was overcome with a sense of deja vu. \nAs many of my colleagues have heard me speak on the Senate floor many \ntimes each year over the last several years about ethanol and about \nmisconceptions about that, these misconceptions showed up in an op-ed \npiece in the Wall Street Journal last week.\n  Once again, in this case it happens to be chain restaurants and \nchicken producers teaming up to smear home-grown biofuel producers at \nthe expense of energy independence and cleaner air. It seems as if \nevery couple of years food producers and grocery manufacturers team up \nwith Big Oil to try to undermine the extremely successful Renewable \nFuel Standard Program.\n  Here is a little history for everyone. In 2008, it was the big food \nproducers led by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, because, \npresumably, in our economy, in our society, grocery manufacturers have \nmore prestige than Big Oil. In 2010 and 2012, it was global integrated \nmeat producers, led by Smithfield Foods and the American Meat \nInstitute, presumably because they have more prestige than Big Oil.\n  The opinion piece I am referring to in the Wall Street Journal this \ntime was written by the head of the National Chicken Council and the \nNational Council of Chain Restaurants. And under these circumstances, \ncompared to the other two instances I cited, there is really no \ndifference. They have prestige that Big Oil doesn't have.\n  This article makes many of the same erroneous and intellectually \ndishonest claims we have heard dozens of times before, and I am going \nto take this opportunity to do a simple fact-check of some of the most \negregious claims.\n  First, these two authors claim that since 2005, when the renewable \nfuel standard was first adopted, costs of vital food commodities, \nincluding corn, grains, oilseeds, poultry, meat, eggs and dairy have \nrisen dramatically.\n  This is pure myth. The fact is consumer food prices have increased by \nan annual rate of 2.68 percent since 2005. In contrast, food prices \nincreased by an average of 3.47 percent in the 25 years leading up to \npassage of the renewable fuel standard in 2005. Prices for chicken \nbreasts have been nearly flat over the past 7 years, averaging $3.43 \nper pound in 2007 and just 3 pennies more, to $3.46 per pound, in 2014. \nCorn prices are expected to average $3.50 per bushel this year, \naccording to the Department of Agriculture. This would be the lowest \nprice in nearly 10 years and 17 percent below the average price of \n$4.20 a bushel in 2007 when the renewable fuel standard was enacted.\n\n  That is a fact. With ethanol production at record levels today, corn \nprices are lower now than they were in 2007. But I don't know how many \ntimes over the last several years I have listened to this business \nabout ethanol causing corn prices to go up and food prices would go up. \nAnd food prices went up. But when corn is $3.50, we don't see food \nprices come down. It has been proven time and again by the EPA, by the \nUSDA, and others: There is no correlation between corn prices or \nethanol production and retail food inflation or food prices. Once \nagain, that is just a simple fact.\n  Second, these authors claim that as a result of the renewable fuel \nstandard, corn is being ``diverted'' from livestock feed to ethanol. \nAgain, this claim is pure falsehood. Corn used for ethanol has come \nfrom the significant increase in corn production since 2005. In 2005, \nAmerican farmers produced 11.1 billion bushels of corn. In 2014, they \nproduced 14.1 billion bushels of corn. Why? Because the market responds \nand the\n\n[[Page S3101]]\n\nfarmers respond to the increased use of corn, and they will meet it \nwhether it is for biofuels or anything else.\n  Here is something very significant: One-third of the corn used for \nethanol production is returned to the market as animal feed. The amount \nof corn and corn coproducts available for feed use is larger today than \nat any time in history. So it is hardly being diverted. But time after \ntime, a prestigious newspaper such as the Wall Street Journal continues \nto tell the people of this country that 40 percent of corn production \ngoes to make ethanol. They are right--40 percent goes to the ethanol \nplant. But out of a 56-pound bushel of corn, 18 pounds is left over for \nanimal feed--and very efficient animal feed, let me say, badly in need \nand welcomed by farmers. In fact, some of it is even exported. But does \nthe Wall Street Journal ever make that clear, that it isn't 40 percent \nof corn that is used for ethanol; it is 26 percent or 27 percent that \nis used for ethanol? So, just as I said, corn is not being diverted.\n  The same can be said for their misleading claim that ethanol \nproduction has contributed to global food scarcity. In the 15 years \nprior to the enactment of the renewable fuel standard in 2005, U.S. \ncorn exports averaged 1.8 billion bushels per year. In the 10 years \nsince the renewable fuel standard's passage, corn exports have averaged \nyet more--not a whole lot more but 1.84 billion bushels. So with 14.33 \nbillion gallons of corn ethanol, corn exports are slightly higher than \nthey were prior to the renewable fuel standard.\n  Another fact-check: The authors of the opinion piece also claim that \ncorn ethanol has resulted in a significant increase in the volatility \nof food costs, which has left prices higher, they say. So I looked into \nthe average food inflation going back to 1970. During the 1970s, food \ninflation averaged 7.8 percent. In the 1980s, it was 4.6 percent. In \nthe 1990s, it was 2.8 percent. In the 2000s, it was 2.9 percent. So far \nthis decade, it has been 2.2 percent--or the lowest rate of increase at \nthe same time that we are producing record amounts of corn ethanol.\n  Finally, these two writers for the chain restaurants and for the \nchicken people claim that the increases in feed cost have affected the \nAmerican production of beef, pork, and chicken. They state that \nproduction had increased consistently over the past 30 years but has \nnow leveled off due to the higher cost of feed.\n  Again, this is nowhere near reality. Let's check the facts. The \nreality is that the Department of Agriculture is projecting red meat \nand poultry production of 95.2 billion pounds this year--up 10 percent \nfrom 2005. More growth is yet expected. The Department of Agriculture \nprojects a production record of red meat and poultry in 2016, with 96.8 \nbillion pounds--up 12 percent from 2005.\n  Just a few years ago, when corn prices had peaked at more than $7.50 \na bushel, grocers, food producers, and restaurants were claiming--as I \nsaid once before but let me emphasize--that food inflation would \napproach 10 percent because of the renewable fuel standard. They warned \nthen that they would be forced to pass those higher costs on to \nconsumers immediately. As I have hinted before, today the price of corn \nis $3.50--less than half of what it was; in fact, $1 below the cost of \nproduction.\n  With lower corn prices, have consumers seen a dramatic reduction in \nretail food prices? In other words, are the benefits of lower grain \nprices being passed on to the consumer by Big Food? Obviously not. Ask \nany person shopping in the grocery stores. Corn prices have come down \nby more than half in the past 2\\1/2\\ years, so why are food producers \nholding prices steady or even increasing them? We accuse Big Oil of \ngouging. Isn't it about time, with $3.50 corn, that we accuse Big Food \nof price gouging?\n  The fact is, domestic renewable fuel producers are feeding and \nfueling the world at the same time. The 14.3 billion gallons of ethanol \nthat was produced in the United States could more than displace the \ngasoline refined from all of the oil imported from Saudi Arabia. And \nwhere would we rather get our energy from--volatile parts of the Middle \nEast or producers right here in the United States? And I say that not \nonly for ethanol; I say that for oil, I say that for coal, I say that \nfor nuclear, and I say that for all sorts of alternative energy.\n  We should be proud of our Nation's farmers and biofuel producers. \nEfficiencies gained have allowed farmers to produce ever-increasing \nyields, with greater environmental stewardship, including using less \nwater and less fertilizer. Ethanol production has also seen efficiency \ngains.\n  These are facts: In 1982, 1 bushel of corn produced about 2.5 gallons \nof ethanol. Today's ethanol plants are producing more than 2.8 billion \ngallons of ethanol. We have a plant in Ida County, IA, that can get \nalmost 3 gallons of ethanol from 1 bushel of corn.\n  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, if ethanol \nyields per bushel had remained at the 1997 levels, it would have \nrequired 343 million bushels--or 7 percent more--of corn to produce the \nsame amount of fuel last year. That corn would have required the use of \n2.2 million additional acres--or approximately half the State of New \nJersey--just to keep up when we had the more inefficient production of \nethanol.\n  Homegrown biofuels are extending our fuel supply and lowering prices \nat the pump for consumers. Biofuels account for 10 percent of our \ntransportation fuel today. This economic activity supports American \nfarmers, rural economies, and keeps the money at home rather than \nsending it abroad.\n  In recent years, our national security and economic well-being have \nbeen too dependent on oil imports--and from where? From tinhorn \ndictators and regimes that are always trying to harm Americans. We \ndon't need to put a Navy fleet in harm's way to protect shipping lanes \nfrom the Middle East when we have biofuels that come right out of the \nMidwest of the United States.\n  Our country needs a true ``all of the above'' energy policy, as we \nall talk about, and biofuels are an important component of that policy.\n  Do you know what is really wrong with people who sometimes talk about \n``all of the above,'' the way I see it, from different segments of \nenergy? There are people who say they are for ``all of the above,'' but \nthey are for none of the below the ground. And then there are people \nwho say they are for ``all of the above,'' but they are for all below \nthe ground but not the things that come from above the ground, such as \nsolar energy producing corn that produces ethanol, as an example, or \nwind.\n  In 2005 and again in 2007, the Federal Government made a commitment \nto homegrown renewable energy when Congress passed the renewable fuel \nstandard. The policy is working. I intend to defend all attacks against \nthis successful program, whether they come from Big Oil, the EPA, Big \nFood, Big Restaurant, or others.\n  Secondly, I tried to do some fact-checking by Mr. Brown and Mr. \nGreen, who wrote that article, and I am not very good at saying exactly \nwhether they ought to have one Pinocchio or four, but they ought to \nlook at having a Pinocchio because they are wrong on so many instances.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article from the Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 15, 2015]\n\n            Paying for Ethanol at the Pump and on the Plate\n\n                     (By Mike Brown and Rob Green)\n\n       What do a franchise owner of four chain restaurants in \n     Virginia, a food service distributor in Ohio and a poultry \n     farmer in Kentucky have in common? They are all small-\n     business owners who work in local communities and help \n     Americans put food on the table.\n       But they have also all felt the failure of the federal \n     corn-ethanol mandate, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard. \n     Congress doesn't agree on much lately--but ending a failed \n     policy that stymies small businesses, hurts the environment \n     and increases food prices should be a bipartisan priority.\n       Since the RFS was implemented in 2005, costs of vital food \n     commodities, including corn, grains and oilseeds, poultry, \n     meat, eggs and dairy, have risen dramatically. Here's one \n     major reason: The federal government's corn-ethanol mandate \n     requires that a percentage of the nation's corn crop be \n     blended into gasoline each year as ethanol. Every year the \n     percentage required increases, diverting more of the nation's \n     corn supply into ethanol fuel. This harms the broader U.S. \n     economy.\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\n       Before it hit consumers so hard, the federal corn-ethanol \n     mandate caused higher feed costs for poultry producers, \n     cattle feeders, dairy farmers and others in the food chain. \n     While food costs have always fluctuated due to unforeseeable \n     factors like the weather, the demand artificially created by \n     the RFS has resulted in a significant increase in volatility, \n     which has left prices higher.\n       Consider: Between 1973 and 2007, corn prices averaged $2.39 \n     a bushel, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. The \n     average price of corn jumped more than 110% between 2008 and \n     2014, to $5.04 a bushel. Even though corn prices have \n     recently declined thanks to fabulous weather that produced \n     two consecutive bumper crops, prices are still more than 59% \n     higher than the historical average. Prices could surge even \n     higher if the U.S. experiences anything less than ideal \n     weather.\n       The resulting increases in feed costs have also affected \n     the American production of beef, pork and chicken, which had \n     increased consistently over the past 30 years but has now \n     leveled off due to the higher cost of feed. As a result, a \n     2012 study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers estimates that the RFS \n     costs chain restaurants $3.2 billion every year in increased \n     food commodity costs.\n       Then there are restaurants. Wholesale food prices have \n     outpaced the consumer price index by more than a full \n     percentage point since the implementation of the RFS. In many \n     instances, especially in the restaurant sector, small \n     business owners are not able to pass on higher retail prices \n     to consumers because of market competition--a concept that \n     the corn-ethanol industry is unfamiliar with thanks to a \n     government quota.\n       As if this were not enough, ethanol production has \n     contributed to global food scarcity and hunger. No country \n     exports more corn than the U.S., but about 40% is ending up \n     in gas tanks, not on the world market. So much corn has been \n     blended into gasoline that the higher percentage levels \n     routinely render boat engines, motorcycles, chain saws and \n     older automobiles inoperable.\n       Fortunately, lawmakers in Congress see the chicken \n     producer, the food service distributor, the restaurant owner \n     and others in the food chain for what they are: major \n     contributors to the U.S. economy. Legislation has been \n     introduced in both the House and the Senate this year to \n     repeal the RFS corn-ethanol mandate, with broad bipartisan \n     support. Congress should take up this legislation and send it \n     to the president's desk.\n       The food industry isn't anti-ethanol. Repealing the fuel \n     standard would simply require the ethanol industry to compete \n     in the marketplace just like restaurants, food distributors \n     and chicken farmers do every day--without a government \n     mandate guaranteeing secure and growing sales.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n                  The President's Leadership and ISIL\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe latest example of President Obama's failure to lead in the \ninternational arena, to the detriment of our national security and the \nsecurity of our allies.\n  Over the weekend, the Iraqi city of Ramadi in Anbar Province--which \nis about 70 miles from Baghdad--fell to ISIL. Once a hotbed of Al Qaeda \nactivity, Ramadi had been won back and pacified at great costs in 2006 \nand 2007. That accomplishment was made possible due to the heroic \nefforts of some great Americans, such as Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, a Texan \nwhom Al Qaeda called ``the Devil of Ramadi'' and whose service was \nchronicled in the book and the movie ``American Sniper,'' and LTG Sean \nMcFarland, whose soldiers implemented a brilliant counterinsurgency \nstrategy to win over the local population and drive out Al Qaeda in the \nprocess.\n  By the way, we are proud to have General McFarland today serving as \ncommanding general of III Corps at Fort Hood, TX.\n  ISIL's latest raid and capture of Ramadi is a significant setback for \nall of us who seek a stable and prosperous Iraq, and it represents this \nterrorist army's biggest military victory this year.\n  Reports of the ISIL takeover of Ramadi are staggering. Faced with the \noncoming ISIL forces, hundreds of Ramadi police and security officials \nfled the city, leaving behind American-made military equipment, \nincluding as many as 50 vehicles, now in the hands of our enemies. \nThose who managed to escape reported that many security officials, \ngovernment workers, and even civilians were quickly killed execution-\nstyle.\n  In response, the Iraqi Government deployed its Shiite paramilitary \ntroops to the province--a move that some experts believe could lead to \neven more sectarian strife. The Iraqis are looking for support almost \nanywhere they can get it, and in the vacuum left by President Obama's \npoor leadership and indecision, Iran is more than happy to fill that \nvacuum and take up the slack. It should come as no surprise that on \nMonday, the day after the fall of Ramadi, Iran's Defense Minister \narrived in Baghdad to hold consultations with the Iraqi Ministry of \nDefense.\n\n  Obviously, I am frustrated by the President's lack of leadership and \nby the Obama administration's failure to put together a strong and \ncohesive strategy to combat ISIL, but it is more serious than that. It \nis about what we have squandered in Iraq, what we bought with the blood \nof Americans and the money that came out of the pockets of American \ncitizens.\n  Since ISIL began taking large swaths of territory last summer, this \nadministration has taken an approach of paralysis by analysis--in other \nwords, doing nothing. When they do take action, it seems ad hoc and \npiecemeal and not driven by overarching objectives or any strategy that \nis apparent to me.\n  I am not the only one who believes we do not have a strategy in the \nMiddle East. This President's own former Secretary of Defense, Bob \nGates, said yesterday: ``We're basically sort of playing this \n[instability in the Middle East] day to day.'' After affirming his \nbelief that we have enduring interests in the region, Secretary Gates \nthen added: ``But I certainly don't think we have a strategy.'' I could \nnot agree more with him.\n  Unfortunately, this takeover of Ramadi serves as just the latest \nexample of a President whose policies are altogether rudderless in the \nMiddle East, even as that region is riled with growing instability and \ngrotesque violence. We can trace that to what happened in the area just \na few years ago. I alluded to this a moment ago. In 2011, after the \nPresident ended negotiations with the Iraqis on a status of forces \nagreement, the Obama administration proceeded with a misguided plan to \npull the plug on American presence in that country. In doing so, he \nsquandered the blood and treasure of Americans who fought to give the \npeople of Iraq a chance.\n  While it is true that the Iraqis had not agreed to the U.S. \nconditions to an enduring American presence, including legal immunity \nfor our troops, this administration gave up and failed to expend the \npolitical capital necessary to secure a status of forces agreement and \nto preserve the security gains we had made together with our allies in \nIraq. As a result, those security gains made in many areas of Iraq \nsince the height of the violence in 2005 and 2006 have since \nevaporated.\n  In 2012, as terrorist groups were flourishing in Syria, the President \nrefused to initiate a program to arm vetted moderate Syrian rebels, \ndisregarding the recommendations made by his most senior advisers, \nincluding then-CIA Director David Petraeus, then-Secretary of State \nHillary Clinton, Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, and then-\nSecretary of Defense Leon Panetta. He rejected the advice from his most \nsenior national security adviser. Instead, the President publicly \nremarked in January of last year that ISIL was the JV team of terrorist \ngroups. And just a few months ago, President Obama boldly said that \nISIL was ``on the defensive.'' Let me repeat that. Just a few months \nago, President Obama claimed ISIL was ``on the defensive.'' That is not \nexactly the case today, nor was it really then. That is not exactly the \nkind of leadership we need from our Commander in Chief.\n  By giving our troops a difficult mission to degrade and ultimately \ndestroy ISIL but not providing them with the strategy and the resources \nthey need to do so, the President is essentially making them operate \nwith one more hand tied behind their back. We know we have the most \ncapable military in the world, but we cannot win a fight with our hands \ntied behind our backs or with these constraints--politically correct \nconstraints--the President wants to make and not commit the resources \nand the strategy and the focus we need in order to win. So I hope the \nPresident will reconsider after this latest dramatic setback in Ramadi. \nI hope President Obama will provide us with a strategy to degrade and \ndestroy ISIL.\n  In Ramadi--a major city and capital of Iraq's largest province--we \nsee much more than just a symbolic setback, and I bet Chairman Dempsey \nwishes he could take those words back--he called it merely symbolic.\n  We see a dangerous development and a great obstacle to a more stable \nIraq\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\nand thus a more stable Middle East. But this is what gets to me: We had \nmore than 1,000 brave American troops die in Anbar Province during \ncombat operations since 2003. I do not want to see their lives having \nbeen given in vain and squandered. So I hope that this is a wake-up \ncall to the Obama administration and that they will provide the \nCongress and the American people and our troops a clear path forward to \ndefeat ISIL and to rid the world of this terror army.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, 4 years ago, I joined my Republican \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and voted to give the \nPresident of the United States trade promotion authority--4 years ago. \nI have been a supporter of trade promotion authority for a long time, \nbut I also realize that when it comes to trade, there are issues on \nwhich we have to work on together.\n  We are at a juncture now where it is hard to move forward here in the \nSenate. I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthat there are basic things about the future of America in a global \neconomy--the American people want to be assured that there are going to \nbe tools for them to compete.\n  So the fact that the Finance Committee and the negotiators of the \ntrade promotion authority spent months and months on whether we were \ngoing to have TAA--which is a program that helps laid-off workers who \nare impacted by trade--because some House conservatives did not support \ntrade adjustment authority--workers being retrained when they are \naffected by trade agreements--we spent months and months because some \nconservatives in the House do not believe in government and do not \nbelieve in this program that helps support laid-off workers.\n  Then we had to spend weeks and weeks out here because people on the \nother side of the aisle--again at the behest of conservatives in the \nHouse--did not want to support enforcement.\n  Now we are at this juncture because the same conservatives, because \nof an ideological belief by the Heritage Foundation--not something \nabout business and labor, no; actually, business and labor support \nexport tools, such as a credit agency that helps them sell their \nproducts. Again, this conservative group is holding up trade \nlegislation because they do not think that it meets their political \nstandards, as my colleague from South Carolina said, Senator Graham, \nthat it is all about some private organization they are trying to \npolitically atone to.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I have \nbeen a supporter of TPA for a long time, but I do not plan to support a \ncloture motion and I do not plan to support moving ahead until we stop \ncatering to this very minority group that does not support the basic \ntools the American people want to see when it comes to trade. They want \nto know that if they lose their jobs, they can get retrained. They want \nto know that if export markets are open, they will have some ability to \nsell their products to those developing markets that may not have a \nbank there but can help get financial support from a bank in the United \nStates with the help of a Federal export credit agency. And yes, we \nhave to have some basic tools on enforcement.\n  So if the other side of the aisle wants to resolve these problems and \nmove ahead on a trade agreement, they have to stop catering to the \nconservatives in the House--and probably some of them do not even \nsupport trade overall--and start working with the people who do support \ntrade.\n  As I said 4 years ago in the Finance Committee when I supported TPA, \nthese policies are important tools for the U.S. economy. I feel \nstrongly that in the developing world, trade can be a great asset in \nhelping stabilize regions. I do not want to hold down other growing \nmiddle classes around the globe. We do not want to lose jobs here in \nthe United States because of it.\n  So let's have the tools that go along with trade, and let's get these \nbills passed. But if we are going to continue to cater to a group in \nthe House who claims they do not want government, I do not see how, in \nthis debate, we are going give the American people the tools that will \ngive them security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, first, I would like to offer my great \nthank-you to the Senator from Washington for advancing this very \nimportant bipartisan bill.\n  We have worked long and hard in my office and with Senator Kirk to \ntry to fashion a bill that addresses the vast majority of issues that \nso many people have or allege to have regarding the Export-Import Bank. \nAt the same time we are stalling that critical piece of infrastructure \nin our trade apparatus, China and India are pouring billions of dollars \ninto their similar institution to recruit and to invest in other \ncountries to make sure their manufacturers and make sure the jobs in \ntheir country are safe. We are unilaterally disarming, and we are \ntaking huge chances by not moving forward on the Export-Import Bank. \nAnd I share my colleague's comment: Who are we listening to?\n  This is one of those rare moments and one of those rare issues where \nwe have the American business community, the chamber of commerce, \nAmerican manufacturers--all the people on that side of the issue and \nAmerican labor together. So what is the issue? The issue is scoring by \nconservative groups. The issue is that you might not get the checkmark \nbehind your name if you actually support American workers, American \njobs, and American manufacturing.\n  This is an issue we are passionate about, and I stand with Senator \nCantwell from Washington and support her. Until we know there is a path \nforward and that the charter for the Ex-Im Bank will not expire, that \nwe will not play chicken with our economy and with our exports--until \nwe know there is a path forward, how can we really say we are protrade? \nHow can we really stand on the floor here as we are discussing trade \nand trade implications of TPA and TPP and all of the initials--TTIP, \nISDS, and all of the things people might be listening to and saying: \nWhat are they talking about? These are important tools and an important \napparatus and they represent a huge part of what we need to do when 95 \npercent of all consumers live outside this country, but we need to do \nit in a way that recognizes that American workers are part of this \nstructure and that we have to have the tools other countries utilize in \norder to make sure we are moving forward.\n  I give my great public thanks to Senator Cantwell for her brave fight \nand knowing that as the chief Democratic sponsor of the bill we are \npromoting, I stand with her. I stand with her today.\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk today about an issue that is \nimportant to North Dakota. It is interesting that we are talking about \neliminating trade barriers and improving opportunities for access to \nmarkets when we have a self-imposed access-to-market problem, and that \nis the trade embargo on Cuba. It is a barrier our government puts on \nour own farmers and ranchers, and it holds back their ability to export \nand hurts their bottom line. I am talking about the U.S. embargo with \nCuba, of course, specifically on private--private, private, private--\nbusiness activities that could enhance the sale of our agricultural \ngoods to Cuba.\n\n  My great friend from Arkansas Senator Boozman and I filed an \namendment which would free our exporters to provide private--private, \nprivate--credit with no risk to the government or taxpayers for exports \nof agricultural products to Cuba. We had a hearing on this in the \nagriculture committee, and I must say it was the single issue raised by \nall of the experts on how we could, in fact, open our markets to Cuba \nif we would allow private-sponsored credit for these exports. This is a \nsimple change to our regulation that will make our agricultural \nexporters more competitive against rice growers in Vietnam and corn \ngrowers in Brazil.\n  We know we are the highest quality producer of agricultural products, \nand many of those products are grown in my great State of North Dakota. \nYet we don't have access to that market because Cuban purchasers don't \nhave access to credit.\n  Unfortunately, under the current regulations, our government has \nerected a trade barrier. While we talk about TPA, trade promotion \nauthority, and increasing export opportunities, we\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\nneed to look at what we can do to increase opportunities for our own \nproducers here right now. It does not take a long, drawn-out \nnegotiation, costs no money, and just makes sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and Senator Boozman in this \nimportant effort to remove our self-imposed trade barriers on our \nagricultural producers and to allow a private investment and \nsponsorship of the purchase of agricultural products in Cuba. With \nthat, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this has been an interesting few days as we \nhave seen the Senate operate the way it is probably designed to \noperate. It is not supposed to be the fastest legislative body in the \nworld. It is supposed to be one that goes over issues slowly and gives \nthose issues full consideration.\n  I am so pleased the bill before us has been through the committee \nprocess. It has been years since we have seen bills go through that \ncommittee process. Virtually all of the bills are coming through the \ncommittee process this year, and that means several hundred amendments \nhave already been offered to this bill. A lot of them were considered \nin committee, some of them were considered duplicative, of course, but \nit brought this bill to the floor, which is very important for the \neconomy of the United States.\n  I hope we can work through the process and get the bill finished. In \nfact, I am relatively certain we will. It is not the prettiest way of \ndoing it, but it is the way it gets done and has been getting done for \ncenturies in the United States.\n\n\n                           A Balanced Budget\n\n  Mr. President, what I really want to talk about today is the \nimportance of a balanced budget. Over the past few weeks, we have seen \nAmerica reacting to a Congress, and especially the Senate, which is \nback to work doing the people's business. The basic task of governing \nseems to have eluded this normal legislative body over the past 8 years \nand has decimated the faith and trust of hard-working Americans who \nyearn for a government that is both accountable and effective, and that \nis why passing a balanced budget represented an important step forward.\n  Here are just a few of the headlines from around the Nation: ``Senate \npasses first joint congressional budget in six years,'' ``Senate Passes \nCost-Cutting Budget Plan,'' ``Budget `A Feat Of Considerable \nImportance,' '' ``Balanced Budget Will Focus on `Every Dollar Spent,' \n'' ``Balanced Budget, A Step Forward,'' and ``Congress approves the \nfirst 10-year balanced budget since 2001.''\n  We know passing a budget was important because it symbolizes a \ngovernment that is back to work, but it is also important to understand \nwhy passing a balanced budget is so vital to our Nation.\n  What is the process? The Senate Budget Committee is tasked with the \nresponsibility of setting spending goals. Congress has other committees \nthat authorize government programs and are charged with overseeing \ntheir efficiency and effectiveness. We also have committees that \nallocate the exact dollars for these programs every year, but the \nSenate Budget Committee sets the spending goals. In other words, we set \nlimits. This is why passing a budget is so important for our Nation. It \nlets the congressional policymakers who actually allocate the dollars \nget to work immediately by following our spending limit. This year, we \nare giving them an early start, and Leader McConnell is committed to \nallowing the Senate to do its job, and that means debates and votes on \nall 12 appropriations bills.\n  What is the importance of a balanced budget? A balanced budget \napproved by Congress will play a crucial role to help make government \nlive within its means and set spending limits for our Nation.\n  A balanced budget will allow Americans to spend more time working \nhard to grow their businesses or to advance in their jobs instead of \nworrying about taxes and inefficient and ineffective regulations. Most \nimportantly, it means every American who wants to find a good-paying \njob and fulfilling career has the opportunity to do just that.\n  A balanced budget will also boost the Nation's economic output, but \nfirst we must get our overspending under control because Congress is \nalready spending more tax revenue than at any point in history. If we \ncan do that, we can help boost the economy and expand opportunity for \neach and every American.\n  The big question is, What happens if interest rates go to their \nnormal historical level? A balanced budget provides Congress and the \nNation with a fiscal blueprint that challenges lawmakers to examine \nevery dollar we spend. This is crucial because we currently spend about \n$230 billion in interest on our debt every year, which is a \nhistorically low interest rate of 1.7 percent. The Congressional Budget \nOffice tells us that for every 1 percentage point that our interest \nrates rise, it will increase America's overspending by $1,745 billion \nover the next 10 years. That is a huge hit.\n  To provide a clearer picture of how dire our Nation's fiscal outlook \nis, we have a looming debt of $18 trillion, and it is on its way to $27 \ntrillion. If the interest rate were to go to a modest 5 percent, we \nwould owe $875 billion a year just for interest, which does not buy us \nanything. That is more than we spend on defense; that is more than we \nspend on other government agencies.\n  Interest on the debt could soon put America out of the business of \nfunding defense, education, highways, and everything else we do. It is \ntime to get serious. It is time both parties get serious about \naddressing our Nation's chronic overspending.\n  In the budget, defense was given $90 billion more than the budget \ncaps and $38 billion more than the President requested. We know both \nsides want the caps from the Budget Control Act removed, but at what \nprice for our Nation and its hard-working taxpayers?\n  Our military leaders have already told us the debt is a threat to \nnational security. Removing the threat of sequester by raising these \ndebt caps without increasing the debt in the short term would require \nraising taxes. When it comes to defense, we are literally trying to \noutbid the President, who, with a Democratic Congress, raised taxes to \nget his budget to that level.\n  Last year, Congress funded items the Department of Defense didn't \napprove or ask for, and costs for major equipment exceeded approved \namounts by billions--that is with a ``b.'' I know small businesses that \nwere deprived of bids by companies that provided products different \nfrom the specs with no consequences. That is not fair to our troops or \nto our taxpayers. We should get what we ordered, and somebody needs to \nmake sure that happens.\n  It is time for Congress to truly work together to tackle our \noverspending and achieve real results and real progress for American \nfamilies who are counting on us.\n  How do we boost economic growth? American families understand that \nyou cannot spend what you don't have and expect us to scrutinize every \ndollar we spend just like they have to and must do. In many ways, if \nthe government would get out of the way, we could increase jobs by \nexpanding the economy. A boost in economic growth means more real jobs \nfrom the private sector and small businesses across the Nation, not \ngovernment ``make work jobs.'' In fact, the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us that if we were to increase the gross domestic product, which \nis the private sector growth, by 1 percent, that would provide an \naverage of nearly $300 billion in additional tax revenue every year.\n  How do we do that? One way is to reverse some of the many regulations \nthat burden families and small businesses that provide little or no \nbenefit. For many of these policies and regulations, we need to return \nto common sense, and that is not being done today.\n  When we continually overspend year after year, we have the opposite \neffect on private sector jobs and economic growth that can actually \nlead to more sales and more jobs. Expanding the economy is the best way \nto raise money for government services, not by raising more taxes.\n  Another important way to help the growth of our economy is to make \nthe government more effective. If government programs are not \ndelivering results, they should be improved or, if they are not needed, \nthey ought to be eliminated. We need to be looking at those. The \ngovernment has to expect the same tough decisions hard-working \ntaxpayers are making every day.\n  This is Small Business Week, and I want to mention my appreciation \nfor\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\nCraig Kerrigan of the Oregon Trail Bank in Wyoming for writing a little \narticle about the real issues for small business. Small business is the \nmotor that drives this economy. He said:\n\n       If they can't make a profit, no one benefits. This is the \n     reality: They will tell you that the biggest threats and \n     challenges they face in today's economy are health care, \n     taxes and excessive regulations.\n\n  A regulation affects a small business much more than it does a big \nbusiness because they don't have a lot of people to spread the work \nover.\n  Going back to Craig Kerrigan's article:\n\n       They want to provide competitive salaries and benefits, and \n     in most cases they do. But any cost that is forced upon them \n     they either pass on to the consumer or they go out of \n     business.\n\n  It is interesting to note that those who force these costs upon small \nbusiness are not the ones paying for them, and it is always easier \nspending other people's money.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter by \nCraig Kerrigan be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  How do we get a more effective government? One of the first places \nCongress should start is by reviewing the 260 programs whose \nauthorization--that is their right to spend more money--has expired. \nSome of these programs expired as long ago as 1983, but we are still \nspending money on them every year. That means we have been paying for \nthese expired programs for more than 30 years. It is not just the \nlength of time these programs have overstayed their welcome, the funds \nwe allocated to them every year are more than what the law called for. \nIn some cases, that means we are spending as much as four times what we \nshould be. You have to take care of your own doorstep.\n  Yesterday, I had an oversight hearing for the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which comes under the direction of the Budget Committee. It was \nthe first oversight hearing in 33 years. Everybody needs to take a look \nat the programs they are in charge of and see if there are not some \nchanges that ought to be made since the invention of the mobile phone, \nand, of course, that was a mobile phone about that big.\n  The 260 programs that have expired are costing us $293 billion a \nyear. That is over $2,935 billion--or $2.9 trillion--over 10 years. \nEliminating these programs alone would almost balance the budget.\n  In business, programs are reviewed every year or sometimes every week \nto see if they still contribute to the business and its strategic plan, \nand if there is not some improvement that will make things work better, \nthey often look for small savings to help strengthen the organization \nand contribute to its bottom line. But in Washington, programs are not \nreviewed, let alone questioned, let alone scrutinized. Not even big \namounts are questioned.\n  Just think of how long it has been since we have taken a close \nexamination of what we are spending money on. In 1983, ``The Return of \nthe Jedi'' was the top movie and Americans were obsessed with the \nRubik's Cube.\n  Savings are usually found in the spending details, but Congress has \nnot examined the details. It just has the big picture, which was \npainted long ago and has now expired. It is time for each committee to \ntake a look at these programs and decide if they are even worth funding \nanymore. After all, a project not worth doing at all would not be worth \ndoing well or would not be worth continuing funding for it. But how \nwould committees know if they have not looked at the program in years? \nHow would they know if they don't have a way to measure how well the \nprograms are working?\n  When I first came to the Senate, Yellowstone Park was going broke and \nthreatening to shut down. Every year they said they were running out of \nmoney in August, and that is the prime time for the season. I checked \nthe spending bill covering the park, and I found out it only lists how \nmany employees and the total millions of dollars to be spent there. I \nasked for the details. Both the spending committee and the Department \nof Interior told me that was as much detail as they had. I asked for a \nprintout of how the money was spent in the previous year. They said it \nwas not available. I heard about millions of dollars in delayed \nmaintenance. I asked for a list of what that consisted of, and I was \nsent a list of new buildings they wanted to construct. That is not \ndelayed maintenance.\n\n  In 1999, the Park Service was cited by the Wyoming Department of \nEnvironmental Quality for raw sewage that was flowing into the Madison \nRiver, which prompted a request to Congress for emergency repair funds. \nI asked why that wasn't taken out of the National Park Service \nemergency budget. There was an emergency fund with plenty of money \navailable immediately for the problem at that time. I didn't get an \nanswer, but I found out that they got more by asking for additional \nfunding at a time of crisis. That is not how government spending is \nsupposed to be done.\n  That is why we need to have a balanced budget. That is why we need to \nhave people scrutinizing the items that are under the jurisdiction of \ntheir committees.\n  A balanced budget amendment is what many of the States are working \non. We better show taxpayers that Congress is committed to a balanced \nbudget, to make it ever more effective, because we are running out of \ntime. It is not just because of the increase in the interest rates that \nare possible here, but currently, lawmakers in 27 States have passed \napplications for a Constitutional Convention to approve a balanced \nbudget amendment, and there are new applications in nine other States \nthat are close behind. If just seven of those nine States approve \nmoving forward on the balanced budget issue, it would bring the total \nnumber of States to 34 States. That would meet the two-thirds \nrequirement under article V of the Constitution and force Congress to \ntake action on a balanced budget amendment. If this happened, one of \nthe most important functions of Congress--the power of the purse--would \nbe drastically curtailed, because there would be a new constitutional \nlimit on what Congress would be allowed to borrow.\n  Now, I mentioned before that I think we have been overspending. We \nare scheduled to overspend by $468 billion this year. How much do we \nget to actually make decisions on? That amount is $1,100 billion. If we \nwere to balance the budget right now, we would have to do a 50-percent \ncut in everything we do, and that is not even talking about an increase \nin interest rates.\n  So, in conclusion, Americans are working harder than ever to make \nends meet. Shouldn't their elected officials be willing to work harder \ntoo? We need to pass a balanced budget as an important step, but that \nis just a first step and, unfortunately, that was the easy part. \nCongress has to get serious about tackling its addiction to \noverspending and once again become good fiscal stewards of the taxes \npaid by each and every hard-working American taxpayer.\n  Earlier this month, on the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe \nDay--or V-E Day--our Nation's Capital had the rare privilege of seeing \nand hearing World War II airplanes, our Arsenal of Democracy, fly over \nthe National Mall and the U.S. Capitol Building. This flight and these \nplanes remind us that as a nation, we rise together or we fall \ntogether. Those planes also remind us that when we work together, we \nsucceed together.\n  Let us commit to work together to end our overspending and balance \nour budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, May 19, 2015]\n\n               Focus on Real Issues for Small Businesses\n\n                          (By Craig Kerrigan)\n\n       In recognition of Small Business Week, I thought it \n     appropriate to share some thoughts about small businesses \n     that are not discussed as much as I feel they should be.\n       It is frustrating how many articles are written about our \n     economy and the effects it has had on small businesses since \n     the Great Recession, but they always seem to take an approach \n     based on surveys, statistics, theories, opinions, analysis \n     and general assumptions; almost illusory.\n       Let me offer a suggestion.\n       I am sure almost all of you have a family member, friend or \n     acquaintance who owns a small business here in Cheyenne or \n     Laramie County.\n\n\n                             Just ask them\n\n       If you do, just ask them what is happening in their \n     business and about the management\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\n     decisions they have had to make to navigate the issues they \n     face every day as they relate to our economic and political \n     environment.\n       No more theories as to what should be happening, just a \n     simple question as to what is really happening, simply put, \n     where theory meets reality.\n       For the purpose of this article, I will use businesses that \n     employ between one and 50 employees with gross receipts or \n     sales up to $7.5 million, although the definition varies from \n     industry to industry.\n       They are the true backbone and lifeblood of our local and \n     national economy as they create 70 percent of new jobs. They \n     are what I call the forgotten many.\n       You can find someone in almost all business sectors: \n     retail, construction, real estate, manufacturing, \n     professional services and food service, to name a few.\n       Many of these small businesses are owned and operated by \n     our friends and neighbors, people who go to work every day to \n     provide a service that benefits our local economy. They have \n     no set hours, no guaranteed benefits, no stock options and no \n     perks.\n       In almost all cases, they started their business with their \n     hard-earned savings, conversion of retirement accounts from \n     previous employment, gifts from family and credit from banks. \n     They have pledged their homes, vehicles and other personal \n     property just to find enough cash to start their business.\n       Many have second jobs and take no salary from the business \n     until it can be profitable.\n       I have been blessed to have been a banker in Cheyenne for \n     almost 40 years, and I have been given a unique perspective \n     from being both a banker and also an owner of a small \n     business as many small community banks are privately and \n     family-owned small businesses.\n       I have had the chance to be involved in helping to \n     facilitate business startups, expansions, restructures and \n     unfortunately liquidating some that have had to close.\n       Every business has unique characteristics with the type of \n     product or service they sell, the experience of ownership and \n     management and the demographics of employees.\n       They are in business to make a profit, but more \n     importantly, they have a passion for what they do. They drive \n     economic growth through investment, innovation and \n     entrepreneurship. They support not only themselves and their \n     families, but they are responsible for the support of their \n     employees and their families.\n\n\n                            Biggest threats\n\n       If they can't make a profit, no one benefits. This is the \n     reality: They will tell you that the biggest threats and \n     challenges they face in today's economy are heath care, taxes \n     and excessive regulations.\n       They want to provide competitive salaries and benefits, and \n     in most cases they do. But any cost that is forced upon them \n     they either pass on to the consumer or they go out of \n     business.\n       It is interesting to note that those who force these costs \n     upon small businesses are not the ones paying for them, and \n     it is always easier spending other people's money.\n       The new health-care law affects decisions they have had to \n     make as to the number of employees they can have and the type \n     of benefits they can offer. Many are limiting full-time \n     employees to less than 50 to avoid the costs of mandated \n     health coverage.\n       If they don't know what the next surprise is going to be \n     with our tax code, it is almost impossible to project income \n     and expenses. And if they are forced to follow a new \n     regulation, they have to hire non-income producing overhead \n     just to make sure they don't get fined or worse.\n       Many regulations are needed; it is when they are \n     inefficient, duplicative and applied based on a ``one size \n     fits all'' approach that they become overwhelming and result \n     in unintended consequences.\n       How do I know this? As a banker, you cannot be an effective \n     partner in the success of any business unless you analyze \n     financial information and communicate with management \n     throughout the year.\n       Numbers can be interpreted differently, but they never lie, \n     and they are not based on theories. You have to know the \n     business of the business and make decisions to help them make \n     the necessary adjustments.\n       Sounds simple, but there are many different business \n     structures--sole proprietorships, corporations, partnerships \n     and limited liability companies. These are businesses that do \n     not have the luxury to staff human resources, compliance, \n     legal or accounting departments.\n       Small businesses must handle many of these internally, or \n     hire third-party vendors, which is added expense. The common \n     thread I see at this time is frustration, uncertainty and a \n     feeling of failure due to costs beyond their control, and \n     because of this they are reluctant to reinvest profits and \n     hire more employees.\n       So the next time you read an article about what should be \n     happening, walk across the street or drive across town and \n     talk with someone you know that owns a small business.\n\n\n                               Thank them\n\n       The first thing you should do is thank them for everything \n     they do to make our community a better place. Many of them \n     are members of our Chamber of Commerce and unselfishly give \n     of their time and money to support other small businesses.\n       Don't be indifferent to our economic and political \n     environment because the reality is you are paying for any \n     increased costs to small businesses in the prices you pay.\n       So at the end of your visit, you will most likely hear \n     ``welcome to the real world.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I wish to join my colleagues in voicing \nmy opposition to granting fast-track authority. I oppose the procedures \ncontained in the bill, and I am seriously concerned about using fast-\ntrack to pass trade agreements that don't reflect the best interests of \nthe American people and can undermine the prerogatives of the Congress.\n  Some who support fast-track would have us believe that opposing this \nbill and TPP means opposition to a free market, to trade, and to \ncommerce; but that is not true. Commerce is essential, and we should be \npromoting it. But corporate interests should not be the driving force \nfor public policy decisions on public health, consumer safety, and the \nenvironment.\n  Just this week, a WTO ruling on our country-of-origin food labeling \nlaw provided a striking example of how what is called free trade can be \nused to erode consumer protection. The country-of-origin labeling law \nwas passed by Congress, and it requires producers of meat and chicken \nto provide information to consumers on where the animal was raised and \nslaughtered. If we ask most people, they would say they want to know if \ntheir beef is from Texas or from Taiwan. And even if one isn't \nparticularly passionate about that issue, I think most people would \nagree that it is squarely within the prerogatives and the \nconstitutional duties of the U.S. Congress to decide.\n  Consumers in the U.S. want to know where their food comes from. \nThrough a legitimate, democratic process, we passed a law to provide \nconsumers with this information. But no matter how we have revised the \nrule pursuant to the law, it is apparently still not in compliance with \nour WTO commitments. It seems that we will have to repeal the law to \navoid trade sanctions.\n  While our WTO obligations are not the same as our commitments under a \nfree-trade agreement, it doesn't require too much imagination to see \nhow other U.S. laws will buckle under future trade agreements. This is \nwhy the deal-breaker for me is the investor-state dispute settlement, \nor ISDS for short.\n  ISDS provides a special forum outside of our well-established court \nsystem that is just for foreign investors. These investors are given \nthe right to sue governments over laws and regulations that impact \ntheir businesses--a legal right not granted to anyone else. This forum \nis not available to anyone other than foreign investors. It is not open \nto domestic businesses. It is not open to labor unions, civil society \ngroups or individuals that allege a violation of a treaty obligation. \nThe arbitrators that preside over these cases are literally not \naccountable to anyone, and their decisions cannot be appealed. To date, \nnearly 600 ISDS cases have been filed. Of the 274 cases that have been \nconcluded, almost 60 percent have settled or have been decided in favor \nof the investor.\n  It is true that when a tribunal rules in favor of the investor, the \narbitrators can't force the government to change its law, but they can \norder the government to pay the investor, which has the same effect. \nThere is no limit to what compensation foreign investors can demand. \nThe largest award to date was more than $2 billion.\n  For a developing country that must pay this award, sometimes it \nrepresents up to a third of their GDP. Most governments cannot risk \nsuch a settlement and end up avoiding this kind of conflict altogether. \nThe government often agrees to change the law or regulation that is \nbeing challenged and still pays some compensation. The threat of a case \ncan be enough to convince a government to back away from legitimate \npublic health, safety or environmental policies.\n  ISDS cases cost millions of dollars to defend and take years to reach \ntheir final conclusion. The high profile cases filed by Philip Morris \nInternational challenging cigarette packaging laws have had a chilling \neffect around the world. Several countries have been intimidated into \nholding off on passing their own laws to reduce smoking. Every year of \ndelay is a victory for tobacco companies. They get 1 more year to \nattract new, young smokers. In the case of tobacco, the cost of ISDS \ncould be human life.\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\n  I would hope that if we empower corporations to challenge \ndemocratically elected laws and regulations, that we would be doing so \nfor an extremely compelling reason. But here is the thing: The \nrationale behind ISDS is extremely thin. Advocates claim that investor \nprotections such as ISDS draw foreign investment into a country, but no \none has actually been able to demonstrate that this link exists. \nStudies have not even been able to show a significant correlation \nbetween investor protections and the level of foreign investment in \nthat country. Instead of driving decisions to invest, ISDS provisions \nare being manipulated by multinational corporations.\n  Some companies seem to be setting up complex corporate structures \nexplicitly for the purpose of taking advantage of existing ISDS \nprovisions. This is what Australia is alleging that Philip Morris did \nto challenge Australia's tobacco laws. The Philip Morris Hong Kong \nentity bought shares in Philip Morris's Australian company just 10 \nmonths after Australia announced its cigarette plain packaging rules. \nIt seems that Philip Morris did this for no other purpose than to gain \naccess to the ISDS provision in the Hong Kong-Australia Bilateral \nInvestment Treaty.\n  ISDS is just another arrow in the quiver of legal options available \nto multinational corporations and no other entity or person. The \nconsequences for public health, safety, and the environment far \noutweigh any real or imagined benefit of ISDS. For these reasons, I \noppose fast-track and any trade agreement that contains an ISDS \nprovision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I spoke a little bit this morning about \nthis whole issue--and a very serious issue it is--of currency \nmanipulation. In effect, we are going to have two choices with respect \nto this issue, one offered by the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Hatch, and myself, and one offered by Senator Portman and \nothers.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  I wish to take a few minutes to raise what are my biggest concerns \nwith respect to the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nPortman, and try to put this issue in context. What is particularly \ntroubling to me is it seems to me that the Portman amendment would \noutsource the question of the Federal Reserve's intent in \ndecisionmaking to the whims of an international tribunal, and I think \nthat is very troubling. That is why Chairman Hatch and I have thought \nto take a more flexible approach.\n\n  I am going to outline how I have reached that judgment so that \ncolleagues, as we turn to this question of currency, have a bit more \nawareness of what is at stake. As I indicated already this morning, we \nwill be discussing this particularly in the conference committee that \nis going to take place next month when the House and the Senate get \ntogether to talk about currency and other critically important \nenforcement issues.\n  I fully agree with my colleagues who have been saying this is a very \nimportant issue and our government must do more to target countries \nthat harm our economy by artificially deflating their currency. What is \nat issue is making sure we proceed in a way that really redounds to the \nbenefit of our country, our workers, and our business.\n  In the process of taking aim at foreign currency manipulators, it is \nespecially important to make sure that this Senate does not cause \ncollateral damage to the Federal Reserve and our dollars. We all \nunderstand the Federal Reserve uses monetary policy as a tool to \nstabilize prices and boost employment. The right solution is to make \nsure that our country gets the upside of going after those who \nmanipulate currency and avoids the downside of restricting the tools \nthat Janet Yellen and those in charge of monetary policy may want to \nuse.\n  The bipartisan trade promotion bill now before the Senate includes a \nfirst--many firsts but one in particular. For the first time currency \nwill be a principal negotiating objective. What Chairman Hatch and I \nhave sought to do is to strengthen that and to take yet another step. \nWe direct the administration to hold our trading partners accountable \nwhen they manipulate currencies by using the most effective tools \navailable: enforceable rules, transparency, recording, monitoring, and \na variety of cooperative mechanisms. My view is that what Chairman \nHatch and I are seeking to do here strikes the right balance. We get \nthe upside of confronting unfair currency manipulation, and we don't \npick up the downside, tying our hands with respect to policy options \nthat are completely legitimate and important.\n  One of those policy options that I feel especially strongly about is \nensuring that the Fed has the ability to use policies to strive towards \nfull employment. So for me, this issue really comes down to making sure \nwe have all the tools at the Fed and elsewhere for helping to create \ngood jobs and economic stability--jobs that pay higher wages and help \nour communities prosper.\n  The Portman amendment is very different than what I and Chairman \nHatch have been talking about. Under the Portman amendment, our country \nwould be subject to dispute settlement in an international tribunal, \nwhich means that there would be trade sanctions. Now, Federal Reserve \nChair Janet Yellen has expressed serious concern that this type of \nprovision could ``hamper''--these are Janet Yellen's words--that this \ntype of provision could ``hamper or even hobble monetary policy.'' The \nChair's concern--Janet Yellen's concern--is that because monetary \npolicy can impact currency valuation, we could end up tying our hands \nand, in effect, taking one of the Fed's important tools out of their \neconomic toolbox.\n  For example, a number of countries have argued that the Fed's \nquantitative easing policy unfairly values our dollar. Now, I want it \nunderstood that I think those countries are dead wrong--dead wrong--in \nmaking that argument. But we ought to realize that those countries that \nhave sought to cry foul argue that what the Fed did to bring down the \nunemployment rate was in effect an unfair strategy for increasing \nexports. Colleagues, as we think about this currency issue, consider \nwhat could happen if the United States was subject to dispute \nsettlement by an international tribunal on this issue.\n  That is why I am concerned that taking the path of the Portman \namendment would, as I have described, outsource the question of the \nFederal Reserve's intent in decisionmaking to an international \ntribunal. I think Americans are going to be very skeptical of the idea \nthat, in effect, we are going to have this international tribunal \ntrying to divine essentially what the Federal Reserve's intent was. I \npersonally do not like the idea at all of outsourcing this judgment to \nan international tribunal. I think it could have very detrimental \nconsequences both to the cause of trade and to our economy.\n  Just yesterday, Treasury Secretary Lew said he would recommend a veto \nof a TPA package that included this type of amendment, because he, too, \nthought it would threaten our Nation's ability to respond to a \nfinancial crisis. So it is going to be important to get this right, to \nmake sure that our trade agreements have the upside of being strong in \nthe fight against currency manipulation, but to make sure that we also \navoid the downside of restricting our monetary policy tools.\n  I hope my colleagues will think about the unintended consequences of \nthe Portman amendment. If we were to have another unfortunate financial \ncrisis--and no one wants that--we all want to make sure that the \nFederal Reserve has the full array of economic tools to get our economy \nmoving again and to keep workers on the job.\n  So we are going to be faced with this judgment, and I hope my \ncolleagues will say that the approach Chairman Hatch and I have offered \nis one that will allow us to build on the first-ever negotiating \nobjective for currency that is in the bill and accept our amendment and \nrecognize that, as I stated earlier, we are going to have another bite \nat the apple when currency is certain to be an important part of a \nCustoms conference between the House and the Senate in June.\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\n  With that, I see my colleagues are here, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let me first say that I thank Senator \nWyden for his hard work. I am one of those who believe it is important \nfor Congress to pass trade promotion authority. I don't believe we can \ncomplete the TPP without trade promotion authority. I think TPP is an \nimportant strategic partnership for the United States as well as an \neconomic partnership for the United States.\n  Having said that, I listened carefully to Senator Wyden where the \nadministration has raised an objection to a particular amendment and \nsaying if that gets on the bill, they would veto the trade promotion \nauthority. I say that because many of us who support TPA have said: \nLook, let's make sure we get it right. Let's make sure that we have an \nopen amendment process so that we can try to make this the strongest \npossible bill, because we don't get that many opportunities to take up \ntrade legislation.\n  I just mention that because yes, I come to the floor to say that we \nneed trade promotion authority. When you look at the fact that we are a \ndemocracy with separation of the branches of government, we cannot \nnegotiate--535 of us--with our trading partners and enter into an \nagreement. We have to delegate that negotiating authority, and that is \nwhat TPA does. At the time we delegate that, we also must make it clear \nwhat our trade objectives are about, and we also must take advantage of \nthat opportunity to protect workers' rights legitimately and make sure \nwe have a level playing field for American companies. I think that is \nour responsibility.\n  In the discussion of this bill, I want to acknowledge that we do have \npart of this--the trade adjustment assistance. That is important to \nAmerican workers. We have Customs legislation that I wish was in this \nbill, because I am concerned as to whether both will reach the \nfinishing line. But it deals with strong enforcement, and ``level the \nplaying field'' currency issues are all dealt with in a separate bill \nthat we passed earlier. I guess last week we passed the legislation on \nthe Customs.\n  Let me just talk for a moment about trade promotion authority, and \nsay that we have to be very clear about our expectations. I want to \ncompliment Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch and the Senate Finance \nCommittee. In reading this legislation--and I hope you all had a chance \nto do it--you are going to find that this really does take our \ndelegation of authority and our expectations to a much higher level \nthan we have ever done on areas that have not been traditionally as \nclear on Congress.\n  I will just mention a few of those. Our overall trading objective is \nvery clear to deal with labor standards. In quoting from the bill that \nis before us, on the overall negotiating objectives: ``to promote \nrespect of worker rights and the rights of children consistent with \ncore labor standards of the ILO (as set out in section 11(7))''--\ndefined as the International Labour Organization--``and an \nunderstanding of the relationship between trade and worker rights . . . \nto promote universal ratification and full compliance with ILO \nConvention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for \nthe Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor . . .''\n  That is in our overall objective. I want to talk a moment about the \nprincipal negotiating objectives, because there is greater consequence \nto the principal negotiating objectives. There are provisions included \nin the principal negotiating objectives that are different from what we \nhave done in any other TPA bill.\n  First, yes, it does deal with the core labor rights. The principal \nnegotiating objective that the administration must show us that they \nhave done deals with the ``adopts and maintains measures implementing \ninternationally recognized core labor standards . . .'' that is \nincluded in there.\n  Included in the principal negotiating objectives is the requirement \nfor environmental law: ``its environmental laws in a manner that \n[cannot weaken] or reduces protections afforded in those laws in a \nmanner affecting trade or investment between the United States and that \nparty . . .''\n  So what we have done is that we also put in there: ``does not fail to \neffectively enforce its environmental or labor laws, through a \nsustained or recurring course of action or inaction . . .''\n  I read that into the record because I want to make it clear that if \nyou believe we should be negotiating trade agreements and you believe \nthat it only can be done through the administration and can't be done \nthrough Members of Congress individually negotiating a trade agreement, \nand you believe you need to be clear as to what we expect, the \nprincipal negotiating objective is where you include that language. And \nwe have been very clear in the principal negotiating objectives in \nregards to core labor standards and environmental standards, because we \nknow that to have a level playing field--the countries we are \nnegotiating with do not have the same high standards that we have for \nlabor, do not have the same high standards we have for the \nenvironment--we want to make sure we are not placed at a disadvantage. \nSo it is in the principal negotiating objectives.\n  But we have gone further than that. In the principal negotiating \nobjectives we put for the first time anticorruption provisions. That is \nin the principal negotiating provisions: ``to obtain high standards and \neffective domestic enforcement mechanisms . . . [to] prohibit such \nattempts to influence acts, decisions, or omissions of foreign \ngovernment officials or to secure any such improper advantage''--these \nare anticorruption provisions--``to ensure that such standards level \nthe playing field for United States persons in international trade and \ninvestment. . . .''\n  Why is this important? Because in some countries, including those \ncountries with which we are negotiating, there are practices where \ncompanies that want to participate in government contracts have to deal \nwith kickbacks or have to deal with bribery.\n  Well, American companies cannot do that. We have laws that prohibit \nthat, but there should not be anyone dealing with that. In the \nprincipal negotiating objectives, we instruct our negotiators to deal \nwith these anticorruption issues. The administration must show we have \nmade progress--not only progress, that we have enforceable standards \nagainst corruption that would disadvantage American companies doing \nbusiness in those countries.\n  That is a huge step forward on our anticorruption issues, but we go \nfurther than that. I am very proud of an amendment I offered that was \nadopted to the trade promotion authority dealing with good governance, \ntransparency, the effective operation of legal regimes, and the rule of \nlaw of trading partners. This is, again, a principal negotiating \nobjective which says we have to strengthen good governance, \ntransparency, the effective operation of legal regimes and the rule of \nlaw of trading partners of the United States, through capacity building \nand other appropriate means, and create a more open Democratic society \nand--let me add this, this is in the bill--to promote respect for \ninternationally recognized human rights.\n  That is a principal negotiating objective. We are talking about \nfreedom of speech, freedom of assembly, association, religious freedom. \nWe have instructed the administration--if they accept our bill and sign \nit into law--come back to us on how we have dealt with advancing good \ngovernance, transparency, and respect for internationally recognized \nhuman rights in the trade agreement that we brought forward.\n  This is the first time we have included anything similar to this in a \ntrade promotion authority act. So this is a new level of expectation of \nwhat we expect to do in our trade agreements. I really want to \nemphasize that because we have not been bashful in the past using trade \nto promote human rights. We usually do it when we have a specific \nopportunity. We did it well before our time in Congress when Jackson-\nVanik was passed, dealing with Soviet Jewry being able to leave the \nformer Soviet Union.\n  We also used trade as a hammer to bring down the apartheid government \nof South Africa. Most recently, we used trade as a hammer when we \nneeded to deal with normal trade relations with Russia in regard to a \nWTO issue--where we attached the Magnitsky law\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\nto it--that I was proud to work on with Senator McCain. I thank Senator \nMcCain for his strong leadership on the Magnitsky law.\n  We used that opportunity, a trade bill, to advance international \nhuman rights issues in holding Russia accountable to its standards and \nwhat it did in regard to Sergei Magnitsky. So we should take advantage \nof the trade promotion authority act to advance basic human rights, \nparticularly when we are dealing with countries that, quite frankly, \nare challenged in that regard.\n  I want to read one other provision that is in the current bill \ndealing with trade promotion authority and dealing with the principle \nnegotiating objectives. It spells out very clearly that it is a \nprincipal negotiating objective. We have enforcement in it. It says:\n\n       To seek provisions that treat United States principal \n     negotiating objectives equally with respect to the ability to \n     resort to dispute settlement under the applicable agreement, \n     the availability of equivalent settlement procedures, and the \n     availability of equivalent remedies.\n\n  What does that mean? What that means is that this is not NAFTA \nagreement. In NAFTA, we did make advances on labor and environment, but \nwe did not include it in the core agreement. It was not effective. We \nhad no enforcement. We had these sidebar agreements. We learned that \nwas not the way to do it. Well, this TPA says that in regard to human \nrights and good governance, in regard to labor and the environment, \nthat they are in the principal negotiating objectives and there will be \ntrade sanctions in regard to violations--if there are violations. We \nhope there are not. We hope they will make the progress. But we have \neffective ways of dealing with our principal negotiating objectives \nthat include the good governance issues that I think are critically \nimportant.\n  I started my remarks by saying thank you to Senator Wyden. I thank \nhim very much because he has really done an incredible job in where we \nare today. He points out that we are not there yet. I agree. We need an \nopen amendment process here. We need to take up more amendments on the \nfloor of the Senate. I say that as one of those Members who have not \nbeen bashful about trying to change the rules of the Senate.\n  I am told by people who have been here longer than I that the rules \nof the Senate work. You just have to be a little patient. OK. We will \nbe a little patient. But let's figure out a way that we can have more \nvotes on the floor of the Senate in regard to this bill.\n  We do not get a chance to take up trade bills very often. I have an \namendment that I want to see acted upon. I do not think it is \ncontroversial, but it is extremely important. What that amendment would \ndo is require the President, before commencing negotiations with \npotential trading partners, to take into account whether that potential \ntrading partner has engaged in a consistent pattern of gross violations \nof internationally recognized human rights. This amendment \nappropriately puts gross violations of human rights on par with \nprenegotiating requirements of other principal negotiating objectives. \nSo before we start picking countries with which we are going to do \ntrade agreements, let's make sure they are not gross violators of human \nrights.\n  Now, so everybody does not get nervous--because TPP is so far \nadvanced--it would not be possible to have the free negotiating \nobjectives certified by the President on TPP. I understand that. There \nis a blanket exemption in TPA in that regard, which applies also to the \namendment I am offering. But I would hope our colleagues would agree \nthat moving forward we would want the President to take that into \nconsideration, to make sure we have a game plan, if we are dealing with \na country that has violated human rights, as to how we are going \ncorrect that activity through the opening of trade.\n  Trade with our country is a benefit. It should be with countries that \nshare our basic values. Lowering trade barriers should come with \nfurther commitments to our basic values, and that is what my amendment \nwould do. I would urge my colleagues, at the appropriate time, to make \nsure this amendment is considered. I would ask their support on this \namendment.\n  Let's continue to work through the process. Let's continue to improve \nthe bill. Hopefully, we can reach a point where we can send to the \nPresident the appropriate legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, no more than 2 minutes. Before my \ncolleague leaves the floor, I just want it understood in this body that \nSenator Cardin has championed for decades the cause of labor rights, \nenvironmental rights, human rights. I so appreciate his leadership in \nthis area.\n  For the first time, as a result of Senator Cardin's work, human \nrights will be a principle negotiating objective because Senator Cardin \nhas been spot-on in saying trade must be about human rights. So that is \nNo. 1.\n  Point No. 2, my colleague was absolutely right in saying how \nimportant it is that we have more votes here. That is why I am going to \nbe spending all day into the night trying to bring that about. I want \nmy colleague to know I will also be very interested in working with him \non this additional amendment he has to further build on what we have in \nthe bill. I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business, and when the Senator from South Carolina \narrives, to engage in a colloquy with the Senator from South Carolina, \nMr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Foreign Policy and ISIL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today, the black flags of ISIL fly over \nthe city of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's Anbar Province. Anbar was \nonce a symbol of Iraqis working together with brave young Americans in \nuniform to defeat Al Qaeda. Today, it appears to be a sad reminder of \nthis administration's indecisive air campaign in Iraq and Syria and a \nbroader lack of strategy to achieve its stated objective of degrading \nand destroying ISIL.\n  Equally disturbing, reports indicate over 75,000 Iranian-backed \nShiite militias are preparing to launch a counteroffensive in the \nlarger Sunni province. Whatever the operational success Shiite militias \nmay have in Anbar would be far exceeded by the strategic damage caused \nby their violent sectarianism and the fear and suspicion it breeds \namong Iraqi Sunnis.\n  Moreover, the prominent role of these militias continues to feed the \nperception of a Baghdad government unable or unwilling to protect \nSunnis, which is devastating to the political reconciliation efforts \nthat must be central to ensuring a united Iraq can rid itself of ISIL. \nShiite militias and Iranian meddling will only foster the conditions \nthat gave birth to ISIL in the first place.\n  Liberating Ramadi and defeating ISIL requires empowering Sunnis who \nwant to rise and fight ISIL themselves, including by integrating them \ninto Iraqi security forces, providing more robust American military \nassistance. Indeed, the Obama administration and its spokesperson have \ntried to save face for its failed policies by diminishing the \nimportance of Ramadi to the campaign against ISIL and the future of \nIraq. As ISIL forces captured and sacked Ramadi, the Pentagon's news \npage ran a story with the headline, ``Strategy to Defeat ISIL is \nWorking.'' Secretary of State John Kerry said Ramadi was a mere \n``target of opportunity.''\n  White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said yesterday we should not \n``light our hair on fire every time there is a setback in the campaign \nagainst ISIL.'' Meanwhile, Ramadi, Iraq, and the region are on fire. \nHow could anyone--how could anyone say we should not light our hair on \nfire when news reports clearly indicate there are burning bodies in the \nstreets of Ramadi, that ISIL is going from house to house, seeking out \npeople and executing them. Tens of thousands of people are refugees. \nWhat does the President's spokesman say? That we should not light our \nhair on fire every time there is a setback.\n  The Secretary of State of the United States of America said Ramadi \nwas a mere ``target of opportunity.'' Have we completely lost--have we \ncompletely\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\nlost our sense of any moral caring and concern about thousands and \nthousands of people who are murdered, who are made refugees, who are \ndying as we speak--and the President's Press Secretary says we should \nnot light our hair on fire.\n  What does the President have to say today? The President of the \nUnited States today says: Well, it is climate change that we have to \nworry about. I am worried about climate change.\n  Do we give a damn about what is happening in the streets of Ramadi \nand the thousands of refugees and the people--innocent men, women, and \nchildren who are dying and being executed and their bodies burned in \nthe streets?\n  A few weeks ago, as ISIL closed in on Ramadi, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff said the city ``is not symbolic in any way'' and \nis ``not central to the future of Iraq,'' the capital of the Anbar \nProvince, the place where we lost the lives of some 400 brave Americans \nand some 1,000 in the first battle of Ramadi during the surge.\n  These are quotes from the media reports: Bodies, some burned, \nlittered the streets as local officials reported the militants carried \nout mass killing of Iraq security forces and civilians.\n\n       Islamic state militants searched door-to-door for policemen \n     and pro-government fighters and threw bodies in the Euphrates \n     River in a bloody purge Monday after capturing the strategic \n     city of Ramadi. . . . Some 500 civilians and soldiers died in \n     the extremist killing spree. . . .\n       They said [ISIS] militants were going door-to-door with \n     lists of government sympathizers and were breaking into the \n     homes of policeman and pro-government tribesmen.\n\n  So the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it is not symbolic \nin any way. It is not central to the future of Iraq. It was in response \nto those comments that Debbie Lee sent a letter to General Dempsey. \nDebbie's son, Marc Alan Lee, was the first Navy SEAL killed in the Iraq \nwar. For his bravery he was awarded the Silver Star and his comrades \nrenamed their base in Ramadi ``Camp Marc Alan Lee.''\n  ``I am shaking and tears are flowing down my cheeks as I watch the \nnews and listen to the insensitive, pain-inflicting comments made by \nyou in regards to the fall of Ramadi'' Debbie wrote General Dempsey.\n  She continues:\n\n       My son and many others gave their future in Ramadi. Ramadi \n     mattered to them. Many military analysts say that as goes \n     Ramadi so goes Iraq.\n\n  Debbie Lee is right. Ramadi does matter. It matters to the families \nof the 187 brave Americans who gave their lives and another 1,150 who \nwere wounded, some of them still residing at Walter Reed hospital, who \nwere wounded fighting to rid Ramadi of Al Qaeda from August 2005 to \nMarch 2007.\n  And it matters to the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, mostly Sunnis, \nwho call Ramadi home, were forced to flee their homes, and feel their \ngovernment cannot protect them against ISIL's terror.\n  Ramadi's fall is a significant defeat, one that should lead our \nNation's leaders to reconsider an indecisive policy and a total lack of \nstrategy that has done little to roll back ISIL and has strengthened \nthe malign sectarian influence of Iran.\n  I wish to go back. Yesterday, as I mentioned, Press Secretary Josh \nEarnest said: ``Are we going to light our hair on fire every time there \nis a setback?''\n  It is one of the more incredible statements I have ever heard a \npublic figure make. Well, General Dempsey's comments are equally as \nabsurd.\n  The New York Times headline: ``Iraq's Sunni Strategy Collapses in \nRamadi Rout.''\n  The Washington Post: ``Fall of Ramadi reflects failure of Iraq's \nstrategy against ISIS, analysts say.''\n  Wall Street Journal: ``US Rethinks Strategy to Battle Islamic State \nAfter Setback in Ramadi.''\n  Associated Press: ``Rout in Ramadi calls U.S. strategy into \nquestion.''\n  Bloomberg: ``Islamic State Victory Threatens to Unravel Obama's Iraq \nStrategy.''\n  The only problem with that statement is there is no strategy to \nunravel.\n  The Daily Beast: ``ISIS Counterpunch Stuns U.S. and Iraq.''\n  According to the Associated Press: ``The United Nations says it is \nrushing aid to nearly 25,000 people fleeing for the second time in a \nmonth,'' after the Islamic State group seized the key Iraqi city.\n  The U.N. reported 114,000 people fled Ramadi in April. The U.N. \nreports it has helped more than 130,000 people over the past alone.\n  Continuing: ``Bodies, some burned, littered the streets as local \nofficials reported the militants carried out mass killings of Iraq \nsecurity forces and civilians.''\n  It goes on and on.\n  Before I turn to my friend from South Carolina, I just want to point \nout, my friends, that this did not have to happen. This is the result \nof a failed, feckless policy that called for, against all reason, the \ntotal and complete withdrawal from Iraq after we had won with the \nenormous expenditure of American blood and treasure, including 187 of \nthem in the battle of Ramadi.\n  In 2011, Senator Lieberman, Graham, and I argued that the complete \npullout from Iraq would ``needlessly put at risk all of the hard-worn \ngains the United States has achieved there at enormous cost in blood \nand treasure,'' and potentially be ``a very serious foreign policy and \nnational security mistake for our country.''\n  We wrote a long article in the Washington Post. In October, 2011, on \nthe day President Obama announced a total withdrawal of troops from \nIraq, Senator McCain called the decision ``a strategic victory for our \nenemies in the Middle East, especially the Iranian regime,'' and warned \nthat ``I fear that all of the gains made possible by these brave \nAmericans in Iraq, at such grave cost, are now at risk.'' That was in \n2011.\n  In December of 2011, Senators McCain and Graham predicted that if \nIraq slid back into sectarian violence due to U.S. pullout, ``the \nconsequences will be catastrophic for the Iraqi people and U.S. \ninterests in the Middle East, and a clear victory for Al Qaeda and \nIran.''\n  It goes on and on. Time after time, Senator Graham and I warned \nexactly what was going to happen in Iraq. It was not necessary to \nhappen. It is because of this President's refusal to leave a force \nbehind.\n  Now, my friends, before I turn to my friend from South Carolina, what \nwas said at the same time that Senator Graham, Senator Lieberman, and I \nwere warning of this catastrophe? What was said at the same time?\n  February 2010, Vice President Biden:\n\n       I am very optimistic about Iraq. I think it's going to be \n     one of the great achievements of this administration. You are \n     going to see a stable government in Iraq that is actually \n     moving toward a representative government.\n\n  In December 2011, at a Fort Bragg event marking the end of Iraq war, \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       But we are leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-\n     reliant Iraq. This is an extraordinary achievement, nearly 9 \n     years in the making.\n\n  In March 2012--this is perhaps my favorite--Tony Blinken, then \nnational security adviser to Vice President Biden, stated: ``Iraq today \nis less violent, more democratic, and more prosperous than at any time \nin recent history.''\n  This is November of 2012, and President Obama on the Presidential \ncampaign trail said:\n\n       The war in Iraq is over, the war in Afghanistan is winding \n     down, al Qaeda has been decimated, Osama bin Laden is dead. \n     The war in Iraq is over. The war in Afghanistan is winding \n     down. Al Qaeda has been decimated. Osama bin Laden is dead.\n\n  So we have made real progress these last 4 years.\n  In January 2014--I guess this is my favorite--President Obama on \nISIS:\n\n       The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is \n     accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that \n     doesn't make them Kobe Bryant.\n\n  He was talking about ISIS:\n\n       The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is \n     accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that \n     doesn't make them Kobe Bryant.\n\n  We are seeing a dark chapter in American history, and it is the \ngetting darker. In response to a slaughter in Ramadi, the answer seems \nto be: ``Let's not set our hair on fire [over this].'' That was by the \nPresident's Press Secretary, and that Ramadi isn't important at all, \nfrom the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is a ``temporary \nsetback.'' This is, according to the Secretary of State, ``a target of \nopportunity.''\n  Where is our morality? Where is our decency? Where is our concern \nabout\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\nthese thousands of people who are being slaughtered and displaced and \ntheir lives destroyed? And we shouldn't set our hair on fire? \nOutrageous.\n  I ask my friend, Senator Graham, what we should do next.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, we should understand that the direct threat of the \nhomeland is growing by the day.\n  If you want to be indifferent to what is going on in Iraq and say \nthat people are dying all over the world and that is no reason for us \nto care or get involved, because we can't be everywhere all the time \ndoing everything for everybody, I would suggest to you that ISIL in \nSyria and Iraq represents a growing threat to our homeland. But you \ndon't have to believe me. Ask our intelligence community.\n  Over 10,000 foreign fighters have gone into Syria in support of ISIL \nover the last few months. Their goal is to hit the American homeland, \nso this JV team is becoming an existential threat--maybe not \nexistential, maybe that is an overstatement--a real threat to the \nAmerican homeland.\n  Ramadi is a big victory for them. It is a recruiting tool. They have \nbeen able to take on the Iraqi Army. They have been able to stand up to \nconstant air assault by the American forces. They are surviving, and \nthey are thriving.\n  So if you want to stop the flow of foreign fighters into the arms of \nISIL, you have to deliver stinging defeats on the battlefield. Not only \nare they stronger today in Iraq and Syria than they have been in quite \na while, but they are expanding their influence to Libya, Afghanistan, \nand throughout the region.\n  All I can tell you is their agenda includes three things--the \npurification of their religion, which means 3-year-old little girls are \nexecuted. Just hear what I said: They executed a 3-year-old little \ngirl. They are enslaving women by the thousands as sex slaves under \nsome twisted version of Islam. What they are doing to people we can't \nreally talk about on the floor, because I think it would be just beyond \nour ability to comprehend.\n  The second thing they want to do is to drive out all Western \ninfluence and create a caliphate where our allies have no place. The \nKing of Jordan would be deposed. All the friends of the United States \nand people who live in peace with Israel, they fall. And then their \nplace becomes the most radical Islamic regime known in the history of \nthe world, which will destroy Israel if they can--purify their \nreligion, destroy Israel, and come after us.\n  President Obama, President Bush made mistakes. He adjusted, you have \nnot. President Bush had a defining moment in his Presidency in 2006. \nThe Iraq war was going very poorly. We had just gotten beaten on the \nRepublican side, and the Iraq war was one of the reasons we lost at the \nballot box.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I interrupt my friend and point out that both of \nus, because of our perception that we were losing in Iraq, under our \nRepublican President, called for the resignation of the Secretary of \nDefense and a new strategy. We saw with our own party in the White \nHouse that we were failing in Iraq and we could not succeed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I remember very vividly going to the White House \nafter multiple visits to Iraq and telling President Bush: When your \npeople tell you this is just a few dead-enders, and this is the result \nof bad reporting by our media, they are wrong.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And that stuff happens.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, it wasn't that stuff happens; it was that we had it \nwrong. The strategy we had in place up to 2006 was failing. And the way \nyou know it was failing is that if you go there often enough--I \nremember the first trip we took in Iraq after Baghdad fell. We were in \nthree SUVs. We went downtown, shopping, and met with some leaders. And \nevery time we went thereafter, it was always a bit worse, to the point \nthat we were inside of a tank, virtually, to go outside the wire.\n  It was clear to anybody who was paying attention at all in Iraq that \nit was not working. I remember talking to a sergeant at one of the mess \nhalls and asking: Sergeant, how is it going over here?\n  And his answer was: Well, not very well. We just drive around getting \nour ass shot off.\n  About 1 year later, maybe 2 years later, we went back to the same \nunit, to different sergeant, after the surge, and I asked another \nsergeant: How is it going?\n  Sir, we are kicking their ass.\n  So the bottom line here is that I think Senator McCain and I have \nbeen more right than wrong. But we were willing to tell our own \nPresident it wasn't working. He did make mistakes. We all have. It is \nnot about the mistakes you make. It is how you correct your own \nmistakes.\n  This President--President Obama, you are at a defining moment in your \nPresidency. If you do not change your strategy regarding ISIL in Iraq \nand Syria--because it is one and the same--then this country is very \nlikely to get attacked in another 9/11 fashion. You need to listen to \nthe people in the intelligence community and those who have been in the \nmilitary in Iraq for a very long time. You are about to make a huge \nmistake if you don't change your strategy.\n  I know Americans are war weary, but let me just say this to the \nAmerican people. The current strategy is going to fail, and one of the \nconsequences of failure is the likelihood of our country or our allies \ngetting hit and hit hard. We don't have enough American forces in Iraq \nto change the tide of battle. We need American trainers, advisers, \nSpecial Forces units, and forward air controllers to make sure the \nIraqi Army can win any engagement against ISIL. If we keep the \nconfiguration we have today, it is just going to result in more losses \nover time.\n  Why do we need thousands of soldiers over there? To protect the \nmillions of us here. And the only reason I would ever ask any soldier \nto go back overseas for any purpose is if I believed it was important \nto protect our homeland--and I do. So this strategy that we have in \nplace is a complete failure inside of Syria, particularly, and it is \nnot working inside of Iraq.\n  We are on borrowed time, Senator McCain.\n  President Obama, you need to listen to sound military advice. You \nneed to build up the Iraqi military by having more of us on the ground \nto help them and turn the tide of battle before ISIL gets even stronger \nand they hit us here. If you don't adjust, the price that we are going \nto pay as a nation is, I believe, another attack on the homeland.\n  So at the end of the day, you can blame Bush, you can blame Obama, \nyou can blame me, and you can blame Senator McCain. We are where we \nare. And I am convinced, if we had left a residual force behind in \nIraq, we would not be here today.\n  President Bush, like every other leader in the world, had certain \ninformation--some of which proved to be faulty. He made his fair share \nof mistakes, but he adjusted.\n  President Obama had good, sound advice in front of him to leave a \nresidual force behind. He decided to go in a different direction. When \nthey tell you at the White House that the Iraqis didn't want us to \nstay, that is a complete, absolute fabrication and a rewriting of \nhistory. President Obama, Vice President Biden got the answer they \nwanted. They made a campaign promise to end the war in Iraq. They \nfulfilled that promise, but what they have actually done is lost the \nwar in Iraq. And the war in Iraq and what happens in Syria is directly \ntied to our own national security.\n\n  I hope the President will seize this opportunity to come up with a \nnew strategy that will protect the homeland and reset order. Radical \nIslam is running wild in the Middle East, and as it runs wild over \nthere, as they rape and murder, plunder and kill and crucify, to think \nthose people will not eventually harm us I think is naive.\n  The only way we are going to stop ISIL and people like ISIL is to \ncome up with a strategy that will allow us to win. The strategy we have \nin place today will ensure the existence of ISIL as far as the eye can \nsee, the fracturing of Iraq and Syria, and one day will inevitably lead \nto an attack on this country. All of this is preventable with a new \nstrategy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Graham and me and \nmany others, I have a message for Marc Alan Lee's mother--the mother of \nthe first Navy SEAL who was killed in the Iraq war and who, for \nbravery, was awarded the Silver Star--and 186 other mothers who lost \ntheir sons in the battle for Ramadi: I will never stop. I will never \nstop until we have\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\navenged their deaths. And we will bring freedom and democracy to Iraq.\n  But more importantly than that is the threat this radical Islam and \nthe Iranians pose to our Nation and the young men and women who are \nserving in the military.\n  As a result of this President's feckless policies, we have put the \nlives of the men and women who are serving in the military in much \ngreater danger. My highest obligation is to do everything in my power \nto see that this situation is reversed and that they get the support \nand the equipment they need and most of all that they get a policy and \na strategy that will succeed and defeat ISIS and Iran in their \nhegemonic ambitions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to support an \namendment I filed with Senators Merkley, Baldwin, and Blumenthal. The \namendment is simple. It says Congress shouldn't make it easy to pass \nany trade deal that weakens our financial rules.\n  In 2008, we suffered through the worst financial crisis in \ngenerations. Millions of families lost their homes. Millions of people \nlost their jobs. Millions lost their retirement savings. And they \nwatched as the government spent hundreds of billions of their tax \ndollars to bail out the giant banks.\n  In response, Congress passed some commonsense financial reforms--the \nDodd-Frank act. These new rules cracked down on the cheating and lying \nin the financial marketplace. They required the big banks to raise more \ncapital so they wouldn't need a bailout if they started to stumble. \nThey gave our regulators new tools to oversee the biggest banks to make \nsure the rules were followed.\n  It is no surprise the giant banks don't like the new rules, so for 5 \nyears now they have been on the attack. They have sent their armies of \nlobbyists and lawyers and their Republican friends in Congress to try \nto roll back the rules and let the giants of Wall Street run free \nagain. Democrats stood strong to fight off these attacks because we \nknew that thoughtful rules can help stop the next financial crisis and \nprotect our working families from another great recession. But now, if \nthis fast-track bill passes, Democrats will be handing Republicans a \npowerful tool they can use to weaken our financial rules.\n  Here is how it works: This fast-track bill applies to any trade deal \npresented to Congress in the next 6 years, which is through the end of \nthe Obama Presidency, through the entirety of the next Presidency, and \ninto the Presidency after that. Fast-track prevents anyone in Congress \nfrom offering any amendments to a trade bill. And in the Senate, with \nfast-track, a trade bill can pass with just 51 votes, not the 60 \ntypically required for major bills.\n  What if we have a Republican President in 2016 or 2020? Look, I hope \nthat will not be the case, but this is a democracy and it is not up to \nme. Most Republicans--including ones currently running for President--\nare committed to rolling back financial reforms. With fast-track, they \ncould weaken our financial rules in a trade deal and then ram it \nthrough Congress with just 51 votes in the Senate. That is a lot easier \nthan the 60 votes needed for a head-on attack on the financial rules \nthrough the normal legislative process.\n  This is a real risk. We are already deep into negotiations with the \nEuropean Union over a massive trade agreement. The European negotiators \nare pressing hard to include financial reforms as part of that trade \ndeal. And lobbyists from the United States have recognized that the \nEuropean trade deal is a great opportunity to weaken America's \nfinancial reforms.\n  Here is what a member of the European Parliament said just a few \nmonths ago: ``I have been approached by lobbyists that have clearly \nargued they want to have a weak European regulation, much weaker than \nDodd-Frank, in order to use that afterwards as a level to undercut or \nundermine Dodd-Frank in the transatlantic negotiations.''\n  The big banks on both sides of the Atlantic are pushing for changes, \ntoo. A letter from some of the largest financial industry groups in \nEurope and the United States called for an ``ambitious chapter'' on \nfinancial regulations in the European trade deal. I don't think they \nare looking to make our regulations stronger.\n  Michael Barr, a former senior Obama official at the Treasury \nDepartment and one of the architects of Dodd-Frank, said that the risk \nto Dodd-Frank in a European trade deal is ``real and meaningful and \nworth worrying about.'' Barr has noted that European officials are \n``barnstorming the U.S., looking for support to include financial \nservices as part of the talks on the proposed Transatlantic Trade and \nInvestment Partnership,'' while the financial industry looks to use \ntalks to ``overturn the pesky--and highly effective--rules being \nimplemented in the U.S. under the Dodd-Frank act.''\n  The Obama administration, to their credit, has stood strong against \nsuch attempts. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew noted in testimony before \nthe House Financial Services Committee that there is ``pressure to \nlower standards'' on things such as financial regulations in trade \ndeals but that the administration believes that is ``not acceptable.'' \nOur lead negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, has said \nthat the United States is ``not open to creating any process designed \nto reopen, weaken, or undermine implementation'' of Dodd-Frank. And \nPresident Obama's administration says our trade deals should not \ninclude regulation of financial services. I agree. But this President \nwon't be President in 18 months, and there is nothing this President \ncan do to stop the next President from reversing direction in the \nEuropean negotiations.\n  Senator McConnell certainly knows this. That is why he is telling \nRepublicans that ``if we want the next Republican President to have a \nchance to do trade agreements with the rest of the world, this bill is \nabout that President as well as this one.''\n  That is why I am proposing this amendment--to make sure no future \nPresident can fast-track a trade agreement that weakens our financial \nregulations. All of my colleagues who believe in holding the big banks \naccountable and keeping our financial system safe should support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor a number of \ntimes this week to talk about the trade issue, and we are now debating \nthat legislation. I have put up this sign because it is being used by \nfolks on our side of the aisle to talk about the importance of this \nagreement. It talks about a free and fair trade agreement for a healthy \neconomy. I agree that it needs to be fair, and I agree we need to \nexpand exports.\n  I support for the first time in 7 years giving the U.S. Government \nthe ability to knock down barriers to our farmers, our workers, and our \nservice providers so we can get a fair shake, but we have to be sure it \nis fair. And so to my colleagues who have put up this sign and then \nhave opposed the amendment I am about to talk about, I hope they will \nfocus on the fair part as well as the expansion of trade to make sure \nit does indeed give our farmers and workers a fair shake.\n  There has been a lot of debate about a particular amendment dealing \nwith currency manipulation. It turns out everybody is against currency \nmanipulation. Maybe that has been an evolution, but everybody is now \nsaying the same thing. The question is whether it should be \nenforceable.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  There has been a lot of discussion on the floor here today about the \namendment I am offering with Senator Stabenow, and frankly there has \nbeen some misinformation out here that I would like to clarify.\n  First, I want to talk about what these two amendments do. They are \nvery similar, with one exception. The amendment being offered by \nSenator Hatch and Senator Wyden does not include enforcement. So they \nsay that this is terrible, that we ought not to have currency \nmanipulation, but the amendment does not have the courage of its \nconvictions. It doesn't say we should do anything about it.\n  Here is the language. First, both have basically the same \ndefinition--targeting protracted and large-scale intervention in the \nexchange markets by a party to a trade agreement to gain\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\nan unfair advantage. What that basically means is that people lower \ntheir currency deliberately by intervening in order to make their \nexports less expensive to the United States and make our exports to \nthem more expensive. That is not fair. But basically we both identify \nthe same problem and ensure that we are focused on this issue of real \ncurrency manipulation.\n  Second, the amendment I am offering has a specific exemption for what \nwe call macroeconomic policy or specifically domestic monetary policy. \nIn other words, QE1, 2, and 3 would not be affected by our amendment. \nYet, even though the Hatch-Cornyn folks are saying they are concerned \nabout that in our amendment, that it might affect domestic policy and \nmonetary policy, they don't have it in their amendment. We have it in \nours.\n  So we not only define currency manipulation so that it is clear that \nit applies to the kinds of standards the International Monetary Fund \ncurrently requires--by the way, to all of the countries that might be \nsignatory to the so-called Trans-Pacific Partnership; all of them--but \nit also explicitly says in ours that this shall not be construed to \nrestrict the exercise of domestic monetary policy. Therefore, ours is a \nstronger amendment with regard to that issue.\n  I also noticed something about their amendment that is interesting. \nThey say theirs has to be consistent with existing obligations of the \nUnited States as a member of the IMF and the WTO--the World Trade \nOrganization. Ours says the same thing, except consistent with existing \nprinciples and agreements, meaning the other countries have to live up \nto their agreements also.\n  I am not quite sure why they don't think other countries should have \nto live up to their obligations. When you sign up with the IMF and the \nWTO, you are required not to manipulate your currency. Yet, people do \nit because there is no enforcement. Their amendment doesn't deal with \nthis issue directly. Ours does--have it be consistent with the \nobligations these countries have already undertaken.\n  Finally and, of course, the most important part is the \nenforceability. There were 60 Senators who in 2013 signed a letter--and \nthe letter went to the President--regarding trade agreements and \ncurrency manipulation. The letter said: We need to have enforceable \ncurrency manipulation provisions. Sixty Senators. A number of those \nSenators are still here in the Senate, of course. I think they were \ngenuine in signing that letter. I was one of them, and I certainly was. \nI am also a signatory to other legislation and have been working on \nthis issue for a long time. Ten years ago, I testified in this Congress \nabout this very issue. But I hope those 60 Senators understand that \nthey said they wanted it to be enforceable. Ours is enforceable. It \nsays it is to be enforceable just like anything else--like intellectual \nproperty protection, like what the tariff level ought to be, like labor \nand environment standards--and it is up to the administration to \ndetermine exactly how to proceed with that. That flexibility is in \nhere. It is a trade negotiating objective, and that is appropriate, \ntoo, in my view. I am a former U.S. Trade Representative. I used to \nnegotiate these agreements.\n  The trade negotiation objectives are something we took seriously, but \nwe were given some flexibility. This amendment provides that \nflexibility.\n  Finally, there has been a lot of discussion about poison pills. I \nhave joked that this is more like a vitamin pill than a poison pill \nbecause this would actually help strengthen this underlying agreement \nand help us get more support for trade.\n  The polling data on this, by the way, is overwhelming. Nine out of \nten Americans agree that we have to deal with currency manipulation. \nWhy? Because they think it is wrong. It is wrong.\n  So I have heard it is a poison pill, first because it might hurt us \nhere in the Senate. Just the opposite is true. There are Senators who \nhave told me they would like to support trade promotion authority but \nthey need something on currency manipulation to help them get there.\n  Is it a poison pill in the House? Well, the vote in the House \napparently is tough to come by for TPA. I hope it does end up being a \nTPA that can pass the Senate and the House. As I said earlier, I think \nit is the right thing for the workers I represent to expand to markets \noverseas. But this will help, it won't hurt, because this will give \nRepublicans from my home State of Ohio and around the country the \nability to go home and look their workers in the eye and say: You know \nwhat, we focused on the fair part here. We focused on ensuring that if \nyou work hard and play by the rules, you will have a chance to compete \nand a chance to win.\n  Finally, they say: Well, it is a poison pill because of the White \nHouse, because there was a veto threat recommended by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury yesterday. Well, it was a recommendation; it wasn't a \nStatement of Administration Policy.\n  I would just reference the President's own statements on this. I know \nhow he feels about it; he is against currency manipulation. In fact, he \nsaid that he wanted to be sure to work with colleagues, ``that any \ntrade agreement brought before the Congress is measured not against \nadministration commitments but instead against the rights of Americans \nto protection from unfair trade practices, including currency \nmanipulation.'' He said he couldn't vote for a trade agreement without \nenforceable practices on currency manipulation--enforceable so that the \nrights of Americans could be protected. So I know where the President \nstood on it, and I hope he will remember that this is about expanding \ntrade. And that is good. We need to do that but at the same time ensure \nthat we have a more level playing field.\n  People have said it is a poison pill because some of our partners in \nTPP don't want to have to live up to their obligations under the \nInternational Monetary Fund. To my colleagues I would just say that \nshould concern us. The last thing we want to do is to complete an \nagreement called the Trans-Pacific Partnership and then find out after \nthe fact that all these tariffs we reduced, all these nontariff \nbarriers that got knocked down didn't matter much because these same \ncountries decided they were going to manipulate their currency, which \nundoes so much of the benefit of a trade agreement.\n  Paul Volcker, former Fed Chair, has said it well: ``In five minutes, \nexchange rates can wipe out what it took trade negotiators ten years to \naccomplish.'' So it should concern us if our trading partners aren't \ninterested.\n  By the way, two of them--Japan and Malaysia--have engaged in currency \nmanipulation in the past. Are they doing it now? In my view, no. In the \nIMF view, no. But they have. Japan hasn't done it since 2012, but \nbefore that they did it over 300 times.\n  Why the heck wouldn't we want to have a provision in here that says: \nI know you are not doing it now, but now that we have come up with this \ngreat agreement to expand access for American farmers and American \nworkers and American service providers to Japan, let's be sure you \ndon't do it in the future and undo all those gains. And why would they \nbe worried about that? Why would they not sign up for that kind of \ncommitment? Why wouldn't the United States sign up and all these other \ncountries? Malaysia is the other country that has in the past \nmanipulated its currency. Why wouldn't they sign up for this? If they \nare refusing to do so, if this is considered a poison pill for that \nreason, we should be worried about it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the time to clarify some \nof the statements made earlier on the floor today. I hope every Member \nof the Senate will decide, as they talk about the need for more \nenforcement, that this is exactly what we are talking about and that \nthey will ensure this trade promotion authority representing the views \nof the Congress includes real enforcement and real help for the workers \nwe represent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                              PATRIOT Act\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, there comes a time in the history of nations \nwhen fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and \nprivacy to suffer. That time is now. And I will not let the PATRIOT \nAct--the most unpatriotic of acts--go unchallenged.\n  At the very least, we should debate. We should debate whether we are \ngoing to relinquish our rights or whether we are going to have a full \nand able debate\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\nover whether we can live within the Constitution or whether we have to \ngo around the Constitution.\n  The bulk collection of all Americans' phone records all of the time \nis a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Second Appeals Court \nhas ruled it is illegal.\n  The President began this program by Executive order. He should \nimmediately end it through Executive order. For over a year now, he has \nsaid the program is illegal. Yet, he does nothing. He says: Well, \nCongress can get rid of the PATRIOT Act; Congress can get of the bulk \ncollection. Yet, he has the power to do it at his fingertips. He began \nthis illegal program. The court has informed him that the program is \nillegal. He has every power to stop it. Yet, the President does \nnothing.\n  Justice Brandeis wrote that the right to be left alone is the most \ncherished of rights, most prized among civilized men. The Fourth \nAmendment incorporates this right to privacy. The Fourth Amendment \nincorporates this right to be left alone.\n  When we think about the bulk collection of records, we might ask, \nwell, maybe I am willing to give up my freedom for security. Maybe if I \njust give up a little freedom, I will be more safe.\n  Most of the information that comes on whether you are safe comes from \npeople who have secret information you are not allowed to look at. So \nyou have to trust the people--you have to trust those in our \nintelligence community that they are being honest with you, that when \nthey tell you how important these programs are and that you must give \nup your freedom, you must give up part of the Fourth Amendment--when \nthey tell you this, you have to trust them.\n  The problem is, we are having a great deal of difficulty trusting \nthese people. When James Clapper, the head of the intelligence agency, \nthe Director of National Intelligence, was asked point blank, are you \ncollecting the phone records of Americans in bulk, he said no. It turns \nout that was dishonest. Yet, President Obama still has him in place.\n  So when they say how important these programs are and how they are \nkeeping us safe from terrorists, we are having to trust someone who \nlied to a congressional committee. It is a felony to lie to a \ncongressional committee, and nothing has been done about this.\n  About a year ago, we began having this debate because a whistleblower \ncame forward and said: Here is a warrant for all of the phone records \nfrom Verizon.\n  You say: Well, maybe they have evidence that people at Verizon were \ndoing something wrong.\n  There is no evidence. This is that they want everyone's phone \nrecords.\n  I don't have a problem with going after terrorists and getting their \nrecords, but you should call a judge and you should say the name of the \nterrorist, and then you get their records as much as you want.\n  If I am the judge and they ask me for the Tsarnaev boy's records--the \nBoston Bomber--the Russians had investigated him. He had gone back to \nChechnya. Yet, nobody asked for a warrant to look at his stuff. We \ndidn't even know he went back to Chechnya. And then we had the disaster \nat the Boston Marathon.\n  I would make the argument that we spend so much time making the \nhaystack bigger and bigger that we can't find the needle because the \nhaystack is too darned big. We keep making it bigger and bigger, and we \nare taking resources away from the human analysts who should be looking \nand seeing when Tsarnaev travels outside of our country.\n  We recently had another terrorist travel from Phoenix to Texas. We \nhad arrested him previously. My guess is there was sufficient cause--\nprobable cause--for a real warrant to look at his activities, and we \nshould. But I don't think we are made any safer by looking at every \nAmerican's records.\n  In fact, when this came up, the government said: Well, we have \ncaptured 52 terrorists because of this. But then when the President's \nown privacy commission looked at all 52 of them, there was a debate \nabout whether one had been aided but not found by these records and \nwould have been found by other records.\n  We have to decide as a country whether we value our Bill of Rights, \nwhether we value our privacy, or whether we are willing to give that up \nto feel safer, because I am not even sure you really can argue that we \nare safer, but people will argue that they feel safer. But think about \nit. Is the standard to be that if you have nothing to hide, you have \nnothing to fear but that everything should be exposed to the \ngovernment, that all of your records can be collected?\n  Some will say these are just boring old business records. Why would \nyou care if they could find out who you called and how long you spoke \non the phone? Well, two Stanford students did a study on this. They got \nan app and they put the app on the phone--voluntarily--of 500 people. \nThese people then made phone calls. All they looked at was how long \nthey spoke--metadata--and whom they spoke to, the phone number to which \nthey were connected. What they found was that without any other \ninformation, 85 percent of the time they could tell what their religion \nwas; more than 70 percent of the time they could tell who their doctor \nwas; they could tell what medications they took; they could tell what \ndiseases they had. The government shouldn't have the ability to get \nthat information unless they have suspicion, unless they have probable \ncause that you committed a crime.\n  When they looked at this, the appeals court was flabbergasted that \nthe government would make the argument that this was somehow relevant \nto an investigation--because that is what the standard is. Under the \nConstitution, the standard is probable cause, which means there is some \nevidence or suspicion that you have done something illegal. But the \nstandard now is relevance, which means, is it relevant to an \ninvestigation? But the court said that even that looser standard of \nrelevance completely destroys any meaning of any words if we are going \nto say every American's phone record in the whole country is somehow \nrelevant to an investigation.\n  But it gets worse. They don't even have to prove it. The government \nsays to the court that they think it is relevant, but there is no \nchallenge and there is no debate. It is just taken at face value--or at \nleast it was until this court ruling was appealed. So we now have the \nsecond appeals court that said this bulk collection of phone records is \nillegal.\n  There are many different programs going on. This is the only one we \nknow about where our government is collecting our records, and the only \nreason we know about it is not because the government was honest with \nyou--the government was dishonest. The Director of National \nIntelligence tried to basically lie to the American people and say it \ndidn't exist. So we know about this one, but what other programs are \nout there?\n  There is something called Executive Order 12333. There are some who \nbelieve this is just the tip of the iceberg, the bulk collection; that \nthere is an enormous amount of data being collected on people through \nthis other program.\n  One question is, if there is no Fourth Amendment protection to your \nrecords, are they collecting your credit card bills? I don't know the \ntruth of that. I would sure like to know. I don't know whether to trust \ntheir answer if I asked them, if they will be honest with us and say \nare they collecting our credit card records.\n  People might say: Well, your credit card records are just boring old \nbusiness records. Why would you care?\n  But think about it. If the government has your Visa bill, they can \ntell whether you drink, whether you smoke, what restaurants you go to, \nwhat your reading material is, what magazines or books you read, what \ndoctors you see, what medicines you buy? Do you buy medicine? Do you \ngamble? All of these things can be determined.\n  Not only can they determine stuff directly from your phone bill and \ndirectly from your Visa bill, they now have the ability to merge all of \nthis information. Apparently, they have the ability to collect your \ncontact lists, and sometimes they are collecting this in a way that is \nsomewhat nefarious.\n  We are supposed to be spying on foreigners--foreigners who might \nattack us. I am all for that. But what happens is there is a lot of \ndata that goes in and out of the country. In fact, sometimes an e-mail \nfrom New Jersey to Colorado\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\nmight go through a server in Brazil. Once it gets to a server in \nBrazil, they can not only look at your metadata--how long and whom you \ntalked to--the content is now available. It all gets scooped up. It is \nall being analyzed. They are doing the social network of who your \nfriends are. Some have said this could potentially have a chilling \neffect on the First Amendment.\n  There was a time in our country not too long ago, in the lifetime of \nmost of us, when if you called the NAACP, you might not want your \nneighbors to know or if you were a member of the NAACP, you might not \nwant your neighbors to know or if you were calling the ACLU or a member \nof the ACLU, you might not want your neighbors to know. It can have a \nchilling effects on your expression of your speech, whom you associate \nwith, and whether you are fearful to have association with people \nbecause you are fearful that knowledge might be known by the \ngovernment.\n  People say: Well, certainly that would never happen.\n  During the civil rights era, many of the civil rights leaders were \nspied upon illegally by the government through illegal wiretaps.\n  Many Vietnam war protesters were also spied upon illegally by the \ngovernment. The reason we have the Fourth Amendment is to have checks \nand balances. Everything that is great about our country is checks and \nbalances.\n  Let's say we have a rapist or a murderer in Washington, DC, today. \nLet's say it is 3:00 in the morning and the police come to the house. \nThey think the rapist or murderer is inside. They do not just break the \ndoor down. If there is no commotion, no noise, no imminent danger, they \nstand outside and get on their cell phone and call a judge. Almost \nalways the judge grants a warrant. Then the police go in.\n  But why do you want that to happen? Sometimes people come up to me \nand they say ``I am a policeman'' or ``I work for the FBI.'' Many of my \nfriends are policemen and work for the FBI, and they say ``Don't you \ntrust us?'' It is not about the individual. Laws are not about whether \nwe trust one person or your brother is a policeman and your brother \nwould never do anything wrong. It is not about your brother. It is not \nabout your friend. It is about the potential for there to be a rotten \napple, someone who would take that power and abuse that power. We have \nlaws not for most of us. It is for the exception. It is for something \nout of the ordinary. But it is also to prevent systemic bias from \nentering into the situation. For example, there was a time in the South \nwhen it might have been that a White person from the government might \nhave decided they were going into the home of a Black person just \nbecause of racial bias. You get rid of bias by having checks and \nbalances, by always saying you have to ask somebody else for \npermission.\n  When we were leading up to the war for our independence in about \n1761, I believe, James Otis was arguing before the courts. He was \narguing against something called the writs of assistance. A writ of \nassistance was a type of warrant, but it was a generalized warrant. No \none's name was on it; It just said: You are welcome to search anybody's \nhouse to make sure they are paying the stamp tax.\n  Do you wonder why the Colonists hated the stamp tax? It was not just \nthe tax; it was the fact that the government could break the door down, \ncome in, and rifle through their papers. Writs of assistance were \nsomething called a general warrant.\n  This same battle had gone on in common law in England and developed \nas one of our precious rights that we actually kept from the English \ntradition.\n  John Adams wrote about James Otis fighting against these general \nwarrants, and he said it was the spark that led to the American \nRevolution. That is how important this is.\n  The Fourth Amendment was a big deal to our Founders. The right to \nprivacy, as Justice Brandeis said, the most cherished of rights, is a \nbig deal. We should not be so fearful that we are willing to relinquish \nour rights without a spirited debate.\n  The debate over the PATRIOT Act, which enshrines all of this and got \nthis started, goes on about every 3 years or so. It has a sunset \nprovision. It is set to expire in the next few days. But we are mired \nin a debate over trade. There is another debate over the highway bill. \nAnd the word is that we will not get any time to actually debate \nwhether we are going to abridge the Fourth Amendment, whether we are \ngoing to accept something that one of the highest courts in our land \nhas said is illegal. Are we going to accept that without any debate?\n  I, for one, say there needs to be a thorough debate, a thorough and \ncomplete debate about whether we should allow our government to collect \nall of our phone records all of the time.\n  In England, about the time of James Otis, there was another man by \nthe name of John Wilkes. I learned about this story in reading my \ncolleague Senator Lee's book recently. John Wilkes was a rabble-rouser. \nHe was a dissenter. Some called him a libertine. I do not know about \nhis morals, but I know he was not afraid of the King.\n  The King was becoming more and more powerful at that time. That is \none of the complaints we had as well. So John Wilkes began his own \nnewspaper. It was called the North Briton, and he labeled it with \nnumbers. The one at the time became the North Briton No. 45. It became \nso famous throughout England that it was also part of our idiom, part \nof our language in the United States. Everybody knew what 45 was if you \nmentioned it. But he wrote something about the King. He basically wrote \nwhat would be an op-ed in our day. He made the mistake of sort of \nsaying that the King's behavior or the Prime Minister's behavior was \nequivalent to prostitution. That did not make the King very happy, so \nthe King wrote out a warrant for the arrest of anybody who had to do \nwith the writing of this North Briton No. 45. But the warrant did not \nhave anybody's name on it. It was a generalized warrant.\n  He said: Arrest anybody.\n  So they broke down John Wilkes' door. They rifled through and ruined \nthe contents of his house, arrested him, put him in irons, and took him \nto the Tower of London. They did the same to 49 other people. But John \nWilkes was not about to take this lying down, so John Wilkes actually \nthen decided that he would sue the King.\n  I tried doing the same thing. I tried suing the President, and it has \nnot gone so well. But the thing is that everybody ought to think they \nhave the ability and the equality to sue even their leaders.\n  So he sued the King, and something remarkable happened. This was in \nthe early the 1760s. When he sued the King, he actually won. I think \nthe award was like 1,000 pounds, which would be a significant sum of \nmoney for us in today's terms. It was a big victory. It was part of the \ndiscussion going on simultaneously over here with James Otis. It was a \nbig deal.\n  So often my party does such a great job talking about the Second \nAmendment and the right to bear arms. I am all for that. But the thing \nis, I do not think you can adequately protect the Second Amendment \nunless you protect the Fourth Amendment, the right to privacy. Your \nhouse is your castle. The right to not have your castle invaded is so \nimportant.\n  I will give an example. A lot of people think we will be safer if we \ncollect gun records. A few years ago, they collected all the gun \nrecords and they had them in Westchester County, near New York City. A \nnewspaper decided they would publish them. They really did not think \nthis through. But you can see the danger of what happens when the \ngovernment has records and then releases them to everybody.\n  Imagine a woman who has been abused or beaten by her husband and has \nleft him. She lives in fear of him finding her. Now the registration \ncomes out and says where she lives and that she has a gun or, worse \nyet, where she lives and that she does not have a gun.\n  Think about prosecutors and our judges. I know many of them who put \nbad people away, and many of them have concealed carry. Many of them \ntravel to work. The security meets them in the parking lot. They go to \nwork, but they worry. We have had sherifs and we have had prosecutors \nkilled in Kentucky because the criminals were angry that they were \nlocked up.\n  We do not want all of our records by the government to be put out \nthere in public for everybody to know where we live and whether we have \na gun.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n  You can see the issue of privacy is not a small issue. It is a big \nissue. It was incredibly important to our Founding Fathers.\n  Some have said it is too late to even get this back. There have been \narticles written in the last few weeks that say that whether or not the \nPATRIOT Act expires, the government will just keep on doing what they \nare doing. In fact, there is a provision in the PATRIOT Act that says \nany investigation already begun before the deadline can go on in \nperpetuity.\n  The other thing is that there are people now writing--John Napier \nTye, who was the Internet watchdog for this program, wrote that he \nbelieves that Executive Order 12333 is really allowing all this bulk \ncollection under what the President says are article II authorities.\n  Article II gives the President and the executive branch different \npowers, but these are not unlimited powers. Some think they are. Some \nsay the President has the absolute power when it comes to war. Article \nII actually comes after article I. In article I, section 8, the \nPresident was told he does not get to initiate war. The most basic of \npowers with regard to war were not actually given to the President; \nthey were given to Congress.\n  What is sad about this, what is going on now is that Congress has not \nshown sufficient interest in what the executive branch does on a host \nof things, whether it be regulation, whether it be the enormous \nbureaucracy, but really so much power has shifted and gone from \nCongress and wound up in the executive.\n  It is the same way with intelligence. We have intelligence \ncommittees, but the question is, Are they asking sufficient questions? \nThere are some. Senator Wyden has been a leader in this. He and I have \nworked together. He really has been the leader because he has been on \nthe Intelligence Committee. He has more information, really, than the \nrest of us do, but he at times has been hamstrung because once you know \ninformation, if it is told to you in a classified setting, you are not \nallowed to talk about it. Sometimes it actually makes sense, if you \nwant to speak out, not to actually learn through the official channels \nbut to read on the Internet because if you learn about it through \nofficial channels, you cannot say anything about it even if the \ngovernment is lying about it.\n  We are talking about an enormous amount of information. We are \ntalking about all of your phone records all of the time.\n  Recently, there were some complaints by people in the newspaper. They \nsaid: Well, the government is really only getting one-third of your \nrecords; they are not getting enough of your records. Some want them to \nget more of your records.\n  The objective evidence shows, though, that we really have never \ngotten anyone independently; we have not found any terrorist \nindependently of this. But still some people are so fearful, they are \nlike: How can we get terrorists? We will be overrun with terrorists, \nand ISIS will be in every drugstore and in every house in America if we \ndo not get rid of the Constitution, if we do not let the Fourth \nAmendment lapse, and if we do not just let everybody pass out warrants.\n  That is what we do under the PATRIOT Act. The PATRIOT Act allows the \npolice to write their own warrants. This is one of the fundamental \nseparations we did with the Fourth Amendment. This was probably the \nmost important thing we did, to separate police power from the \njudiciary, to have a check and a balance so you would never get \nsystemic bias, so you would never get political or religious or racial \nbias in your judicial system. We separated these powers.\n  We now let the police write their own warrants. It is a special form \nof police. It is the FBI, but they are domestic police. The FBI is \nallowed to write their own warrants. These are called national security \nletters. They do not have to be signed by a judge. There is no probable \ncause. If they come into your house, there is no ability for you to \ncomplain. In fact, sometimes they are now coming into our houses \nwithout us knowing about it. This is called a sneak-and-peek warrant. \nLike everything else, the government says we will be overrun with \nterrorists if we do not let the government quietly sneak into our house \nwhen we are gone and put in listening devices, search through our \npapers and read all of our stuff while we are gone.\n  They do not have to have probable cause necessarily for these. It is \na lower standard. But we are letting the FBI write this without a judge \nreviewing it.\n  I have a friend who is an FBI agent. I play golf with him. He is \nlike: Don't you trust me? I do trust him. I do not trust everybody.\n  Madison said that if government was comprised of angels, we would not \nneed restrictions, we would not need laws. Patrick Henry said that the \nConstitution is about restraining the power of government. It is not \nabout the vast majority of good people who work in government. It is \nabout preventing the bad apple. It is about preventing the one bad \nperson who might get into government and decide to abuse the rights of \nindividuals.\n  Some say: Well, the NSA has never abused anyone's rights. That may or \nmay not be true. They are giving us the information. We do not get to \nindependently look at the information. They are telling us. It is the \nsame group who says they were not doing any bulk collection of data at \nall. But even if we presume they are telling us the truth, it is not \nreally the end of the story because the story should be that we do not \nwant to allow the abuse of power to happen.\n  As the debate unfolded the first time for the PATRIOT Act, something \noccurred that happens frequently around here. There is not enough time. \nHurry up, hurry up, there is not enough time. It is kind of like the \ndebate right now.\n\n  Unless we insert ourselves at this moment, I am not sure we will have \nany debate on the PATRIOT Act. It has been set to expire for 3 years. \nWe have known it was coming, and the question is, Do we not have enough \ntime because we just don't care enough? Are we going to relinquish our \nrights or constrict our rights to the Bill of Rights, even though we \nknow it is coming up and that we have to do something else that \noccupies all of our time?\n  Senator Wyden and I have a series of amendments. Our amendments would \ntry to reform some of this. Our amendments would say that NSLs, \nnational security letters, cannot just be signed by the police, that \nthey would have to go to a judge.\n  People argue: Well, how would we catch terrorists? The same way we \ncatch other people who are dangerous, such as murderers and rapists, \nanybody in our society. In fact, when you look at the criminal process \nfor criminal warrants, warrants are almost never turned down. But just \nthat simple check and balance of having the police call a judge is one \nof the fundamental aspects of our jurisprudence, and we gave it up so \nquickly on the heels of 9/11 because of the fear.\n  The thing is, when the PATRIOT Act came forward, most people didn't \neven read it. There was a committee bill and this and that and there \nwas a last-minute substitution. It was given hours, and it was simply \npassed in a spate of fear.\n  As we look at what happened at that time, I think we now have the \nability to look backward and say: Is there another way? When we start \nwith the doctrine that a man's house or a woman's house is their \ncastle, it was a very old notion, maybe even dating back to the times \nof Magna Carta. Our castle and our papers are a little bit different \nnow, and the Supreme Court has not quite caught up to where we are \ntechnologically. They are getting there, but this really needs to be \ndebated and discussed at the Supreme Court level because the thing is \nwe don't keep our papers in our house anymore. In fact, we have gone to \nsuch a paperless society that 90 percent of your paper--or if you are \nunder 30 years old, 100 percent of your paper--is held somewhere else.\n  The question we have to ask is: Do you retain a privacy interest in \nyour records? When the phone company holds your records, do they have \nan obligation to keep them private? Do you retain a privacy interest? \nIf the government wants the records from the phone company, should they \nbe allowed to write the name Verizon and get all of the records from \nVerizon? I, frankly, think that if John Smith has his phone service \nwith Verizon and he is a terrorist, the warrant should say John\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nSmith and go to Verizon, but it is an individualized warrant. I don't \nthink we should have generalized warrants.\n  There are some who want to replace the bulk collection of records \nwith a different system where the government doesn't hold the records, \nbut the phone companies hold the records. I am also concerned about \nthis for one big reason: The recent court case has now said the PATRIOT \nAct does not justify the collection of records, that it is actually \nillegal. I am concerned that since the court is now saying section 215 \ndoesn't allow a bulk collection, that in trying to reform this, what is \ncalled the USA FREEDOM Act, we will actually be granting new power to \nsection 215 that the court says is not there. The court is saying that \nit stands logic on its head to say relevance means nothing, that \neverybody's records in the whole country could be relevant.\n  We have even changed, over time, the investigations and whether there \nis a full-blown investigation at the beginning of an investigation. Who \ngets to decide or define what an investigation is? The bottom line is \nthat we look at this, and as we move forward, we have to decide whether \nour fear is going to get the better of us.\n  Once upon a time, we had a standard in our country that was innocent \nuntil proven guilty. We have given up on so much. Now people are \ntalking about a standard that is: If you have nothing to hide, you have \nnothing to fear. Think about it. Is that the standard we are willing to \nlive under? Think about whether you believe you still have a privacy \ninterest in the records that are held by the credit card companies, \nyour bank or the phone company.\n  In the PATRIOT Act, they did something to make it easier to collect \nrecords and to override your privacy agreement. If you read the nitty-\ngritty of any of these agreements that you have when you use a search \nengine or when you are on the Internet, you do voluntarily say that \nyour information will be shared in an anonymous way, but they promise \nthey will not give your name to somebody.\n  The phone company has the same sort of privacy agreement, but what \nhas happened through the PATRIOT Act is that we have given them \nliability protection. At first blush, you might say we have too many \ndamn lawsuits. I am kind of that way. I am a physician. We have way too \nmany lawsuits. I am for cutting back on lawsuits. But at the same time, \nif you give the phone, Internet or credit card company immunity to \nignore your privacy agreement, they will.\n  Instead of the government storing billions and billions of records in \nUtah, the new system is still going to store billions and billions of \nrecords in the phone company, but still the question is: Will we access \nthem in a general way? It says we are going to look at a specific \nperson, but if you look at the way ``person'' is defined, a person \ncould be a corporation. I don't think you should have a warrant that \nsays Verizon and gets all the records for all of their customers.\n  The other thing that has been going on that they have not been \ncompletely honest with, and we may have some data on, is that the \ngovernment is going inside of the software. They are asking companies \nsuch as Facebook or demanding that companies such as Facebook give them \naccess through their source code so the government can get in. Now, to \nFacebook's credit, they are fighting them, and I think more companies \nare now standing up and trying to fight against this. But in a \nnefarious way, the government is going into the code of Facebook and \nthen inserting malware into other people's Facebook and spreading it \nthroughout the Internet.\n  The government is also looking at communications between two nodes. \nLet's say you communicate with Google and it is encrypted, but then \nwhen Google has a data center that talks to another data center which \nis nonencrypted, the government just hooks up to a cable and siphons \noff records. There is a danger that you will have no privacy left at \nthe end of this.\n  The Fourth Amendment is very specific. The Fourth Amendment says you \nhave to individualize a warrant and put a name on the warrant. You have \nto say specifically what records you want, you have to say where they \nare located, and then you have to ask a judge for permission.\n  The sneak-and-peek warrant I was talking about before is section 213. \nIt is now permanent law. We don't even get a chance to talk about it. \nWe could repeal it, and I will have an amendment to repeal it. This is \nwhere the government goes in secretly and says: Well, we need this \nlower standard because terrorists will get us if we don't. Well, we \nhave now had it on the books for a decade and do you know who they are \ngetting? Drug people--people who are buying, selling or using drugs. \nThat is a domestic problem, which also leads me to something else about \nthe PATRIOT Act that really bothers me.\n  When we first started talking about the standards of the PATRIOT Act \nand going from probable cause, which is what the Constitution has, to \narticulable suspicion, down to relevance, we said: Well, we are going \nto lower standards because we are going after foreigners. They are not \nAmericans and they are not here. We are going to lower the standard, \nand really there could be some debate in favor of that.\n  When we first did it, we said we could not use that information for a \ndomestic crime. I will give an example. I asked one of the intelligence \nfolks at one time to answer a question and was dissatisfied with the \nresponse. Let's say the government comes in through a sneak-and-peek \nwarrant. They don't tell you that they are in your house. Guess what. \nThey find out you are not a terrorist, but you have paint in your house \nwhich you bought through your office business expense, and you are \npainting your house, which is a tax violation. It is a domestic crime, \nbut they got into your house through false pretenses. They said you \nwere a terrorist, but they were wrong. However, they found out you were \nnot being perfectly honest with your taxes. They have gotten in through \na lower standard.\n  Ultimately, if we let them collect all of your records and we let a \ndomestic crime be prosecuted by this, we could have the government \nsifting through your credit card records because they say the Fourth \nAmendment doesn't protect records, including your phone records--not \nthe content, just all of this data. After they put it together and mesh \nit, they decide, by looking at your digital footprint, that maybe you \nare somebody who runs traffic lights.\n  Now we are taking something that was intended to capture foreigners \nand we will capture people domestically and prosecute them for domestic \ncrimes, the specific thing they promised us they would never do. So \nthings morph and get bigger and bigger.\n  We could have a valid debate about whether we have gone too far, but \nwe should at least have a debate. Shouldn't we get together and say: \nLet's have a debate. Let's devote all week to this.\n  For a while, I have asked to have a full day and have five or six \namendments that Senator Wyden and I could put forward and have a full-\nfledged debate over whether the bulk collection of our records is \nsomething we should continue to do.\n  I think if you look at this and say: Where are the American people on \nthis, well, there has been poll after poll. Well over half the people--\nmaybe well over 60 percent of the people--think the government has gone \ntoo far. But if you want an example of why the Senate or Congress \ndoesn't represent the people very well or why we are maybe a decade \nbehind, I would bet that 20 percent of the people here would vote to \njust stop this--to truly just stop it--at the most; whereas, 60 to 70 \npercent of the public would stop these things.\n  You are not well represented. What has happened is that I think the \nCongress is maybe a decade behind the people. I think this is an \nargument for why we should limit terms. I think it is an argument for \nwhy we should have more turnover in office because we get up here and \nstay too long and get separated from the people. The people don't want \nthe bulk collection of their records, and if we were listening, we \nwould hear that.\n  The vote in the House, while I don't think the bill is perfect, and I \nthink it may well continue bulk collection, was over 300 votes to end \nthis program and to say we are no longer going to have bulk collection. \nYet it looks like the majority in this body says we still need bulk \ncollection. In fact, the biggest complaint from the majority of this \nbody is that we are not collecting\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\nenough records and that we need to collect more records.\n  Can we have security and liberty at the same time?\n  I had breakfast with a high-ranking official from our intelligence \ncommunity maybe 6 months ago, and I asked him: How much information do \nyou get from metadata and how much do you end up getting from a \nwarrant? He said, without question, you get more from a warrant. People \ntalk about whether we can go one hop or two hops. That means if you are \nsuspected of terrorism and you called 100 people--if we look at your \nrecords, that is one hop. If we look at the next 100 records, that is a \nsecond hop. As you go in, this pyramid gets bigger and bigger until you \nare talking about tens of thousands of people.\n  As you get further and further away from the suspect, I see no reason \nyou couldn't keep getting warrants. If they say that warrants are slow \nand laborious and there is not a judge, put more judges on the court. \nIf they say they need them at 3 in the morning, put the judges on 24-\nhour alert and you can call them at 3 in the morning. We call judges \nfor a warrant in the middle of the night all across America. I see no \nreason why you can't have security and the Constitution at the same \ntime.\n  The President instituted the Privacy and Civil Rights Board. They \nwent through a lot of this, and some of the things they came up with, I \nthink, were truly astounding. The amount of information, I think, is \nmindboggling--of what is being sucked up in this. There is something \ncalled section 702 of FISA, and this has allowed them to collect \ninformation on Americans who might have been communicating with a \nforeigner. You say: Well, that American is probably suspicious. Well, \nit goes out in ripples and it becomes this enormous amount of--cache of \ninformation.\n  When they looked at some of this recently--the Washington Post looked \nat this--they found that 9 of 10 intercepted conversations were not the \nintended target. So I think there was one estimate that in the last \nyear we had 89,000 targets. If you multiply that and say it is only \none-tenth of what we actually take, you are now looking at 900,000 \nrecords of people who had nothing to do with terrorism. They didn't \neven really talk to the person. They incidentally talked to a person \nwho talked to the person. It could be the terrorist called Papa John's \nand you called Papa John's, so now you are in the same phone tree \nnetwork. That can ripple out in waves. That information should not be \ncollected, it should not be put in a database, and it should not be \nstored. Ultimately, we are collecting so much information that it is \nall of your information.\n  One thing that should concern us about simply going from a system \nwhere the government collects all of these records and stores them in \nUtah to one where the phone company does it--actually some people in \nthe NSA are acquiescing and saying it is not so bad. That concerns me \nthat the NSA is saying ``not so bad.'' It concerns me that we are still \ngoing to have bulk collection.\n\n  The debate we really need to have is whether, if someone else is \nholding your records, if you still have any kind of privacy interest in \nyour records. I personally think your phone records are still partially \nyours, in a way, or that you have a privacy interest in them. This is \ngoing to become very important because your records ultimately--there \nprobably will not even be any records in your house, they will be on \nyour phone, and then your phone records are connected to the company. \nWho owns them? Do you have a right to privacy in those records? I think \nyou can have security and freedom at the same time, but I think if we \nare not careful, this is going to get away from us.\n  When they found out that 9 out of 10 intercepts were actually not the \nintended target, just ancillary information they picked up, they also \nfound that 50 percent contained email addresses that were U.S. \ncitizens. So let's say you collect a million pieces of information and \nyou are just gathering this up and you are intending to go after \nforeign targets who might be terrorists, but over half of this \ninformation, much of it incidentally gained, is actually U.S. citizens. \nSo this is sort of an end run--they call it backdoor searches--but it \nis sort of an end run that has gone around the Constitution, gone \naround the Fourth Amendment, to collect information that we have \nactually said should be illegal to be collected that way, but we are \ndoing it because we have done an end run around.\n  Also realize you can send an email from Virginia to South Carolina \nand it might go over a server in Brazil. If your email goes over a \nforeign server, all of a sudden, boom, everything is done. The \nConstitution is out the door. They can collect that, even the content. \nIt is never revealed to you; nothing is ever presented to you. It is \nall done within the executive branch, with no advocate on your side.\n  There are several programs that came out through this that are being \ncollected. It is not just the bulk collection. There is a program \ncalled PRISM that has been out there for a while and there is another \none called Upstream. In PRISM, it is a surveillance program that \ncollects Internet communications of foreign nationals from at least \nnine major Internet companies.\n  I think this wouldn't have happened if the Internet companies were \nnot given liability protection. I think what would have happened is \nthey would have said we are violating our obligation to our customers \nand we are going to fight against this. But the PATRIOT Act even made \nit worse. The PATRIOT Act made it a crime to reveal that you had been \nserved with a warrant. So we have gone way beyond any typical \nconstitutional mechanisms.\n  In the Upstream Program, a similar thing happened, but this is when \nthe data is collected as it moves across U.S. junctions. The problem is \nnot so much going after foreign communications but going after \nincidental and collecting incidental communications that involve \nAmerican citizens.\n  John Napier Tye was a section chief for Internet freedom in the State \nDepartment's Bureau of Democracy. He was going to give a speech--and I \nthink this is very telling. This is reported in the Washington Post. He \nhad written out his speech and he sent it for review. In his speech, he \nsaid: If U.S. citizens disagree with congressional and executive \ndeterminations about the proper scope of intelligence activities, they \nhave the opportunity to change policy through democratic process.\n  And we think, Who could object to that? What would his censors say? \nHow could he possibly say we don't have the right through democratic \nprocess to change policies? They had him strike ``through intelligence \nprocesses'' because I guess they apparently think we don't have the \ndemocratic ability to change these things. The sad truth is it may be \ntrue because a lot of this is being done by Executive order.\n  Executive Order No. 12333 has no congressional oversight. In fact, \nthe question was asked recently of one of the Senate leaders, Will you \ninvestigate this? Now, there may well be a secret investigation going \non, but there was some indication it was really outside of our purview.\n  I don't think anything the executive branch does should be outside of \nour purview. The whole idea of having coequal branches was to have \nchecks and balances. One of the biggest problems I find in Washington \nis that sometimes the opposition party--if we have a Democratic \nPresident and a Republican Congress, you will get a little bit of \nadversity and a little bit of pitting ambition against ambition and \ncheck and balance. But the party that is the same party as the \nPresident just doesn't tend to push back, probably for partisan \nreasons. Now, it is not just the other party; it happens when \nRepublicans are in power also. What happens is the political party that \nis the same power as the President tends to sort of be open to letting \nthings move on, just letting the President accumulate more power. But I \nthink this should be telling that when he said we could change things \nthrough democratic action, President Obama's White House Counsel told \nhim that, no, that wasn't true. He was instructed to amend the line and \nmake a general reference to our laws and policies but to leave out \nintelligence policies as if we don't really get a say in what they do \nas far as what information they collect on us.\n  John Napier Tye goes on to warn us. He says: Unlike section 215, \nExecutive Order No. 12333 authorizes collection of the content of \ncommunications, not just metadata, even for U.S. citizens.\n  So quite often we are told--we were told for years--don't worry, they \nare\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\nnot collecting your data; they are just collecting the data of \nforeigners. It turns out that wasn't true.\n\n  Now, the big thing they tell us is, Well, we are not collecting the \ncontent, we are just collecting the numbers. But when we read John \nNapier Tye, he says the Executive order authorizes collection of the \ncontent of the communications also, not just metadata, and also for \nU.S. persons.\n  So the question is, If we get rid of bulk collection, will the \nExecutive continue to do it anyway?\n  The other question is, Why doesn't the Executive stop this? It was \nstarted by Executive action and can be ended by Executive action at any \ntime. Where is the Executive? How come the press gives him a free pass \njust to say Congress needs to fix this? Sure, I messed it up, I broke \nit; I am doing something that the second appeals court said is illegal, \nand I am going to keep on doing it until Congress does something. Why \ndon't we see any questions from the press? Why don't we see anybody \nfrom the media saying, Mr. President, it is illegal. You started it. \nYou were performing a program that is collecting all of the phone \nrecords from all Americans. It has been declared illegal from the \nsecond highest court in the land. Why don't you stop? I have not ever \nheard the question asked of him.\n  With the Executive order, apparently because this, they say, is \narticle II, and then article II to them means they can do whatever they \nwant without any oversight by Congress, the conclusion by John Napier \nTye is that there is nothing to prevent the NSA from collecting and \nstoring all communications. This concerns me.\n  The President instituted or brought together a group called the \nReview Group on Intelligence and Communication Technologies. In it, \nthey came forward with some recommendations. Recommendation No. 12 was \nthat all of this data--all of this incidental data that is becoming \npart of these databases that is collected under these authorities--the \nExecutive order--should be immediately purged unless there is a foreign \nintelligence component to it. The Review Group further recommended that \na U.S. person's incidentally collected data should never be used in a \ncriminal proceeding against that person.\n  So now we are back to what I was talking about earlier. If you are \ngoing to go away from the Constitution, if you are going to say to \ncatch bad guys we can't really have the Constitution, we are going to \nhave to have a bar that is a lot easier to cross that allows us to do \nkind of what we want, wouldn't you want to exclude American citizens \nfrom being convicted or put in jail for a crime under a lower standard? \nIt is kind of like this: The question is, If the government can come in \nwithout a valid search warrant, without announcing they are in your \nhouse, collect all of your data, would you want them to have hours and \nhours in your house without any probable cause and then start arresting \nyou for this?\n  There are rumors we are doing this. There are rumors that \nintelligence warrants, which are nonconstitutional, which are a lower \nstandard, are being used to get regular criminals. What they do is \ncollect information through data, metadata analysis, all of this, they \nget enough to be convinced that you are a drug dealer, and then they \narrest you by getting a traditional warrant, but they are using \ninformation they got illegally to get to you.\n  Section 213, this whole sneak-and-peak, where they go in without \nannouncing that they have been in your house, 99.5 percent of the \npeople arrested are actually people who committed a domestic crime. \nThey are not terrorists. So we are told you have to have a PATRIOT Act \nto get terrorists. Yet what we really find is that they are using it in \na way that is not honest. They are using a lower standard--a standard \nless than the Constitution--and they are using that standard then to \narrest people for basic domestic crime.\n  The President's Review Commission in recommendation No. 12 \nrecommended that this incidentally collected data not be used \ncriminally against anybody. They gave their recommendations to the \nWhite House. The White House stated that the adoption of these \nrecommendations they requested would require significant changes and \nindicated it had no plans to make any changes. So the President's own \nreview commission says there is great danger in using a lower, less-\nthan-constitutional standard to collect great amounts of information \nthat can be searched. There is great danger to privacy. There is also \ngreat danger to using information collected outside of the \nConstitution. There is great danger in then using that for domestic \nprosecution, and the President said he has no intention of any changes.\n  When I think of this President, it is probably what disappoints me \nmost. There were fleeting times when this President was in the U.S. \nSenate that he stood up for the Constitution. In fact, there is a quote \nfrom the President when he was running for office--there are many \nquotes--but there was one quote saying that the warrants that are \nissued by police--national security letters--should be signed by a \njudge. The very amendment that I will try to get a vote on he seemed to \nhave supported, but now his administration is issuing hundreds of \nthousands--it starts out with a few, then 47, then a couple hundred, \nand now it is in the thousands. Any time you give power to government, \nthey love it and they will accumulate more. Any time you give power to \ngovernment and expect them to live within the confines of the power, \nthey will not live within the confines of power unless you watch them \nlike a hawk. You have to watch them. You have to have oversight.\n  We are at a point now where we have enormous bulk collection, \nenormous collection of American citizens' data; one program we know \nalmost nothing about. Yet it goes on with no debate. The Executive \norder from 1981 has been transformed into a monster with tentacles that \nreach into every home in our country. The collection of records that is \ngoing on is beyond your imagination, and we need to know about it. \nThere needs to be a public debate. It has become even more pressing \nthat we have this public debate because the problem is that we have the \nPresident and we have the Congress and we have the intelligence \ncommunity not being honest with us. So the fact that the Director of \nNational Intelligence would come to Congress and lie and say they are \nnot collecting this information, and then when they do admit to it say: \nOh, by the way, it is working really well. We are capturing all kinds \nof terrorists--but they hold all the information, and we rely on them \nto be honest and to present truthful information to us. This is a big \nproblem.\n\n  Currently, the courts haven't brought their rulings up to date. The \ndebate has been going on for a long time. In 1928 there was the \nOlmstead case. The Olmstead case went against those of us who believe \nin privacy. I believe that case still lingers on, even though it has \nbeen reversed.\n  In the Olmstead case, Ray Olmstead was a bootlegger, and the \ngovernment decided to eavesdrop on his conversations, but they didn't \nhave a warrant. They could have gotten a warrant. Who knows why they \ndidn't get the warrant, but they didn't get a warrant. But the Court \nended up ruling that phone conversations were not protected by the \nFourth Amendment. This was a sad day in our history when this happened \nin 1928.\n  The dissent in that case was Justice Brandeis. As so often occurs in \nour history, sometimes the dissent becomes the majority opinion and \nbecomes profound because it was there at the time.\n  Harlan's opinion, the dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, is what \neverybody refers to. Nobody refers to the majority in saying that \nseparate is equal. They were wrong--the same as in the Olmstead case. \nPeople remember Justice Brandeis. It is probably one of the most famous \nquotes in jurisprudence: ``The right to be let alone is the most \ncherished of rights.'' It is ``the [right] most valued among civilized \nmen.''\n  We have this debate still sometimes, though, because some \nconservatives say: There is no right to privacy. I don't see it in the \nConstitution. And conservatives who argue that there is no right to \nprivacy aren't remembering the 9th and 10th Amendments very well, \nparticularly the 9th Amendment.\n  The Ninth Amendment says that all the rights aren't listed, but those \nthat aren't listed are not to be disparaged. Even our Founding Fathers \nworried about this. Our Founding Fathers came forward and they at first \nthought we would just do the Constitution without the Bill of Rights. \nSome of them worried. They said: If we do the Bill of\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\nRights, people will think that is all we have. If we list ten different \namendments, they will think that is all of our rights. So they finally \nconvinced everybody to go along with it by saying: We will put in the \n9th and 10th amendment, with the 10th Amendment limiting the powers, \nsaying only the powers enumerated are given to the Federal Government \nand everything else is left to the States and the people, respectively. \nBut the Ninth Amendment, which is in many ways sort of the stepchild of \nour amendments, hasn't been adequately, I think, adhered to or \nrecognized. It says that those rights not listed are not to be \ndisparaged.\n  Sometimes we have this discussion because some people say it has to \nbe enumerated. I agree completely if we are talking that the powers \ngiven to government should be enumerated. They are few--few and \nlimited, the powers given to the government. But it is the opposite \nwith your rights. Your rights are many and infinite. Your rights are \nunenumerated, and you do have a right to privacy. So while the word \n``privacy'' is not in the Constitution, in the Fourth Amendment, \nthough, they do talk a lot about your privacy. It is about your home, \nthat your home is your castle.\n  The exact words of the Fourth Amendment are:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons and things to be seized.\n\n  The reason why we should worry about whether a warrant is \nindividualized is we have had some tragic times in our history. During \nWorld War II we didn't individualize the arrests of Japanese Americans. \nWe didn't say: That is so-and-so who lives in California, and we think \nthey are communicating with Japan and telling our secrets. We \nindiscriminately rounded up all of the Japanese and incarcerated them.\n  There have been times in our history when we haven't acted in an \nindividualized manner. It happened throughout the South in the old Jim \nCrow South. We told people that we were going to relegate them to a \ncertain status based on a general category.\n  So when we talk about individualizing warrants, we are talking about \ntrying to prevent bias from occurring. Now, bias can occur for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. I tell people that you can be a minority because of \nthe color of your skin or the shade of your ideology. You can be a \nminority because of your religion. You can be a minority because you \nare home-schooled. But the thing is, if you are a minority, if you are \na dissenter, if you dissent from the majority, you need to be very, \nvery aware of your constitutional rights. Be very, very aware of the \nBill of Rights.\n  The Bill of Rights isn't so much for the prom queen. The Bill of \nRights isn't so much for the high school quarterback. Many people in \nlife always seem to be treated fairly. The Bill of Rights is for those \nwho are less fortunate, for those who might be a minority of thought, \ndeed or race. We have to be concerned about the individualization of \nour policies or we run the risk and the danger of people being treated \nin categories.\n  Right now we are treating every American in one category. There is a \ngeneral veil of suspicion that is placed on every American now. Every \nAmerican is somehow said to be under suspicion, because we are \ncollecting the records of every American.\n  We talk about metadata and whether or how much it means or what the \ngovernment thinks it can determine from metadata. There are some people \nwho say: Don't worry. It is just your phone logs. It is no big deal. It \nis just boring old business records. We should be a little bit \nconcerned by the words of one former intelligence officer who said, \nthat ``we kill people based on metadata.'' He wasn't referring to \nAmericans. He was talking about terrorists. But we should be concerned \nthat they are so confident of metadata that they would kill someone.\n  Instead of our believing that metadata is no big deal and it just \nshould be public information and anybody can have it, realize that your \ngovernment is so certain of metadata that they would kill an individual \nover it. That seems to me to make the point that metadata is \nincredibly important, if we would make a decision to kill someone based \non their metadata.\n\n  The Electronic Frontier Foundation has done a lot of work for privacy \nand deserves a lot of credit. Mark Jaycox writes in an issue from last \nyear that ``it is likely that the NSA conducts much more of its spying \npower under the President's claimed `inherent' powers and only governed \nby a document originally approved by Executive order.''\n  So while we are superficially having a debate over the bulk \ncollection of records that some claim are authorized under the PATRIOT \nAct, section 215, there is a whole other section that some privacy \nadvocates are worried about that is even bigger.\n  I had a meeting recently with one of the founders of one of the huge \nsocial communication companies, and he told me that he thinks we are \nmissing some of the debate here, because he says everybody is talking \nabout bulk collection of your phone records. He is convinced that there \nis ever so much more being collected through backdoor channels. These \nbackdoor channels can occur in two ways. They can occur one way by \ngoing and looking at foreigners' information and then coming through \nthe backdoor back into our country and looking at Americans' \ninformation. That American's information has tentacles and spreads and \nit becomes this enormous grouping of incidental information. In fact, \nsome have said 9 out of 10 pieces of data pulled in aren't about \nterrorists; they are just incidental stuff.\n  What the President's review commission says is we should delete that \nonce we find it is not relevant to an investigation. The amazing thing \nto me is that even people who support the PATRIOT Act--and I don't; I \nthink the PATRIOT Act lowers the constitutional standards and risks all \nfreedom and our liberty. But even for those who think the PATRIOT Act \nis fine, they said that the PATRIOT Act never was intended to do this.\n  So if you want to ask yourself is the government overstepping, even \nthe authors of the PATRIOT Act are now telling us that the overstepping \nis to such a degree that they think the PATRIOT Act doesn't justify it.\n  In fact, that is really what the court ruled recently. I had hoped \nthe court would rule that the bulk collection--the grabbing up of all \nyour records--was unconstitutional, but they actually simply ruled that \nthe PATRIOT Act does not sanction it. The PATRIOT Act does not give \nauthority to the government to do this. It is a pretty amazing sort of \nset of circumstances--that the government has taken something that was \nintended in one way, completely transformed it, and then when they are \nrebuked by the court, they are not chastened at all.\n  I wonder why no one has had the guts or the wherewithal to ask the \nPresident why he doesn't stop this now. The President could today \nlisten to this speech on the floor of the Senate, and he could change \nhis mind. He could, this afternoon, with his pen--he says he has his \npen and his cell phone--he can immediately stop the bulk collection of \ndata. In fact, all of the alternatives he could continue and he could \nprobably do now. He could also say he is going to collect the data with \na warrant. He has all of that power.\n  Someone should ask the President: Mr. President, why do you keep \ndoing something the court has said is illegal? Why do you continue \ndoing this, and why won't you stop? And how could we possibly think \nthat it is a responsible answer to say: Oh, I will stop when they make \nme. His own privacy commission says that what he is doing is illegal \nand should stop.\n  One of the things that people are worried about is that the \ngovernment is forcing its way into the code source of different \nFacebook, Google, and different Internet companies. There are a couple \nof things that are occurring because of this. If you live in Europe, if \nyou are Angela Merkel or if you are anybody in Europe, you might not \nwant American stuff anymore.\n  There are already rumors in discussion that billions of dollars--\nthere has been some estimating of over $100 billion--have been lost to \nwhere we have been a dynamic leader in software, in hardware, in the \nInternet. People don't want our stuff because they don't trust us \nanymore.\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\n  One of the reasons they don't trust us is this. We have a group \ncalled the Tailored Access Operations that targets system \nadministrators and installs malware while masquerading as Facebook \nservers. That is a little scary--that if you go on Facebook, somehow \nmalware is getting into your computer and then searching and allowing \nthem to know everything you are doing on your computer. If you have a \nwarrant, to my mind you can do a host of these things, but do it to \nsomeone you have suspicion of.\n  I think we have made the haystack so big that no one is ever getting \nthrough the haystack to find the needle. What we really need to do is \nisolate the haystack into a group of suspicious people and spend \nenormous resources looking at suspicious people--people for whom we \nhave probable cause. If you think of almost every instance--I mean, go \nback to 9/11. You will have people come forward with a ridiculous \nassumption that if we had the PATRIOT Act, we wouldn't have had 9/11. \nWe would have caught those two terrorists in San Diego. And I am like, \nyou mean the two terrorists that were living with a confidential \ninformant for a year?\n  We knew who these people were. These people were talking to each \nother. It wasn't a lack of gathering information. All of these \nincidentals and all of this grabbing up of bulk records isn't what we \nneeded. We needed the CIA to call the FBI. We needed further that FBI \ncall Washington and for somebody to listen to them.\n  The 20th hijacker, a guy named Moussaoui, was captured a month in \nadvance. We got him in Minnesota. We got his computer. He was captured \nbecause people said--he was from a foreign country, and he was \nattempting to learn to take off planes but not land them. The FBI agent \nthere ought to be given a Medal of Honor. Instead of giving the Medal \nof Honor to the head of the FBI, we should have fired the head of the \nFBI and this FBI agent should have been made the head of the FBI. He \nwrote 70 letters to his superiors. He caught the 20th hijacker. He \nshould be a well-known name to every American and a hero. He caught the \n20th hijacker. He saved lives. But his superior got 70 letters and did \nsquat. I have no idea what happened to his superior, but nobody was \nfired for 9/11. Instead of firing the people who did not do a good job, \nwe gave them medals. The guy who did a good job, I don't know what \nhappened to him.\n\n  (Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.)\n  What we did is we decided we would just collect everybody's \ninformation, that we would sort of scrap the Bill of Rights.\n  I have met a lot of our wounded soldiers. I have met young men who \nhave lost two, three arms, two, three limbs, sometimes four limbs. I \nhave met people who are paralyzed. And to a person, when I ask them \n``What were you fighting for?'' they tell me ``The Constitution.'' They \ntell me ``Our way of life'' or ``Our Bill of Rights.'' Don't you think \nthey would be disappointed to find out that they went over there and \nthey risked life and limb and gave up part of their bodies and they \ncame home, and while they were gone we gutted the Bill of Rights?\n  Not only did we get it--we can have a difference of opinion on this, \nbut not only did we gut it, we don't have time to debate it. We just \nwilly-nilly say: That is fine. We are not even going to have time to \ndebate it. We have known for 3 years that this debate was coming up. \nYet, we squashed a bunch of bills in the last week, and we have no time \nfor debate, no time for amendments, no time to discuss whether we are \nwilling to trade our liberty for security.\n  Franklin said that those who trade their liberty for security may \nwind up with neither.\n  This is a very important debate that we need to have in the public, \nin the open. We worry about--or some of us worry that just in \ndiscussion of bulk records, we may not get to other programs the \ngovernment just simply will not tell us about. A lot of them are \nwritten about, though.\n  In another episode of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \nnewsletter, they talk about a program called Muscular. Muscular is a \nprogram that is siphoning off the data between different data centers. \nYahoo and Google sometimes have--at least did have communication \nbetween them that was not encrypted. Your information was encrypted \ngoing to the data center, but then between data centers, it was not \nencrypted, and the government is simply siphoning all this off through \nExecutive order. I do not whether it is foreign. I do not know whether \nthere is incidental American. I do not know what is being collected. We \nhave no oversight, no ability to vote on whether we continue this \nprogram or discontinue this program. The companies are sometimes not \nnotified of the warrants or if they are notified of the warrants are \ntold they cannot talk about them; they are gagged. This is the kind of \nstuff we need to have in the open.\n  Some of the information people are talking about that the NSA \ncollects on Americans is contacts from your address book, buddy lists, \ncalling records, phone records, emails, and then they put it all into a \ndata--I think the program is called SNAC. They put it all into this \ndata program, and they develop a network of who you are and who your \nfriends are through all of the interconnection of all of your contacts \nand friends.\n  If you ask them ``Is any of this protected by the Fourth Amendment,'' \nthe answer you will get is ``The Fourth Amendment does not protect \nthird-party records.'' So, really, we are going to have this go to the \nSupreme Court.\n  I said earlier that in the Olmstead case in 1928, Justice Brandeis \nwas in the dissent. The vote was 6 to 3, I believe. The Court ruled \nthat phone conversations have no protection. So we started out with a \nbad history. The phone was just coming around and becoming commonplace. \nThe Supreme Court said: Your conversations do not have any protection.\n  This went on for 40-some-odd years until we hit the late 1960s--I \nthink 1968--and the Katz case. Then they say there is an expectation of \nprivacy. So that was a big blow for those of us who believe in privacy, \nthat we finally decided your phone conversations are private and that \nyou have an expectation of privacy and that it should take a warrant \nwith your name on it, individualized, with probable cause.\n  But we go another dozen years, 10, 12 years, and we get another court \ncase called Maryland v. Smith. Here, though, the Court ruled that your \nconversation are protected from the government, that the government has \nto have a valid warrant, but they end up saying that your records don't \nand that the government is allowed to eavesdrop and pick up and \naccumulate records about your phone calls without a warrant. I think \nthat was a big mistake.\n  The case in Maryland v. Smith, though, is one sort of petty criminal \nand a few records over a few-day period. The question that I would like \nto see before the Supreme Court would be, is that equivalent to all \nAmericans' phone records all the time? There was at least some kind of \ninvestigation going on of this person. They did not do it the right \nway. I think they should have gotten a warrant.\n  But in this case, what the government is arguing is that every one of \nyou is somehow relevant to an investigation for terrorism. That is \nabsurd.\n  Finally, we get to the appellate court last week, and the appellate \ncourt says that. They say that, frankly, it is absurd to say that \neverybody in America is relevant to an investigation. Not only is it \nabsurd, not only is it trifling with your privacy and your right to be \nleft alone, but it takes our eye off the prize.\n  Why do you think it is that there are not enough human analysts to \nknow that Tsarnaev, the Boston Bomber, was plotting to bomb the Boston \nMarathon? Why did we not know he got on a plane to go to Chechnya? One \nof the things that we were told at least in the newspaper was that he \nhad an alternate spelling of his name. So we have been 15 years and we \ncannot figure out that sometimes these names are spelled a little \ndifferently and we did not know he flew back and was radicalized in \nanother country.\n  I am for spending more money and more time on analysts to investigate \nand look at the data connected to people of suspicion. But I do not \nwant to spend a penny on collecting all of the information from all of \nthe innocent Americans and giving up who we are in the process. We have \nto fight against terrorism. We have to protect ourselves. But if we \ngive up who we are in the process, has it been worth it? Are\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\nyou really willing to give up your liberty for security? What if the \nsecurity you are getting is not even real? They said the 52 people who \nwere caught through the bulk collection program--the President's own \nprivacy group investigated and said not one person was captured. There \nis a possibility of one, but they already had information on him from \nsome other source.\n\n  Under the Executive order, we are still not talking about the PATRIOT \nAct, we are talking about something that nobody knows much about at \nall. No common Member has been, to my knowledge, informed of what is \ngoing on in this program; none of those not on the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  But they have something with this information called the special \nprocedures governing communications metadata analysis. This is allowing \nthe NSA to use your metadata--phone records, et cetera, who you call, \nhow long you speak--under the PATRIOT Act and section 702 to create \nsocial networks of Americans. So not only are we collecting your data \nbecause the government says--and realize this; many of your elected \nofficials are saying this: that you have no right to privacy and the \nConstitution does not protect your records. They are collecting all of \nyour records, some of it incidental, but they are creating these \nenormous databanks, but then they are connecting metadata to other \nmetadata to create social networks of who you are.\n  You should be alarmed. We should be in open rebellion saying: Enough \nis enough. We are not going to take it anymore. We should be in \nrebellion saying to our government that the Constitution that protects \nour freedoms must be obeyed. Where is the outrage?\n  I tend to think young people get it. Young people--you see them--\ntheir lives revolve around their cell phone. They realize that if I \nwant to know about their lives, if I collect the data from their \nphones--not the content of their phone calls but the data from their \nphones--that I can know virtually everything about them. Do we want to \nlive in a world where the government knows everything about us? Do we \nwant to live in a world where the government has us under constant \nsurveillance?\n  They will say: We are not looking at it; we are just keeping it in \ncase we want to look at it. The danger is too great to let the \ngovernment collect your information.\n  I think there is a valid question as to whether simply the collecting \nof your information is something that goes against the Constitution.\n  One of the other areas where we are seeing collection of data--I \nmean, it would just boggle your mind. We are not just talking about one \nprogram; we are talking about dozens of programs the government has \ninstituted to look at your stuff.\n  There is another group called EPIC, the Electronic Privacy \nInformation Center. They talk about suspicious activity reports. Those \nare reports your bank has to file whenever you deal in cash at the \nbank. There are certain dollar limits. They think, well, gosh, someone \nis probably a bad person if they are putting $9,500 in cash in the \nbank. Well, it turns out that a lot of honest, law-abiding people do \nthat.\n  Not too long ago, there was a Korean husband and wife. They owned a \ngrocery store. They dealt with a lot of cash. They were very \nsuccessful. Three times a day, they deposited over $9,000, $8 to \n$10,000. They tried to stay under $10,000 because there were all kinds \nof extra paperwork if you were over $10,000. So what the government \nsaid is, you are structuring your deposits to evade people. You must be \nguilty of something.\n  The government then can accuse people of a crime and take their \nstuff. There is something called civil asset forfeiture. It does not \nrequire that you be convicted, does not even require that you be \naccused of something.\n  There was a story not too long ago in Philadelphia--Christos \nSourovelis. The teenager was selling drugs out of the back of the \nparents' house. So they caught the kid and they were punishing him, but \nthey decided they would punish the parents, too. They confiscated the \nparents' house and evicted the family. So the teenager makes a mistake \nby selling drugs, and what does the government do? They take the \nparents' house. So you think that is going to help the kid or help \nanything get better in this situation by taking the house? But here is \nthe rub: The kid did not even have to be convicted of anything. The kid \ndid not own the house; he was just their kid.\n  If we allow all kinds of data to be out there to catch people and \nthen we are not even going to require that you are convicted of a crime \nbefore we take your stuff--you can see the danger of allowing so much \ndata to be collected. But we are currently convicting and taking \npeople's stuff or their money simply based on what they are using it \nfor.\n  The Washington Post did a series of articles on this. Turns out that \nmost people having their stuff taken are poor, often African American, \noften Hispanic, but for the most part poor. One guy was here in \nWashington and had $10,000. He was going to buy equipment, such as a \nrefrigerator or a commercial oven or something, for his restaurant. \nThey just stopped him and took his money. It took him years to get it \nback. He only got it back because the Institute for Justice defended \nhim in getting it back. But it turns justice on its head because he was \nbasically considered to be guilty until he could prove himself \ninnocent.\n  Realize, then, that people like this are sometimes being picked up \nbecause of something called suspicious activity reports. Suspicious \nactivity reports make your bank into a policeman or policewoman. When \nyou deposit things, they are obligated to report you to the government. \nDoes it sound something like ``1984''? Does it sound like you have \ninformants out there everywhere--see something, say something; that \nyour banker is going to call the government if you put cash into the \nbank?\n  The burden should always be on the government to prove you are guilty \nof something. You should never be convicted and you should never be \npunished without there first being a trial, without there first being \nevidence, without there first being a trial with a lawyer, with a \nverdict.\n  Some of this has gone into the war on drugs. The war on drugs has a \nlot of problems. But part of it has been the abuse of our civil \nliberties. Also, part of the war on drugs is that there has been a \ndisparate racial outcome. What do I mean by that? There have been \ninstances where--if you look at the statistics, three out of four \npeople in prison are Black or Brown and are there for nonviolent drug \nuse. But if you look at the surveys and you ask yourselves: Are White \nkids using drugs the same as Black kids, it is equal. White kids are 80 \npercent of the public. How do we get the reverse for 80 percent of the \npopulation in jail is Black and Brown? It is a problem. If we can't \nfigure it out, you are going to have to continue to realize why people \nare unhappy.\n\n  If you want to know why there is unhappiness in some of our cities, \nyou should read The New Yorker. About 3 or 4 months ago they did a \nstory about Kalief Browder. Kalief Browder was a 16-year-old Black kid \nfrom the Bronx. He lives in a poor situation. His family had no money, \nand he had been in trouble before.\n  But he was arrested, and he was sent to Rikers Island--16 years old, \narrested, sent to Rikers Island. His bail was $3,000. His family \ncouldn't come up with $3,000. He was kept for 3 years without a trial. \nAt least some of it was in solitary confinement.\n  He tried to commit suicide. Can you imagine how he must feel? Can you \nimagine how his parents must feel? Can you imagine how his friends \nfeel, the kids he went to high school with. Do you think they think \njustice is occurring in our country?\n  We have to be careful we don't let slip away who we are in the \nprocess of all of this fight against terrorism, all of this fight \nagainst drugs, because what happens is people take things that are bad. \nTerrorism is bad, drugs are bad. But we take this fight about something \nthat is bad, we forget about the process of law, we forget about the \nrule of law, and we forget who we are in the process.\n  But if you want to know why people are unhappy in some of our big \ncities, you want to see that unhappiness in the street, it is because \nsome people don't think they are getting justice. I, frankly, agree \nwith them. I think there isn't justice in our country when this occurs.\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\n  Originally, we had the Constitution. Then after 9/11 we got the \nPATRIOT Act. The biggest change between the Constitution, which \nprovided protection for us from people, bad people, for 200 years or \nmore--the biggest difference is we changed the standard on how we would \narrest people or how we would give out warrants.\n  I remember having this debate about 3 years ago when we talked about \nthe PATRIOT Act. I was walking along talking to another Senator, and he \nwas alarmed that the PATRIOT Act would expire at midnight. What would \nwe do?\n  And I was like: Couldn't we, for just a couple of hours, you know, \nlive under the Constitution?\n  I mean we did for 200 years, for goodness' sake. We have all kinds of \ntools. There is almost no judge in the land that is going to turn down \na warrant. The FISA warrants, the ones they give for security, 99.9 \npercent of them are approved.\n  Couldn't we give out warrants? They said it takes too long. Computers \nwork in the blink of an eye. In the blink of an eye, if John Smith is \nthought to be a terrorist and he called 100 people, in the blink of an \neye, I can look at the 100 on the list and I can say: What is the \nevidence that some on the list look suspicious or any of them from a \nforeign country or any of them on another list from somebody calling \nfrom a foreign country.\n  There are ways to look at this where we would simply then get a \nwarrant for the next hop and the next hop and the next hop. There is no \nreason we can't catch terrorists the same way we catch other bad people \nin society by using the Constitution.\n  Initially, the government had to show evidence that you were an agent \nof a foreign power, but this is no longer true. Now all you have to do \nis make a broad assertion that the arrest is related to an ongoing \nterrorism investigation.\n  The problem in the FISA Court is that when they take you to this \ncourt, it is secret. You don't get your own lawyer, and basically the \ngovernment says to the FISA Court judge: Oh, yes, it is related to an \ninvestigation--but I don't believe they are forced to show that it is \nrelating to an investigation. In some ways, I think we have gone too \nfar because what you end up having is you have people who are saying it \nis related, but the question is, Is there any evidence that there is a \nrelation to it and how could there be a relationship of everybody in \nAmerica to an investigation?\n  We also often have given gag orders, and this is one of the big \ncomplaints of the Internet companies. They get order after order after \norder, a national security letter. They get all of these suspicionless \nwarrants, and then they are told they can't talk about it or they will \ngo to jail. There are some people who got gag warrants who were \nlibrarians and for a decade or more were not allowed to talk to anybody \nto say that they had received this warrant.\n  The American Civil Liberties Union has written that the PATRIOT Act \n``violates the Fourth Amendment,'' which says the government cannot \nconduct a search without obtaining a warrant and showing probable cause \nto believe that a person has committed or will commit a crime.\n  The ACLU goes on to say that it ``violates the First Amendment's \nguarantee of free speech by prohibiting the recipients of search orders \nfrom telling others [these are the gag orders] about those orders, even \nwhere there is no real need for secrecy.''\n  These are the gag orders. They also say that it ``violates the First \nAmendment by effectively authorizing the FBI to launch investigations \nof American citizens in part for exercising their freedom of speech.'' \nNow, they went back in and they wrote the rules and said: Oh, you are \nnot supposed to do it if it violates someone's freedom of speech. But \nthe bottom line is that the opening we have given to the intelligence \ncommunity is so wide that there are, for all practical purposes, no \nlimitations on the gathering of your information.\n  In the Maryland v. Smith case, we kind of get to the point where we \nhave said that telephone conversations are protected, but we have said \ntrace-and-trap and pen register, where they collect your data by phone \ncalls, is not. The problem is--and this is a problem that needs to be \ncorrected by the courts--at this point they are essentially \nnonexistent. There are no protections in the court for any kind of \nwarrant that has to be gotten for any kind of metadata.\n  The FBI need not show probable cause or even reasonable suspicion of \ncriminal activity. It must only certify to a judge, without having to \nprove it, that such a warrant would be relevant to an ongoing \ninvestigation.\n  Also, typically in the past, when we gave warrants for wiretaps, they \nwere sorted to entities. You kind of had to name the entities. But now \nwe are giving the ability to collect data, pen register, trace-and-trap \ndata on your phone calls nationwide. This is a severe departure from \nwhat we had had in the past because typically warrants were given under \na judge's jurisdiction, so within a region. But now we have a blanket \norder that says we can collect any of your phone records, anywhere, \nanytime, across the whole country. This goes against the history of the \nway we have had juris prudence.\n  We talk a lot about phone data but your emails are in there too. \nInterestingly, your emails, after 6 months, have no protection at all. \nSo any email you have on your computer, after 6 months, has no \nprotection at all.\n  Up to 6 months, there is a little bit of protection, but the \ngovernment is allowed to look at--without a probable cause warrant--is \nable to look at whom you are communicating with and the header on the \nsubject line. The government is also able to look at, through metadata, \nthe Web sites you visit.\n  You can see how various groups would say that might be an \ninfringement of their First Amendment because let's say the government \nnow knows I go to Electronic Frontier Foundation or I go to EPIC or I \ngo to ACLU. I am concerned with civil liberties. Am I a potential \nproblem to the government? I am concerned and I am a critic of the \ngovernment. Is it a problem the government now knows what Web sites I \ngo to and that I am concerned with this?\n  Now, if the government would hear--they would say: No, that is not \nwhat we are doing.\n  But the other part of the question is maybe not yet, maybe not now, \nbut you can also squelch and severely restrict First Amendment \npractices if just simply the fear of the government looking at it might \nchange my behavior. There is all the evidence, there have been surveys, \nsaying that 20, 25 percent of people doing things online are changing \ntheir behavior because they are afraid of the government.\n  The government argues that the list of Web sites and Web site \naddresses is simply transactional data, but I think there is much more \nyou can garner from this data.\n  The PATRIOT Act that is due to expire is just three sections. \nInterestingly, the complaints that I have are a lot over section 215, \nwhich the government claims is their justification for collecting all \nof your phone records. Now, the courts have said otherwise. The appeals \ncourt said last week that the business records do not give them the \nauthority to collect your records. In fact, the courts have been very \nspecific that it is illegal.\n  The President is currently ignoring the court, and the President \ncontinues to collect your phone data, all of your phone data, all of \nthe time, as much as they can get. They have not changed any of their \nbehavior, that I know of, since it was declared to be illegal.\n  Some of the changes--I would repeal the whole thing. I would repeal \nthe whole PATRIOT Act. But some of the changes that I would favor, if \nwe were allowed to change it, if we could get a consensus in this body \nthat would mirror the consensus that I think is in America--once you \nget outside the beltway of Washington and you go back into America and \nyou ask people are they for this, the vast majority of people think the \ngovernment shouldn't collect all of their phone records all of the \ntime.\n  But there are some changes we could make. I think the first thing we \nought to do is not replace this system but basically say we are not \ngoing to collect data in bulk, that we are not going to collect your \nphone records, your credit card information, your emails, and where you \ngo on the Web. We are not going to collect that in bulk.\n  I think we could change the PATRIOT Act to say we are only going to\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\ncollect data that has to do with someone who is suspicious, that we \nhave presented some suspicion to a judge, and that the judge said: This \nis probable cause.\n  The standard is not that hard. It is hard for me to imagine, in fact, \na judge saying no. Judges always say yes. If at 3 in the morning there \nis a murder somewhere inside a house in DC, what do you think the odds \nare that when the police call for the warrant that the judge will say \nno? Odds are most of us want the judge to give permission. But it is \nthe checks and balances that we want so we don't have police who \noperate on bias or bigotry or religious discrimination. We want the \npeople to be bound by the rule of law.\n  It is kind of interesting, because you will hear Republicans \nsometimes give lip service to the rule of law. But in giving lip \nservice to the rule of law, what happens is they seem to forget the \nwhole idea of privacy. They are for it in economic transactions but not \nso much with regard to personal liberty.\n  The New York Times has written and talked about some of the economic \neffects of this. In an article by Scott Shane a couple of years ago, he \ntalks about the idea that foreign citizens, many of whom rely on \nAmerican companies for email Internet services, are concerned about \ntheir privacy.\n  Now you can say you don't care about foreigners, and they don't get \nthe same standard as we get, so you can understand maybe there is going \nto be a lower standard. But realize, if we are going to say the \nstandard is quite a bit different and that there is no protection for \nanybody's data on the Internet, realize that standard is going to scare \npeople in other countries away from our stuff. It is going to scare \npeople away from our email companies. It is going to scare people away \nfrom our search engines.\n  I think if you would talk to any of these companies out there--and \nsome of these companies are some of the greatest success stories in our \ncountry--if you think of the Internet revolution and you think of how \nAmerica has really led, America has been the leader. We have created \nhundreds of thousands of jobs, billions of dollars of profit. In our \nzealousness to grab up every bit of information and in our zealousness \nto ignore, basically, the Constitution, we are grabbing up so much \nstuff we are scaring people to death. There has already been billions \nof dollars lost to North American companies because of this, because \nEuropeans, Asians, they don't want our stuff anymore. They don't want \nthings with our hardware. They don't want to deal with our services \nbecause they are fearful the U.S. Government is looking at all of their \ntransactions.\n  The government is pretty clueless over this. Recently, one of the \nmembers of President Obama's administration came out--in fact, several \nmembers--complaining about encryption. They are like: Well, you know, \nwe are going to maybe have some laws to prevent these companies from \nencrypting things. It is like: Don't you get it? Don't you get why \ncompanies--the encryption is a response to government. The encryption \nis a response to a government that has run amok basically collecting \nour information, collecting all of our information. So if you are an \nAmerican Internet company, if you are an American search engine or an \nAmerican email company, what do you think you are saying? You are \nsaying: The only way I am getting Europeans back, the only way I am \ngetting Asians back is to say I am going to protect them from my \ngovernment.\n\n  Isn't that a sad state of affairs?\n  People say: Well, how will you get terrorists if everything is \nencrypted?\n  Edward Snowden was using an encrypted email server, and the company \nthat was housing him--that was specifically the genre of their \nbusiness. They had a business that was encrypted because some people \nwant to be private for a lot of different reasons, many of them \nlegitimate--business, legal, personal reasons. But, anyway, when they \ncame to get Edward Snowden's email, they didn't ask just to get his \nemail; they said they wanted the encryption keys for the entire \nbusiness.\n  See, this is the problem. You have to realize there are zealots who \ndon't seem too concerned with your privacy rights. Imagine what they \nare going to do if they say to Apple: We don't want just the encryption \nfor you to let us in one time to see John Smith, who we think is a \nterrorist; we want you to let us in all of your products. If they force \na good company like Apple to do that, who in the world would want \nanything from Apple anywhere in the world? There is a danger that we \nwill destroy great American companies by forcing this surveillance into \ntheir products.\n  (Mr. TOOMEY assumed the Chair.)\n  Senator Wyden has also made a good point. If the government is going \nto mandate backdoor access to the code source and the government is \ngoing to say that Facebook or Google has to let them in a backdoor, \nthat is a window, that is a breach of the wall, it is a breach of \nprotection.\n  Senator Wyden and others have made a good point. He said: If you do \nthat, you will be actually weakening these companies to attacks of \ncyber security because if somebody can get in, somebody else who is \nsmart can get in as well.\n  So there is a danger to letting the government in.\n  There are dozens and dozens of these programs. The NSA has something \ncalled the Dishfire database. It stores years and years of text \nmessages from around the world. That might be fine except for it ends \nup trapping people who are also American citizens as well. It ends up \ntracking and trapping purely domestic texts that are retransmitted \noutside the country.\n  They have a program called Tracfin that collects and accumulates \ngigabytes of credit card purchases. I don't know--for some reason, I am \nmore appalled by the credit card purchases than I am the phone because \nI think of all the stuff you can buy with your credit card and what it \nindicates about you.\n  With phones--you can find out a lot with people's phone records. When \nthe Stanford students looked at phone records, they found that 85 \npercent of the time they could tell your religion. The vast majority of \nthe time, they could tell your doctors. The vast majority of the time, \nthey could tell what disease you had. The vast majority of the time, \nthe government can then also connect you through social networking and \ntell an extraordinary amount about you.\n  With a credit card, it is even more explicit than that. They can tell \nif you drink, if you smoke, and how much, what magazines you buy, what \nbooks you read, what medicines you take. All that is on your credit \ncard. And we are more and more that type of society. We are less and \nless a society of cash and more and more a society where everything is \non paper. That should worry us. It should worry us that the government \nhas access to all of our records all of the time. It should concern us \nthat the government also says, when you ask them--and this is an \nimportant point--that your records, when held by a third party, are not \nprotected at all. It is debatable whether that is true. I think it \nneeds to be looked at again by the court, and I think there are those \nwho will, in the court, say your third-party records are. The Maryland \ndecision was 6 to 3.\n  Justice Marshall felt your third-party records should be protected. \nHe specifically mentioned that there was a potential stifling effect \nfor association, there was a potential stifling effect for speech, and \nhe was quite concerned that the government really should have a warrant \nto look at your records.\n  My hope is that someday the Maryland v. Smith case will be relegated \nto the dustbin of history, into the same dustbin in which we put \nOlmstead. In Olmstead, they said you couldn't have any protection for \nyour phone records. It went on for 40 years. I think we still live with \nsome of that because we have trained and taught the phone companies not \nto be great advocates for our privacy, and there doesn't appear to be \nseen a great deal of fighting on the part of the phone companies in \nadvocating for us. Some of the Internet companies have begun to step \nup. But I would like to see both phone companies and Internet companies \nstand up and say: We are not going to do it. We are not going to give \nyou access to us, and you will have to take us all the way to the \nSupreme Court.\n  If they did, if there was unified resistance among the consumer and \namong the companies to say ``We are not going to let you have our data \nwithout a fight, and you are going to have to prove suspicion, and that \nyou\n\n[[Page S3125]]\n\nare going to have to get a specific warrant,'' I think then we might be \nable to get back to a more constitutional scenario.\n  Within the NSA, there has also been evidence of installing filters in \nthe facilities of Internet and telecommunication companies, serving \nthem with court orders, and building backdoors into their software and \nacquiring keys to break their encryption. If this becomes the norm, you \ncan see how people will flee American products, and people will say: I \nam not going to use American things. There is an enormous, beyond-\nimagination economic punishment to our country that is occurring now \nand going to continue and worsen if we don't wise up and send a signal.\n\n  So for those in this body who say: We need to collect more \ninformation. We are not getting enough information. Warrants be damned. \nI don't care what they do. Take all my information, get as much as you \nwant--those people will have to explain why they are destroying an \nAmerican industry and why people around the world are going to say: We \nare alarmed at that, and we want some protection. If we are going to \nuse American products, if we are going to use American email, we want \nto know there is not going to be indiscriminate collection of our \ninformation.\n  Bill Binney was probably or is probably one of the highest ranking \nwhistleblowers from the NSA. The things he has to say should disturb us \nbecause he probably knows more about this than any of us will ever \nknow. Bill Binney said that without new leadership--this is in our \nintelligence agencies--new laws and top-to-bottom reform, the NSA will \nrepresent a threat of turnkey totalitarianism. The capability to turn \nits awesome power--now directed mainly against other countries--will \nnow be turned on the American public.\n  Originally, all of these intelligence forays were to get foreigners. \nWe lowered the standard, saying: Well, they do not live here. These are \npotentially terrorists, and so we are going to have a lower standard.\n  They started out as foreign searches. In fact, the NSA was originally \nintended to search for foreigners and to search the information of \nforeigners. And I am not opposed to that. In fact, I was on one of the \nSunday morning programs this week, and they asked: Well, are you for \neliminating the NSA?\n  I said: Of course not. I am for the NSA. I want the NSA to do \nsurveillance that will help to protect us from attack.\n  Not only am I for surveillance, I am for looking as deep as it takes. \nBut I want some suspicion. I want suspicion that this person--that \nthere is some evidence against this John Doe. You don't have to prove \nthey are guilty; you just have to have something that points toward \nthem being suspicious. You then go to the judge, and the judge says: \nHere is a warrant. And if there is evidence the people he called is \nsuspicious, go back to the judge and get another warrant. Go deeper and \ndeeper. There is no reason why this couldn't be done nearly \ninstantaneously. There is no reason why it couldn't be done 24 hours a \nday. And there is no reason why we can't have security and the \nconstitution as well.\n  This battle has not been just about records; it has also been about \nanother key part of the Bill of Rights, which is the right to a trial \nby jury, the right to due process, the right of habeas corpus. The \nFifth and Sixth Amendments I see together as sort of the amendments \nthat are with regard to your person and with regard to whether you are \ntreated justly by your government.\n  As we became fearful of terrorists, we said: Well, we are just going \nto capture people and we will just hold them indefinitely. It is one \nthing to catch someone on a battlefield in a foreign land shooting at \nus--and I have said repeatedly that people in battle don't get due \nprocess, but people outside of battle, particularly American citizens, \nshould. In some of these cases, we are talking about American citizens \naccused of a crime--perhaps terrorism--who are caught in our country. \nYet, we are going to say: Well, they do not really deserve trials. They \ndo not deserve lawyers.\n  In fact, and I find this really hard to believe, one Senator said \nrecently: Well, when they ask you for a judge, just drone them. Ha-ha.\n  The same guy said: Well, when they ask you for a lawyer, you just \ntell them to shut up.\n  About 10 years ago, Richard Jewell was thought to be the Olympic \nBomber. Everybody said he did it. The TV convicted him within minutes. \nEverybody said he was the Olympic Bomber. He fit the profile: He wore \nglasses, he was an introvert, he had a backpack, and he seemed very \nhelpful. Somehow, that was the profile. Everybody said he did it. The \nonly problem is, he didn't do it.\n  So here he was accused of being a terrorist, of exploding something, \ndoing something terrible and killing innocent people. And I think to \nmyself, if he had been a Black man in the South in 1920, what would \nhave happened to him? Or if he had been any American in this century if \nthe people who believe in no jurisprudence were really in charge. We \nshould be afraid of ever letting these people get in charge of our \ngovernment, because the thing is that Richard Jewell was innocent.\n  People say: Well, these aren't just American citizens, they are enemy \ncombatants, and we don't give any kind of jurisprudence--no judges or \nlawyers for these people. They are enemy combatants.\n  Well, it kind of begs the question, doesn't it? Who gets to decide \nwho is an enemy combatant and who is an American citizen? Are we really \nso frightened and so easily frightened that we would give up a \nthousand-year history, the Magna Carta, even before we had juries--even \nin the Greek and Roman times, we had juries. Are we really willing to \ngive that up and give people a classification that the government \nassesses them that cannot be challenged, where people don't get a \nlawyer, they do not get presented to a judge and told why they are \nbeing held, and we would hold them forever?\n  This was the debate over indefinite detention. The response I got \nduring the debate was: Well, yeah, we would keep them. We would send \nthem to Guantanamo Bay.\n  An American citizen?\n  Sure, if they are dangerous.\n  Kind of begs the question, doesn't it? Who gets to decide who is \ndangerous and who is not?\n  When this finally made it to the Supreme Court, though, whether you \ncould hold an American citizen, the Supreme Court rejected the \nadministration's claim that those labeled ``enemy combatants'' were not \nentitled to judicial review. It took years and years to finally have \nthe Supreme Court tell people that the Bill of Rights was still in \neffect, that if you are an American citizen accused of a crime in our \ncountry, no matter how heinous, you do have a right to a trial by jury, \nyou do have a right to a lawyer, you do have the right of habeas \ncorpus, you do have all of the rights of an American citizen. And no \none can arbitrarily take those away from you. And if you don't think \nthat is potentially a problem, think of the South in the 1920s. Think \nof what would have happened if Richard Jewell were a Black man in the \n1920s. He might not have lived the day. Think if Richard Jewell had \nbeen a Japanese American during World War II, when we decided that the \nright of habeas corpus didn't apply to you if your parents were from \nJapan or if your grandparents were from Japan.\n\n  There was an experiment I remember, I think in college--a psychology \nexperiment. They put a person in a room, and they said: This person has \ninformation, and we are going to shock them just a little bit. Here is \nthe dial. You get to decide.\n  They wanted to ask how high people would turn up the dial. It was \npretty scary--a good amount of people you would imagine are normal, \nrespectable people--how high they would turn the dial to shock somebody \nor to torture somebody. So we think that wouldn't happen, but it does.\n  Any time we make an analogy to horrific people in history--to \nMussolini or Hitler--people say: You are exaggerating; it is a \nhyperbole. Maybe it is. Particularly, to accuse anybody of that is a \nhorrific analogy, and I am not doing that.\n  But what I would say is that if you are not concerned that democracy \ncould produce bad people, I don't think you are really thinking this \nthrough too much. And if you are not concerned about procedural \nprotections--procedural protections are how evidence is\n\n[[Page S3126]]\n\ngathered, how evidence is taken from your house, what rules the police \nhave to obey.\n  People don't quite get this. We don't have a mature discussion on \nthis. Any time we try to say that this should stop and that someone \ncould be a bad policeman, the media dumb it down and say that we are \nsaying policemen are bad. No, it is the opposite. Some 98 or 99 percent \nof the police are good. In fact, in the general public it is pretty \nclose to that.\n  The thing is that we have the rules in place for the exception to the \nrule. We have these procedures in place because maybe it isn't tomorrow \nthat we decide that we are going to round up all the Japanese Americans \nagain and put them in internment camps, but maybe next time it is Arab \nAmericans. So we have to be concerned with this because we don't know \nwho the next group is that is unpopular.\n  The Bill of Rights isn't for the prom queen. The Bill of Rights isn't \nfor the high school quarterback. The Bill of Rights is for the least \namong us. The Bill of Rights is for minorities. The Bill of Rights is \nfor those who have minority opinions. The Bill of Rights is for those \nwho are oddballs, those who aren't accepted, those who have \nunconventional thinking.\n  If we are so frightened that we are going to throw all the rules out \nand we are just going to say that here is my liberty, take it, and here \nare my records; I didn't do anything wrong, so I don't mind if you look \nat all my records; if you say the standard will now be that if I have \nnothing to hide, I have nothing to fear and look at everything I do, \nthen there will be a time and there will be a danger that, in giving up \nyour freedom, in giving up your privacy, you will find that the world \nyou live in is not the world you intended.\n  There have been good folks within the National Security Agency who \nhave talked about and have pointed out that we have gone too far. Bill \nBinney was one of those. He was a high-ranking NSA official who decided \nthat they had gone too far.\n  There was an interview--it has probably been 1 year or 2 years ago--\nwith Bill Binney that was in ``Frontline.''\n  One of the first questions was:\n\n       What a lot of people in government will say is that you \n     don't understand; we're still at war. Remember we lost 3,000 \n     people in 9/11. This is a very important program.\n\n  They talk about the warrantless collection of all records:\n\n       It has saved thousands of lives, as Cheney said at one \n     point. There are multiple plots that have been stopped \n     because of this program. You've got to be very careful about \n     what you wish for, because if you do, you might have another \n     attack, and you might have blood on your hands.\n\n  Fear.\n\n       What is your reaction to this question about the \n     effectiveness of what all this has been?\n\n  Binney replied:\n\n       First of all, they like to lump it in as one program and \n     say you can't cancel the program.\n\n  In fact, Binney was famous because he had been working on a program \nthat did investigate terrorists but protected American information and \ndeleted American information from incidental collection.\n  So he said:\n\n       That's false to begin with. It's multiple programs. The one \n     program that dealt with domestic spying was called Stellar \n     Wind.\n\n  Stellar Wind was one that was also created by Executive order and was \ndone without the permission of Congress before the PATRIOT Act.\n\n       They had the other foreign ones; you mentioned the names. \n     There were other names that were listed in the PRISM program \n     that was dealing with foreign intelligence. There were a \n     whole bunch of those programs, not just one.\n       So the point is you stop the intelligence, the domestic \n     intelligence program, period.\n\n  So Binney's opinion was--this is the guy who wrote a lot of the \noriginal programs. Bill Binney said he would continue gathering \ninformation on foreigners. This is a guy who worked for 30 years for \nthe NSA. He is not some dove who doesn't want to do anything about \nterrorists. Bill Binney worked for 30 years to develop the programs to \nhelp us catch terrorists, but he felt it wasn't proper or \nconstitutional to collect Americans' records without a warrant. He said \nif we get incidental records, destroy them; don't collect them.\n  He says:\n\n       Eliminate them. [The records of Americans are] irrelevant \n     to anything that--\n\n  The incidental collection--\n\n     is going on. All the terrorists would have been caught by the \n     process that we put in place for ThinThread--\n\n  ThinThread was a program they had before they went to the \nunconstitutional program--\n\n     which was looking and focusing in on the groups of \n     individuals that we already had identified and anybody in \n     close proximity to them in the social graph, plus anybody--\n     the other simple rules like anybody that was looking at \n     jihadi advocating sites. . . .\n\n  Et cetera.\n\n       That would get them all, and you didn't have to do the \n     collection of all this other data that requires all that \n     storage, transport of information to the storage, maintenance \n     of it, interrogation programs, all of that added expense that \n     they are incurring as a part of it over the last 10 years. \n     You wouldn't have any of that. . . .\n\n  Frontline then asks:\n\n       This problem of haystacks, how big a problem is that? Is \n     that what we've done, is we've created a situation where the \n     haystacks are bigger, and it's almost impossible to find?\n\n  This was Frontline's question. It is a question I have been asking, \nalso. If you collect all of Americans' records all of the time, if we \ncollect all of your phone records, can we possibly look at them?\n  Now, computers are getting better, but still there has to be a human \ninvolved. I think we are overwhelmed with data. At one time about a \nyear ago, I remember an article where I think they collected millions \nand millions of audio hours. They had just been collecting. They were \nvacuuming up everything. And I think they had only been able to listen \nto about 25 percent of it.\n  So the thing is that there is information that we need to get and we \nshould get.\n  When the Tsarnaev boy--the Boston Bomber--went to Chechnya, we needed \nto know that. We needed to continue to see if there was evidence that \nwe could take to a judge to continue to investigate him. So we do need \nsurveillance. But what we don't need is indiscriminate surveillance, \nand we don't need the haystack to get so big that we can never find the \nterrorist in the stack.\n  Binney responds:\n\n       Well, what it simply means is if you use the traditional \n     argument they say we're trying to find a needle in a \n     haystack, it doesn't help to make the haystack orders of \n     magnitude larger, because it makes it orders of magnitude \n     more difficult to find that needle in the haystack.\n\n  Frontline:\n\n       And is that what they've done?\n       Have we made that haystack so large that we are actually \n     having more trouble catching terrorists because we're \n     scooping up and swooping up all of America's data?\n\n  Binney:\n\n       That's what they've done. And now they're looking at things \n     like game playing and things like people doing that. I mean, \n     this is ridiculous. How relevant is that to anything?\n\n  Frontline:\n\n       But they say there're computers, and in Utah they're going \n     to be able to take all this stored data, and they're going to \n     be able to go through all of it, and they're going to be able \n     to connect the dots. Connect the dots--that's what everybody \n     wanted them to do after 9/11.\n\n  Bill Binney, former senior NSA:\n\n       See, that's always been possible. Before 9/11 we were doing \n     that. That was already happening. We already had that \n     program. That wasn't an issue at all. That's why we should \n     have picked this out from the beginning. We should have \n     implemented it, the ThinThread [program that they'd already \n     been working, the] connect-the-dots program on everything in \n     the world, but we didn't. That's why we failed. It wasn't a \n     matter of not having the program; it was a matter of not \n     implementing the program we had.\n\n  When 9/11 came, we gave medals to the heads of our intelligence \nagencies. No one was ever fired. Yet the 20th hijacker was caught a \nmonth in advance. Moussaoui was caught in Minnesota for trying to take \noff in planes but not land them. The FBI agent there wrote 70 letters \nto his superior trying to get a warrant. It wasn't that we had to dumb \ndown and take away the procedural protections of warrants. The warrant \nwasn't denied.\n  They would have a much stronger argument if they could say: We tried \nto catch the terrorists, but the judges kept saying no to warrants.\n  It is absolutely not true. They didn't ask the judge for warrants. So \nthe 70 requests in Washington sat at FBI Headquarters and weren't \nrequested.\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\n  We also had another hijacker in Arizona training to take planes off. \nOnce again, the FBI agent there was doing a great job in sending the \ninformation to Washington, and but people were not talking to each \nother. It had nothing to do with saying the Constitution is too strong, \nand we have to weaken the Constitution or we will never catch \nterrorists. It had nothing to do with that. But that is precisely the \nargument we have.\n  In the aftermath of 9/11, the PATRIOT Act was rushed to the floor--\nseveral hundred pages--and nobody read it. It didn't come out of--there \nwas one out of the committee. They didn't use that. They rushed a \nsubstitute to the floor, and no one had time to read it. But people \nvoted because they were fearful, and people said there could be another \nattack and Americans will blame me if I don't vote on this.\n  But we are now at a stage where we should say: Are we willing to give \nup our liberty for security?\n  Can you not have both? Can you not have the Constitution and your \nsecurity? I think you can.\n  Several agents other than Bill Binney have also said--several \nnational security officials--that the powers granted the NSA go far \nbeyond the expanded counterterrorism powers granted by Congress under \nthe PATRIOT Act.\n  The court now agrees with that. Any time someone tries to tell you \nthat metadata is meaningless, don't worry. It is just whom you call. It \nis just your phone records. It is not a big deal. Realize that we kill \npeople based on metadata. So they must be pretty darned certain that \nthey think they know something based on metadata.\n  So these are ostensibly or presumably terrorists that are being \nkilled. But what I would say is that if they are killing people based \non metadata, I would think you would want your own metadata pretty well \nprotected.\n  To give you an example of how Representatives are sometimes getting \nit right, in the House of Representatives, they have seen and responded \nto the people. Thomas Massie and Representative Lofgren introduced an \namendment to the Defense appropriation bill last year. This amendment \nwould have defunded the warrantless backdoor searches--what they are \ndoing through 702, which is an amendment to the FISA Act. This is where \nwe say we are investigating a foreigner, but the foreigner talks to an \nAmerican who talks to other Americans, and it ripples out into enormous \namounts of incidental information. The information from 702, when you \nanalyze it--9 out of 10 bits of information that are collected--is not \nabout the person we have targeted. They are incidentally collected \nabout other individuals.\n  But when Representative Massie and Representative Lofgren introduced \ntheir amendment to defund the backdoor searches and to tell the CIA and \nNSA that they cannot mandate that companies give a backdoor entry into \ntheir product, the amendment passed 293 to 123.\n  But just to show you that no good deed goes unpunished and just to \nshow you the arrogance of the body--the vast majority of people do not \nwant their phone records collected without warrant--what did they do \nwhen this passed 293 to 123? They stripped it out in secret in \nconference committee and it was gone. The reason it was gone is like \neverything else around here. You wonder why your government is \ncompletely broken. We lurch from deadline to deadline, and it is on \npurpose really. We do deadline to deadline because we have to go. It is \nspring break. We are going to be late for spring break. We have to go, \nso we have to finish this up before we go.\n  It is how the budget is done. No one ever votes on whether we are \ngoing spend X or Y. They put the whole budget into 2,000 pages. Nobody \nreads it. It is placed on our desk that day. Nobody has any idea what \nis in it. None of your concerns about your Government are ever \naddressed. We just pass, boom, the whole thing and it is out the door. \nIt is the same way with these kinds of things. Because there is a \ndeadline--and this amendment was passed 293 to 123, saying that we \nshouldn't fund these illegal searches and that we should stop the bulk \ncollection records--it is passed overwhelmingly. Yet, in secret, \nsomehow it is taken back out of the bill and never becomes law.\n  Now, while I don't agree completely or really at all with the reform \nthat has come forward out of the House, it is at least evident they are \nlistening. They have a bill that would end the bulk collection of \nrecords to replace it with, I think, maybe another form of bulk \ncollection, but it still passed overwhelmingly, 330-some-odd votes. But \ndo you know what you hear when it gets over here? They say the Senate \nis distanced more from the people and not as responsive--absolutely \ntrue and sometimes to the detriment of the public. Because the thing is \nthat while it is overwhelmingly popular with the American people that \nwe should not be collecting your phone records without a warrant--\nwithout a warrant with your name on it, and the House has recognized \nthis and passed something overwhelmingly to try to fix it--the first \nthing I hear over here from people is, Well, we are not collecting \nenough of your phone records. They are disappointed that the government \nisn't getting--they have access and they claim they can get it, they \ngain access to everything, but the Government really is not collecting \nall of it, so people are very disappointed; they want to collect more.\n  The American people say: Enough is enough. We want our privacy \nprotected. We want the Government to take less of our records. Congress \nrecognizes that--the House of Representatives. Then it comes over to \nthe Senate, and the Senate says: Oh, my goodness. We want to collect \nmore of your records. We do not think we are getting enough into your \nprivacy. We do not think we have completely trashed the Bill of Rights \nenough; let's try to gain more of your records.\n  One of the other things the Massie-Lofgren amendment did--that did \npass over there--was to get rid of and say that no funds would go to \nmandate or request that a person alter his product or service to permit \nelectronic surveillance.\n  This is what is going on. What is pretty nefarious and antithetical \nto freedom is that our Government is telling companies like Facebook \nand Google and these other companies--they are forcing them to let the \ngovernment have access into their products.\n  Everybody knows this is going on. It is no secret, and it is killing \nthese companies in their worldwide market because non-Americans don't \nwant to use their email. They are afraid the government has forced \ntheir way into all their transmissions.\n  There is currently another bill in the House put in by Representative \nPocan, Representative Massie, Representative Grayson, and \nRepresentative McGovern that would repeal the entire thing. It repeals \nthe PATRIOT Act and FISA amendments of 2008, permits the courts to \nappoint experts, permits the courts to have appeal. It basically tries \nto make our intelligence courts more like an American court or American \njurisprudence.\n  EPIC is the Electronic Privacy Information Center. They talk some \nabout these national security letters I mentioned earlier. There are \nnow hundreds of thousands of national security letters. These are \nletters that are warrants. They are not signed by judges. They are \nactually signed by the police. This goes against the fundamental \nprecept of our jurisprudence. The fundamental aspect was that we \ndivided police from the judiciary. It is supposed to be a check and \nbalance. In case the local policemen had some sort of bias, they always \nhad to call somebody else. It is not perfect, but it is a lot better \nthan not having a check and balance.\n  When we got to NSL--this comes out of the PATRIOT Act--they start out \nwith a few thousand, and they grow and grow. Now there are hundreds of \nthousands of them. But realize that the national security letter is \nsimilar to what we fought the Revolution over. We fought the Revolution \nover writs of assistance, which are basically generalized warrants, but \nthey were also written by British soldiers. We were offended that a \nsoldier would come into our house with a self-written permit.\n  A lot of the reaction and the reason we wrote the Bill of Rights the \nway we did is that we were concerned with British abuses. We were \nconcerned with the idea of general warrants. So when we wrote the \nFourth Amendment, we\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\nsaid that it had to be specific to an individual. We said you had to \nname the individual. That is one of the real problems with the bulk \ncollection of records. They are not really based on suspicion of an \nindividual because basically the government is collecting all of your \nrecords, indiscriminately.\n  The government is not even obeying the loose restrictions they put in \nplace. The Constitution says you have to have probable cause. You have \nto present some evidence to a judge. You don't have to prove that they \nare guilty, but you have to have enough evidence that the judge says it \nlooks like that person could be guilty of a crime.\n  So with the PATRIOT Act we lowered that standard and then lowered it \nagain. For collecting information under the PATRIOT Act, all you have \nto do is say that the information you want is relevant to an \ninvestigation. When this got to the court, the court basically said \nthis is absurd. So 2 weeks ago, the court just below the Supreme Court \nsaid it is absurd to say that every American's phone record is somehow \nrelevant to a terrorist investigation. They said it takes the meaning \nof the word ``relevant'' and basically destroys any concept that the \nword has meaning at all.\n  The PATRIOT Act went to a much lower standard, not probable cause but \njust that it might be relevant to an investigation. And even with that \nlower standard, the court said that is absurd.\n  How does the President respond? The President responds by doing \nnothing. The President could end this program tomorrow. Every one of \nyour phone records is being collected without suspicion, without \nrelevance. In contradiction to even what the PATRIOT Act says, your \nrecords are being collected. The second highest court in the land has \nsaid this is illegal, and the President does nothing. The President \nsaid to Congress, Oh, yes; I will do it if Congress will do it.\n  It is a bit disingenuous. We did not start the program. The authors \nof the PATRIOT Act had no idea this was going on. The PATRIOT Act, \naccording to the court, does not even justify this.\n  We are looking at telephone records. We are looking at email records. \nEPIC, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, has another big \ncomplaint about this; that people were put forward and then told that \nthey could not even talk about the fact that they had been given a \nwarrant. They were threatened with 5 years in prison for even \nmentioning that they had been served a warrant.\n  This, I think, is an obvious contradiction of the First Amendment. We \nhave legislation that contradicts the Fourth and the First Amendments.\n  The national security letters in 3 years, from 2003 to 2005--these \nare the warrants that are written by FBI agents, not written by a \njudge--there were 143,000 warrants given out in our country to \nAmericans with a warrant written by the police.\n  The New York Times has talked about this, and Charlie Savage in a \nreport last year reported that the Justice Department had to apologize \nto a Federal appeals court for providing inaccurate information about a \ncentral case challenging the unconstitutionality.\n  Now, what is truth and what isn't truth. When you go to a court, it \nis like when your kids fight; there are two sides to everything. One \nchild has one argument, and the other child has the other argument. The \ntruth is listening to both sides and trying to figure out what the \ntruth is. The court is no different. But in these courts, you are only \nhearing one side and only the government represents their case.\n  The government says that we want all the phone records because they \nare relevant. No one stands up on the other side and says: I object. \nThat is one of the reforms Senator Wyden and I have talked about, \nhaving somebody represent the accused, somebody to stand up and say \nmaybe all the phone records in the country are not relevant, maybe they \nare not relevant to an investigation. It would be absurd to say every \nAmerican's records would be relevant.\n  Probably no one in America knows more about this subject than Senator \nWyden, who I see has come to the floor. Senator Wyden knows more about \nthis because he has been on the Intelligence Committee for several \nyears.\n  There are two tiers within Congress. There is a great deal of \ninformation that I have never been told. Even though I was elected to \nrepresent Kentucky, I am not allowed to know a lot of things that \nhappen in the Intelligence Committee. The downside for Senator Wyden is \nhe is allowed to know more but then he is not allowed to talk about it, \nwhich makes it a problem. It is hard to have dissent in our country. If \nI am not given information, how can I complain about it? And if the \nSenator from Oregon is given information, he is not allowed to complain \nabout it.\n  These are the things we struggle with in trying to find truth.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question, \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. It is good to be back on the floor \nwith him once again on this topic.\n  As we have indicated, this will not be the last time we are back on \nthe floor.\n  My colleague has made a number of very important points already. I \nwas especially pleased when my colleague brought to light something \nthat is little known; that the Attorney General of the United States is \ninterested in--excuse me--the FBI Director is interested in requiring \ncompanies to build weaknesses into their products. In other words, we \nhave had companies interested in encryption, as my colleague mentioned. \nWhat happened as a result of that encryption, they had a chance to \nstart getting back the confidence of consumers, both in the United \nStates and worldwide--and then the FBI Director has been interested in, \nin effect, allowing companies to build a backdoor into their systems. \nThis, once again, kind of defies commonsense because the keys will not \njust be out there for the good guys. They will also be available to the \nbad guys.\n  I am very pleased that my colleague from Kentucky highlighted one \nparticular new development in this debate, and I have sought as a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee for some time to come up with an \napproach that once again demonstrates that security and liberty are not \nmutually exclusive. But we are certainly not going to have both, as my \ncolleague touched on in his statement, if the policy of the FBI \nDirector is to require companies to build a backdoor into their \nproducts--build weaknesses into their products.\n\n  Now, the Senator from Kentucky is very much aware that my staff and a \nnumber of Senators are currently working through a number of issues and \namendments related to the question of how we can pass trade legislation \nand get more family wage jobs for our people through exports. A number \nof us, myself specifically, have been concerned that the majority \nleader and other supporters of business as usual on bulk collection of \nall of these phone records would somehow try to take advantage of our \ncurrent discussions and try to, in effect, sneak through a motion to \nextend section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. As long as the Senator from \nKentucky has the floor, that cannot happen. My hope is that once our \ncolleagues have agreed on a path to go forward with job-creating, \nexport-oriented trade legislation, it will be possible to resume our \nwork on that very important bill.\n  In the meantime, my question for my colleague pertains to an issue \nthat he noted I have been at for some time. As my colleague knows, I \nhave been trying to end the bulk phone record collection program since \n2006, and the reason I have is because this bulk phone record \ncollection program is a Federal human relations database.\n  When the Federal Government knows whom you have called, when you have \ncalled, and often where you have called from, which is certainly the \ncase if somebody calls from a land line and someone has a phonebook, \nthe government has a lot of private and intimate information about you. \nIf the government knows that you called a psychiatrist three times, for \nexample, in 36 hours, twice after midnight, the government doesn't have \nto be listening to that call. The government knows a whole lot about \nwhat most Americans would consider to be very private.\n  This has been an important issue. My colleague from Kentucky has been \nan invaluable ally on this particular cause since he arrived in the \nSenate, and I just want to give a little bit more background and then \nget my colleague's reaction to this question.\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n  I have seen several of my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate \nand talk about why we ought to keep a bulk phone record collection, and \nthe statement has somehow been that this is absolutely key for strong \ncounterterror. That is a baffling assertion, I say to my colleague from \nKentucky, because even the Director of National Intelligence and the \nAttorney General are saying it is not. So what we have are Members of \nthe Senate saying that bulk collection--some of them--ought to be \npreserved in order to fight terror, and the Director of National \nIntelligence and the Attorney General, two individuals who are not \nexactly soft on terror, saying it is not.\n  If Senators, and those who might be following this debate, are \nseeking a more detailed analysis, I hope they will check out the very \nlengthy report on surveillance that was issued by the President's \nreview group. This group's members have some very impressive national \nsecurity credentials. These are not people who are soft on fighting \nterror. One of them was the Senior Counterterror Adviser to both \nPresident Clinton and President Bush and another served as Acting \nDirector of the CIA, and this review group--a review group led by \nindividuals with pristine antiterror credentials--said on page 104 of \ntheir report that ``the information contributed to terrorist \ninvestigations by the use of section 215 [bulk] telephony meta-data was \nnot essential to preventing attacks and could readily have been \nobtained in a timely manner using [individual] section 215 orders.''\n  What this distinguished group of experts said supports what the \nSenator from Kentucky is saying and what I and others have been saying \nfor some time.\n  The Senator from Kentucky pointed out my service on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I think Senator Feinstein and I are two of the five longest \nserving members in the committee's history. We didn't find out about \nbulk collection until it had been underway for quite some time because \nit was concealed from most members of the Intelligence Committee for \nseveral years. But given the fact that we began to see in 2006 and \nearly 2007 what is at stake, this has been a fight that has been going \non for 8 years.\n  An additional reason I appreciate the Senator from Kentucky being \nhere now is that for these 8 years and multiple reauthorizations, it \nhas always been the same pattern. It was almost like the night follows \nthe day. Those who were in favor of dragnet surveillance and those who \nwere in favor of the bulk collection program, in effect, wait until the \nvery last minute and then they say: Oh, my goodness. It is a dangerous \nworld. We have to continue this program just the way it is.\n  Well, I tell my colleague from Kentucky, and I know he shares my view \non this, that there is no question that it is a very dangerous world. \nAnybody who has served on the Intelligence Committee, as I have for \nmore than 14 years, and goes into those classified meetings on a weekly \nbasis, does not walk out of there without the judgment that it is a \nvery dangerous world. But what doesn't make sense is to be pursuing \napproaches that don't make us safer and compromise our liberties. That \nis what doesn't make sense.\n  Last year, along with my colleagues Senator Heinrich and Senator Mark \nUdall, I filed a brief in a case that was before the Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. It is an important court. It is one of the \nhighest courts in our country.\n  In the brief, we said we ``have reviewed this surveillance \nextensively and have seen no evidence that the bulk collection of \nAmericans' phone records has provided any intelligence of value that \ncould not have been gathered through means that caused far less harm to \nthe privacy interests of millions of Americans.''\n  What we are talking about, in effect, are conventional approaches \nwith respect to court orders and then there are emergency \ncircumstances. So when the government believes it has to act to protect \nthe American people, it can move quickly and then, in effect, come back \nand settle up later.\n  The conclusion we reached after reviewing bulk collection very \ncarefully was based on 8 years' worth of work, and of course we \nrecently had this court declare bulk collection to be illegal.\n  My first question is, Does the Senator from Kentucky agree there is \nno evidence that dragnet surveillance now makes America any safer?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, that is a great question, and I also think \nit is very difficult to prove these things one way or another \nsometimes. We are at a great disadvantage because a lot of times they \nhold all of the information. I think it was nothing short of miraculous \nthat you and others were able to investigate this and show that in \nreality all of these folks who they allege could have been caught would \nhave been caught through traditional surveillance and through \ntraditional warrants.\n  I think this is a pretty important point because they want us to live \nin fear and give up the Fourth Amendment, but it turns out even the \npractical argument is not an accurate one because it turns out that \nalmost always, if not always, the terrorists seem to be caught through \nsort of the normal channels of human intelligence, suspicion, and \nfinding out something about them that causes us to investigate them.\n  I, like the Senator from Oregon, do want to catch terrorists and I \nalso want to keep our freedom at the same time. I think it was a pretty \nimportant conclusion, not only by the review board but also by the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board as well, the review panel, \ntwo groups of folks from the administration.\n  I am also interested in hearing the Senator from Oregon talk about an \nop-ed he wrote which appeared in the Los Angeles Times in December. \nSenator Wyden wrote that building a backdoor into every cell phone, \ntablet or laptop means directly creating weaknesses that hackers and \nforeign governments can exploit.\n  I would be interested in entertaining a question concerning that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleague. I ask that my \ncolleague restate his question.\n  Mr. PAUL. This is on op-ed that was written by the Senator from \nOregon and appeared in the LA Times in December. The op-ed says that \nbuilding a backdoor into every cell phone, tablet or laptop means \ndeliberately creating weaknesses that hackers and foreign governments \ncan exploit.\n  I think expanding on that in the form of a question would help us to \nunderstand exactly what the Senator means by that.\n  Mr. WYDEN. What the Senator is asking about is a statement made by \nthe FBI Director, Mr. Comey. This is not some kind of hidden article. \nIt was on the front pages of all of our papers and really deserves, as \nmy colleague is suggesting, some consideration.\n  In fact, one of the last things I did as chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee--I had a relatively short tenure there in 2014--was \nto hold a workshop in Silicon Valley on this issue. The problem stems \nfrom the fact that with the NSA overreach taking a huge toll on our \ncompanies and the confidence that consumers, both here and around the \nworld, had in the privacy of their products, these companies said we \nhave to figure out a way to make sure consumers here and around the \nworld understand that we are going to protect their privacy. So they \ndecided to put in place products that had strong encryption. They felt \nthat was important to be able to assure their consumers that when they \nsold something, their privacy rights were protected. In doing so, of \ncourse, they also made it clear, as has always been the case, that when \nthe government believes an individual could put our Nation at risk, you \nget an individual court order, you use emergency circumstances, and you \ncould still get access to information.\n  The response by our government, which contributed mightily to the \nproblem by the NSA's overreach in the first place, was our government \nsaying: Nope. You are not going to be able to use that encryption to \nbring back the confidence that Americans and people around the world \nhave in your products. There were projections that these companies were \nalready losing billions and billions of dollars in terms of the \nconsequences of loss of privacy.\n  The response of the government was to say: We are looking at \nrequiring you to build weaknesses into your products and, in effect, \ncreate a backdoor so we can get easy entry.\n  (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\n  I know at townhall meetings at home in Oregon, I have talked about \nthe concept of our government requiring companies to build weaknesses \ninto their products. People just slap their foreheads. They say: What \nis that all about? It is your job to make sure we have policies that \nboth secure our liberty and keep us safe. It is not your job to tell \ncompanies to build weaknesses into their products.\n  In effect, you have to just throw up your hands when they say: We \ncan't do it, so the company ought to build weaknesses into the \nproducts.\n  As my colleague said, I pointed out that once you do that, it will \nnot just be the good guys who have the keys, it will be bad guys who \nhave the keys at a time when we are so concerned about cyber security.\n  I wish to ask my colleague one other question on one other topic he \nand I have spoken about at great length. Is the Senator from Kentucky \ntroubled by the fact that a number of high-ranking intelligence \nofficials have not been forthright in recent years with respect to this \nbulk collection and the collecting of data on millions or hundreds of \nmillions of Americans? As my colleague knows, I have been particularly \ntroubled by this.\n  I ask the question because my colleague and I have pointed out that \nwe have enormous admiration for the rank-and-file in the intelligence \nfield. These are individuals who day in and day out get up in the \nmorning and contribute enormously to the well-being of the American \npeople, and we have enormous respect for them. We are grateful to them. \nThey are patriots, and they serve us well every day. I personally do \nnot think they have been well-served by the fact that a host of high-\nlevel intelligence officials have not exactly been straight or \nforthright with the Congress and the American people on these issues.\n  I would be interested in the views of my colleague on this subject \nbecause we have discussed this at some length. I am glad to be able to \nput it in the context of making sure that Americans know that the two \nof us greatly respect the thousands of people who work in the \nintelligence field and serve us well and do and have done the things \nnecessary to apprehend and kill bin Laden but that we are concerned \nabout the question of the veracity, the forthrightness of some of the \nmembers of the intelligence community at the highest levels. What is \nthe reaction of my colleague to that?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think the vast majority of the intelligence community, as \nare the vast majority of policemen, good people. They are trying to do \nwhat is best for the country. They are patriotic people, and they are \nreally trying to do what is necessary within the confines of the law.\n  The issue is that the intelligence community has such vast power, and \na lot of it is secret power. So we have to have a great deal of trust \nin those who run the agency because we have entrusted them with such \nenormous power to look through information. Then, when they come to us \nand say, ``Well, you have to give up a little more liberty; you have to \ngive up a little bit more in order to get security,'' we have to trust \nthe information because they control all of the information they give \nus. And then we find--when we ask a high-ranking official in the \ncommittee whether they were doing bulk collection of data and the \nanswer was not true--they said they weren't doing something that they \nobviously were doing--it makes us distrust the whole apparatus.\n  I agree with the Senator from Oregon that the vast majority of law \nenforcement and the intelligence community are good people. They are \npatriotic. They want to stop terrorism, as we all do. But what we are \narguing about is the process and the law and the Constitution and \ntrying to do it within the confines of the Constitution. But when we \nhave someone at the very top who doesn't tell the truth in an open \nhearing under oath, that is very troubling and makes it difficult.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate my colleague's assessment on that issue. He \nknows that it was very troubling that in 2012 and in 2013, we just \nweren't able to get straight answers to this question of collecting \ndata on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.\n  My colleague will recall that the former NSA Director said that--he \nhad been to a conference--and that he was not involved in collecting \n``dossiers'' on millions of Americans. Having been on the committee at \nthat point for over a dozen years, I said: Gee, I am not exactly sure \nwhat a ``dossier'' means in that context.\n  So we began to ask questions, both public ones, to the extent we \ncould, and private ones, about exactly what that meant, and we couldn't \nget answers to those questions. We just couldn't get answers.\n  The Intelligence Committee traditionally doesn't have many open \nhearings. By my calculus, we probably get to ask questions in an open \nhearing for maybe 20 minutes, maximum, a year. So after months and \nmonths of trying to find out exactly what was meant, we felt it was \nimportant to ask the Director of National Intelligence exactly what was \nmeant by these ``dossiers'' and government collecting data and the \nlike. So at our open hearing, I said: I am going to have to ask the \nDirector of National Intelligence about this. And because I have long \nfelt that it was important not to try to trick people or ambush them or \nanything of the sort, we sent the question in advance to the head of \nnational intelligence. We sent the exact question: Does the government \ncollect any type of data at all on millions of Americans? We asked it \nso that he would have plenty of time to reflect on it. We waited to see \nif the Director would get back to us and say: Please don't ask it. \nThere has always been a kind of informal tradition in the Intelligence \nCommittee of being respectful of that. We didn't get that request, so I \nasked it. When I asked: Does the government collect any type of data at \nall on millions of Americans, the Director said no. I knew that wasn't \naccurate. That was not a forthright, straightforward, truthful answer, \nso we asked for a correction. We couldn't get a correction.\n\n  I would say to my colleague that since that time, the Director or his \nrepresentatives have given five different reasons why they responded as \nthey did, further raising questions in my mind, not with respect to the \nrank-and-file in the intelligence community--the thousands and \nthousands of hard-working members of the intelligence community my \ncolleague and I feel so strongly about and respect so greatly.\n  I wish to ask just one other question with respect to where we are at \nthis point and what is ahead. As long as the Senator from Kentucky \nholds the floor, no one will be able to offer a motion to consider an \nextension of the USA PATRIOT Act. But at some point in the near future, \nwhether it is this weekend or next week or next month, my analysis is \nthe proponents of phone record collection are going to seek a vote in \nthe Senate to continue what I consider to be this invasion of privacy \nof millions and millions of law-abiding Americans. When that happens, I \nintend to use every procedural tool available to me to block that \nextension. And if at least 41 Senators stand together, we can block \nthat extension and block it indefinitely. If 41 Senators stick \ntogether, there isn't going to be any short-term extension, and \nfinally, after something like 8 years of working on this issue, finally \nwe will be saying no to bulk phone record collection.\n  I am certain I know the answer to this question, but I think we both \nwant to be on the Record on this matter. When that vote comes, the \nSenator is going to be one of the 41 Senators who are going to block \nthat extension. I have appreciated his leadership.\n  I would just like his reaction to our efforts to go forward once \nagain when we have to do it with proponents of mass surveillance \nseeking an actual vote to continue business as usual with respect to \ndragnet surveillance.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think the American people are with us. I think the \nAmerican people don't like the idea of bulk collection. I think the \nAmerican people are horrified.\n  I think it will go down in history as one of the most important \nquestions we have asked in a generation when the Senator from Oregon \nasked the Director of National Intelligence: Are you gathering in bulk \nthe phone records of Americans? And when he didn't tell the truth and \nthen when the President kept him in office and then how that led to \nthis great debate we are having now--I think the American people are \nwith us.\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n  I don't think those inside Washington are listening very well, so I \nthink those inside Washington have not come to the conclusion yet. But \nI think the Senator from Oregon is right. There may be enough of us now \nto say: Hey, wait a minute, you are not going to steam roll through \nonce again something that isn't even doing what you said it is going to \ndo.\n  No one said at the time of the PATRIOT Act that it meant we could \ncollect all records of all Americans all the time. In fact, in the \nHouse, one of the cosponsors of the bill, James Sensenbrenner, knew all \nabout the PATRIOT Act. He was a proponent of the PATRIOT Act, and he \nsaid never in his wildest dreams did he think that what he voted for \nwould say we could gather all the records all the time.\n  But I am interested in another question, and that would be whether \nthe Senator from Oregon has a question that will help us to better \nunderstand, if we were to stop bulk collection tomorrow, if we were to \neliminate what is called section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, if we were to \ndo that, is there still concern and worry about what is called \nExecutive Order 12333?\n  I am not aware of whether the Senator can or can't talk about this or \nwhat is public. From what I have read in public and from one of the \ninsightful articles from John Napier Tye, the section chief for \nInternet freedom in the State Department, he has written that his \nconcern is that this Executive order may well allow a lot of bulk \ncollection that is not justified and not given sanction under the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  Does the Senator from Oregon have a question that might help the \nAmerican public to understand that?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would just say to my colleague that we always have to be \nvigilant about secret law. And we have, in effect, found our way into \nthis ominous cul-de-sac that the Senator from Kentucky and I have been \ndescribing here this afternoon really because of secret law.\n  As I wrap up with this question and hearing the concern of my \ncolleague--because I think that is what is at the heart of his \nquestion, that ``secret law'' is what the interpretation is in the \nintelligence community of the laws written by the Congress. Very often \nthose secret interpretations are very different from what an American \nwill read if they use their iPad or their laptop. For example, on \nsection 215, bulk phone records collection, I don't think very many \npeople in Kentucky or Oregon took out their laptop, read the PATRIOT \nAct, and said: Oh, that authorizes collecting all the phone records on \nmillions of law-abiding Americans.\n\n  There is nothing that even suggests something like that, but that was \na secret interpretation.\n  So I am very glad the Senator from Kentucky has chosen to have us \nwrap up at least this part of our discussion with the questions that we \nhave directed to each other on this question of secret law because, as \nmy colleague from Kentucky and I have talked about, we both feel that \noperations of the intelligence community--what are called sources and \nmethods--they absolutely have to be secret and classified because if \nthey are not, Americans could die. Patriotic Americans who work in the \nintelligence community could suffer grievous harm if sources and \nmethods and the actual operations were in some way leaked to the \npublic. But the law should never be secret. The American people should \nalways know what the law means. And yet, with respect to bulk \ncollection and why that court decision was so important, what happened \nwas that a program that had been kept secret, that had been propped up \nby secret law, was declared illegal by an important court.\n  So I will just wrap up by way of saying that the Senator from \nKentucky and I have always done a little kidding over the years about \nour informal Ben Franklin caucus. Ben Franklin was always talking about \nhow anybody who gave up their liberty to have security really deserves \nneither.\n  I just want to tell my colleague that I am very appreciative of his \ninvolvement in this. From the time my colleague came to the Senate, he \nhas been a very valuable ally in this effort. My colleague recognized \nthis was not about balance. This is a program that doesn't make us \nsafer but compromises our liberty. It is not about balance. And at page \n104, you can read that the President's own advisers say that.\n  So I am very pleased that the informal Ben Franklin caucus is back in \naction this afternoon. I look forward to working closely with my \ncolleagues on this. As I indicated by my question, I expect we will be \nback on the floor of this wonderful body before long having to once \nagain tackle this question of whether it ought to be just business as \nusual and a re-up of a flawed law. My colleague and I aren't going to \naccept that.\n  I thank him for his work today. These discussions and being on your \nfeet hour after hour are not for the fainthearted. I appreciate my \ncolleague's leadership, and I once again yield the floor back to him.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Senator from \nOregon, and I would like to point out to the American people, to people \nwho are always crying out and saying ``Why can't you work together? Why \ncan't you work with the other side?'' that I think we have a false \nunderstanding sometimes of compromise. The Senator from Oregon is from \nthe opposite party. We are in two opposite parties, and we don't agree \non every issue. But when it comes to privacy and the Bill of Rights and \nwhat we need to do to protect the Fourth Amendment, we are not \nsplitting the difference to try to find a middle ground between us. We \nboth believe in the Fourth Amendment. We both believe in protecting the \nFourth Amendment and protecting your right to privacy.\n  So bipartisanship can be about two people believing in the same thing \nbut just being in different parties. It means we may not agree on 100 \npercent of issues, but on a few, we are exactly together, and we don't \nsplit the difference. It isn't always about splitting the difference.\n  You can have true, healthy bipartisanship, Republican, Democrat, \nIndependent coming together on a constitutional principle, coming \ntogether on something that is important.\n  I didn't come to the floor today because I want to get some money for \none individual project for one person. I came because I want something \nfor everybody. I want freedom for everybody, and I want protection for \nthe individual. I want protection against the government's invasion of \nyour privacy.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for his insightful questions.\n  One of the things we talked a little bit about as Senator Wyden and I \nwere going through a series of questions was some of the different \nboards that have been put in place by the President and have come out \nand said that the program--the Executive order--the President put in \nplace two panels, a review panel and another one called the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board, and, interestingly, both panels told \nhim the same thing: that what he was doing was illegal and wrong and it \nought to stop. Then the President came out and said ``That is great,'' \nbut then he keeps doing it.\n  I don't quite understand because I like the President and I take him \nat his word, and he says: Well, yes, I am balancing this and that, and \nthey told me this, and if Congress stops it, I will obey Congress. It \nis like, we didn't start this. The President started this program by \nhimself. He didn't tell us about it. Maybe one or two people knew about \nit. Almost all of the representatives didn't know about it, and no \nAmericans knew about it. And then when we asked them about it, they \nlied to us and said they weren't doing it.\n  The President has two official panels, and they both said it is \nillegal and ought to stop. And the PATRIOT Act doesn't justify what \nthey are doing. And this was all created by Executive order.\n  So what is the President's response? He just keeps collecting your \nrecords. Does nobody in America think this is strange or unusual that \nthe President will continue a program that his own advisers tell him is \nillegal and that the courts have now said is illegal, and he goes on.\n  But this isn't all one-sided. That is for one political party. But in \nmy political party, there are people saying: I guess the President's \nadvisers say it is illegal, the court says it is illegal, but, man, \nthey are not collecting enough. I just wish they were collecting more \nAmericans' records without a warrant.\n  What a bizarre world, that people don't seem to be listening to the\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\ncourts, to the experts, or to the Constitution.\n  The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, though, I think \nreally had some insightful comments. They give a description, first of \nall, of collecting all of your phone records, and I like the way they \nput it. They said that an order was given so that the NSA is ``to \ncollect nearly all call detail records generated by certain telephone \ncompanies in the United States. . . .'' Sometimes when you read a \nsentence, you don't quite get to the importance. ``Nearly all.'' So we \nare not talking about 1,000 records. We are not talking about 1 million \nrecords. We are talking about nearly all of the records in the entire \nUnited States. There are probably over 100 million phones, I am \nthinking, in the United States, so over 100 million records. Every \nrecord has thousands of pieces of information in it, so we are talking \nabout billions of bits of information that the government is \ncollecting.\n  I don't have a problem if they want to collect the phone data of \nterrorists. In fact, I want them to. I don't have a problem if they \nwill go 100 hops into the data if they have a warrant. If John Doe has \na warrant, look at all his phone records. Ask a judge to put his name \non the warrant and look at all of his records. If there are 100 people \nhe called and they are people you are suspicion of, call them, too. Go \nto the next hop, go to the next hop, go to the next hop. There is no \nlimit. But just do it appropriately. Do it appropriately with a warrant \nwith somebody's name on it. I see no reason why we can't do this with \nthe Constitution.\n  We are now collecting the records of hundreds of millions of people \nwithout a warrant, and I think it needs to stop. The President's own \ncommission says to stop. Here is what the commission says: ``From 2001 \nthrough early 2006 the NSA collected bulk data based on a Presidential \nauthorization.''\n  So, interestingly--and this ought to scare you, too--they didn't even \nuse the PATRIOT Act in the beginning at all. The President just wrote a \nnote to the head of the NSA and said: Just start collecting all their \nstuff, without any kind of warrant. And then later on they started \nsaying: Well, maybe the PATRIOT Act justifies this. But for 5 years \nthey collected data with no warrant and with no legal justification, \nand they do it through something they call the inherent powers of the \nPresident, article II powers.\n  Article II is the section of the Constitution that gives the \nPresident powers. We designate what the President can do. Article I \ndesignates what we can do. Interestingly, our Framers put article I \nfirst, and those of us in Congress think that maybe they thought the \npowers of Congress were closer to the people and more important, and \nthey gave delegated powers to us, and they were very specific.\n  But what concerns me about the bulk collection is that for 5 years it \nwasn't even done with regard to the PATRIOT Act. I am guessing it was \ndone under the Executive order.\n  As much as I don't like the PATRIOT Act and would like to repeal the \nPATRIOT Act and simply use the Constitution, I am afraid that even if \nwe repeal the PATRIOT Act, they would still do what they want. Your \ngovernment has run amok. Things are runaway, and the government really \nis not paying attention to the rule of law.\n\n  For the first time, in 2006, the court got involved. The intelligence \ncourt at that time finally heard the first order under section 215. So \nfor 5 years they were collecting all the phone records with just a \nPresidential order. Now we do it under the PATRIOT Act.\n  But the rule of law is about checks and balances. It is about \nbalancing the executive branch and the legislative branch and the \njudiciary branch. It is about balancing the police in the judiciary. We \ntalked about warrants and the police not writing warrants.\n  I see on the floor one of the Nation's leading experts in the Fourth \nAmendment and the Constitution, who has recently written a book on \nthis, and I told him recently I have been stealing his story and at \nleast half the time giving him credit for it. But I talked earlier on \nthe floor about the story of John Wilkes, and if the Senator from Utah \nis interested in telling us a little bit of the story, I would like to \nhear a little bit from his angle or in the form of a question or any \nother question he has.\n  Mr. LEE. I would like to be clear at the outset that while the \nSenator from Kentucky and I come to different conclusions with regard \nto the specific question as to whether we should allow section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act to expire, I absolutely stand with the junior Senator \nfrom Kentucky and, more importantly, I stand with the American people.\n  With regard to the need for a transparent, open amendment process and \nfor an open, honest debate in front of the American people on the \nimportant issues facing our Nation, including this one--and I certainly \nagree with the Senator from Kentucky that the American people deserve \nbetter than what they are getting, and, quite frankly, it is time that \nthey expect more from the Senate.\n  On issues as important as this one, on issues as important as the \nright to privacy of our citizens and our national security, this is not \na time for more cliffs, more secrecy, and more eleventh-hour backroom \ndeals that are designed to mix conflict, mix crisis in a previously \narranged time crunch in which the American people are presented with \nsomething where they don't really have any real options.\n  It is time for the kind of bipartisan, bicameral consensus I believe \nis embodied in the USA FREEDOM Act. While I often criticize Congress \nfor our economic deficits, our financial deficits, the core of this \ncurrent challenge we face is centered around the Congress's deficit of \ntrust--in this particular circumstance, the Senate's deficit of trust. \nMembers of our body routinely tell the American people to just trust \nus. Trust us, we will get it right. Just trust us, we will \nappropriately balance all the competing concerns.\n  I think it is time that we trust the American people by having an \nhonest discussion with them emanating from right here on the floor of \nthe Senate. It is time to discuss and debate and to amend the House-\npassed USA FREEDOM Act.\n  I am confident that Senator Paul and others among my colleagues who \nhave different ideas from mine will be happy to offer and debate \namendments to improve it and make it something perhaps that they could \neven support. In fact, as far as I am aware, Senator Paul and others \nhave amendments that they are eager and anxious and willing and ready \nto present and to have discussed here on the floor and voted on right \nhere on the floor of the Senate.\n  But first I am calling on my Republican and Democratic colleagues to \nhelp repair the dysfunctional legislative branch we have inherited, to \nrebuild the Senate's reputation as not only our Nation's but the \nworld's greatest deliberative body, and, by extension, slowly restore \nthe public's confidence in who we are and what we are here to do here \nin the Senate.\n  The greatest challenge to policymaking today is perhaps distrust. The \nAmerican people distrust their government. They distrust Congress in \nparticular. It is not without reason. For their part, Washington \npolicymakers seem to distrust the people.\n  Almost as pressing for the new majority here in the Senate is that \nthe distrust that now exists between grassroots conservative activists \nand elected Republican leaders can be particularly toxic. Leaders can \nrespond to this kind of distrust in one of two ways. One option \ninvolves the bare-knuckles kind of partisanship that the previous \nSenate leadership exhibited over the last 8 years, twisting rules, \nblocking debate, and blocking amendments, while systematically \ndisenfranchising hundreds of millions of Americans from meaningful \npolitical representation right here in this Chamber. But this is no \nchoice at all. Contempt for the American people and for the democratic \nprocess is something Republicans should oppose in principle. In fact, \nit is something we oppose in principle.\n  We should throw open the doors of Congress, throw open the doors of \nthe Senate, and restore genuine representative democracy to the \nAmerican Republic. What does this mean? Well, it means no more cliff \ncrises, no more secret negotiations, no more ``take it or leave it'' \ndeadline deals, no more passing bills without reading them, and no more \nprocedural manipulation to block debate and compromise. These are the\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\nabuses that have created today's status quo--the very same status quo \nthat Republicans have been elected to correct.\n  What too few in Washington appreciate and what this new Republican \nmajority in Congress must appreciate if we hope to succeed is that the \nAmerican people's distrust of their public institutions is totally \njustified. There is no misunderstanding here. Americans are fed up with \nWashington, and they have every right to be. The exploited status quo \nin Washington has corrupted America's economy and their government, and \nits entrenched defenders, powerful and sometimes rich in the process. \nThis situation was created by both parties, but repairing it is now \ngoing to fall to those of us in this body right now. It is our job to \nwin back the public's trust. That cannot be done simply by passing \nbills or even better bills. The only way to gain trust is to be \ntrustworthy. I think that means that we have to invite the people back \ninto the process, to give the bills we do pass the moral legitimacy \nthat Congress alone no longer confers.\n  In order to restore this trust, Members will have to expose \nthemselves to inconvenient amendment votes, inconvenient debate and \ndiscussion, and scrutiny of legislation we are considering. The result \nof some votes in the face of certain bills may, indeed, prove \nunpredictable, but the costs of an open source, transparent process are \nworth it for the benefits of greater inclusion and more diverse voices \nand views and for the opportunity such a process would offer to rebuild \nthe internal and the external trust needed to govern with legitimacy.\n  My friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Kentucky, has \nreferred to a story of which I have become quite fond, a story that I \nhave written about and talked about in various venues throughout my \nState and throughout America. It relates to a lawmaker, a lawmaker who \nserved several hundred years ago, a lawmaker named John Wilkes--not to \nbe confused with John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's assassin. This John \nWilkes served in the English Parliament in the late 1700s.\n  In 1763, John Wilkes found himself at the receiving end of anger and \nresentment by the administration of King George III. King George III \nand his ministers were angry with John Wilkes.\n  At the time, there were these weekly news circulars, weekly news \nmagazines that went out and would often just extol the virtues of King \nGeorge III and his ministers. One of them was called the Briton. The \nBriton was written, produced, and published by those who were loyal to \nthe King, and they would say only glowing things about the King. They \nwould write things about the King saying: Oh, the King is fantastic. \nThe King can do no wrong. Had sliced bread been invented as of 1763, I \nam sure the Briton would have reported that the King was the greatest \nthing since sliced bread. All they could say were nice things about the \nKing because they were written by the King's people.\n  Well, John Wilkes decided to buck that trend. He started his own \nweekly circular called the North Briton. The North Briton took a \ndifferent angle. The North Briton took the angle that it was supposed \nto be in the interests of the people that he reported the news and that \nhe made commentary. So in the North Briton John Wilkes would \noccasionally be so bold as to criticize or question King George III and \nthe actions of the King and of the King's ministers.\n  This proved problematic for some in the administration of King George \nIII. The last straw seemed to come with the publication of the 45th \nedition of the North Briton, North Briton No. 45. When North Briton No. \n45 was released, the King and his ministers went crazy. Before long, \nJohn Wilkes found himself arrested. John Wilkes found himself subjected \nto a very invasive search pursuant to a particular type of warrant. It \nhad become, unfortunately, all to common in that era, a type of warrant \nwe will refer to as a general warrant. Rather than naming a particular \nplace or a particular person where things would be searched and seized, \nthis warrant simply identified an offense and said: Go after anyone and \neveryone who might in some way be involved in it. It gave unfettered, \nunlimited discretion to those executing and enforcing this warrant as \nto how and where and with respect to whom this warrant might be \nexecuted.\n  So they went through his house even though he was not named in the \nwarrant, even though his home, his address, was not identified in the \nwarrant. They searched through everything. John Wilkes was, \nunderstandably, outraged by this, as were people throughout the city of \nLondon when they became aware of it. John Wilkes, while in jail, \ndecided he was going to fight back. He fought in open court the terms \nand the conditions of his arrest. He ended up fighting against this \ngeneral warrant. He eventually won his freedom.\n  Over time, he was reelected repeatedly to Parliament. In time, he \nalso brought a civil suit against King George III's ministers who were \ninvolved in the execution of this general warrant, and he won. He was \nawarded 4,000 pounds, which was a very substantial sum of money at the \ntime. The other people who were subjected to the same type of search \nunder the same general warrant were also awarded a recovery under this \nsame theory, to the point that in present-day terms, there were many \nmillions of dollars that had to be paid out by King George III and his \nministers to the plaintiffs who sued under this theory that they were \nunlawfully subjected to a search under a general warrant.\n  In time, the number 45, in connection with the North Briton No. 45--\nthe publication that had sparked this whole inquiry--the number 45 \nbecame synonymous with the name John Wilkes, and then John Wilkes in \nturn became synonymous with the cause of liberty. People throughout \nBritain and throughout America would celebrate the cause of freedom by \ncelebrating the number 45. It was not uncommon for people to buy drinks \nfor their 45 closest friends. It was not uncommon to write the number \n45 on the side of buildings, taverns, saloons. It was not uncommon for \nthe number 45 to be raised in connection with cries for the cause of \nliberty. So the number 45, the name John Wilkes, and the cause of \nliberty all became wrapped up into one.\n  It was against this backdrop that the United States was becoming its \nown Nation. When it did become its own Nation, when we adopted a \nConstitution, and when we decided shortly thereafter to adopt a Bill of \nRights, one of the very first amendments we adopted was the Fourth \nAmendment. The Fourth Amendment responded to this particular call for \nfreedom by guaranteeing that in the United States we would not have \ngeneral warrants. The Fourth Amendment makes that clear. It contains a \nparticularity requirement stating that any persons or things subject to \nsearch warrants would have to be described with particularity. The \npersons would have to be identified or at least an area or a set of \nobjects would have to be identified rather than the government just \nsaying: Go after anyone and everyone who might be connected with this \noffense or with this series of events.\n  At that time, there were no such things as telephones. Those would \nnot come along for a very long time. They certainly did not imagine, \ncould not have imagined, the types of communications devices we have \ntoday. Nevertheless, the principles that they embraced at the time are \nstill valid today, and they are still relevant today. The principles \nembodied in the Fourth Amendment are still very much applicable today. \nThe freedom we embraced then is still embraced today by the American \npeople, who, when they become aware of it, tend to be offended by the \nnotion that the NSA can go out and get an order that requires the \nproviders of telephone services to just give up all of their data, give \nup all of their calling records, to give those over to a government \nagency that will then put them into a database and keep track of where \neveryone's telephone calls have gone.\n  The idea behind this program is to build and maintain a database \nstoring information regarding each call you have made and each call \nthat has been made to you, what time each call occurred, and how long \nit lasted. This is an extraordinary amount of information, information \nthat, while perhaps relatively innocuous in small pieces, when put \ntogether in a single database--one that includes potentially more than \n300 million Americans, one that goes back 5 years at a time--can\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\nbe used or could easily be abused in such a way that would allow the \ngovernment to paint a painfully clear portrait, a silhouette of every \nAmerican. Some researchers have suggested, for example, that through \nmetadata alone, it could be ascertained how old you are, what your \npolitical views are, your religious affiliation, what activities you \nengage in, the condition of your health, and all other kinds of \npersonal information.\n  One of the reasons this is distressing is, that, unlike a program \nthat would involve listening to the content of your telephone calls--\nwhich, of course, is not at issue with respect to this program--all of \nthis can be done with a high degree of automation, such that those \nintent on abuses could do so with relative ease, with the type of ease \nthat they would not have access to absent this type of automation.\n  Sometimes people are inclined to ask me: Where is the evidence that \nthis particular program is being abused? What can you point to that \nsuggests anyone has used this for a nefarious political purpose or for \nsome other illegitimate purpose not connected with protecting American \nnational security?\n  I have a few responses to them. First and foremost, we do need to \nlook to the Constitution, both to the letter and spirit of that \nfounding document that has fostered the development of the greatest \ncivilization the world has ever known. It isn't important for its own \nsake simply because we have taken an oath to uphold, protect, and \ndefend it as Members of this body. The Constitution is an end unto \nitself. It is important that we follow it regardless of whether we can \npoint to some particular respect in which this particular program has \nbeen abused.\n\n  Secondly, even if we assume, even if we stipulate for purposes of \nthis discussion that no one within the NSA is currently abusing this \nprogram for nefarious political purposes or otherwise, even if we \nassume no one within the NSA currently is even capable of abusing or \nhas any inclination to abuse this program at any point in the future, I \nwould ask the question: Can we say we are certain that will always be \nthe case? Who is to say what might happen 1 year from now, 2 years from \nnow, 5 years, 10 years or 15 years from now?\n  We know how these things happen. We understand something about human \nnature. We understand what happens to human beings as soon as they get \na little bit of power. They tend to abuse it.\n  Remember the investigation brought about by Senator Frank Church in \nthe 1970s. Senator Frank Church, when he investigated wiretap abuses--\nabuses of technology that was still only a few decades old back in the \n1970s when this occurred--the Church Committee concluded, among other \nthings, that every Presidential administration from FDR through Richard \nNixon had abused our Nation's investigative and counterintelligence \nagencies for partisan, political purposes to engage in political \nespionage. Every single one of those administrations from FDR to Nixon \nhad done that.\n  In that sense, we have seen this movie before. We know how it ends. \nWe know that even though the people working at the NSA today might well \nhave only the noblest of intentions, over time these kinds of programs \ncan be abused, and we know a lot of people in America understand the \npotential for this abuse.\n  Thirdly, I have to point out that the NSA currently is collecting \nmetadata only with respect to phone calls. But under the same reading \nof section 215 of the PATRIOT Act that the NSA has used to collect this \nmetadata--a reading with which I disagree and a reading with which the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disagreed in its \nthoughtful, well-written opinion just about 2 weeks ago--even though \nthe NSA is currently collecting only telephone call metadata right now, \nthere is nothing about the way the NSA reads section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct--which is incorrect, by the way, an incorrect reading--but there is \nnothing about that reading that would limit the NSA to collecting only \nmetadata related to telephone calls.\n  So who is to say the NSA might decide tomorrow or next year or a \ncouple of years from now--if we reauthorize this--or at some point down \nthe road during a period of reauthorization, that the NSA will not \ndecide at that point to begin collecting other types of metadata, not \njust telephone call metadata but perhaps credit card metadata, metadata \nregarding people who reserve hotels online, regarding emails that \npeople send or receive, regarding Web sites that people visit online, \nregarding online transactions that occur. Those are all different types \nof metadata.\n  Now, again, I disagree with the NSA's legal interpretation of section \n215 of the PATRIOT Act. I think they are abusing it. I think they are \nmisusing it. I think they have dangerously misconstrued it, just as the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded a few weeks ago. \nBut this is their interpretation. And if we reauthorize this, are we \nnot reauthorizing, in some respects, or at least enabling them to \ncontinue this? I don't think we are validating or ratifying what they \nare doing.\n  Their interpretation of it is still wrong, but we are enabling them \nto engage in a continued ongoing practice of abuse of the plain \nlanguage of section 215, which requires that anything they collect be \nrelevant to an investigation.\n  Well, their interpretation of ``relevant to the investigation'' is we \nmight at some point in the future deem this material relevant to what \nwe might at some point in the future be investigating. That cannot \nplausibly, under any interpretation of the word ``relevance,'' be \nacceptable. And it was on that basis that the Second Circuit rejected \nthe NSA's interpretation.\n  In any event, that same interpretation will still be the NSA's \ninterpretation if, in fact, we reauthorize this.\n  There is nothing stopping the NSA from using that same \ninterpretation--mistaken interpretation but an interpretation \nnonetheless--of section 215 in a way that would allow--there is nothing \nstopping them from using that same misinterpretation of a statutory \nlanguage for the purposes of gathering metadata on credit card usage, \non online activity, on emails sent online and received. From that you \ncan discern even more information about a person's profile. You can \ncome up with a very frighteningly accurate picture of anyone based on \nthat kind of metadata, just as you can now, but that would give them an \neven bigger picture. That would be an even greater affront to the \nprivacy interests of the American people.\n  All of this relates back to the idea that the government shouldn't be \nable to go out and say: Here is a court order. We want all of your \ninformation. We want all of your data. Just give it to us because we \nmight want it later.\n  This type of dragnet operation is incompatible with our legal system. \nIt is incompatible with hundreds of years of Anglo-American legal \nprecedence. It is incompatible with the spirit, if not the letter, of \nthe U.S. Constitution, and it is not something we should embrace.\n  At the end of the day, we need to do something with this program. Not \neveryone in this Chamber agrees on what that something is, and not \neveryone in this Chamber who believes we need reform or who believes \nthe NSA's program of bulk metadata collection is wrong agrees on the \nsame solution. But the way for us to get to a solution must involve \nopen, transparent debate and discussion, and it absolutely should \ninvolve an open amendment process.\n  So if there are those who have concerns with the legislation passed \nby the House of Representatives last week by a vote of 338 to 88, I \nwelcome their input. I welcome any amendments they may have. I welcome \nthe opportunity to make the bill better, to make it more compatible \nwith this or that interest, to make it do a better job of balancing the \nprivacy and national security interests at stake.\n  But we have to have that debate and discussion, and we have to have \nthat process in order for the American people to be well represented \nand well served. We cannot continue to function by cliff.\n  Government-by-cliff is a recipe for disaster. Government-by-cliff \nresults in a take-it-or-leave-it, one-size-fits-all binary set of \nchoices that disserve the American people. Government-by-cliff all too \nfrequently results in temporary extensions rather than some type of \nlasting legislative solution that can help the American people feel \nmore comfortable that they are being well represented.\n  So I would ask my distinguished colleague, my friend the junior \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\nfrom Kentucky, if there are not ways in which we could come to an \nagreement, if we as a body couldn't come to an agreement on how best to \nresolve this difficult circumstance, if the cause of protecting \nAmerican national security is irreconcilably in conflict with the \nprivacy interests that are part of the Fourth Amendment and, most \nimportantly, I would ask my friend from Kentucky if privacy isn't, in \nfact, part of our security rather than being in conflict with it.\n  I would be interested in any thoughts my friend from Kentucky might \nhave on that issue.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah makes a very good \npoint and also asks some very good questions.\n  In saying that we tend to work against headlines here, I often say we \nlurch from deadline to deadline, and the American people wonder what \nthe heck we are doing in between the deadlines.\n  The PATRIOT Act has been due to expire for 3 years. It is on a sunset \nof 3 years. We knew 3 years ago that this debate was coming. There \nshould be plenty of time and, I think, adequate time to discuss issues \nthat affect the Bill of Rights, that affect rights that were encoded \ninto our Constitution from the very beginning.\n  So I think without question the issue is of great importance and then \nwe should debate it. But too often budgetary measures--or maybe this \nmeasure--get so crowded up against deadlines that people are like: Oh, \nwe don't have time for amendments. The problem is, if you don't have \namendments, you are not really having debate.\n  I think the Senator characterized very well that we both agree the \nbulk collection of data is wrong. We think that goes against the spirit \nand the letter of the Constitution.\n  However, at least half of us that we would encounter in this body \ndon't even agree with that supposition. They believe, as many of them \nhave pointed out, we are not collecting enough, and they don't care how \nwe collect it, let's just collect more.\n  So we are on different sides of opinion, two groups here. And then \nsome of us aren't exactly on the same page as to the solution, but we \nagree on the problem. I think you could work through to the solution if \nyou all agreed it is a problem and that the American people think we \nhave gone too far.\n  I think that is what the purpose of some of this debate today is, \nhopefully to draw in the American public and have them call their \nlegislators and say: Enough is enough. You shouldn't be collecting my \ndata unless you suspect me of a crime, unless my name is on the \nwarrant. Unless you had a judge sign the warrant for me, you shouldn't \nbe collecting all the data of all Americans all the time.\n  I think part of our problem is the deadlines, and part of the reason \nI am here today is that I have been working on five or six amendments \nfor a year now with Senator Wyden, so we have bipartisan support for a \nseries of amendments. These are what we think would be best to fix this \nproblem. Certainly, when we have had 3 years to wait for this moment, \nwe ought to have enough time to vote on five or six amendments.\n  So that is really, I think, what we are asking of the leadership of \nboth sides--is permission. Because, really, in this body, everybody has \nto agree to let you vote on something or no votes happen.\n  We have done a better job this year. We are voting on more \namendments, but this is still one of those occasions where we are \nbutting up against a deadline. My fear is that without extraordinary \nmeasures--which I am hopefully trying to do today--that we may not get \na vote on amendments and we may not get adequate time to debate this, I \nthink, important issue.\n  Some of the amendments we have been interested in presenting as a way \nto fix this--so first you have to agree with what the problem is. We \nthink the problem is that the government shouldn't collect all of your \nphone records all of the time without putting your name on a warrant, \nwithout telling a judge that they have suspicion that you have \ncommitted a crime. We think that collecting everyone's phone records \nall of the time without suspicion is sort of like a general warrant. It \nis like a writ of assistance, it is like what James Otis fought \nagainst, it is like what John Adams said was the spark that led to the \nAmerican Revolution.\n  So we think the American people also believe this, that the American \npeople believe their records shouldn't be collected in bulk, that there \nshould not be this enormous gathering of our records.\n  What we need to do is get to a consensus where everybody agrees that \nis a problem. But the body is still divided. About half of the Senate \nbelieves we should collect more records, that we are not invading your \nprivacy enough, that privacy doesn't matter--that, by golly, let the \ngovernment collect all of your records to be safe.\n  Well, when the privacy commission looked at this, when Senator Wyden \nlooked at this, and when other people who have the intimate knowledge \nlooked at this, their conclusion was that the bulk collection of our \nrecords, this invasion of privacy, isn't even working, that we aren't \ncapturing terrorists we wouldn't have caught otherwise by this \ninformation. So the practical argument that says we will give up our \nprivacy to keep us safe, even that argument is not a valid argument.\n  But we have been looking at some of the possible solutions--and I see \nthe Senator from New Mexico and would be pleased to entertain a \nquestion if he has a question.\n  (Mr. LEE assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Yes. I thank my friend from Kentucky and ask him if he \nwould yield for a question without losing his right to the floor.\n  I want to start out by prefacing this for a few minutes, from my \nlimited experience--just over the past a little over 2 years, and I am \non the Intelligence Committee now--by saying there is simply no \nquestion that our Nation's intelligence professionals are incredibly \ndedicated, patriotic men and women who make real sacrifices to keep our \ncountry safe and free and, in that, they should be able to do their \njob, secure in the knowledge that their agencies have the confidence of \nthe American people. And Congress--those of us here--needs to preserve \nthe ability of those agencies to collect information that is truly \nnecessary to guard against real threats to our national security.\n\n  The Framers of the Constitution, as my colleague from Kentucky knows, \ndeclared that government officials had no power--no power--to seize the \nrecords of individual Americans without evidence of wrongdoing. And it \nwas so important that they literally enshrined and embedded this \nprinciple in the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.\n  In my view, the bulk collection of Americans' private telephone \nrecords by the NSA in this program clearly violates the spirit--if not \nthe letter--of the intentions of the Framers here.\n  Just 6 months after my first Senate intelligence briefing, former \nNational Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents \nthat exposed the NSA's massive collection of Americans' cell phone and \nInternet data. And as my friend from Kentucky said, not just a few \nAmericans but literally millions of innocent Americans were caught up \nin what is effectively a dragnet program.\n  It was made clear to the public that the government had convinced the \nFISA Court to accept a sweeping reinterpretation of section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act, which ignited, in my view, a very necessary and long \noverdue public conversation about the trade-offs made by our government \nbetween protecting our Nation and respecting our constitutional \nliberties.\n  I think well-intentioned leaders had, during the previous decade, \ncome down decidedly on the side of national security with a willingness \nto sacrifice privacy protections in the process. And what became \nobvious was that because of our continued lack of knowledge of Al Qaeda \nand other terrorist organizations, some within our government believed \nwe still needed to collect every scrap of information available in \norder to ensure that, should we ever need it, we could query this \ninformation and track down U.S.-based threats. In doing so, the \ngovernment ended up collecting billions of call data records, linked in \ncase after case after case not to terrorists but to innocent Americans.\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\n  Wisconsin Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who I served with \nin the House of Representatives, who was one of the authors of the \noriginal underlying legislation--the PATRIOT Act itself--said a couple \nof years ago: ``The PATRIOT Act never would have passed . . . had there \nbeen any inclination at all that it would have authorized bulk \ncollections.''\n  As this debate increasingly moved to the public sphere, I joined my \ncolleagues on the Select Committee on Intelligence--Senator Wyden, who \nwas just here on the floor a few minutes ago, and former Senator Mark \nUdall--in pressing the NSA and the Director of National Intelligence \nfor some clear examples in which the bulk information collected under \nthis metadata program, under section 215, was uniquely responsible for \nthe capture of a terrorist or the thwarting of a terrorist plot. They \ncould not provide any--not a single solitary example--nor could they \nmake a case for why the government had to hold the data itself and why \nfor so long.\n  Thankfully, a review panel set up by President Obama agreed with us \nand recommended that the government end its bulk collection of \ntelephone metadata.\n  I will admit, however--and my friend from Kentucky has brought this \nup on several occasions already--that I am incredibly disappointed that \nthe President hasn't simply used his existing authority to unilaterally \nroll back some of the unnecessary blanket metadata collection. Some \nhave claimed this inaction is evidence that the President secretly \nsupports maintaining the current program as is. That, however, is \nnonsense.\n  The President has asked Congress to give him additional authorities \nso that he can carry out the program in an effective manner, and the \nUSA Freedom Act seeks to do just that.\n  The Republican-led House of Representatives last week passed that \nbill--the USA Freedom Act--by a vote of 338 to 88, with large \nmajorities from both parties. At a time when everyone believes we agree \non nothing, large majorities of Republicans and Democrats supported \nthat piece of legislation.\n  Further, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the NSA is \nviolating the law by collecting millions of Americans' phone records is \neven more proof that we have gone too far and need to recalibrate and, \nin my view, refocus our efforts. Why on Earth, I would ask, would we \nextend a law that this court has found to be illegal?\n  Given the overwhelming evidence that the current bulk collection \nprogram is not only unnecessary but also illegal, I think we have \nreached a critical turning point, and I want to thank my colleague from \nKentucky for coming to the floor to force us all to have this \nconversation. We have kicked the can down the road too many times on \nthis particular issue, and I believe it is time to finally end the bulk \ncollection of these phone records and instead focus more narrowly on \nthe records of actual terrorists.\n  Americans value their independence. I know this is especially true in \nmy home State of New Mexico. They cherish their right to privacy that \nis guaranteed by our Constitution. But some of our colleagues still \nthink it is OK for the government to collect and hold millions of \nprivate records from innocent citizens and to search those records at \nwill.\n  The majority leader is asking us to act quickly to reauthorize. I \nbelieve it would be a grave mistake to reauthorize the existing PATRIOT \nAct, and I join my colleagues in blocking any extension of the law that \ndoes not include major reforms, including an end to bulk collection.\n  I think we can and we must balance government's need to keep our \nNation safe with its sacred duty to protect our constitutionally \nguaranteed liberties. And I guess this brings me to my question for the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n\n  How on Earth can you possibly square what the Fourth Amendment says, \nin terms of our papers and our ability to control our own effects \nwithout a warrant, with the government's bulk collection of phone \nrecords of law-abiding American citizens?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for that \ngreat question.\n  I think there is no way we can square this bulk collection with the \nFourth Amendment. I think part of the problem, though, is that we, over \na long period of time, diminished the protections of records held by \nthird parties. And I think one of the debates we need to get hopefully \nto the Supreme Court sometime soon is whether you give up your privacy \ninterest in records that are held by third parties.\n  I think there will come a time that your papers, once held in your \nhouse--there are no papers in your house. There may not be paper. But \nthere is still the concept of records. Records were traditionally on \npaper, and they were traditionally in your house. But now your most \nprivate papers are held digitally by your phone, and then by the people \nwho are in charge of the different organizations such as phone, email, \net cetera.\n  I think there has to be Fourth Amendment protection of these. Those \nwho look at the court cases, and go back to probably the last important \ncase, the Maryland v. Smith case, often say there is no Fourth \nAmendment protection at all for these records. In fact, the government \nwill tell you they can do whatever they want with email, with text, and \nwith all of these things. And I am not convinced they are not using \nother programs, such as this Executive order program, to actually \ncollect many other kinds of metadata other than phone calls.\n  So I am very worried about it. I think we need help from the courts. \nBut we need help from the legislative body to represent the will of the \npeople. And I think the will of the people is very clear that the \nmajority of people think we have gone too far and that we need to stop \nthis indiscriminate vacuuming up of all Americans' phone records \nregardless of whether there is suspicion.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Kentucky an \nadditional question. I found it very helpful before I came to the floor \ntoday--and I want to thank my colleague again for raising these \ncritical issues--to go back and read the Fourth Amendment, and I \nthought it would be worthwhile just to briefly read that once again \nhere on the floor because I think it really puts you in the mind of \nsome of the greatest Americans who ever lived.\n  Our Framers wrote a constitution that has survived for well over 200 \nyears now. It has survived Republicans. It has survived Democrats. It \nhas survived political parties that came and went, and it has survived \ngreat conflicts time and again.\n  The Fourth Amendment says: ``The right of the people to be secure in \ntheir persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable \nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall \nissue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and \nparticularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or \nthings to be seized.''\n  I would ask my friend from Kentucky his views on the resilience of \nthis constitutional document and how he can possibly read the actual \ntext of this Fourth Amendment without realizing that those Framers \nreally meant for this to apply into the future to things that we hadn't \nforeseen yet but using the broadest terminology available, such as \nwords like effects and papers?\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Kentucky once again. \nThis is one of those issues that unite people on the left and the \nright, Republicans and Democrats, who care deeply about our national \nsecurity but also care about our constitutional liberties. I think the \ntime to fix this is upon us. And without shining a light on this, we \ncertainly are not going to be able to make the progress we need. We \nhave an opportunity here, and we should seize it.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \ncoming down and for being a great supporter of the Fourth Amendment.\n  One of the things I think is interesting is that in our current \nculture we seem to devalue the Fourth Amendment. You go to--at least on \nour side--all kinds of groupings and gatherings, and there is a lot of \ntalk of the Second Amendment, talk of the First Amendment, but there \nhasn't been so much of the Fourth Amendment until we got to this point \nwith the collection of data seeming to be running amok.\n  One of our Founding Fathers was George Mason. He was considered to be\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nan anti-Federalist. He was a guy who really stood on principle, but \nalso he was a guy who had the audacity to actually not sign the \nConstitution, even though he was asked and he was there and could have.\n  On September 17, 1787, he refused to sign the Constitution and \nreturned to his native State as an outspoken opponent of the \nratification contest. His objection to the proposed Constitution was \nthat it lacked a declaration of rights. Mason felt that a declaration \nof rights--or what we call a bill of rights--was a necessity in order \nto curb Federal overreach.\n  Mason, though, was also famous for being an author of the Virginia \nDeclaration of Rights, which was written a decade or so before our \nConstitution and upon which many things were based. He wrote in the \nfirst paragraph of the U.S. Declaration of Independence something \nsimilar to what we hear in the Declaration of Independence:\n\n       That all men are by nature equally free and independent, \n     and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter \n     into a state of society, they cannot by any compact deprive \n     or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and \n     liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, \n     and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.\n\n  In the Declaration of Rights, which comes from 1776, for Virginia, he \nalso was instrumental in including article IX. Article IX is basically \nthe precursor to the Fourth Amendment. In it, he wrote:\n\n       That general warrants, whereby any officer or messenger may \n     be commanded to search suspected places without evidence of a \n     fact committed, or to seize any person or persons not named, \n     or whose offence is not particularly described and supported \n     by evidence, are grievous and oppressive, and ought not to be \n     granted.\n\n  So from the very beginning, the Fourth Amendment was a big deal. It \nwas a big enough deal that the fact that it wasn't included caused \nGeorge Mason to say he couldn't sign the Constitution. It was a big \nenough deal that this debate went on for a while, and finally the \nresolution of getting the Constitution included that there would \nultimately be a Bill of Rights. Thomas Jefferson wrote about the Bill \nof Rights. He said:\n\n       A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against \n     every government on earth, general or particular, and what no \n     just government should refuse, or rest on inferences.\n\n  I like the way he put it: A Bill of Rights is what the people are \nentitled to against every government. It is a protection.\n  Jefferson also described the Constitution as the chains of the \nConstitution. The chains were to bind government and to prevent \ngovernment from abusing its authority.\n  When we have adhered to this, when we paid strict attention to it, we \nhave maximized our freedom. When we have let our guard down, when we \nhave allowed our guard to stray away, when we have allowed the \ngovernment to usurp authority to gain and grab and take more power, it \nhas been at the expense of freedom.\n  I think we can be safe and have our freedom as well. I think we can \nobey the Constitution and catch terrorists at the same time. I think, \nin fact, frankly--strictly from a practical point of view--I think we \ngain more information by using the Constitution. By having less \nindiscriminate collection of data and by having more collection of \ndiscriminating data--data that is based on suspicion, data that is \nbased on tips, data that is based on human intelligence, data that we \ncan focus all of our human energy on--I think we actually will catch \nmore terrorists. I think there has been instance after instance after \ninstance where we did have information on terrorists and we failed to \nact, perhaps because we are spending so much time and so much energy on \nthe indiscriminate collection of data.\n  William Brennan is one of our famous Justices, and he said of the \nFramers:\n\n       The Framers of the Bill of Rights did not purport to \n     ``create'' rights. Rather, they designed the Bill of Rights \n     to prohibit our Government from infringing rights and \n     liberties presumed to be preexisting.\n\n  We didn't create the rights. Government didn't create your rights. \nYour rights come naturally to you. For those of us who believe in a \nCreator, they come from our Creator. But they are important to protect. \nThey should be protected against all forms of even majority. It is why \nsome of us think it very important to say that we are a Republic, we \nare not a democracy; that no majority should be able to take away our \nrights. That is why this is important. I think these questions \nultimately get to the Supreme Court. Because no matter what the \nmajority says here, no matter what the majority of the legislature \nsays, the Bill of Rights lists and codifies rights that cannot and \nshould not be taken away by a majority: the rights that we have to be \nleft alone--as Justice Brandeis said, the most cherished of rights, the \nright to be left alone. But this debate is a long and ongoing debate. \nFor nearly 100 years, from the Olmstead case in 1928 to the present, we \nhave had a discussion and a struggle and a controversy over what parts \nof our conversations are to be protected and what parts are not to be \nprotected.\n  I think a lot of our problems really originated with going the wrong \nway in 1928 with the Olmstead case because we went for a long period of \ntime--we went for two generations thinking that your phone calls were \nnot private and that your phone calls were not protected by the Fourth \nAmendment. Then, we finally got to the 1960s, and we reversed that and \nwe said your conversations are to be protected. But within a decade we \nmade the wrong decision again and said that your records are not to be \nprotected--that your Fourth Amendment, your records once held by the \nphone company, aren't to be protected. I think that was a mistake.\n  I think it is also a mistake to think we are literally talking about \npaper in your house because there is quickly coming a time in which \ntechnology will be such that there will be no papers. Papers will be \nanother word for ``records,'' but your records will not be kept in your \nhouse.\n  They already aren't. There was a discussion of this in whether we can \nsearch a person's individual phone, and the Court did rule I think in \nan accurate way. The Court and one of the Justices said that, \nbasically, the information found on your phone is more personal and \nmore extensive than probably any papers that were ever in any home in a \ntime before electronics. So we are going to have to catch up to \nelectronics, we are going to have to catch up to the digital age, and \nwe are going to have to decide does the individual maintain a privacy \ninterest and/or a property interest.\n  I, frankly, think that when the phone company holds my records, that \nthey are partly mine; that there is a property interest and a privacy \ninterest I haven't relinquished. Unless I have given explicit \npermission, I don't think I have given up my privacy. In fact, many \ntimes it is the opposite.\n  Many times what we have actually said is, when I agree to do banking \nwith you or I agree to have you hold my telephone calls or I agree to \ndo Internet searches with you, I have an explicit agreement often. The \nagreement is so explicit to defend my privacy that when they don't, \nthey are actually fearful of being sued. And so all of this craziness, \nall of this overreach, all of this loss of our privacy comes with a \nlittle additional caveat that is written into all the laws and \neverybody is clamoring for and it is what they want now--liability \nprotection. They want to be able to violate their privacy agreement. So \nwe give them liability protection. They don't want to be sued, but they \nrealize they are violating and could be accused of violating our \nprivacy agreement.\n  So as much as I hate and despise frivolous lawsuits, the threat of \nsuing somebody causes them to obey their contract. If they don't have \nthe threat--if you say: Well, we are going to have contracts, but we \nare not going to enforce them with the threat of a lawsuit, then \ncontracts become meaningless. So it is really important that as we move \nforward, we try to say to people the privacy agreement you signed is a \nreal document, it is a real contract, and it should be protected.\n  When referring to the Bill of Rights, Gen. Smedley Butler, who was a \ntwo-time Medal of Honor winner and a Brevet Medal of Honor winner, \nsaid:\n\n       There are only two things we should fight for. One is the \n     defense of our homes and the other is the Bill of Rights.\n\n  When I have talked to the young men and women who have fought bravely \nfor our country--young men and women who have lost limbs, families of \nthose who have lost lives--that is what\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\nI hear from every one of them. I hear from them that they were fighting \nto defend the Bill of Rights. They were fighting to defend our \nConstitution.\n  What saddens me is that while they were fighting for our \nConstitution, while they were fighting for our Bill of Rights, their \nlegislators weren't fighting for the Bill of Rights. Their legislators \nwere turning the other way. Their legislators were so fearful of attack \nthat they gave up on the Bill of Rights and said: Here is my liberty, \njust give me security. This is a longstanding debate. Franklin had it \nright--those who are willing to give up their liberty may end up with \nneither.\n  Now, some would ask: Why am I here today? What do I propose to get \nout of this? Is there an end point when I will go home and be quiet and \nquit talking about the Bill of Rights?\n  I think there could be. I think if the leadership of both parties in \nthe Senate would agree to have a debate on the PATRIOT Act, if they \nwould agree to have amendments and have votes--and I will give some \nexamples of some things that we think--most of these will ultimately be \nintroduced in all likelihood by Senator Wyden and I. I will start with \nthe first one. This is based upon an amendment that he and I have \nworked on together. This amendment would prohibit mandates on companies \nthat alter their products to enable government surveillance. So this \namendment prohibits any mandates from government agencies requiring \nprivate companies to alter their security features--their source code--\nto allow the government to get into their stuff and into your lives.\n  This amendment would apply to computer services, hardware, software, \nand electronic devices made available to the general public.\n  Currently, the government is requiring and sometimes telling \ncompanies they can't even tell you this. They are requiring access to \ncertain products. There have been stories of them inserting malware on \nFacebook, giving you access to Facebook, and then getting into your \nFacebook account through the Facebook code source. I know Facebook has \nobjected to this and fought them on this, but our amendment would say \nthat the government just can't do this. The government cannot force \ndifferent social networking sites and different Internet software \ncannot force them to give the government access indiscriminately.\n  The question would be: Can the government require things \nspecifically? Absolutely, yes. Present evidence to get a warrant, and \nrealize that when they want to make you so afraid that you give up all \nyour records, realize that warrants aren't hard to get. The FISA \nwarrants are almost without question agreed to, maybe to a fault. \nNinety-nine percent-plus of all the warrants ever requested are \ngranted. I think it is not too much of a step to say we should ask and \nrequest warrants.\n  The second amendment we would consider putting forward, if we were \nallowed to and allowed to have votes on, would replace the PATRIOT Act \nextension with comprehensive surveillance reform. We would replace the \nextension of expiring authorities with substantial reforms, as \noriginally proposed by Senators Wyden and Paul and others in the \nIntelligence Oversight and Surveillance Act of 2013.\n  This amendment would end bulk collection and replace it with nothing. \nWe would close the section 702 backdoor search loophole, which allows \nthe government to say they are searching foreigners' records but in \nreality gather up 90 percent of the records being American records and \ncalled incidental. We would close this backdoor loophole where actually \nAmerican records are being collected, not foreign records. We would \ncreate a constitutional advocate to argue before the FISA Court, before \nthe intelligence court.\n  The reason I think this is necessary is that the court has somewhat \nbecome a rubberstamp for the government, and we aren't allowing any \nkind of opposing arguments and we really aren't having any argument. \nFor example, we have loosened the standard from the constitutional \nstandard, which is probable cause, and we have said it is relevant. So \nwe get to relevance. But when you come before the court, I don't think \nanybody is debating or being asked to prove whether it is relevant. \nCertainly they must not because they are somehow approving the \ncollection of everybody's records in the United States--which I don't \nknow of anybody who believes the word ``relevant'' can include \neverybody.\n  So if we had an advocate or we had someone to say this is the other \nside--I think it is really important. I am not a lawyer, but I \nunderstand they argue with each other all the time and you are supposed \nto figure out the truth. You argue and advocate for your side, and then \nsomehow you apply the truth or people arbitrate what they think the \ntruth is from this discussion. If only the government argues, you can't \nget even any sense or form of what truth is.\n  So what we would argue in our second amendment is that you actually \nhave an advocate that argues on that side. I would go further, though, \nand say that not only do you have an advocate, you should have an \navenue for appeal.\n  I am with Senator Wyden. I want to protect all the people doing this. \nI don't want any names revealed. I don't want any agents revealed. I \ndon't want to endanger the people who are risking their lives for our \ncountry to gain intelligence. But I do think the law in general can be \ndebated. Senator Wyden talked about how the law doesn't need to be \nsecret; the operations need to be secret.\n  So we can protect all of that. But I think the law should be debated. \nFor example, the question now whether you have any privacy interest in \nyour third-party-held records--whether the Fourth Amendment protects \nthese at all, that is our constitutional question. That should not be \ndecided in secret, and you really can't have justice decided in secret.\n  The other part of our amendment would give Americans spied on by the \ngovernment standing to sue in court and end the practice of reverse \ntargeting, under which the government targets the communication of an \nAmerican without a warrant by targeting the non-U.S. person they speak \nto. By some reports, it is even worse than that. I mentioned earlier \nthat an enormous amount of what the PATRIOT Act does--which is supposed \nto go after foreigners--is actually being used domestically for drug \ncrimes.\n  There have been reports that the information is being gathered \nthrough an intelligence warrant, and then they go back with the \ntraditional warrant after they have gotten information through a lower \nstandard--through a nontraditional, nonconstitutional investigation. \nThen they go back, and they get the warrant after using this \ninformation or they recreate the scenario in order to get the \ninformation they need. Then they do not tell the judges they got the \ninformation through the intelligence angle.\n  Another amendment that we would like to ask the leadership of both \nsides if they would let us introduce it and if we were allowed to \ndebate this and have an open amendment process would be that the \nwarrantless crime could not be used against Americans in nonterror \ncriminal cases.\n  This was originally the way it was. This is why you have to worry \nabout the slippery slope. Back in the 1970s, they said: OK, we are \ngoing to have a different standard to get foreign tariffs. Even I, who \nwant to keep good standards, can accept a little bit of that--a \nslightly lower standard for people who do not live here and are not \nAmerican citizens and are not part of our country. It has its dangers, \nbut even I might be able to accept that. But what I cannot accept is \nthat you lower the constitutional standard. You are going to use a \nterrorist warrant that has a lower procedural hurdle, and then you are \ngoing to use it for domestic crime.\n  That is exactly what is going on now. We should be appalled that they \ndestroyed the Fourth Amendment for certain crimes and we did not do \nanything about it.\n  Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act is called sneak-and-peek. The \ngovernment can go into your house and never tell you they were there. \nThey can look through all of your records. They can steal stuff. They \ncan replace it. They can do all kinds of things and place listening \ndevices--all without ever telling you.\n  This is in contradiction to what most people have accepted the Fourth\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nAmendment to be. But if you look at who is being convicted with section \n213, 99.5 percent of the people are for drugs, for domestic crime. What \nwe have done is that we have taken a domestic crime and we say the \nConstitution no longer applies. We basically got rid of the Fourth \nAmendment for these crimes.\n  For about 11,000 people a year, the Constitution no longer applies to \nthem. We are using a lower standard. If you want to make this even \nworse, think about who is being convicted of drug crimes in our \ncountry. Three out of four people being convicted of drug crimes in our \ncountry are Black or Brown. But if you ask who are the kids who are \nusing drugs, equal numbers of White and Black kids are using drugs. But \nthree out of four people in jail are Black or Brown. Then you find out \nthat not only have we messed up the war on drugs such that it has a \nracial element to it, but we are now using a lower standard that is not \nthe Constitution, and the end result is a racial outcome.\n  This is an enormous problem. Related to so much of what is going on \nin our country, so much of the anger you are seeing in our cities comes \nfrom this injustice. You now have people going to jail. You have people \ngoing to jail for 15, 20, 30 years.\n  There is a woman by the name of Mary Martinson from Mason County, IA. \nHer mother just died recently. They let her out of prison for a couple \nof hours. Her dad is getting older, and she wishes she had been there \nto help her parents. She did mess up. She was a drug addict. Her \nboyfriend was a drug addict. They had guns in the home. They were \nselling the drugs. He was a meth addict. She was probably going to die \nif she stayed on the drugs, so it was good that she got off the drugs. \nShe got caught. She got 15 years in prison.\n  You can kill somebody in Kentucky and be out on parole in 12 years. \nYet we put this woman in jail for an addiction. She had never been \nconvicted of any other crime. No judge in their right mind would have \never given her 15 years--nobody would have. The judges basically are \ntelling the defendants and telling the press: I would never do this. \nThis is the wrong thing to do, but I am forced to do this. Compound \nthis with the fact that the war on drugs has had a racial outcome. You \nput the two together and you say: Well, we are no longer obeying the \nConstitution, and there is a racial outcome.\n  Where is the hue and cry?\n  Where is the President on this issue?\n  I have talked to the President about criminal justice. I think he \nsincerely wants to help. But here is the thing. The President could \ntoday stop this program. He could stop collecting stuff through the \nsneak-and-peek. He can say we are no longer going to do the bulk \ncollection. Most of these things originated out of Executive order. He \ncould stop these any time he wanted to. We would stop it. We would say \nno more spying against Americans and no more use of this information \nfor nonterror criminal cases.\n  We have another amendment that goes to the heart of what I think \nshould be decided by the Supreme Court. We call this the amendment that \nwould protect the privacy of Americans' records held by third parties. \nI think that your records do retain a privacy interest. This \namendment--should the leadership agree to allow us to have amendments--\nwould establish a clear principle consistent with the Fourth Amendment. \nAs it relates to government collection, an individual's records, if \ngiven to a third party for a specific business purpose, are as equally \nsecure in their person as those that remain in their possession, unless \nthe third party informs the individual that it intends to share the \ninformation. This amendment affirms that the government cannot \ncircumvent warrant requirements by taking Americans' records from third \nparties, and it protects the constitutional rights during engagement \nand regular communication and commerce.\n  I think we had a vote on this a while back. I do not think we were \nthat successful. I think we got four people to vote--to say that your \nrecords should be protected by the Fourth Amendment. Most people do not \nrealize this. Most people have no idea that the government's position, \nand, currently, maybe the Supreme Court's position, is that you do not \nhave any right--Fourth Amendment right--in your records unless you have \nthem in your house.\n  I think this is something about which the more people understand and \nthe more people are drawn to this issue, maybe people will demand that \nwe have some justice here. We live in an era where ultimately no one is \ngoing to have paper records in their house. All of your records are \ngoing to be electronic. Because they are held and they are managed \nsomehow by a third party, does that really mean we have given up our \nrights? The thing is that the government might say if your cell phone \nis in your house, then they do. But the cell phone is connected to \nsomeplace outside your house. Your email is being served on some server \nsomewhere. I see no way that it could be construed that you have given \nup your right to privacy because someone else is holding the records \nfor you because that is the way in the digital age we have come to hold \nrecords.\n  We talked a little bit earlier about trust. I think trust is \nincredibly important. I do not discount that the vast majority of \npeople who work in our intelligence community are honest, trustworthy, \nand patriotic. I think we all want the same thing. We want to protect \nour country. We want to protect our loved ones. We want to honor the \nmemory of those who died on 9/11 by capturing and stopping the people \nwho would attack us. But the question is this: Can you catch more or \nless, or are we more or less effective, in catching terrorists if we \nuse the Constitution, if we use traditional warrants?\n  I think, without question, if you talk to people, they will tell you \nthat they get a great deal more information and more specific \ninformation by using warrants.\n  Let's say tomorrow we elected a President who eliminated the bulk \ncollection of data. Let's just say it happened. What do you think would \nhappen? People say: Oh, the sky would fall. We would be overrun with \njihadists. Maybe we could rule on the Constitution. Maybe we could get \nwarrants. The information is out there. There are warrants. If you make \nthe warrants specific, there is no limit to what you cannot get through \na warrant. The warrants are given the vast majority of the time.\n  People complain and say it would take too long; it would be \ninconvenient. Make it better then. Put your judges on 24 hours a day. \nAppoint 24 more judges. Put them on call all the time, and let's \ndo this. There is no reason why you cannot have security and liberty at \nthe same time.\n\n  Another amendment we have--should the leadership agree to allow us to \nhave amendments and to have votes and to have a debate on this--is an \namendment that would require the court to approve national security \nletters. In a 3-year period between 2003 and 2006, 140,000 national \nsecurity letters were given out. National security letters are warrants \nthat are below the constitutional bar. They do not meet the \nconstitutional bar because they are not being signed by a judge. They \nare being signed by the police. You got rid of one of the great \nprotections we had, which was the check and balance that the police \nwould always go to the judiciary. It was a different branch.\n  The judge is sitting at home, hopefully reading it in a reasoned \nfashion. The judge is not in hot pursuit. The judge is not letting \ntheir emotions--the judge was not just punched by one of the convicts. \nThe judge is sitting at home in a reasoned fashion trying to make a \nreasonable decision. But still, the vast majority of the time warrants \nare given.\n  If there is a policeman outside the house of an alleged rapist, and \nthey want to go in, they call on a cell phone. The judge almost always \nsays yes. It is the same for murder.\n  Does anybody imagine that there would be a judge in our country and \nthat you call and say: John Doe--we have evidence that he traveled to \nYemen last year. We have evidence that he talked to Joe Smith, and we \nhave evidence that he is a terrorist, and we want a warrant to tap his \nphone.\n  Look, I am the biggest privacy advocate in the world. I will sign the \nwarrant immediately. I do not know of anybody that will not sign \nwarrants to allow searches to occur. But you have the check and balance \nso it does not get out of control. What happened and what is happening \nnow is we let down our guard. We have no checks and balances. So what \ndoes the government do\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\nwhen you are not watching? If you look away, the government will abuse \ntheir power. Lord Acton said: ``Power corrupts, and absolute power \ncorrupts absolutely.'' The corollary to that would be: When you are not \nwatching, power grows exponentially.\n  They will do whatever they can get away with. They will do it in the \nname of patriotism. Actually, I do not even question their motives. \nThey believe themselves to be patriotic, but they think we have to do \nanything it takes--no matter whether it contravenes the Constitution or \ncontravenes the Bill of Rights. The people who do this--their motives \nare good, but they are confused in a sense, and they do not fully \ncomprehend what we are giving up in the process.\n  This amendment would require judges to sign national security \nletters. It would make them more like warrants. In practice, national \nsecurity letters have become warrants written by law enforcement \nwithout prior court review and approval, granting them almost \nunfettered access to individual email and phone communication data, as \nwell as consumer information such as bank and credit records.\n  Those subjected to the national security letters must also obey a gag \norder. Not only does the Government come to you with a less than \nconstitutional permit or a less than constitutional warrant, but they \nthen tell you that you cannot talk about it. You may go to jail for 5 \nyears if you tell somebody you had a warrant served on you.\n  This amendment would require that a government obtain approvals from \na court prior to issuing an NSL to a private entity, thus forcing them \nto demonstrate a clear need for information as part of an \ninvestigation.\n  Amendment 6 would create a new channel for legal appeals for those \nsubjected to government surveillance orders. This amendment would \nempower individuals or companies, ordered by the government to hand \nover information about users or customers, to make constitutional \nchallenges that would be in order in the U.S. court of appeals.\n  My understanding right now is that it is very difficult to appeal a \nFISA order. They are secret. You are not allowed to be in the court, so \nyou are not allowed to participate in the process. I think, also, you \ncan get outside of FISA by appealing, but I think you have to ask for \nsomething that is called a writ of certiorari. It is a special \ncondition, and it is not so automatic. My understanding is that the \ncourt will grant these things, but they do not occur very often. They \nare an extraordinary thing.\n  We would like to make it a little bit more of a facility of getting \nto a normal appeal--the way a normal appeal would occur. We have been \npushing to allow that there would be more of an automatic sort of \nappeal here.\n  One of the other amendments would say there is no liability immunity \nfor companies that break their agreements with users. Like I said, \nwhile I am not in favor of lawsuits and I do not like the idea of \nfrivolous lawsuits, I think if you do not protect the contract and if \nyou have a privacy agreement that says they are not going to share your \ninformation with anybody, the only way they will protect it is if there \nis the threat that they could be sued for not protecting it. I think \nthe contracts become not worth the paper or the click ``I agree to \nthis'' and become completely worthless if the companies are told they \ncan go around it. The companies have all specifically requested this \nbecause I think they fear that every day the government is requesting \nthem to breach the privacy contract. So in order to enable the privacy \ncontract, I think we have to get to a point where people can sue if \ntheir privacy is violated.\n\n  I think there can be a mixture of opinions on what Snowden did. I \nthink we have to have secrecy and there has to be laws against \nrevealing secrets, so I can't say we should have everybody revealing \nsecrets. At the same time, I think the law says that those who are \nreporting to Congress should tell the truth.\n  So we have the intelligence director lying to us and saying the \nprogram doesn't exist, and then we have someone committing civil \ndisobedience. When you commit civil disobedience, it isn't that we \nchange the law and say it is OK. What we do is say: You broke the law, \nand maybe you did it for a higher purpose, but it doesn't mean we will \nget rid of all punishment for things like this. I think there is one \nway we can modify it.\n  Snowden was a contractor, and we don't have very good rules for \nwhistleblowers who are contractors. I would extend the whistleblower \nstatute to people who want to come in and want to tell an authority, an \ninvestigator general or somebody, if they want to reveal that they \nthink something is being done illegally.\n  For example, if Snowden knew that Clapper was lying, a felony has \nbeen committed. I would think that somebody who has evidence of a \nfelony and tells the investigator general, ``Look, I have seen this, \nand I have seen that they are collecting all the records of every \nAmerican,'' and he says they are not, then he has committed perjury and \na felony, and there ought to be some sort of whistleblower statute for \nthat. What we do in one of our amendments is to allow whistleblowers to \nbe contractors as well.\n  One of the things that has been going on--even predating the PATRIOT \nAct and goes back to probably the 1980s and 1990s--is something called \nsuspicious activity reports. These are now being done, I believe, by \nthe millions. At one point I looked at it, and 5 million of these had \nbeen filed. Every year, hundreds of thousands of these are being filed, \nand if the banks don't file them, the banks could have their licenses \ntaken from them or there could be $100,000 fines issued to banks.\n  What we would like to do is to make a suspicious activity report \nbased on suspicion, not just based on a transaction. It would make it \nmore like a warrant where a judge would actually review it and see if \nthere is suspicion to be reporting this activity instead of just \nreporting activity based on the way people do their transactions.\n  The problem has been that we now have the IRS confiscating your \nmoney, your bank account, based on the way you do your transactions. It \nis not based on a conviction; it is based on, I guess, the presumption \nthat you are guilty until you can prove yourself innocent. This is also \ngoing on with civil asset forfeiture. It is intertwined with records, \nand as we allow the government to collect our records in an \nunconstitutional manner, we have to be very careful that then those \nrecords are then being used with the presumption of guilt, not \ninnocence.\n  I have a great deal of questions about Executive Order 12333. John \nNapier Tye was with the State Department and oversaw some of the \nfreedom of the Internet and government surveillance, and he put out an \nop-ed that shows a significant concern as far as whether this Executive \norder may be as big as bulk collection.\n  I spoke with one of the founders of one of America's larger Internet \ncompanies recently, and he told me that not only is he worried about \nbulk collection, but he is worried that bulk collection might be \nsmaller--the collection of all the phone data might be smaller than the \nbackdoor collection through 702 and the backdoor collection through the \ngovernment forcing companies to allow them into their software.\n  Our concern is that we need to look more at the Executive order. I \nthink it is being done in secret, but once again, an evaluation as to \nwhether a law is constitutional or whether a law overstates its purpose \nshould be done in the open.\n  I see the Senator from Montana, and I will be happy to entertain a \nquestion without losing the floor.\n  Mr. DAINES. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question \nwithout losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. I thank my colleague for raising this important issue on \nthe Senate floor today. It wasn't all that long ago that I served as a \nHouse Member. I served one term in the House and then came over to the \nSenate this year. I came over to the Senate floor, and I stood in \nsupport of my colleague's efforts to protect the American civil \nliberties and ensure drones are not being used to target American \ncitizens on our own soil.\n  In fact, I am grateful to see that in the Senate Chamber today, we \nhave five House Members who are here standing with the Senator from \nKentucky as he makes his very important point which relates to our \nConstitution and our freedom.\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\n  Well, 2 years later, we are here again, and the threats to America's \ncivil liberties and constitutional freedoms remain ever present.\n  As my colleague from Kentucky is well aware, I spent more than 12 \nyears in the technology sector before being elected to Congress. I know \nfirsthand the power that Big Data holds. I also know the great risks \nthat arise when that power is abused.\n  There is a clear and direct threat to Americans' civil liberties that \ncomes from the mass collection of our personal information in our phone \nrecords. I, like so many Montanans, am deeply concerned about the NSA's \nbulk metadata collection program and its impact on our constitutional \nrights. In fact, just last night, I hosted a telephone townhall meeting \nwith thousands of Montanans, and one of the issues I heard most about \nwas the NSA's bulk data collection program and when is Congress finally \ngoing to put a stop to it. In fact, this is one of the issues I hear \nmost about from my fellow Montanans.\n  I brought down just a few of the thousands of letters I received from \nMontanans on the NSA's dangerous bulk metadata program. For example, I \nhave a letter from Adam, who lives in Missoula. Adam writes:\n\n       I'm writing to ask you to allow Section 215 of the PATRIOT \n     Act to expire on June 1st of this year. While it is only one \n     provision of the larger problem...it would at least begin to \n     curtail the surveillance of Americans.\n       As Americans we should be free to communicate without the \n     threat of the government monitoring those communications. \n     Wanting to keep your life private does not mean you have \n     something to hide--only that your life isn't any of the \n     government's business as long as you are not infringing on \n     the liberty of others.\n       At the end of the day, giving up our liberties because of \n     the threat of terrorism truly is the definition of terrorism \n     winning. To be free inherently means a person also incurs \n     risks.\n       Even though he was speaking about taxes, I believe Benjamin \n     Franklin would agree: ``Those who would give up essential \n     Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve \n     neither Liberty nor Safety.''\n\n  Jes from my hometown of Bozeman, MT, wrote:\n\n       I am writing to you as your constituent.\n       NSA spying needs a comprehensive overhaul. But in the \n     meantime, I urge you to show that you care about the \n     Constitution by voting against reauthorization of Section 215 \n     of the USA PATRIOT Act. Section 215 has been used to invade \n     the privacy of millions of people.\n       Although some in Congress and the NSA have argued that \n     collecting call detail records (``metadata'') is not privacy \n     invasion, the information collected by the government is not \n     just metadata--it paints an intimate portrait of the lives of \n     millions of Americans.\n       What's more, the collection of call detail records isn't \n     even necessary to keep us safe.\n       The President, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \n     Board and the President's Review Group have all admitted that \n     collection of call detail records is not necessary.\n       PCLOB [Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board] went so \n     far as to note that it could not identify a single time in \n     which bulk collection under Section 215 made a concrete \n     difference in the outcome of a counterterrorism \n     investigation.\n       That's why I urge you to support reform by committing to a \n     no vote on reauthorization of Section 215.\n       A vote against reauthorization is a vote for the \n     Constitution. Thank you for opposing unconstitutional \n     surveillance and for supporting a free and secure Internet.\n\n  Montanans are right to be concerned. This program is a direct threat \nto our constitutional rights. It has jeopardized our civil liberties \nwith little proven effectiveness, and I am the son of a U.S. marine.\n  Several weeks ago, I was with Leader McConnell and other Senators. \nWhen we went to Israel, we met with Prime Minister Netanyahu. When we \nwent to Jordan, we met with King Abdallah. When we went to Iraq, we met \nwith Prime Minister al-Abadi. When we were both in Baghdad, we went up \nto Erbil and met with the leaders of the Kurds, including Mr. Barzani. \nWe then went to Afghanistan. We were in Kabul, and we were in \nJalalabad. We met with President Ghani. We heard directly from the \nleaders in the Middle East, we heard directly from our U.S. military, \nand we heard directly from U.S. intelligence about what is going on in \nthe Middle East.\n  As the father of four and someone who strongly believes in a strong \nnational defense and the importance of protecting our homeland, I weigh \nthese issues very deeply. These are heavy issues we must look at as we \nwant to ensure we protect the homeland and, just as important, protect \nthe Constitution and the constitutional rights of the American people.\n  As my colleague is likely aware, a 2014 report from the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board, which is a nonpartisan, independent \nprivacy board, found that the NSA's bulk data collection program said \nthat it ``contributed only minimal value when combating terrorism \nbeyond what the government already achieves through . . . other \nalternative means.''\n  Like the New York-based Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals recently \nunanimously confirmed, this oversight board found that section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act does not provide authority for the NSA's bulk metadata \ncollection program. In fact, the report states:\n\n       Under the Section 215 bulk telephone records collection \n     program, the NSA acquires a massive number of calling records \n     from telephone companies each day, potentially including the \n     records of every call made across the nation. Yet Section 215 \n     does not authorize the NSA to acquire anything at all.\n\n  It is illegal, it is an overreach of power, and it is a direct threat \nto our First and Fourth Amendment rights.\n  In fact, the report goes on to conclude:\n\n       The program lacks a viable legal foundation under Section \n     215, implicates constitutional concerns under the First and \n     Fourth Amendments, raises serious threats to privacy and \n     civil liberties as a policy matter, and has shown only \n     limited value. For these reasons, the government should end \n     the program.\n\n  I stand here today with the people of Montana. I stand here today \nwith my colleague from Kentucky. I stand here today with five Members \nof the U.S. House who are seated in the back of the Senate Chamber: \nCongressman Duncan of South Carolina, Congressman Blum of Iowa, \nCongressman Massie of Kentucky, Congressman Labrador of Idaho, and \nCongressman Amash of Michigan.\n  I think it is important that the Senate recognize what the people's \nHouse did last week when they passed the USA FREEDOM Act. That vote was \n338 to 88. To suggest that this is just a small minority of Congress \nmen and women who support the USA FREEDOM Act--this is the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and the chairman of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, amongst many \nothers, who want to make sure we strike the right balance between \nprotecting the homeland and protecting our civil liberties.\n  The people of Montana, my colleague from Kentucky, the five Members \nfrom Congress who are here at this moment, and millions of Americans \nknow I strongly agree with their view on the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  Like all Americans, I understand the great risks that face our \nnational security. The threats from ISIS, the threats from North Korea, \nand the threats from Iran grow stronger each and every day. We must be \nprepared. We must ensure our intelligence and law enforcement agencies \nhave the tools they need to protect and defend our Nation. But these \nobjectives--national security and protection of our civil liberties--\nare not mutually exclusive. We can and we must achieve both. We must \nmaintain a balance between protecting our Nation's security while also \nmaintaining our civil liberties and our constitutional rights.\n\n  All of us standing here today took an oath to protect and defend the \nConstitution. I took that oath just a few steps away from where I am \nspeaking here today, between myself and the Presiding Officer's chair, \noccupied at the moment by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee.\n  As all of us here today know, the fight to protect our Constitution \nand America's civil liberties is far from over. We must remain vigilant \nand we must also ensure that we have robust and transparent debate \nabout these programs and what reforms must be implemented to protect \nAmerica's civil liberties. That is why I support the USA FREEDOM Act, \nwhich would end the NSA's bulk metadata collection program and why I \nstrongly believe that Congress must engage in an open amendment \nprocess. The American people must have their voices heard, and an open \namendment process will help ensure that happens.\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\n  In light of all we have learned about the NSA's unlawful bulk data \ncollection program, it is clear that reforms must happen. It is \ncritical that Americans' rights are protected against the overreach of \ntheir own government.\n  So I ask the Senator from Kentucky, would he agree that the \nindiscriminate government collection of Americans' phone records \nviolates the Constitution and, according to two independent \ncommissions, has not proven critical to our national security?\n  (Mr. TILLIS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. PAUL. I wish to thank the Senator from Montana for that excellent \nsynopsis of the issues as well as for the great question.\n  I think the reports by the review committee and the privacy \ncommittee, both commissioned by the President, both nonpartisan, are \nincredibly powerful because not only did they look at the \nconstitutional issue of whether this is a bulk or a general warrant \nversus an individual warrant, they also saw practically that it wasn't \nworking, it wasn't adding anything to our intelligence. So I think we \nhave sort of a dual reason now to say this is a big problem.\n  One, there are constitutional questions, which I think are very \nclear, but then the second practical question is that when we examine \nthe evidence--and the privacy commission actually looked at classified \nevidence; they looked to see whether it was adding anything to this--I \nam thoroughly convinced that we can catch terrorists with traditional \nconstitutional warrants.\n  When I have talked to former high-ranking heads of our security \nagencies, they freely admit they get more information with a warrant. \nIt is a little more work. It has to be more specific. But I am also a \nbeliever in that because we have generalized what we are looking for \nand it is indiscriminate, that maybe we are missing people because we \nare overwhelmed with data. We are overwhelmed with things at the \nairports. I would much prefer that we have less indiscriminate searches \nat the airports and be more specific in looking at the manifests of who \nis flying and trying to find out who are the risks.\n  So I do think that, without question, this is not a constitutional \nprogram. It is not even legal under the PATRIOT Act. The courts have \nsaid it isn't, and we should do everything we can to stop it.\n  I appreciate the support of the Senator from Montana.\n  One of the things about this issue is that it really is a bipartisan \nissue. It is an issue where there are people who feel strongly on both \nsides of the aisle. The Senator from Oregon was here earlier and the \nSenator from New Mexico, and I now see the Senator from West Virginia, \nwho is also a loud and consistent voice on this.\n  Does the Senator from West Virginia have a question?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Kentucky yield?\n  Mr. PAUL. I will, without yielding the floor.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I know the Senator from Kentucky agrees with me that the \ndefense of our country and the protection of our civil liberties should \nbe bipartisan and above politics. I know he agrees that we can and must \nprotect our citizens without violating their civil liberties. Again, I \ndon't always agree with my good friend from Kentucky on every issue, \nbut when it comes to this Nation's intelligence gathering and security, \nwe agree more than we don't.\n  As was he, I was deeply troubled by the revelation that our country \nwas engaged in bulk collection--I think we all were surprised--and that \nmillions of private citizens' data was gathered unknowingly and \nunjustifiably.\n  In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed to the American public that NSA was \nengaging in ``bulk data collection,'' in sweeping up virtually every \ncell phone record of an enormous number of Americans, again for no \nreason. The U.S. spying program did this by systematically and \nindiscriminately collecting millions--I mean millions--of Americans' \nphone records by simply digging up every phone record that came into \nits net even if it wasn't remotely related to a broad, general search. \nThese are not searches that were relevant to a particular threat or an \nindividual group; it was just a huge database of documenting what \nmillions of law-abiding citizens were doing.\n  That is not what this country was based on, and I think the Senator \nfrom Kentucky has made that very clear. I know the Senator from \nKentucky believes this was wrong, as I do. That is not just our \nopinion; national security experts, legal experts, the American public, \nand even several courts have said that the bulk collection of data is \nnot only unconstitutional but also unnecessary to our national \nsecurity. And my friend from Kentucky has confirmed that the \nPresident's review group has said that bulk data collection is not \nessential to preventing attacks and that the program has not made a \ndifference in a single instance.\n  The bill the Senate will soon be considering--the USA FREEDOM Act of \n2015--will ensure that we restore important privacy protections for \nAmericans.\n  The United States will always face security threats--I think we all \nknow that--and we will for generations to come. That is just a reality. \nOn that horrible day of September 11, 2001, we as a country were \nreminded of this fact and realized we must meet those threats with \nstrong law enforcement and strong intelligence. However, we must also \nbalance that necessity with our constitutional rights.\n  The NSA bulk data collection program clearly did not strike that \nbalance, and the District Court of DC and the Court of Appeals of the \nSecond Circuit of the United States struck it down. The courts have \nmade clear that this program is not legal, and I understand the \nfrustration of Senator Paul and Senator Wyden with any suggestion that \nit be continued.\n  I believe this bill, USA FREEDOM 2015, moves us in a positive \ndirection. It ends the bulk data collection program and ensures that \nthe collection of data is related to a relevant, particular terrorist \ninvestigation. At the same time, it still protects this country.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 replaces indiscriminate bulk collection \nand allows the government to collect call detail records on a daily \nbasis if it can demonstrate to the FISA Court a reasonable, articulable \nsuspicion that its search term is associated with a foreign terrorist \norganization.\n  The bill provides greater transparency about surveillance activities. \nIt contains significant new government reporting requirements for FISA \nauthorities to ensure its activities do not again break the law. It \ngives private companies increased options for reporting to the public \ninformation about the number of FISA orders and national security \nletters they receive. The bill requires declassification of FISA Court \nopinions containing significant legal interpretations. The bill \nrequires the FISA Court to designate a panel to appoint individuals to \nadvise in particular cases involving new or difficult legal issues. It \nexpands the opportunity for the appellate review of FISA Court \ndecisions. The bill strengthens the judicial review process for gag \norders, imposes new privacy protections for FISA pen registers, and \nlimits the use of unlawfully obtained information.\n  The bill also contains many provisions to protect our Nation's \nsecurity. It creates a new emergency authority to allow the government \nto obtain business records, including call detail records, without \nadvance court authorization if an emergency requires those records. It \nalso adds a short-term emergency authority for continued transnational \nsurveillance of foreign terrorists or spies who come into the United \nStates before emergency authorization can be obtained from the Attorney \nGeneral. It permits ongoing FISA surveillance of an agent of a foreign \npower who temporarily leaves the United States. It clarifies that \nindividuals can be subject to FISA surveillance if they are knowingly \naiding, abetting, or conspiring with respect to the proliferation of \nWMD on behalf of a foreign power.\n  Finally, the bill increases the statutory maximum penalty for \nmaterial support of terrorism from 15 to 20 years.\n  I know the Senator from Kentucky does not think it goes far enough in \nprotecting our privacy rights, but perhaps my good friend can remind us \nagain of what provisions he would like to see changed or strengthened \nin the bill to satisfy his interests and the interests of Senator Wyden \nand other people.\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\n  I yield the floor back to the Senator from Kentucky to hear basically \nhis concerns and how we can have some protections, and do we have any \nrights whatsoever to gather information when it is proven? I have heard \nthe Senator from Kentucky say that if he thought we could prove it, \nthere was a different concern we had and we could get the FISA Court \ninvolved and basically move forward from there.\n  I thought this bill moved us in a positive direction--the new bill \nbefore the Senate that we are about to consider. I would appreciate it \nif the Senator from Kentucky could explain to me his concerns about \nthat and what we need to do.\n  Mr. PAUL. Let me make sure I have the question correct. The Senator's \nquestion is on my concerns on the USA FREEDOM Act?\n  Mr. MANCHIN. USA FREEDOM 2015.\n  Mr. PAUL. I want to like it because it ends bulk collection, and I am \nall for ending bulk collection. So we all agree--the people for it \nagree with the problem; it is a question of the solution.\n  It says there have to be specific selector terms on U.S. persons. \nPart of my problem is that ``persons'' is still defined as \ncorporations. My concern is that you could put the word ``Verizon'' in \nthere, and the government wouldn't be collecting the records, but you \nstill could get all records from Verizon. Does the Senator see what I \nmean? That is one of my concerns with the way it has been written.\n  My other general concern is that we would still be having bulk \ncollection. It wouldn't be bulk collection by the government, but it \nwould still be bulk collection but through the phone companies.\n  I don't like the liability protection because I think it makes it \nmore likely than not that the privacy agreement won't be as respected \nif they cannot be sued for violating the privacy agreement.\n  Those are a couple of concerns. I don't know if they are \ninsurmountable, but those are a couple of concerns.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I think we both agree and most of the people in this \nbody agree that the bulk collection is wrong. It has been proven to be \nillegal, it shouldn't have been done, and it should be stopped. I think \nwe all agree on that.\n  I think we still face considerable threats from around the world on a \ndaily basis, if not even greater than that. We are looking to try to \nfind a balance, and I think the Senator from Kentucky is valuable in \nhelping us find that balance. That is what we are looking for. I know \nour colleague, Senator Lee from Utah, has made a gallant effort in \ntrying to find that balance and making sure that we don't overstep.\n  The private companies are collecting. They already have that \ninformation anyway. It is not just sweeping from NSA, as they had been \ndoing. Basically, I am understanding by this bill, the USA FREEDOM Act \nof 2015, that basically we would have to demonstrate to the FISA Court \nreasonable, articulate suspicion that its search term is associated \nwith a foreign terrorist organization. They can't even go into those \nrecords until that is shown. That is the way I understood it. I am not \nsure if there is something I am missing.\n  Mr. PAUL. I guess the question I have is that we have some of those \nrestrictions now, but they seem to think that those restrictions don't \napply--the people interpreting what we have now are interpreting 215 to \nmean we can collect all of the American records in bulk.\n  If there were a circumstance where I was necessary to pass USA \nFREEDOM and if it were that close, if people were willing to look at \nthe bill and say we would make a person, an individual-- see, the big \nthing for me is that the warrant should be individualized. And I am \nworried that if we use the word ``person'' and if it can be replaced \nwith the word ``Verizon'' and we still collect all the records, I would \nfeel disappointed if we thought we got rid of bulk collection and a \nyear or 2 from now, when they finally admit it, they admit: Oh, we are \nstill doing the very same thing. We are doing Verizon. We are getting \nall of Verizon's records. We are just making them process it, and we \nare paying them for it.\n\n  That is what I fear. I want to make sure that doesn't happen.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. I guess we are caught in that Citizens United decision, \nit sounds like.\n  Mr. PAUL. In a different way, we are talking about whether in the \nintelligence selector numbers a person is a corporation and whether can \nhave a single warrant.\n  I think if you want phone records from Verizon, it should say \n``Verizon'' and we want the records of John Doe. It shouldn't just say \nthat we want all the records from Verizon. That is a general warrant. I \nam still fearful that the USA FREEDOM Act might not limit that.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. If the FREEDOM Act goes away and the way they are doing \nbulk collection, which we agree should be done away with--and we don't \ncome to some agreement--are you concerned that we might be in more \njeopardy by not having something in place where we are able to get the \nnecessary intelligence we need?\n  Mr. PAUL. I guess that is also where I probably differ. I think we \nare just as safe or safer with nothing, because the Constitution allows \nthe searching of records. And I am all for it, but I would do it \nthrough warrants.\n  The point is that in metadata, one can do a hop or two with these \nless-than-constitutional warrants or whatever. But with a real warrant, \nwe can go 100 hops into the data. I really would chase the rabbit down \nthe hole. I would look very hard with suspicion, and I think warrants \nare generally easy to get. This is the point I don't get about why we \nhave to have warrants with a lower constitutional standard, because I \nthink the FISA warrants are almost never turned down, but neither are \ncriminal warrants. If you are a policeman standing in front of a house, \nyou almost never get a no. But if you are a policeman saying, I want to \nsearch all my neighbors' houses, then the judge is going to say no, and \nthat is a good thing. So I think traditional warrants--I think people \nhave somehow just convinced themselves that we can't catch terrorists \nwith traditional warrants, but I think you can go through a lot of data \nwith traditional warrants, too.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Your sincere belief is that if this sunsets, this bulk \ncollection in the way the PATRIOT Act has been enforced before--if it \nsunsets and it goes away, which we agree that we are trying to replace \nthat before the sunset--you believe the system we have had in place \nbefore the PATRIOT Act of 2001 gives us still the ability to keep the \nhomeland safe, using the court system, as you say, following the rabbit \ndown the hole using the court system? Because we know we have rapid \nfire coming at us from different directions and people trying to come \ninto this country and do harm. Social media has blown up even since \n2001, so we are much more vulnerable from that standpoint.\n  What I am hearing you say also is that you are not really \nobjectionable if you can find the right language--if you thought you \ncould get protection of that individual without the interpretation of \nthe entire broadness of the corporations.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think that also and within the context of--we have six or \nseven amendments that we would like to offer. I can't guarantee that we \ncould win any of them, but there is a chance maybe we could win another \nreform.\n  So for example, one of the reforms that some people think may be as \nimportant as all the bulk collection is the ability of the government \nto tell an Internet provider that they have to create a backdoor to \ntheir product for the government to go through--and some of the \nbackdoor stuff through 702.\n  We think there are some other things that may well be as big as this. \nI also think there is the ability of the government to not only use \ntraditional warrants. They have some they are using under Executive \norder, as well, and we still have a host of other types of warrants and \nsubpoenas being used. But I would never be for this in a heartbeat if I \nthought it was going to put the country in danger. I think we will be \nsafer because of it and so will our liberty.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. It is a good point in the bill that we will be \nconsidering, the 2015 FREEDOM Act. It expands the opportunity for the \nappellate review of the FISA Court decisions, which I think the Senator \nhas had a problem\n\n[[Page S3144]]\n\nwith, too, because it has been handed out, uncontested. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. PAUL. Say that again, please.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. The bill that we will be considering is expanding the \nopportunity for the appellate review of the FISA Court decisions. I \nthink and I can understand that you are saying they can get a FISA \norder no matter what.\n  Mr. PAUL. I am not sure I understand the question, but I do believe \nas to the court case right now, the way it stands--if the USA FREEDOM \nAct had passed last year, I think there was a chance that it might have \nmade the court case moot because it would have said that Congress has \nalready acted and Congress now has given an authority for a variation \nof this and Congress already fixed the problem. So there is a part of \nme that would like to see the appellate court case go up to the Supreme \nCourt. It has been remanded to a lower court so I don't know if it is \never getting there. But we ultimately have some questions in our \ncountry that won't be decided until we have a Supreme Court case.\n  One of those questions is, Do papers have to be physical and in your \nhouse? What if they are digital and lodged somewhere else? Do you have \nany right of privacy, any Fourth Amendment protection at all for \nrecords that are held somewhere else? The current legal opinion doesn't \nreally give any protection to third-party records. I think that needs \nto be fixed, because technology has made it such that our records are \nno longer going to be real records that you can hold in your hand. I \nthink almost all of our records will be virtual and held in space \nsomewhere, and I think you still have to have a personal privacy \nprotection in those.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. So the bill that we have proposed before us, it is going \nto require declassification of FISA Court opinions containing \nsignificant legal interpretation, which is a positive thing.\n  Mr. PAUL. There is a lot that I like in the bill. It is just a matter \nof whether or not I can be convinced that it doesn't allow bulk \ncollection under another name. I am still worried about that. But I am \nopen to it.\n  Some of these things--this is a very important bill. I mean, we could \nhave a week of discussion on this bill, and amendments and a process. \nThe only reason we are getting a little bit of this is because I am \nkind of forcing the issue, but I would like to see the amendments voted \non. All the other stuff we are doing around here is important but has \nno deadline. We could have done it next week or 2 weeks from now--all \nthe stuff we are doing right now.\n  But anyway, that is what I am going to be asking for--the ability to \npresent five or six amendments, vote on them, and then we will see. And \nI am more than willing to talk with the authors of the USA FREEDOM Act \nto see if there is a way, but it is going to have to involve some give \nand take to figure it out.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. It sounds like we are not that far apart. I think we are \nall going down the same path, trying to keep the homeland as secure as \npossible while protecting the rights of all Americans. I appreciate \nthat. I hope that we do. These are important issues. It is a dangerous \nworld that we live in. It is a threatened world that our children are \nbeing raised in. We want to do everything we can to protect them, and I \nknow you do, too.\n  With that, I think we all came to an agreement that what was done \nbefore was wrong. So we all come unanimously to that agreement, and \nfinding a pathway forward is what we are working on now. So I \nappreciate your sincerity and your intent to try and reach out and find \nthat. I hope you can find that comfort level so we can move forward and \nstill have a protected country.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I think he has made \nsome really good points. I think a lot of us have come to the agreement \nthat there is a problem with bulk collection. I don't think we have \neverybody, but I think we have a significant number. The court agrees \nwith us. So I think we are getting closer.\n  One of the groups that we have talked about in looking at where we \nare, whether this is a constitutional or legal program--is it is pretty \nintriguing to look at the report that comes from the Privacy and Civil \nLiberties Oversight Board. This is a bipartisan board. It is a board \nthat was put in place, and I think the appointees are bipartisan \nappointees.\n  When they met, they came to the conclusion, though, that the bulk \ncollection of records is not warranted and not given sanction by the \nPATRIOT Act. They had four different reasons why they say that the \ntelephone records program--the bulk collection of our records--does not \ncomply even with the PATRIOT Act. The first reason they say is that \nthere is no connection to any specific FBI investigation at the time of \nthe collection. So, basically, when they collect your phone records, \nthey are not even alleging that they are related to any investigation. \nBut that is what the statute says. They are supposed to be relevant to \nan investigation, but there is no evidence and nothing is even \npresented that there is any investigation even going on. The \ninvestigation actually starts after they have collected all of your \nrecords.\n  So how can section 215 say that you can collect these records because \nthey are relevant to an investigation that has not yet even begun? They \nuse this big data case later on when they say there is going to be an \ninvestigation. So I think their No. 1 reason is pretty strong. There \ncan't be a connection or relevancy because there really is no \ninvestigation when they collect your records.\n  The second reason of the privacy commission was that the records are \ncollected in bulk, potentially encompassing all telephone calling \nrecords across the Nation. They cannot be regarded as relevant to any \ninvestigation without redefining the word ``relevant'' in a manner that \nis circular. Relevant sort of means that there is some sort of criteria \nthat means that there is some pertinence, that there is something about \nthe records or something about the investigation.\n  For example, if there is someone in the northwest section of \nWashington, DC, and we saw something happen there. We are saying we \nwant to look at the records there. Even though it might be bulk \ncollection, it would be at least relevant to some sort of \ninvestigation. There would be some pertinent factor. But they are just \ncollecting everybody's records. It is completely without any relevancy. \nAnd I love the way they put it--that this would not be relevant unless \nwe redefine the word relevant in a manner that is circular, unlimited \nin scope, and out of step with case law from analogous legal context \ninvolving production of records.\n  The third reason why the privacy board said that this program is not \nlegal is that it operates by putting telephone companies under an \nobligation to furnish new calling records on a daily basis as they are \ngenerated, instead of turning over records they already have in their \npossession. This is an approach lacking foundation in the statute and \none that is inconsistent with FISA as a whole.\n  The final reason they say that this program is illegal--this is the \nPresident's own privacy commission--is that the statute permits only \nthe FBI to obtain items for use in the investigation. It does not \nauthorize the NSA to do anything. So section 215 of the PATRIOT Act is \nwhat they are saying they are using as justification. It allows the FBI \nto collect records. It doesn't allow the NSA at all. So they are using \na statute that was intended for the FBI to say the NSA can do this. So \nI think the reasons are pretty clear--four specific reasons why the \nPATRIOT Act does not justify the collection of these records.\n  The next thing the policy committee looked at was they looked at and \nthey tried to decide whether there has been any practical effect. I \nknow Senator Leahy was a part of this, looking at whether any of these \nthings actually did catch terrorists. But this is what they concluded, \nand they actually looked at the classified data. So the Privacy and \nCivil Liberties Oversight Board looked at the data, looked at the \nclassified data, and this is their conclusion:\n\n       However, we conclude that the Section 215 program, the bulk \n     collection, has shown minimal value in safeguarding the \n     nation from terrorism. . . . we have not identified a single \n     instance involving a threat to the United States in which the \n     [bulk collection] program made a concrete difference in the \n     outcome of a counterterrorism investigation.\n\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\n\n  Those are pretty strong words. The Policy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board commissioned by the President, which is bipartisan, \nlooked at the classified data and said it didn't find a single \nincident--not one incident--in which it made a concrete difference in \nthe outcome of a counterterrorism investigation.\n\n       Moreover, we are aware of no instance in which the program \n     directly contributed to the discovery of a previously unknown \n     terrorist. . . .\n\n  What does this mean? We are not pushing a button and generating \nterrorists out of this. The terrorists are coming from real \ninformation. You have to realize that this misinformation and this \nwrong-headed information has been used forever--for 15 years--to \njustify the fact that we should give up on the Fourth Amendment and we \nshould give up on protections.\n  Over and over people say that if we only had the PATRIOT Act, we \nwouldn't have had 9/11. The two terrorists they claim we would have \ngotten were in San Diego. We already knew about them. An informant \nlived with them for a year. The FBI wasn't talking to the CIA, they \nweren't looking at lists, and they didn't know they would come back. \nThe CIA didn't know. It had nothing to do with having bulk collection \nof our records. We knew about these people. It was crummy work. It was \npeople not doing their job.\n  I repeat: No one was ever fired. We gave rewards. We gave medals of \nhonor to everybody in the intelligence community and no one was ever \nfired. There were some true heroes--the FBI agent in Arizona and the \nFBI agent in Minnesota who actually discovered potential hijackers. The \n20th hijacker was captured before 9/11. The 20th hijacker was captured \na month before 9/11. That is the person who should have gotten the \nMedal of Honor. The person who would not listen to him should have been \nfired. I have no understanding or awareness that anybody was ever fired \nover 9/11.\n\n  The Policy and Civil Liberties Board goes on to say that our review \nsuggests that section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the bulk collection of \nrecords, offers little unique value. They explore a little bit of \nwhether there is a privacy problem with collecting all of these records \nand what are the implications of collecting all of these records. The \ngovernment's collection of a person's entire telephone call history has \na significant and detrimental effect on an individual's privacy.\n  Beyond such individual privacy intrusions, permitting the government \nto routinely collect calling records of the entire Nation fundamentally \nshifts the balance of power between the State and its citizens. With \nits power of compulsion and criminal prosecution, the government \npossesses unique threats to privacy when it collects data on its own \ncitizens.\n  Compound this with the fact that the government--you could say: Well, \nthey are just collecting this data at a lower standard, but if you are \nnot a terrorist you do not have to worry. But here is the problem. They \nare collecting this data with the lower standard, a less-than-\nconstitutional standard, but then they are also prosecuting you for \ndomestic crime.\n  Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act is being used 99.5 percent of the time \nfor domestic crime. We are putting drug dealers in jail. That is \nanother question and another story. But then we should vote on it as a \ncountry. OK. For drug dealers, we are not going to have the \nConstitution anymore, we are going to have the PATRIOT Act for drug \ndealers. Let's be honest about it. The war on drugs has had a disparate \nimpact, a disproportionate impact on people of color. So you have to \nadmit to all the young Black men and all the young Brown men you put in \nprison that we are no longer using the Constitution to stick you in \nprison, we are using the PATRIOT Act to put you in prison.\n  We need to be honest with people. If the PATRIOT Act is about \nterrorism, they should adopt my amendment that says you cannot be put \nin jail for a domestic crime under the PATRIOT Act. Why? Because the \nPATRIOT Act has dumbed down and loosened the standards. We do not have \nprobable cause, we have relevance. Realize that relevance, as they say \nin the Commission, has become completely circular and devoid of \nmeaning, if you are saying that all the records in the country are \nsomehow relevant to an investigation that has not yet begun.\n  They make a great point here about the fact that not only does this \nstifle or invade your privacy, it may well stifle your speech and your \nassociation. If you are going to be associating with minority causes, \nunpopular causes, whether you are a kid from the North who went down to \nbe in favor of civil rights, whether you are someone who belongs to the \nNAACP or the ACLU, they say: Yet, even though there is no evidence of \nabuse--\n  And this is the big argument. Everyone says: Well, there has never \nbeen any abuse, so it is fine to keep doing this.\n\n       Yet, while the danger of abuse may seem remote, given \n     historical abuse of personal information by the government \n     during the 20th century, the risk is more than theoretical.\n\n  I could not agree more. Moreover, the bulk collection of telephone \nrecords can be expected to have a chilling effect on the free exercise \nof speech and association because individuals and groups engaged in \nsensitive or controversial work have less reason to trust in the \nconfidentiality of their relationships as revealed by their calling \npatterns.\n  Realize that they are taking your phone records, your calling lists, \nyour buddy lists, your ISP address, your email. They are integrating \nthis into some network where they can pull your name up and find out \nwho are all your buddies, who are all your friends, who are all your \nFacebook friends.\n  Realize the potential danger of having so much information, so much \nof a dossier on every American citizen, even if they are not using it. \nBut when you think that, well, this is fine because we are not doing it \nand good people are running these agencies, realize that the head of \nthe Agency lied to us about this program at all. He said it did not \nexist. So when you get to be trusting these people to protect your \nindividual information, realize that the most--at the very top of the \nintelligence community, the most famous person in our country dealing \nwith intelligence lied to a congressional committee and said that this \nprogram did not even exist.\n  The report goes on to say that the inability to expect privacy, vis-\na-vis the government and one's telephone communications, means that \npeople engaged in wholly lawful activities, but who for reasons \njustifiably do not wish the government to know about their \ncommunications, must either forgo such activities, reduce their \nfrequency or take costly measures to hide them from the government \nsurveillance.\n  The telephone records program thus hinders the ability of advocacy \norganizations to communicate confidentially with members, donors, \nlegislators, whistleblowers, members of the public.\n  Initially, in the 1970s when we set up the surveillance court, the \nsecurity court, the FISA Court, they were done with individualized \nwarrants. They got information through individualized warrants.\n  Beginning in 2004, though, the role of the security court changed \nwhen the government approached the court with its first request to \napprove a program involving what is now referred to as bulk collection. \nFor the first several years, we did bulk collection--they just did it. \nThey just said it was under the inherent authorities of the President. \nThis should scare us because there are people who believe that the \ninherent authorities of the President are unlimited. That would not be \na President. There would be another name for that.\n  But if there are no limits to what the President can do, there is \nanother name for it and it is not President. The Commission goes on to \nsay that the judge's decision--their decisionmaking would be clearly \nenhanced if they could hear opposing views. So the privacy commission \nadvocates exactly what I am advocating for, that you should have a \nlawyer in there with you and that there should be an adversarial type \nof procedure.\n  Because the thing is, is that it is like any other dispute. If you \nhave ever heard two people arguing, figuring out the truth is listening \nto both sides and trying to gather what the truth is. So I think that \nwe get to the truth a lot more if we had someone asking questions. \nRealize also that section 215 of the PATRIOT Act says that the \ninformation has to be relevant to an investigation.\n\n[[Page S3146]]\n\n  Without having someone in there to argue your case, the court appears \nto have not really had a great deal of discussion or, to my mind, \nthought about whether bulk collection is somehow relevant. You might \nargue that if there were opposing sides, as in a traditional court, \nthat maybe someone would stand up and say to the judge: How can this be \nrelevant? What investigation is it relevant to?\n  See, I think the FISA Court became such a rubberstamp that you were \nnot even having these questions asked because how could you ask that \nquestion. If you are an advocate for someone who does not want to give \nup their information, how could you ask the question whether it is \nrelevant to an investigation, and then the government would say: Well, \nwe are going to do it. It will be relevant when we do an investigation.\n  No court, you would think, would understand or accept that, if it \nwere an adversarial procedure where you have a lawyer on both sides. I \ndon't think you can truly have justice--I think you can have a court \nthat meets in secret. I think courts can protect individual names and I \nwant them to. I thought Senator Wyden made a great point when he was \nout here.\n  Intelligence activities, at their core, we have to protect the names \nof operatives. You do not want the code out there, like if we have a \ngreat code and we are stealing information from our enemies and we are \neavesdropping on our enemies, we do not want the code out there that \nshows how smart we are and how our technology works. But if we are \ngoing to do something like collect the records of all Americans, that \nis a constitutional question.\n  You can have opinions on both sides of it. I do not think there is \nmuch of a valid constitutional reason for believing in this. But you \ncan have an opinion. In a democratic Republic, we could argue these \npoints back and forth. But you really would have to have the ability to \nhave a discussion over those things. Because I think without that, I do \nnot think we can actually get to justice.\n  Mr. COONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I would yield for a question but not yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I am wondering whether the Senator from \nKentucky would be good enough to confirm for me where I think the issue \nis that is before the Senate today. So if I might, I will speak for a \nfew minutes about what I think is the core issue before us on the floor \nand then ask the Senator whether he would confirm that this is his \nunderstanding as well.\n  At the outset, I will say it is relatively rare for my colleague from \nKentucky and I to come to the floor in agreement on an issue, but it \nhas happened before on exactly this issue. I think it is important that \nit be clear to folks that there are concerns on both sides of the aisle \non the critical underlying issues about how we balance privacy and \nliberty, security and our civil liberties.\n  For nearly a decade, our government has operated a program that \ncollects massive amounts of information from innocent Americans without \nany specific suspicion they have done anything wrong. Let me put that \nanother way. For years, any American's communication data could have \nbeen tracked and collected by the government, whether or not they were \nsuspected of a crime.\n  That program has been carried out under Section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct based on flimsy or mistaken interpretations of the original law, \nall in the name of our national security. Yet the bulk collection \nprogram has had disputed and not arguably clear benefit to our national \nsecurity. There is not one clear publicly confirmed instance of a plot \nbeing foiled because of this section 215 program. I have long been \nconcerned about the scope and the reach of our intelligence community's \nbulk collection program.\n  That is why in 2011 I voted, along with my colleague from Kentucky, \nagainst the straight reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act. I believed \nthen, as I believe now, it would be irresponsible for Congress to \ncontinue reauthorizing the law without taking steps to address concerns \nabout unlawful surveillance it has allowed, particularly given the fact \nthat earlier this month a U.S. Federal circuit court specifically \ndeemed this program illegal.\n  Fortunately, we have an alternative, which I believe the Senator from \nKentucky has been expounding on behalf of, the USA FREEDOM Act, a \nbipartisan bill passed by the House just last week by an overwhelming \nmargin--I think it was 338 to 88. It would end bulk collection by only \nallowing the Federal Government to seek call records retained by the \ntelecommunications industry once it has established a record is \nrelevant to an ongoing investigation.\n  Records would no longer be stored by the government but would remain \nin the hands of telecommunications companies, which under FCC rules, in \norder to ensure that there is customer access to records in the case of \na dispute, they are retained for 18 months. This bill strikes an \nimportant balance by protecting American's privacy and ensuring our \ngovernment can still keep our Nation safe.\n  In fact, there are some who might argue that the USA FREEDOM Act \nwould allow a stronger and more robust and more effective series of \nactions to keep our Nation safe. I urge my colleagues to support it. I \nknow these are difficult decisions for us to make. I know we all have \nconcerns about our Nation's security, but we have to all have concerns \nabout our Nation's freedom.\n  We fought for it from the very beginning of our country. I want to \njust thank and salute Members here, colleagues, and in particular my \ncolleague from Kentucky for being insistent that we have clarity about \ntime. We were told 4 years ago, when the reauthorization fight was \nhappening, that time had run out and that we needed to reauthorize it, \nwithout considering needed reforms that were discussed and debated in \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Two years ago, some of the core elements of this were exposed to the \nworld. A lot of my constituents raised legitimate and serious concerns \nabout it. Whether we are being asked to extend it for 2 week or 2 days \nor 2 hours, I think time has run out for us to even discuss \nreauthorizing a program that has explicitly been held illegal. We \ninstead need to come together and take up and pass the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  Would my colleague from Kentucky confirm that is the situation on the \nfloor at the moment and on behalf of which he was speaking?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think what is still unclear to me is what will be taken \nup and what votes there will be on this. I believe that the debate is a \nvery important one, that it is one we should engage in and have a \nsignificant time to talk about, and there should be amendments. As you \nknow, sometimes the amendments get offered and then things sort of fall \naway.\n  I want to ensure that on something this important that comes up only \nonce every 3 years and on which the court just below the Supreme Court \nhas said we are doing something illegal, that we don't just gloss over \nand say we are going to keep on doing something the courts have said is \nillegal.\n  As far as the end result of where it goes, I want to end bulk \ncollection. So I agree with all of the people on the USA FREEDOM side. \nI am a little concerned that we might be transferring government bulk \ncollection to privately held bulk collection.\n  In the selector terms they use in the USA FREEDOM Act, it says \n``person.'' It says ``specific person.'' I think it defines ``person,'' \nthough, as still including corporations. My concern is that you could \nwrite into specific person ``Verizon'' again, and we are back where we \nstarted.\n  So if we could get to a point of, No. 1, allowing some amendments to \nbe voted on and maybe changing it such that you can't have--see, to me, \nthe biggest issue here is a general versus a specific warrant. I don't \nwant warrants that you can get everybody's records all at once or even \none company's. I want the warrant to say--and I am fine with getting \nterrorists. I want to get terrorists. If John Doe is a potential \nterrorist, put his name on it. You can go as deep as you want into the \nphone records, but do specific warrants. But I don't like it if you \njust say: I want everybody's records from a phone company.\n  So I am concerned that we are trading one bulk collection for another \nform, and I need to be a little more assured on that. I think there \nmight be\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nroom for it if people were open to discussion on how we could figure \nout a way to get something through because it is going to difficult, as \nyou know, to get to 60. It is going to be hard either way. The other \nside wants the bulk collection, and if people want the bulk collection, \nthey want more of it. And then there are at least half of us who think \nit is the wrong thing to do.\n  I don't know the outcome, but I was uncertain enough that I came \ntoday to come to try to draw attention to it. And if I had a request \ntoday, it would be the leadership to let amendments to go forward, that \nwe agree on having a pretty free amendment process.\n  This is only every 3 years, and it is a big deal. We don't have much \nlegislation come before us where an activity has been said to be \nillegal by an appellate court, we continue to do it, and then people \nwant to advocate to continue to do something that is illegal. But I am \ngoing to try to see what I can get. I am hoping to get an answer--maybe \ntoday--from leadership on whether they will allow amendments to this. I \nwant to be pretty certain that is going to happen because they seem to \nfall away sometimes.\n  Mr. TESTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. PAUL. I want to continue to keep the floor. I yield for a \nquestion without losing the floor.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Kentucky \nfor what he is doing. I think this is very important, and I stand here \ntoday with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to protect \nAmericans' privacy rights.\n  I am very much concerned by the overreach we have seen in the name of \nnational security, and I oppose efforts to reauthorize any piece of it \nwithout real reforms.\n  Folks in Montana know I have been an opponent of the PATRIOT Act \nsince it was signed into law. Why? Because the PATRIOT Act violates \nlaw-abiding citizens' rights to privacy--something we hold dear in this \ncountry. We do need to make this country as secure as we possibly can, \nbut we cannot do that at the expense of our constitutional rights.\n  It has been talked about here earlier today that a Federal court \nrecently ruled that the NSA bulk data collections are illegal, flat \nillegal. But keep in mind that the NSA used the PATRIOT Act to \nauthorize those data collections. Yet, in the Senate, some of our \ncolleagues think we should reauthorize those expiring provisions \nwithout even having a debate on the merits. We have seen this before. \nIt has happened several times since I have been in the Senate.\n  Trying to jam an extension of the PATRIOT Act through the Senate at \nthe last minute is not fair to this body, and it is not fair at all to \nthe American people. We deserve a real debate on privacy and security \nin the Senate. It is too important of an issue not to. We have to put \nsome sideboards on our national intelligence agencies so that they can \nkeep us safe without violating our constitutional rights. We need a \nreal debate on this issue.\n  Last week, the majority leader made a decision to deprive the Senate \nand the public of debate by taking up a trade bill which we could have \npassed in June. No doubt about it, we are approaching the Memorial Day \nrecess. Some folks are anxious to go home, but we have work to do. I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that we make real \nreforms to the PATRIOT Act. If the people in this body don't know that \nthis is important, they don't know the Constitution.\n  I thank everybody who spoke on the floor today. We need to have a \ndebate. We need to have a debate on what the PATRIOT Act is about, how \nit is being utilized, and how we need to move forward. An extension is \nnot acceptable.\n  I yield the floor back to the Senator from Kentucky and thank him for \nthe work he has done on this issue.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator from Montana, and I think that is \nfurther evidence that there is bipartisan support for the Constitution.\n  The PATRIOT Act went too far. We have heard from both Senators from \nMontana, from opposite parties, who both wanted to defend the \nindividual, wanted to defend the Bill of Rights, and think that we have \nlet the government go too far. I think the American people agree with \nthis as well.\n  I think without question--this is one of those things that are kind \nof perplexing, if you think about it. If you ask most Americans, if you \ndo a poll or a survey or ask most Americans ``Should the government be \nallowed to look at your phone records without any suspicion that you \nhave committed a crime?'' I think there are a very low number who think \nthat. But then when you get to Washington, it is almost the opposite. \nYou have people in Washington who have, I think, viewpoints that are \nreally out of step with what the American people want.\n  I think the American people really have decided that the bulk \ncollection of records is wrong, that it is unconstitutional. The second \nhighest court in the land has said it is illegal. Yet, you still have a \nsignificant body of people in this country saying: Not only keep doing \nit, let's do more of it.\n  The problem is that if we are going to allow records to be collected \nwithout individualized suspicion, what we are doing is allowing \nsomething, when we talk about bulk collection, that has no sort of \ndeterminants for what suspicion is. You can imagine what the danger of \nthat is if you apply that to everything.\n  Also, in an age where we have computers that can analyze and hold so \nmuch information--they are building them bigger and bigger and \ngathering more and more and processing this information--there is great \ndanger that could come from this.\n  I wrote something about ``1984'' a couple of years ago, and I said \nwhen I read it the first time--and a new big brother, you know, was the \ndanger of all these things. I thought, Oh, this is terrible. But I felt \ncomforted. I read it probably in 1978.\n  We didn't have the technology to eavesdrop on everyone. We didn't \nhave the technology to know everyone's whereabouts. We didn't have the \ntechnology to have cameras in every house.\n  In the book, they talked about looking at people back and forth \nthrough two-way televisions and monitoring. Everybody, as you know, had \nto be careful where books were placed. You had to read in secret \nbasically. But because the technology didn't exist when I read \n``1984,'' I really wasn't as concerned about it. But the thing is that \nyou don't lose your freedom in one fell swoop; you lose it a little bit \nat a time.\n  People say: Well, the people doing this are good people.\n  It is like the President said. When the President signed legislation \na few years ago that said that an American citizen can be detained \nwithout a trial, he said: But I am a good man, and I won't use this \npower.\n  It is sort of a fundamental misunderstanding of law and the rule of \nlaw that you think that the goodness of yourself or the goodness of the \nindividuals around you somehow is the protection of the law. The law is \nreally to protect you against bad people. The law is to protect you \nwhen bad people get in office. The law--and those who believe in the \nrule of law--is based on the fact that there is an understanding that \nin the time of history, people were democratically elected who were bad \npeople and that people, once given power, become addicted to it and \nthey want more of it.\n  Lincoln once wrote that any man can stand adversity, but if you want \nto truly challenge a man, give him power. That is what we are talking \nabout. We are talking about unlimited power. We are not even talking \nabout power that is constrained by law at all.\n  The whole idea that the PATRIOT Act has anything to do with the bulk \ncollection is a farce. The President's privacy commission has really \nput this in bold for us, that really there is nothing about the PATRIOT \nAct that has any resemblance to what we are doing with bulk collection. \nSo that is not only the rule of law, that is people within government, \nwithin the executive branch, who have made the decision that they are \ngoing to do whatever they want.\n  One of the things that worries me about this debate--and I think it \nis good that we are having the debate--there is apparently a section of \nthe PATRIOT Act as we passed it the last time that says that if the \nPATRIOT Act is not extended, all things previously being investigated \nbefore will continue. So we really kind of have a perpetual PATRIOT \nAct, if you will. That worries me a little bit, but then it\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\nworries me a little more that we are not even really paying attention \nto the PATRIOT Act; we are doing whatever we want. It is sort of a \nlawlessness that allows us to collect bulk records because there is no \nrelevance to an investigation. As they said in the privacy commission, \nwe are collecting the records before there is any investigation. So \nthere is no relevancy to an investigation. The investigation hasn't \nstarted yet, unless the investigation could be defined as everything.\n  I like the way they put it. They said we would have to destroy the \ndefinition of ``relevancy'' to believe that there is any component of \nrelevancy to these investigations.\n  But we are collecting records of every American all of the time right \nnow. It may not be just phone records; they say the biggest source of \ncollection now is probably actually through section 702 of FISA, the \nFISA amendments. We are not exactly clear who gets scooped up in that.\n  Once again, if these are the records of foreigners, if these are the \nrecords of people bent upon attacking us, I am all for getting that. \nBut the way they are collected--and by some allegations, intentionally \nso--we are sometimes targeting a foreigner, so we don't have to use a \nstandard at all in order to get information on an American.\n  So let's say they want information on you. I am not sure why, because \nsome of this is being used for drug crimes and domestic crimes. So \nlet's say they want information on you and they don't want to get a \nwarrant or a judge says no. In fact, that sometimes happens, that the \nFISA Court judge says no and then they use one of these other end-\naround ways that don't even require a FISA Court judge.\n  The level of lawlessness is appalling. The level of lawlessness is \nastounding. It disappoints me that the President, who was once \nconsidered by some to be somewhat of a civil libertarian, does nothing. \nWhen the President ran for office, the President said that national \nsecurity letters ought to be signed by judges. He was in the exact same \nplace where I am on civil liberties with regard to these warrants, the \nnational security letters. Yet, his administration issues them by the \nhundreds of thousands. I don't think they are even reporting these \nanymore for us. I think they were reporting them for a few years, but \nwe are no longer getting information.\n  But it disappoints me that the President is not really willing to do \nanything about this. The President could end the bulk collection \ntomorrow. It is done by Executive order; it could be undone by \nExecutive order.\n  It is disingenuous, at the very least, that the President says: Oh, \nyes, we are going to balance liberty and security.\n  Well, no, he is not. He is not balancing anything. He is just \ncontinuing to collect all of our records without a warrant. He is \ncontinuing to do bulk or general collection of records without a \nwarrant.\n  I think the American people are ready for us to be done with this. My \nhope is that during today we will call attention to this and that the \nAmerican people will say: Who are these people who want to keep \ncollecting our records without a warrant, and why do they still want to \ndo this when the people who have investigated it have determined that \nno one has been captured by this program, no one has been uniquely \nidentified by this program?\n  So there really is a consideration of whether we are going to listen \nto the American people. Are we going to wake up? Are we a \nrepresentative body?\n  This question is, Are we going to allow a debate on something that \nonly comes around every 3 years or are we going to say ``My goodness, \nit is the weekend, it is Memorial Day weekend, and we are up against a \ndeadline, and we just don't have time to listen to this. We don't have \ntime to talk about the Bill of Rights because we just don't have time. \nI know it has been 3 years that we have known this date was coming up, \nbut we don't have time''?\n\n  I think at the very least we could make time, and that is my request \ntoday. My request of the leadership on both sides of the aisle is: Can \nwe not make time? There are at least 10 or 15 of us who will cosponsor \nabout 5 or 6 amendments that we want votes on. Frankly, I think with \nthe mood of the country, we have a chance on a few of these.\n  I would like to see how a vote would turn out on the idea, for \nexample, that we are using a less-than-constitutional standard to \ngather information that we say is for terrorism, but then we put people \nin jail domestically for crimes that are completely and entirely \nunrelated to terrorism; that whether or not we can use information \ngathered in a nonconstitutional or a less-than-constitutional way is \ngoing to be used for domestic crime.\n  If you believe that, it means we are carving out in our domestic laws \nan area where the Constitution doesn't entirely apply. Section 213 \nallows the entering of the house in a nonconstitutional way--a way \nthat, if it were done in a straight-up fashion, the courts would say it \nis illegally gathered information and wouldn't be admissible in court.\n  I think we ought to have a vote. Is the PATRIOT Act our less-than-\nconstitutional means of gathering information to be used in domestic \ncourt?\n  Here is the other question, if they will be honest with us: Are they \nusing them in any other courts? Are there IRS investigations that begin \nas terrorist investigations but end up in IRS court?\n  In some ways, I think yes is the answer. We have now the IRS basing \ninvestigations of people maybe for political purposes but definitely \nfor the purposes of whether individuals are doing transactions in \ncertain ways or whether their records are in a certain way. And because \nit is done this way, we are not really requiring convictions before we \ntake their stuff. This is a separate but related problem because it has \nto do with using records to gain entrance to people and to then take \ntheir stuff without a conviction.\n  I think that is an important question. Are we innocent until proven \nguilty? Are we really going to allow the government to take possession \nof your things, to take possession of your things without a conviction? \nI would think the presumption of innocence is an incredibly important \ndoctrine that we shouldn't so casually dismiss.\n  This is a poll that was commissioned by the ACLU on Monday, and they \nasked a sample of 300 likely voters between the ages of 18 and 39 a few \nquestions.\n  It says: Which of the following statements about reauthorizing the \nPATRIOT Act do you agree with more?\n  Some people say Congress should modify the PATRIOT Act to limit \ngovernment surveillance and protect Americans' privacy. Sixty percent \nagreed.\n  Other people say Congress should preserve the PATRIOT Act and make no \nchanges because it has been effective in keeping America safe from \nterrorists and other threats to national security, like ISIS or Al \nQaeda. That was 34 percent.\n  Those are the overall numbers. If you look at it by all parties--\nDemocrats, Independents, and GOP--it is 58 percent or greater. In fact, \nDemocrats and Republicans are pretty equal, which is interesting, with \n59 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Republicans thinking we have \ngone too far in the PATRIOT Act and that Americans' privacy is being \ndisturbed by the PATRIOT Act.\n  If you look at Independents, it is 75 percent among men who are \nIndependent and 65 percent among women who are Independent.\n  The survey asked people: Do you find it concerning the U.S. \nGovernment is collecting and storing your personal information, like \nyour phone records, emails, bank statements, and other communications? \nEighty-two percent are concerned the government is storing this \ninformation.\n  Over three-quarters of voters found four different examples of \ngovernment spying personally concerning to them: The government \naccessing personal communications, information or records without a \njudge's permission--83 percent--using that information for things other \nthan stopping terrorists, such as I mentioned, doing convictions for \ndrugs, were the most compelling examples for voters.\n  With regard to whether the government accesses any of your personal \ncommunications, information or records you share with a company without \na judge's permission, people were asked to tell them whether they were \nconcerned with this issue. Eighty-three percent were concerned.\n  When asked about the government using information collected without a\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nwarrant for things other than stopping terrorist attacks, 83 percent \nwere concerned.\n  When asked about the government allowing private companies to use \npublic school technology programs to track online activities of \nschoolchildren, 77 percent were concerned.\n  When asked if the government performs instant wiretaps on any phone \nor other telecommunications devices located in the United States, 76 \npercent were concerned.\n  From this ACLU study of young people--I believe they were all ages 18 \nto 39--participants were asked whether or not these were conditions \nthat would lead you to believe that Americans need more protections of \ntheir privacy: Local police and the FBI need a warrant issued by an \nindependent judge for a valid reason before they search your home or \nproperty without your permission; the same should be true of your email \nand phone records. And 84 percent agreed.\n  If you ask that question in Washington, it is about a 10 or 15 \npercent question. Most people in Washington don't think your email or \nyour phone records should be protected by needing a warrant. But if you \nask most Americans the question--particularly young Americans--should \nyour email or your phone records be protected by a warrant? Most people \nsay yes.\n  The government requires some companies to intentionally include \nsecurity loopholes in their services to make it easier for law \nenforcement to access your information. These are these backdoor things \nwhere they can insert malware. This makes the government less safe by \nleaving us vulnerable to terrorists and spies of foreign countries who \nwant to harm the United States. Eighty-one percent were concerned with \nthis and thought we should have more privacy.\n  I think it is clear the American people are concerned about what we \nare doing. What isn't yet clear is whether the message has been \ntransmitted to Washington; whether or not there is enough of a majority \ngrowing in Washington to actually do something about this. But I think \nthe numbers are growing.\n  Over 300 people in the House acknowledged there was a problem and \npassed legislation. I have mixed feelings on the legislation. I think, \nwithout question, I agree with those who voted for it that bulk \ncollection of records is wrong and that it should end. I have been a \nlittle more in the camp, though, that we should just end the bulk \ncollection of records and replace it not with a new program but with \nthe Constitution.\n  I personally think we could survive with the Constitution. I think we \ncould also survive and catch terrorists with the Constitution. In fact, \nI think we can get more information with the Constitution. I think \nvalid warrants are much more powerful. A valid warrant allows a great \ndeal more information and it is also specific.\n  Once we are doing valid warrants, we are not doing this sort of \ndragnet. We are not doing this sort of vacuuming up of everything. We \nare not becoming overwhelmed with a lot of incidental data. We are \nspecifically going to the heart of things. We are specifically going to \nthe core of whether we can actually get the people who are attacking \nus.\n  When we look at the privacy report we have talked a little bit \nabout--the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, a bipartisan \nboard that basically said very explicitly to the President that what he \nwas doing is illegal--it does still boggle my mind the President was \ntold by his own privacy board what he was doing was illegal and he just \nkeeps doing it. It somewhat boggles the mind that he was told by the \nappellate court that what he is doing is illegal and yet he just keeps \ndoing it.\n  It is an incredible deflection. It is incredibly disingenuous when \nthe President says: Well, we are going to balance liberty and security, \nand I am just waiting for Congress to tell me what to do. Well, he \ndidn't wait for Congress to tell him to collect the phone records. In \nfact, we never did such a thing.\n  Even the people intimately involved with passing the PATRIOT Act--\nthose who were the cosponsors and authors of the PATRIOT Act--have all \nsaid they never intended and don't believe the PATRIOT Act gives any \njustification for bulk collection of records. So Congress never \nauthorized the bulk collection of records.\n  Two different Commissions the President has put forward--the privacy \nand civil liberties as well as the review commission--have both told \nhim it is illegal. Yet he keeps going on.\n  I have heard very little questioning of the President or his people \nabout this. I kind of wonder why we don't ask more questions, why we \njust sort of accept that a program that is said to be illegal by the \ncourts, a program that is said to be illegal by two different \nindependent commissions--why wouldn't we just stop it? Why does the \nPresident not have the wherewithal to stop it? It disappoints me.\n  The program was actually begun even before the PATRIOT Act was \nfinalized. We did this for a couple of years simply by Presidential \nedict. This is another concerning development in our country; that more \nand more of our government is run by Executive edict or by Executive \norder--thousands and thousands of Executive orders.\n  In the 1950s, we had a discussion of Executive orders. I think it is \nthe only time it has gone to the Supreme Court with the Youngstown \nSteel case. In that case, the Court came down and said there are three \ndifferent kinds of Executive orders: There are Executive orders that \nare clearly in furtherance of legislative action, and those are \nperfectly legal. There are Executive orders that are debatable, whether \nthey further legislative action or not. But then there are some \nExecutive orders that are clearly in defiance of what the legislature \nhas done, and these are clearly illegal. And the Supreme Court struck \ndown what Truman had done.\n  I think we need to revisit that debate. Because what is happening in \nour country--and it may well be the biggest problem in the country and \nis part of what is going on with this bulk collection but really is \npart of a bigger problem--is that power has drifted away from Congress \nor has been abdicated and given up. We gave the power to the \nPresidency, and we didn't do it just in one fell swoop. It wasn't just \nRepublicans. It wasn't just Democrats. It was a little bit of both, and \nit has been going on for probably over 100 years now. I think it \naccelerated in the era of Wilson, but over decades it has gotten bigger \nand bigger and bigger. Under the New Deal, the executive branch grew an \nalarming amount, but more recently it continues to grow by leaps and \nbounds.\n  It may well be that the No. 1 issue we face as a country is that we \nhave had what some have described as a collapse in the separation of \npowers. Madison talked about that each branch would have ambition to \nprotect their own power; so we would pit ambition against ambition and \nthen each would jealously guard their power, and, as such, power \nwouldn't grow. Power would be checked. But power has grown. It has \ngrown alarmingly so and mostly grown and gravitated to the executive \nbranch.\n  In the short time I have been here, I have seen that in many ways the \nleast of our bureaucrats are more powerful probably in some ways than \nthe greatest of our legislators, and the most powerful of our \nlegislators are somewhat of less power than bureaucrats.\n  Almost every constituent that comes to talk to me from Kentucky and \nhas a problem with government--as we explore the problem and explore \nthe solution, we discover that Congress didn't pass their problem. \nCongress didn't write the rule that is beleaguering them. Congress \ndidn't inflict the punishment that is making it difficult for them to \nrun their business. It was done by an unelected bureaucrat.\n  This has grown, and sometimes it has grown from even when we had good \nintentions. We tried to do the right thing and it turned out wrong. \nProbably that is really the story of Washington as well.\n  Take even the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act I support. I would \nhave voted for it from 1974. It says you can't discharge pollutants \ninto a navigable stream. I agree with that. The problem is that over \nabout a 40-year period we have come to define dirt as a pollutant and \nmy backyard as a navigable stream. So, once again, we have taken our \neye off the prize.\n  The things we really ought to have the government involved with--big \nbodies of water, bodies of water between the States, rivers, lakes, \noceans,\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\nair--there is a role for the government to be involved. But because we \nhave people abusing the rights of private property owners and saying, \nif you put dirt in your backyard, we will put you in jail, it has \nbecome sort of to the point of craziness. But it is all executive \nbranch overreach.\n  There was a case that went to the Supreme Court a few years ago in \nIdaho. A couple lived near a lake but about a mile from a lake. They \ndidn't live on the lake. It was on an incline, and there were houses on \nboth sides of their property. So they bought their property and started \ndoing what everybody else did--back-hoeing, creating a footprint, \nfilling it and putting down footers.\n  The EPA showed up and said: You are destroying a wetland, and we are \ngoing to fine you $37,000 a day.\n  They were kind of like: Well, I thought if it were a wetland, there \nwould be water or standing water or it would look like the Everglades \nor there would be some sort of evidence that it was wetlands.\n  The EPA said: Yes, there is evidence. If any one of 300 different \nspecies of plants grows in your backyard, we can define it as a \nwetland. If we can take leaves and flip the leaves over and they are \nblack on the bottom, it indicates there is moisture on the leaves and \nyou could be a wetland.\n  This all came out of crazy executive overreach. We did not do any of \nthat. Congress did not do one iota of this expansion. It was done some \nby these law courts--these EPA courts--but it was done a lot by \nexecutive definition of what a wetland is.\n  In the early 1990s, under a Republican President, we redefined \nwetlands. They commissioned a book--a 150-page book, 200-page book--and \nthey just redefined what a wetland was. By redefining what a wetland \nwas, we doubled the amount of wetlands in the country overnight--not by \npreserving land but by redefining a lot of land that really is not a \nwetland.\n  Now, through the waters of the United States, we are connecting \neverybody to the ocean somehow and saying that every bit of land is \nsomehow connected to navigable water.\n  I was talking to one of the Senators from Idaho a year or so ago and \nI liked what he told me. He told me: In Idaho, we have a very precise \ndefinition of what a navigable stream is. You put a log in of a two-\ninch diameter, and it has to float 100 feet in a certain period of \ntime. I just loved the definition of it because that sounds like a \nstream that is probably moving and there is water in it. But we now say \na crevice in the side of a mountain, if when it rains water goes over, \nit is a stream. But as a consequence, we are shutting down America.\n  People complain about jobs, but they are all for these regulations, \nand then they complain that they don't have a job.\n  One gentleman decided he was going to put dirt on his land in \nSouthern Mississippi. It was what he considered to be uplands. There \nwere trees growing on it, so usually trees are not really a typical \nfeature of wetlands. His daughter was 43 at the time and he was 70. \nThey were going to develop the lots and sell the lots, and so he dumped \nsome dirt there. The EPA got involved and they convicted him using the \nRICO statutes. This is what you are supposed to get gangsters and drug \ndealers with. It was conspiracy. They got him for conspiracy to violate \nthe Clean Water Act by putting clean dirt on his own land where there \nwas no water to begin with. He was given 10 years in prison. He just \ngot out of prison about a month ago. He is now 80 years old. That is \nwhat is happening in America.\n  So if you wonder why some of us are worried about our records being \nsnatched up, we are worried that our own government has run amok, that \nour own government is out of control, and that our own government is \nnot really paying attention to us.\n  To put a 70-year-old man in prison for 10 years for putting clean \ndirt on his own land--the person who did that ought to go to jail. They \nought to be put in a stockade, publicly flogged, and made to pay \npenance for a decade for doing something so stupid.\n  But the thing is this is going on.\n  A guy named John Pozsgai was a Hungarian immigrant. He came here from \ncommunism and he loved our country. He worked hard and he had a \nmechanic shop in Morristown, NJ. It wasn't in the greatest part of \ntown. It was a commercial part of town. Across the street from him was \na dump. It did flood on occasion, but the reason it flooded was because \nthe ditches were full of 7,000 tires. People were just throwing all \nkinds of crap there. There were all kinds of rotted-out automobiles. It \nwas a junkyard, so they had thrown all this stuff out there.\n  He bought the land pretty cheaply because it was a junkyard, and he \ndecided to clean it up. He picked up 7,000 tires. He picked up all the \nrusted automobiles. And, lo and behold, when he cleaned the drainage \nditches, it no longer flooded. But he started putting some dirt on \nthere and the government said he was breaking the law and that he was \nonce again contaminating the wetlands. He was a Hungarian and he didn't \nlike to be told what to do, and I can understand the sentiment. So he \njust kept putting dirt on there. He decided to do it at night, and they \ncaught him because they spent--I don't know--a quarter million dollars \non cameras and surveillance to catch a guy putting dirt on his own \nland.\n  He was bankrupted. They put him in jail for 3 years, they fined him \n200-and-some thousand dollars. They wiped him out so he couldn't pay \nthe taxes. They broke his spirit. I met his daughter. It is just a \ntragic case.\n  So if you wonder why some of us are worried about the government \nhaving all of our records--\n  I talked earlier about what happened in Westchester, and this is an \nappalling thing. This should make you concerned about having records. \nIn Westchester--I think that is where the Clintons live. Anyway, they \ndecided they would reveal all the gun records. So in Westchester they \nrevealed whether you had a gun or didn't have a gun and where you \nlived.\n  Can you imagine how that might be a problem? Let's say you are a wife \nwho has been beaten by your ex-husband and you live in fear of him and \nyou either have a gun or you don't have a gun. Either way, you don't \nwant your ex-husband to know where you live. And particularly if you \ndon't have a gun, you don't want your ex-husband who beat you to know \nyou don't have a gun.\n  Think if you are a prosecutor or a judge. They get threatened by the \npeople they put in jail. Would you want your name in the paper with \nyour address and that you have a gun or don't have a gun?\n  So you can see how privacy is kind of a big deal. Privacy can mean \nlife and death in that kind of situation.\n  I think we ought to be more cognizant of what a big deal this is and \nwhat a big deal the Bill of Rights is. We shouldn't be so flippant that \nwe are like: Oh, yes, whatever. We have to be safe. Maybe we catch a \nterrorist, maybe we don't, but we have to do this and we just have to \ngive up some of our freedom to be secure.\n  It turns out, though, when we look at the objective evidence, it \ndoesn't appear we are safer. It appears that when they have alleged \nthat we are safer, what has happened is that it doesn't look like we \nhave gotten any unique intelligence from these things.\n  I think there is probably nothing more important than discussing the \nBill of Rights and talking about our civil liberties. I think we need \nto have an adequate debate. It is supposed to be what the Senate was \nfamous for.\n  My hope is that from drawing some attention to this issue today we \nwill get an agreement, and that is the agreement we are going to ask \nfor. We are going to ask for an agreement from both parties to allow \namendments to the PATRIOT Act, and we could start any time they are \nready. If somebody wants to send a message to the leadership that if \nthey are ready to come out and allow debate and allow amendments on the \nPATRIOT Act or a promise to do this before the expiration, we could \nprobably get something moving.\n\n  I think the American people are ready for that debate. We can look at \nthe statistics, particularly among young people. It is a 70- to 80-\npercent issue, where young people are saying, for goodness' sake, we \ndon't want our records scooped up and backed up by the government \nwithout any suspicion.\n  I think also young people get this more than others because they are \nused to their records being digital, they are used to their records \nbeing on their phone. They are very aware that their\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nrecords are stored on a server somewhere, and they have grown to expect \nprivacy.\n  Some say, oh, that is crazy. Young people share their information all \nthe time. Well, you do and you don't. I share my information when I buy \nthings online, but I am sharing it through an agreement. The people I \nshare it with, the companies that then market other things to me, have \nagreed, through a privacy agreement, not to share my information, not \nto sell my information. I am to be anonymous. They will market to me, \nbut they promise to keep me anonymous. We are comforted by the fact \nthat we have a privacy agreement, and that if millions of people sued \nthem, they couldn't get away with revealing our information.\n  What I don't like about some of the different things we are doing--\nand this includes the USA Freedom Act--is that we give liability \nprotection. When we give liability protection, I think it is an \ninvitation to say: You know what. Your privacy agreement isn't really \nthat important, and if you breach it, nobody is allowed to sue you. So \nI think that is something we ought to be very careful with, and if we \ndo end up having a debate on this and we do end up having amendments on \nthis, that we consider taking out the liability protection.\n  I also think the most important thing is if we decide that bulk \ncollection is wrong, we need to understand how you get bulk collection. \nYou get bulk collection because you have a nonspecific warrant. You \ndon't have an individualized warrant; you have a general warrant.\n  This is what we have been fighting since the time of John Wilkes in \n1760 in England, to James Otis in the 1760s here through John Adams. \nThe debate and the thing that we found most egregious, the thing that \nwe found most objectionable was the idea that a warrant for your \ninformation wouldn't have your name on it, it wouldn't be \nindividualized or that it wouldn't be without suspicion or that it \nwould occur without a judge's warrant. It really was one of the things \nthat annoyed us more than anything else. One of the things that Adams \nsaid was the spark of our war for independence was just the sheer gall \nof British soldiers coming into our house without a warrant because \nmost of the records are in your house. We don't see basically the \nphysical and abrupt entry into your house anymore, but it happens \nnonetheless. It happens in just less of a physical way because your \nrecords are virtual now. But how we let people come into our house is \npretty important.\n  On the issue of warrants--this isn't specific to the PATRIOT Act, but \nit is a related issue. The issue is whether we should allow people to \ncome into our house in the middle of the night with what is called a \nno-knock raid. The sneak-and-peek, they come in and leave. But the no-\nknock raid, you know they are there when they come. The problem is that \npeople were being woken up in the middle of the night and they were \ngrabbing their gun by their bedside. If they are in a high-crime \nneighborhood, they have a gun by their bedside and they are sometimes \nshooting the police. Mostly they are looking for drugs. I hate drugs \nabout as much as anybody. I have seen addiction to drugs, I have worked \nwith people as a physician and I know what it is like. But the thing is \nthat barging through doors in the middle of the night leads to \naccidents in both ways: Police get shot; police accidentally shoot the \nvictims sometimes.\n  In Modesto, I think in 2002, they burst into a home at 1 or 2 in the \nmorning, yelled and screamed: Everybody get on the ground. There was an \n11-year-old kid. He got on the ground, and the officer's shotgun \naccidentally discharged. It was an accident, but it didn't help the \nkid. He died.\n  The thing is, do we really need that? Do we need to come in the \nmiddle of the night looking for marijuana or any kind of drug? Couldn't \nwe come in the daytime and knock on the door and say: We have a \nwarrant.\n  I know police work is not without risk and people do shoot back at \nthem. So I understand where they are coming from, and I want to protect \nthem and for them to be safe. I want to protect the police, but I \nactually think it protects the police more if we go in the way we do \nwith traditional warrants and not without unannounced warrants.\n  Of course, there are different circumstances or exigencies. There are \ntimes when the police go in without any warrant at all. If there is \nsomething imminent going on or some threat of a danger or situation \ninside, the police go in. I think, for the most part, we are better off \nif we do things and do them in the traditional way with warrants.\n  When we talk about how warrants have changed, one of the changes is \nthe standard for what the warrant is issued with. Even if it were \nindividualized, if it says that you only have to say they are relevant \nto an investigation. That is a big step down from probable cause. \nPeople have defined ``probable cause'' over time in different ways.\n  This is from Ballentine's Law Dictionary. A common definition of \n``probable cause'' is ``a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by \ncircumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious \nperson's belief that certain facts are probably true.''\n  Some lawyer must have written that. But you can kind of get a little \nbit of understanding that we are supposed to go through some kind of \nthought process and there is supposed to be evidence of suspicion. It \nis not the standard of proving guilt, proving beyond the preponderance \nof the fact or any kind of doubt. It is a standard, and it is a \nstandard we have had for a long time.\n  The Oxford Companion to American Law defines ``probable cause'' as: \n``Information sufficient to warrant a prudent person's belief that . . \n. evidence of a crime or contraband would be found in a search. \n`Probable cause' is a stronger standard of evidence than a reasonable \nsuspicion, but weaker than what is required to secure a criminal \nconviction. Even hearsay can supply probable cause if it is from a \nreliable source or supported by other evidence.''\n  It is kind of interesting because people are so worried about getting \na warrant, even a warrant can be supported by someone making an \naccusation. It is not perfect. In fact, there are some people who \ncomplain warrants are too easy to get. But the thing is there is no \nevidence that it is really overly hard to get a warrant. If we went \nback to the Constitution--I had this debate years ago the last time I \ncame up for renewal, and I was walking along with one of the other \nSenators who supported the PATRIOT Act. He acted as though, you know \nwhat, if it expires at midnight, what will we do? My response was maybe \nwe could live with the Constitution at least for a while. We did for \nhundreds of years.\n  Is there anything so unique about the times we live in that we could \nnot still live under the Constitution? The Fourth Amendment has its \norigins in English common law. The saying that a man's home is his \ncastle, this is the idea that someone has the right to defend their \ncastle or home from invasion from the government.\n  Based on the castle doctrine in the 1600s, landowners first recorded \nlegal protection from casual searches from government. Some of the \nfamous cases are actually in the 1760s, but even at least 100 years in \nadvance of that, they were beginning to develop protections for people \nfrom the government.\n  It is interesting to realize this is not a new phenomenon where we \nare talking about protecting ourselves from government. We protect \nourselves and government helps us protect ourselves from others who may \nbe violent against us. But we have always--for hundreds and hundreds of \nyears--been aware that government does bad things too. If you do not \nration the amount of power you give to government, you can get to the \npoint where the great abuse comes from government itself. So they began \nto use warrants. But in England the debate quickly developed over \nwhether a general warrant was adequate or a specific warrant. This is \nwhere John Wilkes comes in. This is where James Otis comes in.\n  One of the debates over the separation of powers that we have--this \nis pretty commonly going on, although I think the people who believe in \nunlimited inherent powers are probably the majority of Washington. But \nthere is a debate over what people call article II powers. The article \nII is where the Executive is given powers under the Constitution, but \nthere are people who sort of believe in this unlimited nature. There is \nreally nothing that restrains\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\nit. In fact, some have said even in the debate over this, the Executive \nOrder No. 1233 that is involved in some of this records production, it \nis really none of our business because it is article II. It is part of \nthe inherent powers of the President to, in times of war or times of \nconflict, to do whatever they need to do.\n  I think that is a dangerous supposition, to think that really there \nare times when there are no checks and balances. I personally think \nprobably one of the most genius things we got out of our Founding \nFathers was the checks and balances and the division of power.\n  Montesquieu was one of the philosophers the Founding Fathers looked \nto and some say when we were setting up the separation of powers that \nhe was probably where we got the example. Montesquieu said that when \nthe Executive begins to legislate, a form of tyranny will ensue because \nyou have allowed too much power to gravitate to one body and you have \nnot divided the power. The division of power was one of the--if not the \nmost important--the most important things we got from our Founding \nFathers. But we are having this collapse of the separation of powers. \nIt is getting to be where there is an ancillary body which is Congress, \nand then there is the executive branch, the behemoth, the leviathan.\n  The executive branch is so large that really the most important laws \nin the land are being written by bureaucrats. No one elects and no one \ncan unelect. In an average year, there are over 200 regulations that \nwill cost the economy $100 million apiece. We do not vote on any of \nthem. We vote indirectly for the President, but I think that is so \nindirect that it is a real problem.\n\n  I think what we have now is an executive branch that legislates. The \ncollapse of the separation of powers is a collapse of the equilibrium. \nThis equilibrium is what kept power in check. When I think who is to \nblame for this, it is not one party; it is really both parties.\n  When we have a Republican in office, Republicans tend to forgive the \nRepublican President and give them more power. When we have a Democrat \nin office, the Democrats tend to forgive a Democrat and give the \nDemocrat more power.\n  A more honest sort of approach to this or a more statesman's like \napproach to this would be that if we were able to have both parties \nstand up as a body and if there were pride in the institution of \nCongress--pride such that we were jealous of our power, that we were \npitting our ambition to keep our position against the President \nregardless of the President's party affiliation--then we might have a \nchance.\n  A lot of the things about collection of bulk data were not known for \nyears and years but have been going on for a long time. One of the \nthings I found most troubling in the John Napier Tye op-ed was that he \nsaid--he was giving a speech and he said: Well, the good news is that \nif the American people are upset, if they are upset about things, \nintelligence activities, and they think it is an overreach, they have \nevery opportunity to use the democratic process to change things. This \nwent through the White House censor and the White House censor--\ncounsel, adviser, boss--decided they needed to take that out of his \nspeech because they did not want to imply, really, that intelligence \nactivities could be changed through democratic action, because they \ntook the opinion apparently that the inherent powers of article II are \nnot subject to democratic action.\n  When I think of the people who say that the inherent powers are \nunlimited and the President has these powers that are not to be checked \nby Congress, I do not think of a Presidency. I think of a different \nword, and it is not ``President.''\n  I am very concerned about whether we are going to let this go on. \nThere are some other side effects that come from this. As you allow the \nexecutive branch unlimited power and as you allow the bureaucracy to \ngrow, a consequence or a side effect has been that the debt has grown \nto alarming proportions. We borrow about $1 million a minute. We have \nan $18 trillion debt. As the debt has grown larger and the executive \nbranch has grown bigger, your Congress men and women have grown more \nancillary and more peripheral to the entire process. But I am one who \nbelieves there are limits. I think there is a limit to how much debt we \ncan incur and how rapidly we can incur it.\n  I think already we have seen sort of an anchor or a burden, an effect \non the economy that pulls us down and causes growth to be less vibrant. \nSome say 1 million jobs a year are being prevented from being created \nbecause of this.\n  I think that if we are not careful, this collapse of the separation \npower, this collapse of equilibrium, as we let this get away from us, \nwe are also getting away from the control over our future. We are \nletting the power accumulate in such a rapid fashion that if you want \nto see how much power is accumulating, you can almost make the analogy \nof looking at the debt clock. If you go to debtclock.org and watch the \ndebt spiraling out of control, as the debt grows larger and larger, you \nbasically are seeing a diminishment of a corresponding diminishment of \nyour freedom. It is of concern.\n  It is of concern how rapidly this is happening. There are two \nphilosophic reasons we should be concerned about power. One is that \npower corrupts. More basic than that is that as power grows, there has \nto be a corresponding loss of your freedom. I call this the liberty \nargument for minimizing government. Thomas Payne made this argument. \nThomas Payne said that government is a necessary evil. What did he mean \nby that? I think what he meant by that is that you need government. We \nneed government for a stabilizing force. There are things government \nneeds to do. But it is a necessary evil because you have to give up \nyour liberty to have some government. How do you give up your liberty? \nYou give up some of what you earn. Your liberty is who you are. Your \nliberty is what you produce with your hands, and your liberty is what \npeople will pay you to do with your hands, what you do to produce. That \nis your income. That is you. That is your liberty.\n  If we have 100 percent taxation, I would say you have no liberty. You \nare essentially a slave to the State. If you have 50 percent, you are \nonly half slave, half free. The thing is that the smaller your \ngovernment, the lower your taxation and the more free you are. But it \nis an argument for, if you are concerned about freedom, you would want \nas small a government as you possibly could have that still did the \nthings that you think are necessary.\n  The other argument I like for why you should keep your government \nsmall is what I call the efficiency argument. The efficiency argument \nwas best expounded by Milton Friedman, who said that nobody spends \nsomebody else's money as wisely as their own. There is sort of a truism \nto that. You think about it in your own life. If I ask you for $1,000 \nto invest in a business enterprise, you will think: How long did it \ntake me to earn $1,000. You will think: I had to pay taxes, I had to \nsave, I had to pay all my expenses to get this $1,000. You will think \nhow much you prize that, and you will not make the decision in an easy \nfashion. You will make your decision not perfectly, but if you compare \nyour decision spending your money to a politician spending the money, \nit is just bound to be a wiser decision. It is a more heart-wrenching \ndecision. It ends up typically being a better decision. If you ask a \npolitician for $1 million, that might be equivalent to $1,000 or it \nmight not mean anything to him. You might ask him for $10 million.\n  Think about it this way: We gave $500 million to one of the richest \nguys in our country to build something that nobody seemed to want, and \nhe lost all of the money. And you think to yourself, do you think the \nperson in the Department of Energy that gave $500 million to one of the \nrichest guys in the country to build something we didn't want feels bad \nor doesn't sleep well at night? No. I think they gave that person the \nmoney because that person was a big contributor. They were an activist \nfor their candidate, so when the candidate got in power, they used the \nDepartment of Energy as their own personal piggybank to pass out loans \nto their friends. Nobody feels bad about the fact that they lost the \nmoney because it wasn't their money. It is the efficiency argument for \nwhy you should think the government should be small.\n\n[[Page S3153]]\n\n  Before the PATRIOT Act, there was something called Stellar Wind. This \nwas a secret also, and we didn't learn about this for many years, but \nthis was started immediately after 9/11 and was revealed by Thomas Tamm \nat the New York Times in 2008. But it was basically a prelude to the \nbulk collection we are having now.\n  The amazing thing about bulk collection is none of this is new. It \nhas been going on now for 14 or 15 years. It doesn't make it any less \nobjectionable, but it is not new. We have now had bulk collection under \ntwo different administrations. One administration got a great deal of \ngrief for this, and then the next party ran and said: We are going to \nchange these things and do things differently. And they did them the \nsame or more so. There really had not been any change, and I guess that \nis why some people are concerned as to whether we will truly get \nchange.\n  The program's activities in Stellar Wind involve data mining of large \ndatabases of communications of American citizens, including emails, \ntelephone conversations, financial transactions, and Internet activity. \nWilliam Binney, a retired leader within the NSA, became a whistleblower \nbecause he believed these programs to be unconstitutional.\n  The intelligence community was also able to obtain from the Treasury \nDepartment suspicious activity reports. So we are back to these banking \nreports that are issued.\n  If we decide to fix bulk records and try to do something about this \ninjustice, the main thing is we should be aware that this is not the \nonly program. There are probably a dozen programs. There are probably \nanother dozen we have not even heard of that they will not tell any of \nus about. And realize that they are not asking Congress for permission; \nthey are doing whatever they want.\n  We did not give them permission under the PATRIOT Act to do a bulk \ncollection of phone records. They are doing it with no authority or \ninherent authority or some other authority because the courts have \nalready told them there is no authority under the PATRIOT Act. There is \nalso no commonsense logic that could explain--no commonsense logic that \ncould say there is a relevancy to all the data of every American.\n  When Stellar Wind came about, there were internal disputes within the \nJustice Department about the legality of the program because the data \nwas being collected for large numbers of people, not just the subjects \nof FISA warrants. The Stellar Wind cases were referred to by FBI agents \nas pizza cases because many seemingly suspicious cases turned out to be \nfood takeout orders. Imagine also that if we are looking for \ninterconnecting spots, a lot of people order pizza.\n  According to Mueller, approximately 99 percent of the cases led \nnowhere. Nevertheless, internal counsel for the administration said \nthat because the Nation had been thrust into an armed conflict by \nforeign attack, the President has determined in his role as Commander \nin Chief that it is essential for defense against a further attack to \nuse these wiretapping capabilities within the United States. He has \ninherent constitutional authority to order warrantless wiretapping.\n  The memo goes one step further. It says that the President has the \ninherent constitutional authority to order warrantless wiretapping--we \nare talking about warrantless, not any kind of a subpoena--an authority \nthat Congress cannot curtail.\n  If we really believe bulk collection is wrong and if we really \nbelieve we need to be a check and balance on the President, we should \njust be getting started with reining him in on bulk collection because \nthe President--this was the previous administration--says these \nauthorities they are using cannot be curtailed by Congress. If you talk \nabout a Presidency that has powers that are not checked by Congress, I \ndon't think you are talking about a Presidency here. There is another \nname for that kind of leader, but it is not ``President.''\n  The argument here is astounding. The argument here is that they can \ncollect anything they want without a warrant because the President has \nthe inherent constitutional authority to order warrantless \nwiretapping--an authority Congress cannot curtail. I think that is \nalarming.\n  A few years later, the Office of Legal Counsel came back--this is \nalso from the administration--and concluded that at least the email \nprogram was not legal, and then-Acting Attorney General James Comey \nrefused to reauthorize it.\n  William Binney, a former NSA code breaker whom we have talked about \nand who is a whistleblower, talked about some of the activities of the \nNSA and said they have highly secured rooms that tap into major \nswitches and satellite communications at both AT and Verizon.\n  The article--I believe this was the New York Times--suggested that \nsupposedly dispatched Stellar Wind--supposedly they were no longer \ndoing this--continues as an active program. This conclusion was \nsupported by the exposure of room 641A in AT's operation center in \nSan Francisco in 2006. It gets back to the trust factor.\n  The Director of National Intelligence said they were not collecting \nany bulk data, but he wasn't telling the truth. They tell us Stellar \nWind ended back in 2005 or 2006, but then we find a room at AT that \nis still hooked up directly to the NSA.\n  I would like to see the phone companies be better defenders of our \nprivacy, but with the PATRIOT Act, we gave them immunity. Even if there \nwere some individuals in the phone companies who cared about your \nprivacy and thought your phone conversations should be protected, why \ndo it? You can't sue them. If you have a privacy agreement with your \nphone company, they don't care. Nobody can sue them. You have no \nprotection. You have no standing in the court to protect yourself. That \nis one of the problems with the USA FREEDOM Act, is that we are giving \nliability protection once again to the phone companies for something \nnew.\n  One question I would ask, if there was anybody who would actually \ntell me the answer, would be, if we already gave them liability \nprotection under the PATRIOT Act, why are they getting it again under \nthe USA FREEDOM Act unless we are asking them to do something new that \nthey didn't have permission for?\n  The other thing about the USA FREEDOM Act is that if we think bulk \ncollection is wrong, why do we need new authorities? Why are we giving \nthem some kind of new authority? Are we restricting our authority in \nsection 215 of the PATRIOT Act on one hand and then expanding it on \nanother?\n  I think when people are dishonest with you, you are right to be \ndoubtful and you are right to try to circumscribe and to put their \npower in a box so you can watch them and make sure they are honest.\n  In June of 2013, the Washington Post and the Guardian published an \narticle from the Office of the Inspector General--a draft report dated \nMarch of 2009 that detailed the Stellar Wind Program. So in 2009, there \nwas evidence that Stellar Wind was still going on. And realize that \nStellar Wind is not what we are talking about. Stellar Wind would be \nother bits of information that are being collected beyond your phone \nrecords.\n  I think if we had somebody here or if we had somebody who would \nhonestly tell us, I would sure like to know if they absorb and collect \nall of our credit card information. I have a feeling it is probably \ndone. I don't know, and I have not been told, so I am not revealing a \nsecret. I guess it is done. I am guessing all of your records are \ncollected because the thing is, we have the audacity of the executive \nbranch saying they have inherent constitutional authority to do \nanything they want, to order warrantless wiretapping. According to the \nexecutive branch, they have an authority that Congress cannot curtail. \nThat doesn't sound like the Office of the Presidency to me; it sounds \nlike a governmental official whom you have no control over. It sounds \ninconsistent or antithetical to a constitutional republic. How can you \nhave a Presidency that has unlimited power? That is what they are \ntelling you.\n  They are telling you it is in the service of good. We are going to \ncatch terrorists, and we are going to do good things. We are going to \nlook at all of your information, but we are never going to abuse your \nprivacy.\n  During September 2014, the New York Times asserted, ``Questions \npersist\n\n[[Page S3154]]\n\nafter the release of a newly declassified version of a legal memo \napproving the NSA Stellar Wind program, a set of warrantless \nsurveillance and data collection activities secretly authorized after \n2001.'' The article addressed the release of a newly declassified \nversion of the 2004 memo. Note was made that the bulk program--\ntelephone, Internet, and email surveillance of American citizens--\nremained secret until the revelations by Edward Snowden and that to \ndate, significant portions of the memo remain redacted in the newly \nreleased version as well as that doubts and questions about its \nlegality continue to persist.\n  When we go back to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, \nas they get closer to their conclusion, they talk once again about the \nidea that you are only hearing one side. I think that no matter how \nhonest and no matter how patriotic people are, one side just won't do \nit. You can't find the whole truth when only the government presents \ntheir position. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board said \nthat the proceedings with only one side being presented raised concerns \nthat the court does not take adequate account of positions other than \nthose of the government. They recommended the creation of a panel of \nprivate attorneys and special advocates who can be brought into cases \ninvolving novel and significant issues by FISA Court judges.\n  I think this would be a step in the right direction, but I think also \nthat what we need to do is we should really probably give you the \nability to have your own attorney. If this is a court proceeding, I \nthink you need your own attorney so you have somebody who works for you \nand is your advocate. But a special advocate would be better than what \nwe have.\n  The Board goes on to conclude that ``transparency is one of the \nfoundations of democratic governance. Our constitutional system of \ngovernment relies upon the participation of an informed electorate. \nThis in turn requires public access to information about the activities \nof the government. Transparency supports accountability.''\n  I could not agree more. It is even more important when we talk about \nthe intelligence agency because of the extraordinary power we give to \nthese people, the extraordinary power we give them to invade our \nprivacy and to have tools to invade our privacy. We have to trust them, \nso there needs to be a degree of transparency. But transparency doesn't \nhave to involve state secrets. It doesn't have to involve codes or \nnames. But the transparency needs to involve what they are doing. Do we \nthink any terrorist in the world doesn't realize that all of the \ninformation is being scarfed up? It is not a secret that they are doing \nthis.\n\n  So we should have an open debate in a free society about how it \nshould be done and whether we can gather information in a way that is \nconsistent with the Constitution.\n  When we get to the Privacy and Civil Liberty Board's recommendations, \nthey have several good recommendations.\n  No. 1, the government should end its section 215 bulk telephone \nrecords program, period. They say that the program as it is constituted \nimplicates constitutional concerns under the First and Fourth \nAmendments. This is the President's Privacy and Civil Liberties \nOversight Board.\n  Without the current section 215 program, the government would still \nbe able to seek telephone calling records directly from the \ncommunications providers through other existing legal authorities. I \nthink the other existing legal authorities could be the Constitution. \nCould we not just call a judge and get a warrant and go down to the \nphone company and get what we want? I think there is a way we can do \nthis that is still consistent with the Constitution.\n  (Mr. GARDNER assumed the Chair.)\n  The other recommendation they have, other than ending the program, is \nthat when the bulk collection program is ended, the records should be \npurged so there is no chance that this can be abused again in the \nfuture.\n  One of the arguments for the NSA has been that they collect the data, \nit is in a database, but it is only accessed when they have what they \ncall reasonable, articulable suspicion.\n  One of the recommendations of the privacy board, though, was that \nthey not be given the ability to judge whether there is reasonable, \narticulable suspicion; that it would actually go to an independent \njudge to determine that. So the recommendation of the privacy board was \nthat these should go to the review of the FISA Court before they are \nable to query the database.\n  There are many different groups who have been fighting for our \nprivacy in this country, and it is a coalition of people both from the \nright and from the left. We have seen it today as different Senators \nhave come to the floor. We have had Senators from the Republican Party \nas well as from the Democratic Party. We have had those from the right, \nfrom the left, conservatives, libertarians, and we have had \nprogressives. There has been a combination of folks who also have one \nthing in common, and that is the belief that the Bill of Rights should \nbe protected.\n  Among the private groups who have done a good job with this is \nElectronic Frontier Foundation. They have been one of the groups who \nhave done a good job. In one of their newsletters, they quote Ron \nWyden, who says: We have not yet seen any evidence showing that the \nNSA's dragnet collection of America's phone records has produced any \nuniquely valuable intelligence.\n  Patrick Eddington writes for CATO. CATO is another group who has been \na good supporter of privacy. In an article that talks about the \nupcoming battle from a couple of weeks ago, he writes--this is on the \nUSA FREEDOM Act, and this is sort of the big debate because many people \non both sides of the aisle think the bulk collection of records is not \nconstitutional. We think it exceeds the government's power and it \nexceeds the Constitution. But what many are proposing to replace it \nwith is the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  This is what Patrick Eddington writes: The USA FREEDOM Act claims to \nend the controversial telephone metadata program, but a close reading \nof the bill reveals that it actually leaves key PATRIOT Act definitions \nof ``person'' or ``U.S. person'' intact, so a person is defined as any \nindividual, including officer or employee of the Federal Government, or \nany group, entity, association, corporation, or foreign power.\n  So the question I have is, it sounds good that we are going to make \nthe definition of whose records we go after when we say it is going to \nbe a specific U.S. person. The problem is that we then define \n``person'' as ``corporation.'' So we get back to the same argument: If \nwe are going to search the database of all of a person's phone calls \nand we say that a person is Verizon, we are again stuck collecting \neverybody's records.\n  What I don't want to have happen and what I won't be able to support \nis a bill that becomes bulk collection of a person's records, just \nunder a different venue. I am not sure that one's privacy has been \nprotected more if it were now just asking the phone companies for bulk \ncollection where we were taking their data, sourcing it, and getting it \nfrom the companies after they gave it to the government. I am just not \nsure if it is that much--distinctly different.\n  In the USA FREEDOM Act, they talk about the idea that we will get \nspecial advocates, and I am for that. I think that is a good idea. But \nPatrick Eddington points out a flaw. He says that the FISA Court has \nsole discretion to appoint or not appoint these amicus curiae or these \nspecial advocates. So it could be that a FISA Court that really has not \nbeen too inquisitive, a FISA Court that has determined that all of your \nrecords are somehow relevant, may not be the most inquisitive to \nappoint an advocate for you if they have been able to define \n``relevance'' as meaning all of the records.\n  Another deficiency of the USA FREEDOM Act is that it does not address \nbulk collection under Executive Order 12333. The bill also fails to \naddress bulk collection under section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act.\n  One could say: What are you complaining about? You are getting some \nimprovement. You still have problems, but you are getting some \nimprovement.\n  I guess my point is that we are having this debate, and we don't have \nit very often. We are having the debate every 3 years, and some people \nhave tried to make this permanent, where\n\n[[Page S3155]]\n\nwe would never have any debate. Even though we are only having it every \n3 years, it is still uncertain whether I will be granted any amendments \nto this bill.\n  So, yes, I would like to address everything while we can. I think we \nought to address section 702. I think we ought to--for goodness' sake, \nwhy won't we have some hearings on Executive Order 12333? I think they \nmay be having them in secret, but I go back to what Senator Wyden said \nearlier. I think the principles of the law could be discussed in \npublic. We don't have to reveal how we do stuff. Do we think anybody in \nthe world thinks we are not looking at their stuff? Why don't we \nexplore the legality and the law of how we are doing it as opposed to \nleaving it unsaid and unknown in secret?\n  Part of our secrecy is sort of backfiring on us also because what is \nhappening is in keeping this secret, people believe the worst. \nEverybody around the world believes the worst about it. Everybody \naround the world believes that they are having all their stuff looked \nat, that their emails are being looked at. So if you are a \nbusinessperson in Europe and you are trying to negotiate a secure \ndeal--a deal where you don't want your competitors to know what you are \noffering to buy a certain company--I would think you probably wouldn't \nuse American email, and I would guess that is what is happening.\n  American companies are starting to try to figure out a way around \nthis, are trying to offer encryption. What does the government do? The \nPresident's administration is all over the airwaves, all over \nWashington, all over the place talking about how the companies are \nsomehow evil for wanting to encrypt their data.\n  I saw the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in my \ncommittee the other day, and I said: You realize it is your fault. Is \nit the companies' fault that they are trying to protect their \ninformation for their customers? They are trying to make a living. It \nis your fault for bullying them and stealing their information and \nstealing all of Americans' information. We are simply reacting to the \nbully that you are.\n  Most of the issues Patrick Eddington points out in his piece are \nissues that we actually have amendments for that would make the bill \nstronger. So if there are arguments that maybe the USA FREEDOM Act \ncould be made better--definitely reauthorizing it by itself is a big \nmistake, but if alternatives are going to be offered, maybe we could \ntry to offer alternatives that make the USA FREEDOM Act better.\n  The other idea Patrick Eddington puts forward is that there is no bar \non the government imposing backdoors being built into electronic \ndevices. That is what we have talked about before, that the government \nis mandating to different companies that they have to have access to \ntheir product.\n  I think it is an under-discussed development that the companies are \ngoing to be more at risk for sabotage by foreign countries, foreign \ngovernments, and sabotage from hackers if they build a portal. So if \nthe government says ``We need a portal to stick our big nose in your \nbusiness and suck up all your information,'' my guess is that \nsophisticated hackers and sophisticated foreign governments will say \nthat most of American software now has a flaw, and the American \nGovernment is getting into it. What do we think these people will do? \nThey will develop programs to look for the flaws and churn through \nuntil they find our flaws.\n  It is the opposite of what we should be doing. We should be trying to \nkeep foreign governments, foreign snoopers, and foreign competitors out \nof our stuff, including the U.S. Government, but we are doing the \nopposite.\n  There is a lot left to be desired with the USA FREEDOM Act. I try to \nbe supportive of moving forward, but I can't support it unless we are \nable to incorporate some of the other ideas I think are necessary.\n  The people say we are just not doing enough. This week, many have \ncome out and said: We have to collect more data. We are only collecting \na third of the data. We have to get more data.\n  The interesting thing is that we are spending $52 billion a year on \nintelligence in our country--$52 billion. We are spending $10 billion \nin the NSA alone. It is $167 per person in the United States. I think \nit is hard to argue we are not doing enough already. I think the \nargument can be made, though, that we are doing it in such a haphazard, \nall-collecting, all-consuming, indiscriminate way that maybe we are not \ngetting the best bang for our buck.\n\n  There have been many groups out there. We mentioned Electronic \nFrontier Foundation, TechFreedom, Liberty Coalition, GenOpportunity, \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, FreedomWorks--a lot of different \ngroups from right and left that are opposed to this bulk collection of \ndata.\n  There is an interesting article recently written by Anthony Romero \nwith the ACLU, and the title of it is ``The Sun Must Go Down on the \nPATRIOT Act.'' In it he refers back to both of the review groups we \ntalked about and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, and \nhe says and reiterates a point that is incredibly important, that \n``there was no evidence at all that the NSA's massive surveillance \nprogram had ever played a pivotal role in any investigation.''\n  I think we ought to be able to figure out something from this, and we \nought to be able to learn that not only is there a constitutional \nquestion of this, there is also the question of whether practically it \nis doing anything to make us safer. If it is not making us safer, it is \nextraordinarily expensive and we are losing our freedom in the process. \nWhy don't we shut it down?\n  Different advocacy groups for a variety of opinions have put forward \nthe idea that I think was represented in the NAACP v. Alabama. I \nbelieve this was back in the seventies, which set forth a First \nAmendment claim, and this claim is that there is a vital relationship \nbetween freedom of association in privacy in one's associations. The \npoint is that sometimes when you are protesting either for or against \nsomething that is very unpopular, sometimes you even worry about your \nsafety. There were people who lost their lives in the freedom movement, \nin the civil rights movement. There were people who lost their lives. \nAnd you can understand how in those days people might have been worried \nfor anybody to know they belonged to the NAACP or they opposed the Jim \nCrow laws in the South. But it was an important case because it talks \nabout how the fact is that information can be kept private and should \nbe kept private for fear it will chill speech, for fear it will put a \ndamper on who people would associate with, for fear that it would put a \ndamper on dissent, which is a fundamental aspect of a Republic.\n  In a letter from a couple weeks ago from some congressional leaders, \nthey point out something that I think bears repeating. Mass \nsurveillance, the bulk collection, harms our economy. Mass surveillance \nwill cost the digital economy up to $180 billion in lost revenue by \n2016.\n  We are not getting any new bad guys with this, we are abrogating \nprivacy, and we are losing money.\n  The Internet companies in our country, the whole software world, the \nwhole hardware, all of this, have been some of America's greatest \ntriumphs, some of America's greatest ingenuity. Yet we are willing to \nsquash all that in a battle that really is going to damage our privacy, \nisn't helping us in the war against terrorism, and is going to make it \nsuch that nobody in the world is going to want to buy American \nproducts. I think it is a disgrace and, once again, I don't think it is \npurposeful. Nobody wants to harm our companies, but I think it is just \nanother unintended consequence--a bad policy not thought through.\n  The ACLU commentary on the USA FREEDOM Act has come up with some \nideas of things they think would make the bill stronger. One, they say \nthe bill could be amended to prevent surveillance of individuals with \nno nexus to terrorism:\n\n       The 2015 USA FREEDOM Act would authorize the collection of \n     records and communications identified by a ``specific term''. \n     . . . This would stop the government from conducting \n     indiscriminate surveillance of virtually all citizens and \n     from engaging in narrower but still-egregious forms of abuse, \n     like the surveillance of everyone in an entire zip code or \n     all those who use a given communications provider, like \n     Gmail. However, the current SST definition is still not \n     strong enough to prevent ``bulky'' collection. . . .\n\n  This is the point I have been making, and this is something you need \nto be very careful about in Washington, because the minute you think \nyou have\n\n[[Page S3156]]\n\nwon a battle, secretly you have been beaten. You just don't know it \nyet. We may still get a reform like this and then find out we are still \ngoing to get bulky collection; that a corporation's name can be put in \nthe specific selector term, and--so we were worried about the \ngovernment giving us all of Verizon's records. Now we are just sending \na warrant to Verizon that has their name in it and we are getting all \nof their records.\n  The example they put here is that you could still end up having the \nsurveillance of everyone in the entire ZIP Code or all of those who use \na given communications provider like Gmail. So Gmail is a specific \nterm. Are we not still back where we were and have we really fixed the \nproblem?\n  The ACLU goes on to say that the bill should be amended to narrow the \nSST definition--the selector term--to prevent this kind of bulky \nsurveillance. The bill should also make crystal clear, consistent with \nthe Second Circuit--which has come out since this bill was written--\nthat section 215 cannot be used to amass Americans' records for open-\nended data-mining purposes unmoored from any specific investigation.\n  I think this is incredibly important. The USA FREEDOM Act wants to \ntake a step forward, but we need to make sure the ruling from the \nSecond Circuit that has already passed, that we don't do something that \neither moots the case or we don't do something that actually expands \nthe power of 215 when the court has already restricted the power of \n215.\n  The ACLU's second recommendation is that we should include procedures \nto ensure that the government purges irrelevant information. Right now \nthe bill would allow the collection of irrelevant information under 215 \nand other authorities without minimization procedures.\n  This kind of reminds me--if you want to know how much information we \nare grabbing up and how worried to be about it, there was an article in \nthe Washington Post a couple of months ago, and it said the President \nhad been minimized 1,227 times. We are collecting the President's data, \nall right. You can say, well, we are being fair, we are getting \neverybody's. For goodness' sake, we should not be collecting the \nPresident's information. In fact, you might inadvertently have somebody \nreading that who really shouldn't be reading the President's \ninformation. We should not be collecting the President's information. \nThat is ridiculous. But we are minimizing the President, which means we \nare finding it and sort of whitening it out and hoping nobody has read \nit in the process.\n  There were earlier versions of the USA FREEDOM Act that included some \nof these basic protections on getting rid of or minimizing irrelevant \ninformation from bulky surveillance. This is sort of the problem. This \nbill started out pretty good in the House, got out of committee, got \nsort of eaten up on the floor, and wound up losing a lot of the better \nstuff that was in it.\n  The third recommendation is what we mentioned a few minutes ago, \nwhich is to make sure there is a strong advocacy, a special advocate; \nthat it is a strong advocate that goes before the FISA Court. As the \nSecond Circuit Court decision observes, adversarial judicial process is \nvital, especially on matters as critically important as the \ngovernment's authority to spy on its citizens. This is a really \nimportant point, the adversarial judicial process.\n  There are some--Judge Napolitano has written on this--and I think he \nhas made the point that without an adversarial process, you really \ncan't even have a judicial process. If you don't have people on both \nsides arguing or advocating for a position, there really isn't a court. \nIt really is not a judicial proceeding that we can recognize as finding \njustice. But the FISA Court only hears from one side, the government.\n  But the ACLU points out that these advocates participate solely at \nthe discretion of the court and can make arguments that do not advance \nprivacy and civil liberties.\n  Yet, if you are hired by the government, are you really going to be \nthe best advocate for privacy?\n  The fourth suggestion that the ACLU has to make the USA FREEDOM Act \nbetter is that we should limit additional authorities that have been \nused to collect America's records in bulk. We now know that the \ngovernment has conducted bulk surveillance not only under 215 but also \nunder a host of other statutes, including existing administrative \nsubpoena authorities.\n  For example, for two decades, up until 2013, the Drug Enforcement \nAgency operated a program that collected the international call records \nof Americans in bulk, reporting under existing administrative subpoena \nlaws. So here is a real question: What other authorities are we \noperating under that are collecting bulk records? They are doing it \nunder administrative subpoena laws. They are doing it for the DEA. I \nstill think the more I learn about this, the more questions I have as \nto how many other authorities are still collecting things. I would \nstill like to know, are they collecting all the credit card information \nin the country? Are they doing that under Executive authority?\n  Are we really living in a country now where nobody in the government \nquestions someone when they say that under article II authority the \nPresident can do whatever he wants and that this can't even be \ncorrected or challenged at all by Congress?\n  The fifth recommendation from the ACLU is to stop the government from \nusing section 702 of FISA as a backdoor to conduct surveillance on \nAmericans. This was one of our amendments that we also have. In fact, \nmost of these are amendments that I would present, if we are allowed to \npresent them, which is sort of the purpose for being here, for wearing \nmy feet out and my voice today, is that we would like to find out, Will \nthe leadership allow us to have amendments?\n  We would like to know and have an agreement that we will specifically \nbe allowed to offer these amendments we have worked on for 6 months to \na year now. We have waited for 3 years for the opportunity. We would \nlike to know, Will leadership let us have these amendments? Will \nleadership allow a free and open debate over how to fix this bulk \ncollection program?\n  The backdoor thing with 702 is a pretty important thing. It is \ncollecting enormous amounts of data. Earlier today we talked about how \nthis data, that 9 out of 10 pieces of data are not about the target, \nthey are just incidental. I think there was one estimate that we have \nhad 90,000 targets, but it means that we have really had 900,000 bits \nof information on other individuals collected, but it all just gets \nstuck in a database. So the database keeps growing and growing and \nsometimes it is intentionally so, that we want to investigate a guy \nhere, but we don't want to ask for a warrant, so we investigate a guy \noverseas that we know already talks to the guy over here, and now we \nare really investigating Americans without a warrant. So they \nrecommended we stop this backdoor access. This is something Senator \nWyden and I have also been in favor of as well.\n  Another recommendation the ACLU has is that our current laws punish \nindividuals for providing material support to terrorists. I have no \nproblem with that, but they have been used apparently to prosecute \npeople seeking to provide humanitarian assistance. The USA FREEDOM Act \nshould add an explicit intent requirement to the material support law.\n  There is another comment from the Sunlight Foundation by Sean Vitka, \nand the title is the ``USA FREEDOM Act is about to pass through the \nHouse--is it a step backwards?''\n\n       Sunlight and others have had major concerns about the USA \n     FREEDOM Act for some time. Broadly speaking, it isn't a \n     satisfactory level of reform given what we've learned in the \n     past two years about government surveillance and the immense \n     secrecy that surrounds it. Until last week, it's fair to say \n     some considered the bill a net positive, some a net negative \n     and that no one thought it was enough for reform.\n       As time has progressed, we've seen what began in 2013 as a \n     decent, if tunnel-visioned, compromise chipped away at, \n     including the transparency and accountability provisions . . \n     .\n\n  I think this is an important point, because the USA FREEDOM Act \nstarted out pretty good. It got a little bit less good over time. But \nthink about where we are right now. It passed overwhelmingly in the \nHouse. The majority in the Senate does not want it because they think \nit lessens the bulk collection too much. So they are going to chip away \nat it again. So imagine where we are going to be in the end if\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\nthat is what we are going to pass. I think it would be better to be \ndone with bulk collection. Let's be done with bulk collection. Let's \nstart over.\n  But let's not replace it with something that may end up being just as \nbad. The sacrifices made in the bill in order to secure these modest \nreforms grew more dramatic. For instance, the USA FREEDOM Act was \nalways a threat to court challenges and may have mooted the ACLU'S \ntremendous court win last week, if it had passed last year. This is the \npoint I have been making. The luckiest thing we ever got is that we did \nnot pass the USA FREEDOM Act last year because the courts are probably \ngoing to do right now a better job than legislation.\n  If fact, we might be better off not passing the USA FREEDOM Act and \nseeing what the courts will do for us on this because there is a danger \nit moots the case. But there is a danger also that it is seen as \nactually giving justification for the program, which I guess is kind of \nmooting the case as well. The ruling in the appellate court could \nalso--they are agreeing with what I just said--do more than USA FREEDOM \naspired to do, because it interprets the word ``relevance'', saying it \ndoes not authorize bulk collection and that that word is not used in \nsection 215.\n  So I think that is a good point, that the court is saying that the \nword ``relevance'' does not authorize bulk collection. So you have got \nbulk collecting going on, but there is no authorization from 215 on it.\n  Here is the question: Is USA FREEDOM going to allow bulky--perhaps \nbulk--collection, and do we wind up actually giving back more power to \nthe intelligence community when we are trying to limit their power? I \nthink we need to be very careful with what we do here.\n  Sunlight goes on to say--Sean Vitka:\n\n       It's unclear whether the primary goal of USA FREEDOM, the \n     rewriting of Section 215 to stop bulk collection, is already \n     accomplished and whether USA FREEDOM could open us all up to \n     more secret interpretations and new venues of surveillance.\n\n  I think that is an incredibly important question. Several groups that \ninitially supported USA FREEDOM have backed away from it. ACLU and EFF \nagree that the USA FREEDOM Act as it stands now is not worthy of \nsupport. I think some of these may be neutral on it, but they have \nbacked away from some of their support. Some of the concerns that Sean \nVitka talks about here are shortcomings in the USA Freedom Act. He says \nthat it accepts the premise that mass surveillance under these programs \nis necessary, despite the findings of the congressional joint inquiry \nand the 9/11 Commission to the contrary, and also despite that the \nPrivacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board said it was not necessary.\n  Sean Vitka goes on to say that one of his other concerns is that the \nUSA FREEDOM Act effectively continues mass surveillance under section \n215 of the PATRIOT Act through the use of multiple NSA-supplied \nselector terms. So you could say that we are only going to do \nindividual terms, but then you do a bunch of them. By the time we do a \nbunch, are we really individualizing or are we not growing it into bulk \ncollection?\n  They include the following among those selection terms--ones they are \nworried about: the Internet protocol address or cloud source accounts \nof entire organizations, in contravention of the Fourth Amendment's \nparticularized probable-cause-based warrant.\n  Additionally, Sunlight goes on to point out what I pointed out as \nwell, that the term ``person'' is not defined as an individual natural \nperson, and the bill does not alter the PATRIOT Act's original \ndefinition of person, which includes any individual, officer or \nemployee of the Federal Government or any group, entity, association, \ncorporation.\n  You know, I really feel what we could be doing back here is--we think \nwe won. We get the USA FREEDOM Act, and then 2 years from now, we find \nout they are plugging the name ``Verizon'' into their selection term \nand they are still collecting all the records from Verizon. So I think \nunless you can limit this to an individual, a natural person, I think \nreally this is one of the biggest problems we have with the USA FREEDOM \nAct at this point.\n  Sean Vitka goes on to say that there is a concern that it expands the \ncorporate immunity. We have discussed that as well today--that by \nremoving that companies act in good faith, we also are going to pay the \ncompanies now to do this as well.\n  Judge Napolitano wrote about this just the other day, May 14. He \nwrites:\n\n       A decision last week about NSA spying by a panel of judges \n     on the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York City sent shock \n     waves through the government. The court ruled that a section \n     of the PATRIOT Act that is due to expire at the end of this \n     month, on which the government has relied as a basis for its \n     bulk collection and acquisition of telephone data the past 14 \n     years, does not authorize that acquisition. This may sound \n     like legal mumbo-jumbo but it goes to the heart of the \n     relationship between the people and their government and a \n     free society.\n       The PATRIOT Act is the centerpiece of the Federal \n     Government's false claim that by surrounding our personal \n     liberties to it, it can somehow keep us safe. The liberty-\n     for-safety offer has been around for millennia and was \n     poignant at the time of the founding of the American \n     Republic.\n\n  The Framers addressed it in the Constitution itself, where they \nrecognized the primacy of the rights to privacy and assured against its \nviolation by government, by intentionally forcing it to jump through \nsome difficult hoops before it can capture our thoughts, words, or \nprivate behavior. These hoops are the requirement of a search warrant \nissued by a judge based on evidence called probate cause, demonstrating \nthat it is more likely than not that the government will find what it \nis looking for from the person or place it is targeting. Only then may \na judge issue a warrant which must specifically describe the place to \nbe searched, or specifically identify the person or thing to be seized.\n  Napolitano goes on:\n\n       None of this is new. It has been at the core of our system \n     of government since the 1790s. It is embodied in the Fourth \n     Amendment which is the heart of the Bill of Rights. It is \n     quintessentially American. The PATRIOT Act has purported to \n     do away with the search warrant requirement, by employing \n     language so intentionally vague that the government can \n     interpret it as it wishes. Add to this the secret venue for \n     this interpretation, the FISA court, to which the PATRIOT Act \n     directs that NSA applications for authority to spy on \n     Americans are to be made, and you have the totalitarian stew \n     that we have been force fed since 2001.\n       Because the FISA court meets in secret, Americans did not \n     know that the feds were spying on us all of the time and \n     relying on their own unnatural reading of the words in the \n     PATRIOT Act to justify it until Edward Snowden spilled the \n     beans on his former employer nearly 2 years ago.\n\n  Here is another reason I think to question whether USA FREEDOM may be \nthe best bill for us. There was an article in the Daily Beast by Shane \nHarris the other day. The title of it is `` `Big Win' for Big Brother: \nNSA Celebrates the Bill That's Designed to Cuff Them.''\n\n       It was supposed to be the declawing of America's biggest \n     spy service, but what no one wants to say out loud is that \n     this is a big win for the NSA, one former top spook says.\n       Civil libertarians and privacy advocates were applauding \n     yesterday after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly \n     passed legislation to stop the NSA from collecting Americans' \n     phone records in bulk. But they'd best not break out the \n     bubbly.\n       The real big winner here is the NSA. Over at its \n     headquarters in Fort Meade . . . intelligence officials are \n     high-fiving, because they know things could have turned out \n     much worse. ``What no one wants to say out loud is that this \n     is a big win for the NSA, and a huge nothing burger for the \n     privacy community,'' said a former senior intelligence \n     official, one of half a dozen who spoke to The Daily Beast \n     about the phone records program and efforts to change it.\n       Here's the dirty little secret that many spooks are loath \n     to utter publicly, but have been admitting in private for the \n     past two years: The program--\n\n  The bulk collection program--\n\n     which was exposed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden in \n     2013, is more trouble than it's worth.\n       ``It's very expensive and very cumbersome,'' the former \n     official said. It requires the agency to maintain huge \n     databases of all Americans' landline phone calls. But it \n     doesn't contribute many leads on terrorists. It has helped \n     prevent few--if any--attacks. And it's nowhere near the \n     biggest contributor of information about terrorism that ends \n     up on the President's desk or other senior decision makers.\n       If, after the most significant public debate about \n     balancing surveillance and government in a generation, this \n     is the program that NSA has to give up, they're getting off \n     easy. The bill that the House passed yesterday, called the \n     USA FREEDOM Act, doesn't actually suspend the phone record \n     program. Rather, it requires that phone companies, not the \n     NSA, hold on to the records.\n\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\n\n  That bears repeating. At least from the author's perspective of this \narticle, the USA FREEDOM Act does not actually suspend the phone \nrecords program. Rather, it requires the phone companies, not the NSA, \nto hold onto the records.\n\n       ``Good! Let them take them. I'm tired of holding onto \n     this,'' a current senior U.S. official told The Daily Beast. \n     It requires teams of lawyers and auditors to ensure that the \n     NSA is complying with Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, which \n     authorizes the program, as well as the internal regulations \n     on how records can and cannot be used. The phone records \n     program has become a political lightning rod, the most \n     controversial of all of the classified operations that \n     Snowden exposed. If NSA can still get access to the records \n     but not have to hold on to them itself, all the better, the \n     senior official said.\n       ``It's a big win for common sense and for the country,'' \n     Joel Brenner, the NSA's former inspector general, told The \n     Daily Beast. ``NSA can get to do what it needs to do with a \n     higher level of scrutiny and a little more trouble, but it \n     can still do what it needs to do. At the same time, the \n     government is not going to hold the bulk metadata of the \n     American people.''\n       ``The NSA is coming out of this unscathed,'' said the \n     former official. If the USA FREEDOM Act passes the Senate--\n     which is not a foregone conclusion--it will be signed by \n     President Obama and create a more efficient and comprehensive \n     tool for the NSA. That's because under the current regime, \n     only the logs of landline calls are kept. But in the future, \n     the NSA will be able to get the cell phone records from the \n     companies, too.\n\n  That bears repeating. This week, everybody was talking about and \nsaying: We are not getting enough. The people who want more \nsurveillance are saying: We are not getting enough. We are only getting \nthe landlines. We are only getting one-third of all of the records. \nHere is the allegation: Under the USA FREEDOM Act, they are going to \nget many more records. They are going to have access to all cell phone \nrecords. The question is, Are we going to really have less bulk \ncollection or maybe the same?\n  There is another irony--this is still according to Shane Harris at \nthe Daily Beast:\n\n       And there's another irony. Before the Snowden leaks, the \n     NSA was already looking for alternatives to storing huge \n     amounts of phone records in the agency's computers. And one \n     of the ideas officials considered was asking Congress to \n     require phone companies to hang onto that information for \n     several years. The idea died, though, because NSA leaders \n     thought that Congress would never agree, [current and former \n     officials have said].\n\n  It is kind of ironic that the NSA already thought of this idea, \ndidn't think we would be silly enough to do it, and now it is being \npromoted as the reform, that the reform is going to be what the NSA \nactually wanted in the first place.\n  Suddenly, the NSA found itself under orders from the White House--\nthis is after the revelations from Snowden--to come up with some \nalternative to the phone records program that preserved it, but also \nput more checks on how the records are used. Continuing:\n\n       That's when General Keith Alexander, then the agency's \n     director, dusted the old idea off the shelf and promoted it \n     on Capitol Hill.\n\n  That is right.\n\n       ``The USA Freedom Act''--the supposed reining in of the \n     NSA--``was literally born from Alexander,'' the former \n     official said.\n       So the NSA effectively got what it wanted. But that doesn't \n     mean privacy activists got nothing, or that they'd count the \n     law's passage as a loss.\n\n  There is a large coalition, 50 maybe 100 different groups, that have \nall been in favor of trying to end the bulk coalition. We have been \nworking together on this. We have mentioned the Electronic Frontier \nFoundation, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the ACLU, \nFreedomWorks, Bill of Rights Defense Committee, The Constitution \nProject--across the spectrum, right and left.\n  The question is on encryption, whether the government will be able to \nbreak through the encryption that businesses are trying to devise to \nkeep them out.\n  There is an article in the New York Times, though this is from 1\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, saying:\n\n       The National Security Agency is winning its long-running \n     secret war on encryption, using supercomputers, technical \n     trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to \n     undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday \n     communications in an Internet age. . . . The agency has \n     circumvented or cracked much of the encryption, or digital \n     scrambling, that guards global commerce and banking systems.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       ``For the past decade, N.S.A. has led an aggressive, \n     multipronged effort to break widely used Internet encryption \n     technologies,'' said a 2010 memo describing a briefing about \n     N.S.A. accomplishments for employees of its British \n     counterpart.\n\n  I think the encryption thing is a big deal and will continue to be \nsomething that is a bone of contention between the tech industry and \nthe government.\n  With regard to what we do in order to protect ourselves from the \ngovernment, I think encryption will continue to take off.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Will the Senator yield for a question without losing \nthe floor?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes, without losing the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am so pleased to hear my colleague talk about \nencryption technology because it is clearly something very important in \nthis privacy debate. I hear with interest, as you cite that article, \nthat one of the key things about the encryption debate is several years \nago, those involved at the highest levels of government basically \ndecided that instead of being able to break the encryption code, that \nmaybe it would be a good idea to put an actual government chip in every \ncomputer. That was called the clipper chip. And the notion was that \nthen the NSA and other people wouldn't have to worry about breaking the \ncode. They would just have a government backdoor to our technology.\n  In fact, there were many people--I kept saying you are going to say \ninstead of ``Intel inside'' you are going to say ``U.S. Government \ninside'' of every computer. Is that what we were trying to do?\n  So the clipper chip battle in the 1990s was a very famous debate \nabout exactly how we were going to proceed on making sure that we were \nguaranteeing privacy to U.S. citizens. So clearly we were successful in \ndefeating the clipper chip, but it took a lot of time and a lot of \nenergy.\n  So I thank my colleague for continuing to fight on these important \nissues. You mentioned many of the organizations that were also involved \nin that battle. Are you saying that now you believe there are new \ngovernment efforts to thwart our encryption capabilities?\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator for that question. I think there is a \nnew sort of political rhetoric attacking encryption, but I think there \nwill be more efforts. This article is from about a year ago, but I \nthink what is going to happen from this--and what I have been hearing \nfrom people--is there is ultimately going to be encryption that is not \nhoused by any company. They are going to have encryption--the only way \nto get to the encryption is through the individual. This is being done \nbecause the government has overplayed their hand. Because the \ngovernment has been such a bully on this, companies are going to \ncontinue to get further and further away. What they are going to do is \nthe encryption will only be in control of the user. When that happens, \nthe government is not getting any information at all.\n  So they are taking a tool that probably has been useful to a certain \ndegree--and I don't mind if we are doing it through warrants and \nspecific extradition--but I think they are pushing companies so hard \nthat I think encryption is going to be put in a place where even the \ncompany cannot get to it.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. If I could ask another question of the Senator without \nlosing him the right to the floor, this is a debate, as you were just \nsaying. I think I understand your premises that there are three legs to \nthe stool. There is a Federal Government that wants access, but they \nshould go through the judiciary system, and there are separately the \nentities that have the actual records, which are the telecom companies, \nand that keeping those separate, not blending them, not actually giving \nthe telephone companies the right to keep all the data and information \nof individuals is a critical distinction.\n  You were just describing, I think I understood, that in this case the \ngovernment was just saying: Oh, keep all of that data and information, \nwhich is not exactly what the phone companies had acquired or kept for \nany business purposes, but it just puts personal data and information \nat risk.\n  Am I understanding that correctly?\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I think I understand that question. The phone companies \naren't excited about it, but they will do it if they are paid and told \nto do it, basically. But the phone companies, I don't know. I don't how \nmuch objection they have had to the current system and the new system. \nThey probably don't want to have to hold all this. There are rumors \nthat the people who want more will require them to.\n  I don't think, under the current USA FREEDOM Act, they are going to \nbe required to hold the records, but they are going to be encouraged to \nand paid to hold the records.\n  So I think the real question is, Is the USA FREEDOM an improvement or \nare we just going to have bulk collection done by another name, with \nphone companies holding the records. That is what my fear is.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I would say to the Senator or ask the Senator, in this \ndebate, I think you raised an important question, if I understand it \ncorrectly, which is, How much will the U.S. Government spy on U.S. \ncitizens? And that, combined with the question you were asking to the \nchanges to the PATRIOT Act and the accumulation of business records, is \nwhen that individual could be a U.S. citizen.\n  For example, you and I could be somewhere--you could be an individual \nof interest to one of these Federal agencies, but just because I happen \nto have a cup of coffee with you, now all of a sudden all of my \nbusiness records, all of my personal information could be under \ninvestigation by the U.S. Government, and I wouldn't even know about \nit; is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. PAUL. Yes, I think that is a big concern. There are a couple of \nthings that I think are alarming. Even two domestic emails could be \nrouted through a server in another country, and they could use that to \nactually get access to two Americans who are communicating from New \nJersey to South Carolina.\n  But also I think as Senator Wyden has pointed out, it often or \nsometimes sounds like we are targeting a foreigner simply to get access \nto an American.\n  Does the Senator have a question in that vein?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think my colleague has asked very good questions, and it \nis my intention to rejoin him here in a few minutes.\n  But I think it is important--and I would be interested in your \nreaction--do people understand what is at stake here?\n  We are talking about section 702 of the FISA Act and that involves a \nvery important issue of making sure, when there is somebody dangerous \noverseas, that we can, in effect, go up on that person to get that kind \nof information that we have to have.\n  But what we are seeing increasingly--and we have actually put it on \nour Web site--Americans are being swept up in those searches and their \nemails are being read.\n  And what is especially troubling to me--and I would be interested in \nmy colleague's views with respect to this backdoor search loophole--\nthis is a problem today, but it is only going to be a growing problem \nin the days ahead because increasingly communications systems around \nthe globe are merging. They are becoming integrated. It is not as if \nthe communications systems stop at a nation's border.\n  So I think this is a particularly important issue. As we have talked \nabout, the amendments we are interested in offering, I think this is a \nparticularly important bipartisan effort. I don't think people have \nknown a whole lot about how the backdoor search loophole takes place.\n  We have supported section 702, because when there are dangerous \nthreats overseas, we want our government to be able to ensure it is \ntaking steps to protect the American people. But having more and more \nAmericans swept up in these searches, particularly the changing nature \nof a communications system being integrated, strikes me as a very big \nproblem.\n  I am going to be back to join my colleague very shortly, but I would \nbe very interested in my colleague's thoughts on the importance of \nclosing this backdoor search loophole.\n  We have tried in the past. I think that now, particularly, when we \nhave had a chance to walk this through in terms of what it really \nmeans, my hope is we can finally close it.\n  What would my colleague's reaction be with respect to the importance \nof this?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think it is a great question, and some are saying that \nthrough the backdoor of abusing 702, that if there were 90,000 people \ntargeted last year through using this 702, that we collected the \ninformation on 900,000 individuals who were incidental and were not the \ntarget at all. So for every one byte of data we are collecting on \nsomebody, we are collecting nine bytes of data on somebody who is not \nthe target.\n  But that becomes part of this enormous data center that we are \nbuilding. And many of those people are Americans who were getting \nthrough the backdoor.\n  But also why I am here today is I want the leadership to allow us to \nhave our amendments. That is one of our amendments. That is a joint \namendment we have worked on. We have been working on these things for \nmonths. This only comes up every 3 years. Should they not give us a day \nto have a vote on some of these amendments?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will be back to rejoin him in a \nfew minutes. I do so appreciate my colleague's stamina and passion.\n  I went to school on a basketball scholarship, and I think I have been \nable to stay in a little bit of shape, but my friend from Kentucky has \nsure shown both his commitment and his stamina. I am going to have to \ntake a brief meeting on one of the issues pending, but I intend to join \nmy colleague here before too long.\n  I thank the Senator. I will have additional questions at that time.\n  I return the floor to Senator Paul.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator for that question.\n  In the New York Times, in March of 2014, Clara Miller writes about \nsome of the costs on U.S. tech companies that are occurring from some \nof this:\n\n       Microsoft has lost customers, including the government of \n     Brazil.\n       IBM is spending more than a billion dollars to build data \n     centers overseas to reassure foreign customers that their \n     information is safe from the prying eyes in the United States \n     government.\n       And tech companies abroad, from Europe to South America, \n     say they are gaining customers that are shunning U.S. \n     providers, suspicious because of the revelations by Edward J. \n     Snowden that tied these providers to the National Security \n     Agency's vast surveillance program.\n\n  The estimates are in the billions of dollars lost to American \ncompanies.\n\n       Even as Washington grapples with the diplomatic and \n     political fallout of Mr. Snowden's leaks, the more urgent \n     issue, companies and analysts say, is economic. Tech \n     executives, including Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, raised the \n     issue when they went to the White House...for a meting with \n     President Obama.\n       It is impossible to see now the full economic ramifications \n     of the spying disclosures--in part because most companies are \n     locked in multiyear contracts--but the pieces are beginning \n     to add up as businesses question the trustworthiness of \n     American technology products.\n       The confirmation hearing last week for the new NSA chief, \n     the video appearance of Mr. Snowden at a technology \n     conference in Texas and the drip of new details about \n     government spying have kept attention focused on an issue \n     that many tech executives hoped would go away.\n       Despite the tech companies' assertions that they provide \n     information on their customers only when required under law--\n     and not knowingly through a back door--the perception that \n     they enabled the spying program has lingered. ``It's clear to \n     every single tech company that this is affecting their bottom \n     line,'' said Daniel Castro, a senior analyst at the \n     Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, who \n     predicted that the United States cloud computing industry \n     would lose $35 billion by 2016.\n       Forester Research, a technology research firm, said the \n     losses could be as high as $180 billion, or 25 percent of \n     industry revenue, based on the size of the cloud computing, \n     web hosting and outsourcing markets and the worst case for \n     damages.\n       The business effect of the disclosures about the NSA is \n     felt most in the daily conversations between tech companies \n     with products to pitch and their wary customers. The topic of \n     the surveillance, which rarely came up before, is now ``the \n     new normal'' in these conversations, as one tech company \n     executive described it. ``We're hearing from customers, \n     especially global enterprise customers, that they care more \n     than ever about where their content is stored and how it is \n     used and secured,'' said John E. Frank, deputy general \n     counsel at Microsoft, which has been publicizing that it \n     allows customers to store their data in Microsoft data \n     centers in certain countries.\n\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\n\n  Isn't that sad? Isn't it sad that a great American company is having \nto advertise that they are storing their information in other countries \nbecause in America we are not protecting your privacy? Isn't that sad, \nthat a great American company, in order to stay in business, is having \nto advertise to their customers that they are keeping their information \nin another country?\n\n       At the same time, Mr. Castro said, companies say they \n     believe the Federal Government is only making a bad situation \n     worse. ``Most of the companies in this space are very \n     frustrated because there hasn't been any kind of response \n     that's made it so they can go back to their customers and \n     say, 'See, this is what's different now, you can trust us \n     again,''' he said.\n       In some cases, that has meant forgoing potential revenue.\n       Though it is hard to quantify missed opportunities, \n     American businesses are being left off some requests for \n     proposals from foreign customers that previously would have \n     included them, said James Staten, a cloud computing analyst \n     at Forester who has read clients' requests for proposals. \n     There are German companies, Mr. Staten said, ``explicitly not \n     inviting certain American companies to join.'' He added, \n     ``It's like, `Well, the very best vendor to do this is IBM, \n     and you didn't invite them.'''\n       The result has been a boon for foreign countries.\n       Runbox, a Norwegian email service that markets itself as an \n     alternative to American services like Gmail and says it does \n     not comply with foreign court orders seeking personal \n     information, reported a 34 percent annual increase in \n     customers after news of the NSA surveillance.\n       Brazil and the European Union, which had used American \n     undersea cables for intercontinental communication, last \n     month decided to build their own cables between Brazil and \n     Portugal, and gave the contract to Brazilian and Spanish \n     companies. Brazil also announced plans to abandon Microsoft \n     Outlook for its own email system that uses Brazilian data \n     centers.\n\n  Anybody still think this bulk collection is a good idea for America?\n\n       Mark J. Barrenechea, chief executor of OpenText, Canada's \n     largest software company, said an anti-American attitude took \n     root after the passage of the PATRIOT Act, the \n     counterterrorism law passed after 9/11 that expanded the \n     government's surveillance powers.\n\n  This is all coming from a New York Times article by Claire Miller \nfrom March of 2014.\n\n       But ``the volume of the discussion has risen significantly \n     post-Snowden,'' he said. For instance, after the NSA \n     surveillance was revealed, one of OpenText's clients, a \n     global steel manufacturer based in Britain, demanded that its \n     data not cross U.S. orders. ``Issues like privacy are more \n     important than finding the cheapest price,'' said Matthias \n     Kunisch, a German software executive who spurned U.S. cloud \n     computing providers for Deutsche Telekom. ``Because of \n     Snowden, our customers have the perception that American \n     companies have connections to the NSA.''\n       Security analysts say that ultimately the fallout from Mr. \n     Snowden's revelations could mimic what happened to Huawei, \n     the Chinese technology and telecommunications company, which \n     was forced to abandon major acquisitions and contracts when \n     American lawmakers claimed that the company's products \n     contained a backdoor for the People's Liberation Army of \n     China--even though this claim was never definitively \n     verified.\n       Silicon Valley companies have complained to government \n     officials that Federal actions are hurting American \n     technology businesses. But companies fall silent when it \n     comes to specifics about economic harm, whether to avoid \n     frightening shareholders or because it is too early to \n     produce concrete evidence.\n       ``The companies need to keep the priority on the government \n     to do something about it, but they don't have the evidence to \n     go to the government and say billions of dollars are not \n     coming to this country,'' Mr. Staten said.\n       Some American companies say the business hit has been minor \n     at most. John T. Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco \n     Systems, said in an interview that the NSA disclosures had \n     not affected Cisco's sales ``in a major way.'' Although deals \n     in Europe and Asia have been slower to close, he said, they \n     are still being completed--an experience echoed by other . . \n     . companies.\n       Security analysts say tech companies have collectively \n     spent millions and possibly billions of dollars adding state-\n     of-the-art encryption features to consumer services, like \n     Google search and Microsoft Outlook, and to the cables that \n     link data centers at Google, Yahoo and other companies.\n       IBM said in January that it would spend $1.2 billion to \n     build 15 new data centers, including in London, Hong Kong, \n     and Sidney, Australia, to lure foreign customers that are \n     sensitive about the location of their data.\n\n  Isn't it sad that companies want to avoid being in America? They want \nto avoid having their information cross our borders.\n\n       Salesforce.com announced similar plans this month.\n       Germany and Brazil, where it was revealed that the NSA \n     spied on government leaders, have been particularly \n     adversarial towards American companies and the government. \n     Lawmakers, including in Germany, are considering legislation \n     that would make it costly or even technically impossible for \n     American tech companies to operate inside their borders.\n       Yet some government officials say laws like this could have \n     a motive other than protecting privacy. Shutting out American \n     companies ``means more business for local companies,'' \n     Richard A. Clarke, a former White House counterterrorism \n     adviser, said last month.\n\n  This is an article that was published on NPR's Web site. The headline \nis ``As Congress Haggles over Patriot Act, We Answer 6 Basic \nQuestions.''\n  Quoting from the article:\n\n       A key section of the Patriot Act--a part of the law the \n     White House uses to conduct mass surveillance on the call \n     records of Americans--is set to expire June 1. That leaves \n     legislators with a big decision to make: Rewrite the statute \n     to outlaw or modify the practice or extend the statute and \n     let the National Security Agency continue with its work.\n\n  I think it will be interesting to see how the debate ultimately plays \nout. You have what has been passed in the House--the USA FREEDOM Act--\nand passed in the House overwhelmingly. The majority here probably \nbelieves we are not collecting enough bulk data. They would prefer to \ncollect more bulk phone data and aren't too concerned that any privacy \ninterests are being trampled upon.\n  So you have two sort of contrary opinions in wondering which \ndirection we go. Some who want more collection of data and say we are \nnot collecting enough data say they might live with it if we add in and \nforce the phone companies to keep the data. Right now, the bill doesn't \nhave them keeping the data. But the concern for some of those of us who \nbelieve in privacy is that we may just be trading one form of bulk \ncollection for another, that we may be trading a system where the \ngovernment collects the data and there is a bulk collection for a \nsystem where the phone companies have the bulk collection but you are \nstill having the same sort of collection of data.\n  My concern with the USA FREEDOM Act is that it still, I believe, may \nallow for a nonspecific warrant. It still may allow for bulk collection \nin the sense that it says you have to select a specific person, but the \nspecific person can be a corporation. So if you still have a \ncorporation--the problem is that if we put the name ``Verizon'' in and \nyou are getting all of Verizon's customers and the only difference is \nthe phone company is holding the information and then divulging it \nversus the government holding it, I am not so sure we have had so much \nof an improvement.\n  Some will say we just need to be safe, we just need to do whatever it \ntakes, that it doesn't matter if we give up any kinds of basic freedoms \nor privacy in the process. But I think we give up on who we are as a \npeople if we say that basically, at all cost, regardless of what it \ntakes, we are going to do this to keep ourselves safe.\n  The thing is that even the President's privacy commission and the \nPresident's review commission--two independent, nonpartisan bodies--\nended up saying that they didn't think anybody was independently \ncaptured, that there was no unique information that was actually gotten \nfrom either of these programs, that the bulk collection of data hadn't \nmade us safer but it has infringed upon our privacy.\n  I think if we don't have a significant debate on this, if we continue \nto say ``Well, we are up against a deadline, and because there is a \ndeadline, we don't have time for amendments,'' I think we run a real \nrisk with the American people. Congress has about a 10-percent approval \nrating right now, and some argue that might be a little bit high \nconsidering how great a job we are doing--a 10-percent approval rating.\n  The vast majority of the American people think we have gone too far \nin the bulk collection of records. In the ACLU survey we looked at a \nlittle bit earlier, in the age group between 19 to 39, over 80 percent \nof people think we have gone too far and we are not protecting privacy.\n\n  (Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.)\n  We just read an article from the New York Times in which they talk \nabout what kind of business is potentially being lost because people \ndon't want\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nAmerican products. I think it is kind of sad. Not only do they not want \ntheir data held in a center in our country, they don't want their data \ncrossing into our country.\n  I don't think we have to be that fearful of terrorism that we have to \ngive up who we are in the process.\n  I have met some of our young soldiers who have come back with missing \nlimbs. I have met the parents of some who have died. And to a person, \nthey say they were fighting for our Bill of Rights and they were \nfighting for our Constitution. It is difficult for me to understand how \nwe can take into account the sacrifice they made in war and at the same \ntime, while we are here safe at home, we can't even protect the \ndocuments they are fighting for.\n  I see no reason why we can't rely on the Constitution. I see no \nreason why we can't rely on traditional warrants. Warrants are not hard \nto get. Warrants are actually quite easy to get. Warrants are, if \nanything, very easy to get. On the FISA Court, turning down a warrant \nis almost nonexistent. So I see no reason why we can't try using the \nConstitution for a while.\n  I am concerned that the problem is bigger than just what we are \ntalking about today. We are talking about the bulk collection of \nrecords supposedly under section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. If we stop \nthat, how much have we stopped? How much is still in existence? How \nmuch are we still doing through other venues?\n  I think probably the most alarming thing we have come across as I \nhave been talking today is the idea that some people believe the \nPresident has inherent powers that are not subject to Congress. That, \nto me, is very alarming.\n  It also means that I think that because this opinion persists within \nthe executive branch, there are in all likelihood many programs like \nthe bulk collection of data--many programs that we don't know about, \nsome that we have heard about. It is still not clear to me whether the \nStellar Wind Program is completely gone, which involves more than just \ntelephone data, email conversations, computer addresses, and credit \ncards. What is the government collecting? How much is being collected \nand under what authority?\n  It does concern me that there are people--some of them elected \nofficials--who believe in the inherent powers of the Presidency that \ncannot be challenged even by Congress. We have a lot of work if that is \nreally what we are up against.\n  I think it would be a big step forward if we do something about the \nbulk collection of data. But I think, given the court case, it is \nconcerning to me that we might actually make the court case or the \nfuture of it moot and that we actually could make things worse. It \nwouldn't be the first time we have made things worse, thinking we were \nfixing things and made it worse.\n  From the opinion of the Second Circuit Court, here are some quotes.\n  The court writes:\n\n       That telephone metadata do not directly reveal the content \n     of telephone calls does not vitiate the privacy concerns \n     arising out of the government's bulk collection of such data. \n     . . . the startling amount of detailed information metadata \n     can reveal, information that could traditionally only be \n     obtained by examining the contents. . . .\n\n  I think this is a good point because many people want to downplay \nwhat metadata is or what you can determine from it. But here is the \ncourt acknowledging that you may actually get more detailed information \nfrom metadata than what you once got from obtaining the content.\n  When we think about how true this is, think about if someone were \njust going to come into your house and take your papers. What could \nthey find? How many people even have personal letters anymore? People \ndon't have anything on paper that is personal at all. A lot of people \npay their bills online. But it is amazing, if you put the compilation \nof all the metadata together, what you can determine.\n  Remember that a high-ranking intelligence official said that we kill \npeople based on metadata. I presume he is talking about foreigners. But \nif we are killing people based on metadata, the assumption is that they \ncan get an enormous amount of information from metadata, and we should \nbe very careful about releasing this.\n  They give an example of the sort of metadata and what it can \ndetermine:\n\n       For example, a call to a single-purpose telephone number \n     such as a ``hotline'' might reveal that an individual is: a \n     victim of domestic violence or rape; a veteran; suffering \n     from an addiction of one type or another; contemplating \n     suicide; or reporting a crime.\n       Metadata can reveal civil, political, or religious \n     affiliations; they can also reveal an individual's social \n     status, or whether and when he or she is involved in intimate \n     relationships.\n       The more metadata the government collects and analyzes, \n     furthermore, the greater the capacity for such metadata to \n     reveal ever more private and previously unascertainable \n     information about individuals.\n\n  That is sort of interesting also about metadata. We have so much \nonline and so much information on our phones that you could probably be \nin someone's house for a month and never find that in paper because so \nmuch of our lives revolve through the phone, through things we order \nand phone calls and all of that, that in the old days what could have \nbeen gotten through someone's castle, through someone's actual papers \nin their house, I think pales in comparison to what you can get simply \nthrough metadata even without content.\n  They make another point, too:\n\n       Finally, as appellants . . . point out, in today's \n     technologically based world, it is virtually impossible for \n     an ordinary citizen to avoid creating metadata about himself \n     [or herself] on a regular basis simply by conducting his \n     ordinary affairs.\n       The order thus requires Verizon to produce call detail \n     records every day on all telephone calls made through its \n     systems or using its service where one or both ends of the \n     phone call are located in the United States.\n\n  It is hard for me to believe that there are people who don't \nunderstand that what we are talking about here is a general warrant. \nThis is what we fought the Revolution over. This is, as John Adams \nsaid, the spark that led to the Revolution. The spark that led to the \nRevolution was the whole worry and concern, one, that soldiers were \nwriting the warrants, and the other concern was that in writing the \nwarrants, they weren't specific to anyone, they were being written in a \ngeneral fashion, and that by writing them generally so, there could be \nan injustice in having an entire group who ends up being subject to a \nwarrant that is not specific.\n  From the appellate court, we also hear that the metadata has a reach \nfar beyond almost imagination.\n  In the article ``As Congress Haggles over Patriot Act, We Answer 6 \nBasic Questions,'' which was published on npr.org, there are several \nquestions they ask about the PATRIOT Act debate.\n  Most of the talk has been about telephone surveillance, but the \nquestion is this:\n\n       What about the NSA's surveillance of email and other \n     Internet activities?\n       This congressional debate has nothing to do with any of \n     NSA's surveillance Internet activity.\n       That's mostly because of the fact that those programs are \n     authorized by different laws.\n       The PRISM program, for example, which collects a vast \n     amount of Internet data . . . is covered under section 702 of \n     the FISA Amendments Act.\n\n  Some have said that the PRISM Program probably is collecting more \ninformation in many ways, maybe even dwarfing the bulk collection of \nthe phone records. So if we don't address section 702 in this debate, \nthis is also what we were talking about earlier, is the backdoor, the \nability to say: Well, we are investigating someone in a foreign \ncountry, but really they are trying to get access to someone in our \ncountry through the backdoor. If we don't address this, we may well not \nbe addressing a significant part of the problem.\n  This is one of the other questions:\n\n       Is there anything else in the House bill we should know \n     about?\n       The bill [the USA FREEDOM Act] lifts the secrecy \n     surrounding key decisions made by the secret Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Court. Going forward, some will be \n     made public.\n\n  I think this is a step in the right direction. There are a lot of \nlegal decisions, and I think we can discuss the pros and cons of the \nlegal decision without having to know the specific details. I think \nSenator Wyden made a good point on this earlier when he said that it is \nnot the operational details we need to know, but when we are \nquestioning and debating the law, there is\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\nno reason why that shouldn't be public knowledge.\n  One of the reasons we would like to see the court rulings, too, is \nthat the FISA Court found bulk data collection constitutional. I still \nfind that somewhat inconceivable, that a court that is anything less \nthan a rubberstamp could find it somehow reasonable to say that \ncollecting all of our records in advance really is relevant to an \ninvestigation. I think it is a pretty significant point that they are \nnot going to query the data until after they get it. So there is no \ninvestigation until they have already collected the data.\n  The other point is that when they say it is relevant, is anybody \nreally determining that arguing one way or the other or do we just \naccept what the NSA says, that the data is relevant?\n  Nobody knows what will come of this debate. My hope in going on all \nday with this debate and trying to force the issue is to try to allow \nfor some votes on some amendments to this. We shouldn't have just an \nup-or-down vote on whether to extend the PATRIOT Act. I think that when \nwe have 80 percent of the population in some cases but at least two-\nthirds of the entire population saying that the bulk collection of all \nof our phone records all of the time without a warrant is something \nthat has gone too far and needs to stop, it is an insult to the \nAmerican people to think that we are not going to have any vote at all, \nthat we would just have a vote up or down on extending this.\n  I think we really do need to have a vote, and the vote needs to be on \nmany different alternatives. It shouldn't just be on one alternative. \nIt needs to be on section 702 and the FISA amendments. It should be on \na variety of things that could make this better--whether FBI agents \nshould be able to write their own warrants or whether they should be \nsigned by judges. There are a variety of things we need to be talking \nabout. The Senate could simply take up the House bill and pass the \nHouse bill, but I think that is unlikely.\n\n  This is an interesting article from The Boston Globe, a while back. \nIt says: ``What your metadata says about you: From MIT's Cesar Hidalgo, \na new window on what your email habits reveal.''\n  The article is written by Abraham Rieseman.\n\n       As recently as a few weeks ago, ``metadata'' was an obscure \n     term known mainly to techies and academics. Broadly defined, \n     metadata is data about other data. For the phone company, it \n     might be the time and length of your calls, but not the \n     conversation itself; in the context of email, it means \n     information such as the sender and recipients of a message--\n     basically, everything except what the message actually says.\n\n  We spoke earlier about the suspicious activity reports. These are \nreports that the government requires that banks send in. It adds a cost \nto your banking, and it is a pretty significant intrusion into the \nbanking affairs and also into an individual's affairs.\n  This is an article that was written by the ACLU about suspicious \nactivity reports.\n\n       Law enforcement agencies have long collected information \n     about their routine interactions with members of the public. \n     Sometimes called ``field interrogation reports'' or ``stop \n     and frisk records,'' this documentation, on the one hand, \n     provides a measure of accountability over police activity. \n     But it also creates an opportunity for police to collect the \n     personal data of innocent people and put it into criminal \n     intelligence files with little or no evidence of wrongdoing. \n     As police records increasingly become automated, law \n     enforcement and intelligence agencies are increasingly \n     seeking to mine this data.\n       The Supreme Court established ``reasonable suspicion'' as \n     the standard for police stops in Terry v. Ohio in 1968. This \n     standard required suspicions supported by articulable facts \n     suggesting criminal activity was afoot . . .\n\n  In the suspicious activity reports, though, these kinds of programs \nthreaten this reasonable time-tested law enforcement standard by \nencouraging the police and the public to report behaviors that do not \nrise to reasonable suspicion. So it is one thing to say that someone \nhas done something that rises to reasonable suspicion, but it is \nanother to say that activity that could be perfectly normal, like \nwithdrawing $1,000 from the bank or putting $1,000 in the bank, somehow \nis suspicion of a crime that we should be investigating.\n  A lot of this stuff has gotten really, really out of control. It is \none of the things where actually the newspapers have done a pretty good \njob of reporting some of the stuff--not necessarily the suspicious \nactivity reports but on some of the other confiscations of people's \nassets without really evidence of a crime but maybe evidence that they \nhave cash.\n  You can be driving down the road in DC and make an unsafe lane change \nand the government asks you if you have money. You then find that the \ngovernment takes it or the government says: Well, you have $2,000. We \nwill let you keep $1,000 if you sign a statement saying that you will \nnot sue us to get the $1,000 back.\n  Believe it or not, that is stuff that is still happening in our \ncountry. It is called civil asset forfeiture. To make it worse, we \nactually give a perverse incentive. We say to the local officials that \nif you capture money from people, we will give you a percentage of it--\nso the more you take, the more you get.\n  Some people have shown that people actually go after things that are \npaid off. There was a motel in New Jersey, the Motel Caswell. Local \nofficials decided they would go after it because, they said, there had \nbeen some drug dealings at the motel. It turned out there were 6 people \nin the motel selling drugs out of 180,000 visits or something \nridiculous.\n  It turned out there were other hotels that had a higher percentage of \ndrug busts done at the hotel, but they owed money and the Motel Caswell \nwas completely paid off. It may have been part of the decisionmaking \nprocess, because when the government came and seized the hotel for \nillegal activity, they took the hotel and went sell it, but it has a \nlien against it. The bank owns it, and you do not get to sell it very \neasily. It was paid off. They were going to sell it. It is a $1.5 \nmillion hotel. And then, I guess, the local police forces would benefit \nby that.\n  It is not just with our records that there is a problem. It is also \nwith the concern for how we adjudicate justice in our country. As we \nsee this moving forward, I think we need to be worried about not only \nthe way our records are collected, but we need to be concerned about \njustice in general.\n  As I have traveled around the country, one of the things I have seen \nis what I call an undercurrent of unease in our country. I traveled to \nFerguson. I have traveled to Detroit. I have been to Chicago. I have \nbeen to most of our major cities, and I have also been to some of the \nplaces where there has been this anger.\n  I think people are angry because they do not feel that government is \ntreating them justly. People do not like to be treated arbitrarily. In \nfact, there are some who have given the definition of what is \nacceptable, what is good government and what is bad government, what is \ngood law and what is bad law, what is just and what is unjust. But \nwhether it is arbitrary or not, Hyack in ``The Road to Serfdom'' talks \nabout that arbitrariness, not having the predictability of knowing what \nthe law will do. That the law does not do the same thing to all \nindividuals is a definition of the injustice that causes people to be \nunhappy about the way their government treats them.\n  My fear is that this arbitrary nature of collecting bulk records, of \ncollecting all of our records without a significant warrant--the \nproblem here is going to be something that adds on to a sense of unease \nthat is in our cities and in our country at-large. What happens is that \neverybody is not treated exactly equal. People do not have the same \nresources to try to escape the clutches of Big Brother when either data \nor information is used against them.\n  One of the little-noticed sections in the USA FREEDOM Act deals with \nthe safety of maritime navigation and nuclear terrorists and \nconventions implementation. Interestingly, there is a provision somehow \nin this for civil forfeiture. But I think the biggest problem with \ncivil forfeiture is that we allow it to occur without a conviction. I \nthink no one should have their possessions taken from them. I think you \nshould be innocent until proven guilty.\n  I see that the Senator from Connecticut has a question. I would be \nhappy to entertain a question without losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky for \ngiving me the opportunity to ask a\n\n[[Page S3163]]\n\nquestion. In the preface to that question, I would like to make a \ncouple of remarks if he will yield to me for that purpose.\n  My colleague from Kentucky has taken the floor tonight in the highest \ntraditions of the Senate to make a point that should be meaningful to \nall of us who care about our democracy. My colleagues, including the \nSenator from Kentucky, have made a number of important points about the \ndangers of mass surveillance and the harms caused by the bulk \ncollection of Americans' data.\n  I agree with those who have pointed out that the USA FREEDOM Act is a \nstrong compromise solution for protecting Americans' freedom and \nsecurity at the same time as striking a balance between preserving our \nsecurity and protecting our precious rights.\n  I want to highlight for the Senator from Kentucky, in his very \ninsightful remarks, as well as for my colleagues and others who are \ninterested in this topic, a particular part of that legislation--the \nprovisions that deal with the adversarial process in the FISA Court.\n  The bulk collection program is a powerful example of why we need a \nstronger adversarial process. We know that bulk metadata collection is \nunnecessary. The President's own review group has made that clear. We \nalso know that bulk metadata collection is un-American. This country \nwas founded by people who rightly abhorred the general warrant, and no \ngeneral warrant in our history has swept up as much information about \ninnocent Americans as the orders permitting and enabling bulk \ncollection.\n  Last week, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that bulk \ncollection is also unauthorized by the law. More than 9 years after the \ngovernment began bulk collection, we are finally told by the highest \ncourt to consider the question that the bulk collection program was \nnever authorized by Congress.\n  How do we get here? How do we arrive at a place where one of the most \nrespected courts of appeals in the United States says that the \nexecutive branch of our government has been collecting data on innocent \nAmericans without legal authority to do so--in fact, breaking the law \nby invading Americans' privacy?\n  We got here because the FISA Court failed its most crucial test. In \nMay of 2006, the FISA Court was asked whether the Federal Government \ncould collect phone records of potentially every single American. The \nargument hinged on the word ``relevance'' in the statute. Under the \nstatute, the Federal Government can collect relevant information. The \ncourt had to decide whether ``relevant information'' means all \ninformation.\n  That does not strike me as a difficult question. Does ``relevant \ninformation'' mean all information? It did not strike the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals as a difficult question either.\n  The Second Circuit held that the Federal Government's interpretation \nis ``unprecedented and unwarranted.'' Those are strong words for a \ncourt normally extraordinarily reserved and understated in its \ncharacterization of illegality by the executive branch. But the court \nsaid unequivocally and emphatically that the Government was breaking \nthe law.\n  Never before in the history of the Nation had such a bizarre \ninterpretation been entertained. At the very least, you would have \nthought the FISA Court would recognize that its May 2006 decision was \nimportant.\n  If this question had gone to a regular article III court, it would \nhave been immediately recognized as a momentous decision, permitting \nbulk collection of data on every American. Litigants on both sides \nwould have, in effect, pulled out all the stops in their arguments. Yet \nnot only did the FISA Court get the question wrong in May of 2006, it \nappears not even to have spotted the issue, not even to have raised it \nand addressed it in its opinion. Of course, nobody knew it at the time \nbecause the opinion itself was kept secret, as were all of the \nproceedings on this issue.\n  The FISA Court upheld the government's bulk collection program, and \nit did so without even writing an opinion explaining its legal \nreasoning. Not until the program was made public roughly 8 years later \nwas an opinion written, and every opinion released so far has omitted \nkey issues or ignored key precedent.\n  If the court had written an opinion, at least Congress would have \nquickly known what the court had done, not to mention the American \npeople would have known what the court had done, but the court wrote \nnothing. It chose to be silent and secret, and apparently it believed \nthis issue merited no notice to the Congress. A court that could get \nsuch an important question so disastrously and desperately wrong is \nfundamentally broken.\n  Let me be clear. I do not mean to denigrate the judges of the FISA \nCourt. Any judge, no matter how wise and well attuned to legal issues, \nneeds to hear both sides of an argument in order to avoid mistakes. \nCourts make better decisions when they hear both sides.\n  In fact, during a hearing on this issue in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, I had the opportunity to ask one of the Nation's foremost \njurists whether she could do her job without hearing from both sides of \nan argument, and she was quite clear that she could not. Adversarial \nbriefing, she explained, is essential to good decisionmaking.\n  We know as much from our own everyday lives that we make better \ndecisions when we know the argument against what we are going to do, \nwhat we are going to think, and what we are going to say. It is the \ngenius of the American system of jurisprudence that judges listen to \nboth sides in open court before they make a decision. Their rulings are \npublic, and they themselves are evaluated and judged.\n  Nine years after the FISA Court's ruling in May of 2006, we continue \nto wrestle with the impact of the court's grievous, egregious error, \nbut we cannot simply fix the mistake without fixing the court. We \ncannot fix the system without remedying the process because that \nprocess is so broken, it will make more mistakes--not only predictable \nmistakes but inevitable mistakes.\n  As technology evolves, we cannot say with certainty what the next big \nprivacy issue will be. In 2006, the FISA Court decided whether the \ngovernment can collect all of our phone records. In 2020, the \ngovernment will have some new means of surveillance, and they will want \nto try it. In 2030, we will have another.\n  We need a FISA Court that we can trust to get the question right. \nTrust, confidence, and the integrity of the judicial system that \nauthorizes the surveillance of Americans' private lives is at issue \nhere.\n  We need a FISA Court that operates transparently, openly, and has \naccountability. A court that operates in secret and hears only the \nviews of the government and faces only minimal appellate reviews cannot \nbe trusted to pass the next big test.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act would fix this systemic problem. It would demand, \nunder certain circumstances, that the FISA Court hear from both sides \nof the issue and explain why it is making a decision and also explain \nwhy it has decided not to hear both sides if it chooses to do so. That \nwould bring transparency to the FISA Court decision, requiring them to \nbe released unless there is good reason not to release them. It \npreserves the confidentiality of the court where necessary, but it also \nprotects the fundamental, deeply rooted sense of American justice that \nan adversarial, open process is important--indeed, essential--to \ndemocracy. And it would provide some appellate review, some form of \nreview by an appellate court so that if mistakes are made, they are \nmore likely to be caught and stopped before they result in fundamental \ninvasion of private rights.\n  In short, the USA FREEDOM Act will make the FISA Court look more like \nthe courts Americans deal with in other walks of life, more like the \ncourts they know when they are litigants, when they are spectators, and \nmore like the courts our Founders anticipated.\n  What would they have thought about a court that hears cases in \nsecret, makes secret decisions, operates in secret, and issues secret \nrulings? They would get it wrong. They would have thought that that \nsounds a lot like the Star Chamber, that sounds a lot like the so-\ncalled courts that caused our rebellion.\n  This change will help ensure that we are not back in this Chamber 9 \nyears from now debating the next mass surveillance program that started \nwithout\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\nCongress actually authorizing it, as did metadata collection. It will \nhelp ensure that strictures of our Constitution are obeyed in spirit \nand letter. It will help ensure that programs designed to keep \nAmericans safe can command the respect and trust they need to be \neffective. We need those programs. National security must be preserved \nand protected, but we need not sacrifice fundamental rights in the \nprocess.\n  Unless and until this essential reform is enacted, along with the \nother essential reforms contained in the USA FREEDOM Act, I will oppose \nany reauthorization of section 215.\n  The question that I ask my colleague from Kentucky and the point that \nI think he has made so powerfully and eloquently relates to this \nessential feature of our American jurisprudence system. Are not open \nadversarial courts essential to the trust and confidence of the \nAmerican people, and do we not need that kind of fundamental reform in \norder to preserve our basic liberties?\n  I ask this question of my colleague and friend from Kentucky because \nI think his debate on the floor of this Senate tonight raises \nfundamental issues that need to be discussed and addressed.\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the opportunity to ask this \nquestion and address this body.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. PAUL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for that question.\n  I think one of the points my friend was making through the question \nhad to do with the whole idea of relevance, which is sort of an amazing \nthing.\n  I think the quote from the privacy and civil liberties commission \nreally hits the nail on the head--that they cannot be regarded as \nrelevant to any FBI investigations required by the statute without \nredefining the word ``relevant'' in a manner that is circular, \nunlimited in scope, and out of step with the case law.\n  The interesting thing is that we want a body that works a little more \nlike a court, and I know the Senator from Connecticut has been in favor \nof having a special advocate and trying to make it more like a \ncourtroom. I think you can only get the truth if you have people on \nboth sides. If you have people on one side, it is an inevitability that \nthe truth is going to be lost and you are going to list in one \ndirection.\n  I think that will be a huge step forward, but it does boggle the mind \nthat we can have them arguing that this is relevant to an investigation \nthat has not yet occurred because we are collecting data and then we \nare going to mine it at some other time for some investigation. So it \ncouldn't be relevant to an investigation because there is not yet an \ninvestigation when they are collecting the data. And no FISA Court \nseemed to question that, so it concerns me as to whether it is a very \ngood kind of undertaking at finding the truth.\n  So I think the Senator is exactly right, and I believe there are \nthings we can definitely do to make it better. I think the bottom line \nis that we should not collect bulk data on people who are not suspected \nof a crime.\n  One of the sections of the PATRIOT Act that doesn't get quite as much \ndiscussion is section 213. That is the sneak-and-peek section and it is \nnot up for renewal, but it is something that also shows how we have \nreally gone awry on that.\n  Radley Balko has written about this in the Washington Post, and it is \nhow something starts out just a little bit at a time and grows bigger \nand bigger.\n  From 2001 to 2003, law enforcement only did 47 sneak-and-peek \nsearches. The 2010 report said it was up to 3,970, and 3 years later, \nin 2013, there were 11,129 sneak-and-peek searches. That is an increase \nof over 7,000 requests. That is exactly what privacy advocates argued \nin 2001 would happen.\n  The interesting thing is that when you look to see who exactly we are \narresting through these sneak-and-peek warrants that were intended to \nbe a lower standard so we could catch terrorists, well, we are going \nafter drug dealers. So, in essence, we have changed from a \nconstitutional standard to catch drug dealers down to a terrorist \nstandard, which is a lower standard.\n  To make matters worse, there are accusations and implications from \ndata that maybe the war on drugs has a disproportionate racial outcome. \nI think it is concerning that we are actually not using a \nconstitutional standard but a lower standard.\n  I have an article that was written by Radley Balko in 2014 that \nappeared in the Washington Post. He says:\n\n       Washington establishment types are often dismissive and \n     derisive of the idea that members of Congress should actually \n     be required to read legislation before voting on it--or at \n     the very least be given the time to read it. There's also a \n     lot of Beltway scorn for demands that bills be concise, \n     limited in scope and open for public comment in their final \n     form for days or weeks before they're voted on. If you're \n     looking for evidence showing why the smug consensus is wrong, \n     here is Exhibit A.\n\n  He is talking about the sneak-and-peek and how if we had known what \nwas in it, we would have known in advance that it was not really going \nto end up being used for terrorists and instead end up being used for \ndomestic crime.\n  He says:\n\n       This is also an argument against rashly legislating in a \n     time of crisis. On Sept. 11, 2001, the federal government \n     failed in most important and basic responsibility--to protect \n     us from an attack. We responded by quickly giving the federal \n     government a host of new powers.\n\n  Assume that any power you grant to the Federal Government to fight \nterrorism will inevitably be used in other context.\n  The article goes on:\n\n       Assume that the primary ``other context'' will be to fight \n     the war on drugs. (Here's another example just from this \n     month.) I happen to believe that the drug war is \n     illegitimate. I think fighting terrorism is an entirely \n     legitimate function of government. I also think that, in \n     theory, there are some powers the federal government should \n     have for terrorism investigations that I'm not comfortable \n     granting it in more traditional criminal investigations. But \n     I have zero confidence that there's any way to grant those \n     powers in a way that will limit their use to terrorism.\n       Law-and-order politicians and many (but not all) law \n     enforcement and national security officials see the Bill of \n     Rights not as the foundation of a free society but as an \n     obstacle that prevents them from doing their jobs. Keep this \n     in mind when they use a national emergency to argue for \n     exceptions to those rights.\n       When critics point out the ways a new law might be abused, \n     supporters of the law often accuse those critics of being \n     cynical--they say we should have more faith in the judgment \n     and propriety of public officials. Always assume that when a \n     law grants new powers to the government, that law will be \n     interpreted in the vaguest, most expansive, most pro-\n     government manner imaginable. If that doesn't happen, good. \n     But why take the risk? Why leave open the possibility? Better \n     to write laws narrowly, restrictively and with explicit \n     safeguards against abuse.\n\n  Of the 11,000 sneak-and-peek warrants that were issued, 51 were used \nfor terrorism. We lowered the constitutional standard, but we ended up \nusing it for domestic crime, not for terrorism.\n\n  This is happening in other forums. There is something that folks are \ncalling parallel construction. This is an article from the Electronic \nFrontier Foundation by Hanni Fakhoury entitled ``DEA and NSA Team Up to \nShare Intelligence, Leading to Secret Use of Surveillance in Ordinary \nDomestic Crime.''\n\n       Add the IRS to the list of Federal agencies obtaining \n     information from NSA surveillance. Reuters reports that the \n     IRS got intelligence tips from DEA's secret SOD unit and were \n     also told to cover up the source of that information by \n     coming up with their own independent leads to recreate the \n     information obtained from SOD.\n\n  So let me explain what happens. We once again use a lower standard, a \nnonconstitutional standard, the standard we are supposed to be using \nfor terrorists. We get information on people who are not terrorists, \nwho may or may not be committing an IRS violation. We tell the IRS. \nThey know it is illegally obtained information, so then they look for \nanother way to prove that this information--other information that they \ncan find--to prove the point that they only knew about it from legally \nobtained information.\n\n       A startling new Reuters story shows one of the biggest \n     dangers of the surveillance state: The unquenchable thirst \n     for access to the NSA's trove of information by other law \n     enforcement agencies.\n       As the NSA scoops up phone records and other forms of \n     electronic evidence while investigating national security and \n     terrorism leads, they turn over ``tips'' to a division of the \n     Drug Enforcement Agency known as the Special Operations \n     Division. FISA surveillance was originally supposed to be \n     used only in specific authorized national security \n     investigations, but information sharing rules\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\n     implemented after 9/11 allows the NSA to hand over \n     information to traditional domestic law-enforcement agencies, \n     without any connection to terrorism or national security \n     investigations.\n       But instead of being truthful with criminal defendants, \n     judges, and even prosecutors about where the information came \n     from, DEA agents are reportedly obscuring the source of these \n     tips.\n       For example, a law enforcement agent could receive a tip \n     from foreign surveillance, and he could look for a specific \n     car in a certain place.\n       But instead of relying solely on the tip, the agent would \n     be instructed to find his or her own reason to stop and \n     search the car.\n\n  Agents are directed to keep SOD under wraps and not to mention in \ntheir reports where they got their information.\n  If we are going to use standards that are less than the Constitution \nfor IRS investigations, for drug investigations, we ought to just be \nhonest with people that we are no longer using the Constitution. If we \nare going to use the Constitution, then we shouldn't allow evidence \nobtained through foreign surveillance and through a lower standard to \nbe used in domestic crime.\n  (Mr. CRUZ assumed the Chair.)\n  Parallel construction, which is basically getting surveillance tips \nand then using them and reconstructing and trying to come up with a \ndifferent reason for why law enforcement stopped someone, is something \nthat really--if we are not going to be honest about it, someone has to \ndo something to fix this.\n  After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their \ninvestigation began with the traffic stop, not with the tip they got \nfrom our foreign surveillance agencies.\n  The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as \nparallel construction.\n  Senior DEA agents who spoke on behalf of the Agency but only on the \ncondition of anonymity said the process is kept secret to protect \nsources and investigative methods. Realize they are also keeping it \nsecret from a judge, the defense lawyers, and the prosecution.\n  Some have questioned the constitutionality, obviously, of this \nprogram.\n\n       ``That's outrageous,'' said Tampa attorney James Felman, a \n     vice chairman of the criminal justice section of the American \n     Bar Association. ``It strikes me as indefensible.''\n       Lawrence Lustberg, a New York defense lawyer, said any \n     systematic government effort to conceal the circumstances \n     under which cases begin ``would not only be alarming, but \n     pretty blatantly unconstitutional.''\n\n  Former Federal prosecutor Henry Hockmeier wrote: ``You shouldn't be \nallowed to game the system. You shouldn't be allowed to create this \nsubterfuge. These are drugs crimes, not national security cases. If you \ndon't draw the line here, where do you draw it?''\n  This is an article from the Washington Post by Brian Fung entitled \n``The NSA is Giving Your Phone Records to the DEA. And the DEA is \nCovering It Up.''\n\n       A day after we learned of a draining turf battle between \n     the NSA and other law enforcement agencies over bulk \n     surveillance data, it now appears that these same agencies \n     are working together to cover up when those data get shared.\n       The Drug Enforcement Agency has been the recipient of \n     multiple tips from the NSA.\n\n  Realize also that the NSA is supposed to be investigating foreign \nthreats. The NSA was not supposed to be doing anything domestically. We \nnow have them involved in bulk collection, but we also now have them \ninvolved in drug enforcement.\n  The article continues:\n\n       DEA officials in a highly secret office called the Special \n     Operations Division are assigned to handle these incoming \n     tips, according to Reuters. Tips from the NSA are added to a \n     DEA database that includes intelligence intercepts, wiretaps, \n     informants, and a massive database of telephone records. This \n     is problematic because it appears to break down the barrier \n     between foreign counterterrorism investigations and ordinary \n     domestic criminal investigations.\n\n  Because the SOD's work is classified, DEA cases that began as NSA \nleads can't be seen to have originated from an NSA source.\n\n       So what does the DEA do? It makes up a story of how the \n     agency really came to the case in a process known as parallel \n     construction, Reuters explains. Some defense attorneys and \n     former prosecutors said that parallel construction may be \n     legal to establish probable cause for an arrest, but they \n     said employing the practice as a means of disguising how an \n     investigation began may violate pretrial discovery rules by \n     burying evidence that could prove useful to criminal \n     defendants.\n\n  The report makes no explicit connection between the DEA and the \nearlier NSA bulk phone surveillance uncovered by Snowden.\n  In other words, we don't know for sure if the DEA's Special \nOperations Division is getting tips from the same database that has \nbeen the subject of multiple congressional hearings. We just know that \na special outfit within the DEA sometimes gets tips from the NSA.\n\n       There is another reason the DEA would rather not admit the \n     involvement of NSA data in their investigations. It might \n     lead to a constitutional challenge to the very law that gave \n     rise to the evidence.\n       Earlier this year, federal courts said that if law \n     enforcement agencies wanted to use NSA data in court, they \n     had to say so beforehand and give the defendant a chance to \n     contest the legality of the surveillance. Lawyers for Adele \n     Daoud, who was arrested in a federal sting operation and \n     charged, suspect that he was identified using NSA information \n     but were never told.\n       Surveys show most people support the NSA's bulk \n     surveillance program strongly when the words ``terrorism'' or \n     ``courts'' are included in the question. When pollsters draw \n     no connection to terrorism, the support tends to wane. What \n     will happen when the question makes clear that the \n     intelligence not only isn't being used for terrorism \n     investigations against foreign agents, but it is actively \n     being applied to criminal investigations against Americans?\n\n  Some of the companies have begun to push back on the backdoor \nmandates that are coming from government to get into our information.\n\n       In one of the most public confrontations of a top U.S. \n     intelligence official by Silicon Valley in recent years, a \n     senior Yahoo Inc. official peppered [NSA] director, Adm. Mike \n     Rogers, at a conference on Monday over digital spying.\n       The exchange came during a question and answer session at a \n     daylong summit on cybersecurity. . . . Mr. Rogers spent an \n     hour at the conference answering a range of questions. . . .\n       The tense exchange began when Alex Stamos, Yahoo's chief \n     information security officer, asked Mr. Rogers if Yahoo \n     should acquiesce to requests from Saudi Arabia, China, \n     Russia, France and other countries to build a ``backdoor'' in \n     some of their systems that would allow the countries to spy \n     on certain users.\n       ``It sounds like you agree with [FBI Director] Comey that \n     we should be building defects into the encryption in our \n     products so that the US government can decrypt,'' Mr. Stamos \n     said. . . .\n       ``That would be your characterization,'' Mr. Rogers said, \n     cutting the Yahoo executive off.\n       Mr. Stamos was trying to argue that if Yahoo gave the NSA \n     access to this information, other countries could try and \n     compel the company [to do the same].\n       Mr. Rogers said he believed that it ``is achievable'' to \n     create a legal framework that allows the NSA to access \n     encrypted information without upending corporate security \n     programs. He declined to [be more specific].\n       ``Well, do you believe we should build backdoors for other \n     countries?'' Mr. Stamos continued.\n       ``My position is--hey, look''--\n\n  This is from Mr. Rogers, Admiral Rogers--\n\n       ``I think that we're lying that this isn't technically \n     feasible''. . . .\n       He said the framework would have to be worked out ahead of \n     time by policymakers--not the NSA. . . .\n       The back and forth came less than two weeks after Apple, \n     Inc. chief executive Tim Cook leveled his own criticism of \n     Washington, saying at a White House cybersecurity conference \n     in California that people in ``positions of responsibility'' \n     should do everything they can to protect privacy, not steal \n     information.\n       Mr. Rogers attempted to parry the questions but also \n     signaled he welcomed the debate. . . .\n       Still, Mr. Rogers did little to deflect recent accusations \n     about the NSA activities. For example, he refused to comment \n     on recent reports that the NSA and its U.K. counterpart stole \n     information from Gemalto NV, a large Dutch firm that is the \n     world's largest manufacturer of cellphone SIM cards.\n\n  I think the accusations continue to mount. Everywhere we look, we see \nthe anger beginning in our tech industry. We see them wondering about \nhaving backdoor mandates built into their product.\n  I think the Senator from Oregon has been great at pointing this out \nand has written several op-eds talking about what the harm is of \nleaving basically a portal or an opening for our government but one \nthat may well be exploited by hackers and may well be exploited by \nforeign governments.\n  Does the Senator from Oregon have a question?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think my colleague has made the point with respect to \nour government--particularly the FBI Director--actually arguing that \ncompanies should build weaknesses into their systems.\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\n  I note my colleague has been on his feet now for somewhere in the \nvicinity of 9 hours, so I think we are heading into the home stretch. \nFor people who are listening, I think they really are first and \nforemost interested in how this Senate, on a bipartisan basis, can come \nup with policies that ensure that we both protect our privacy and our \nsecurity. As my colleague said, they are not mutually exclusive.\n  So I think what I would like to do is wrap up my questioning tonight \nby talking about how this bulk phone record collection and related \npractices is an actual intrusion on liberty, and to start the \nconversation, you have to first and foremost get through this whole \nconcept of metadata. We heard people say: What is the big deal about \nmetadata? And for quite some time we had Senators saying: What is \neverybody upset about? This is just ``innocent metadata.''\n  Well, metadata, of course, is data about data, but it is not quite so \ninnocent. If you know who someone calls, when that person calls, and \nfor how long they talk, that reveals a lot of private information. \nPersonal relationships, medical concerns, religious or political \naffiliations are just several of the possibilities. Most people that I \ntalk to don't exactly like the government vacuuming up private \ninformation if those persons have done nothing wrong. Now, this is \nespecially true if the phone records include information about the \nlocation and movements of everyone with a cell phone. And we have not \ngotten into this in the course of this evening, but I want to take just \na minute because I think, again, it highlights what the implications \nare.\n  I have repeatedly pushed the intelligence agencies to publicly \nexplain what they think the rules are for secretly turning American \ncell phones into tracking devices. They have now said that the NSA is \nnot collecting that information today, but they also say the NSA may \nneed to do so in the future. And General Alexander, in particular, \nfailed in a public hearing to give straight answers about what plans \nthe NSA has made in the past.\n  Now, to be clear, I don't think the government should be \nelectronically tracking Americans' movements without a warrant. What is \nparticularly troubling to me is there is nothing in the PATRIOT Act in \naddition that limits this sweeping bulk collection authority to phone \nrecords. Government officials can use the PATRIOT Act to collect, \ncollate, and retain medical records, financial records, library \nrecords, gun purchase records--you name it. Collecting that information \nin bulk, in my view, would have a very substantial impact on the \nprivacy of ordinary Americans.\n  I want to be clear, I am not saying this is what is happening today, \nbut I want to make equally clear this is what the government could do \nin the future. So my question, as my colleague, who has been on his \nfeet for a long time, moves to begin to wrap up his comments this \nevening, I would like my colleague's thoughts on the impact of NSA \ncollection of bulk records on innocent Americans. I also would be \ninterested in his views with respect to why we have not been able to \nget the government to give straight answers about the tracking of the \nlocation and movements of Americans with cell phones that took place in \nthe past. I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts on those two \npoints.\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, I want to thank the Senator from Oregon for the great \nquestions and also for being supportive and really being the lead \nfigure from the Intelligence Committee trying to make this better.\n  I think so often our Intelligence Committees don't have enough people \nwho are really concerned with the Bill of Rights as well as national \ndefense, so we get a one-sided view of things. I think over the years \nyou have been able to continue this battle in a healthy way, \nunderstanding both sides of it, both with national security but also \nunderstanding that who we are as a people is important and that we not \ngive that up--that we not give up our most basic of freedoms in doing \nthis.\n  I think that power tends to be something people don't give up on \neasily. So when you have power that you give to people, you have to \nhave oversight. It is incredibly important that we do have oversight on \nwhat we are giving up, but it is also important that we see what has \ngone wrong. The FISA Court model hasn't worked to oversee and regulate \nthe NSA, because when finally a real court looked at this, when finally \nthe appellate court looked at this, what we find is that the appellate \ncourt was aghast that basically they were maintaining that this was \nrelevant to an investigation.\n  Apparently, the way the process worked was the NSA said it was \nrelevant, but there was no debate or dispute. It was just accepted at \nface value. I thought the privacy commission put it pretty well when \nthey said: Well, how can it be relevant to an investigation that hasn't \nyet occurred? We are collecting all the bulk data and we are going to \nquery it when we have an investigation. You can't argue that it is \nrelevant to an investigation when there is no such investigation \noccurring while they are collecting the data. The privacy commission \nsaid that basically we are turning words on its head if we are saying \nsomething like this is relevant.\n  So I think the American people are ready for it to end. The American \npeople think the bulk collection of our records with a generalized \nwarrant is a mistake and ought to end. I think we are working very \nhard, and at this point our hope is that between your actions and my \nactions, that hopefully leaders of your party and my party will agree \nto allow amendments to the PATRIOT Act.\n  The goal of being here today has been to say not only to the American \npeople but to say to the leadership on both sides and to all the \nMembers that we want an open amendment process, that the discussion of \nthe Fourth Amendment is an important discussion and that we shouldn't \nrun roughshod over this by saying there is a limit and a deadline and \nwe don't have time for debate and we are going to put it off yet again.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for helping to make it happen, but my \nhope is that we can get an answer from the leadership of both parties \nthat they are going to allow the amendments that your office and my \noffice have been working on for 6 or 7 months now.\n  Mr. WYDEN. My understanding of my colleague's request--and that was \nmy point of once again coming back to bulk collection of phone records, \npast practices with respect to tracking people on cell phones, and any \npolicies that may be examined for the future--I think my colleague is \nsaying it is time to ask some tough questions. Many of these amendments \nwe have been working on are basically designed to address these issues \nwhere we haven't been able to get answers in the past.\n  After 9/11, it was clear the people of our country were worried and \nthere was just a sense that if you were told it was about security, you \nwere supposed to say, OK. That is it. But that is not the kind of \noversight the Congress--particularly after we had a time stamp on the \nPATRIOT Act, we all thought it was going to end, and then it was time \nto start asking the tough questions. And not enough tough questions \nhave been asked. And my colleague in the amendments we are talking \nabout really seeks to get answers and use that information to change \npractices on a lot of these areas that have really gotten short shrift \nin the past. I appreciate my colleague talking about the FISA Court in \nconnection with this. This is, for listeners, the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act Court--certainly one of the most bizarre judicial \nbodies in our country's history, created to apply commonly understood \nlegal concepts, such as probable cause, to the government's request for \nwarrants to track terrorists and spies. But over the last decade, the \nFISA Court has been tasked with interpreting broad new surveillance \nlaws and has been setting sweeping precedents about the government's \nsurveillance storing, all of it being done in secret.\n  And I will say--and I would be interested in my colleague's thoughts \non this--that it is time that the court's significant legal \ninterpretations be made public--be made public so there are no more \nsecret laws; that the people of this country have the chance to engage \nin debate about laws that govern them. I also think there ought to be \nsomebody there who can say on these questions where there are major \nconstitutional implications, there ought to be somebody there who can \nsay: Look, there may be other considerations than the government's \npoint\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\nof view. But transparency here is critical so that Congress and the \ncourts can hold the intelligence community accountable. I want to \nmention, once again, we are talking about policies. We are not talking \nabout matters that are going to reveal secret operations or sources and \nmethods. We are talking about policy.\n  So I think it would be helpful, again, as we move to wrap up, if my \ncolleague from Kentucky could outline some of the reforms in the \nforeign intelligence court area that he thinks would be most helpful in \nterms of promoting transparency and accountability, that do not \ncompromise sources and methods--because I think my colleague has some \ngood ideas in this area--and what, in my colleague's view, would be \nmost important with respect to getting reforms in this secret court in \na way that would ensure more transparency for the public and still \nprotect our valiant intelligence officials who are in the field.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think that is a good question, and the Senator's office \nand my office have worked for a while to try to come up with FISA \nreforms. One of them is sort of in the USA FREEDOM Act but maybe could \nbe better, saying that there ought to be a special advocate so there is \nan adversarial proceeding.\n  One of the problems in the USA FREEDOM Act, as it is written, is that \nthe advocate is only appointed by the FISA Court and doesn't have to be \nappointed by the FISA Court. It may well be that a FISA Court that has \ngiven a rubberstamp to bulk collection may not be as inclined to give a \nspecial advocate.\n  I also think it is important, as the Senator mentioned many times, \nthat we should get outside of a secret court to a real court, where you \nreally have an advocate that is actually on your side, I think allowing \nfor an escape hatch for people to appeal.\n  For example, if you are being told by a FISA Court that bulk \ncollection of all the phone data in our country is legal, you should \nhave a route to an appellate court, an automatic route out of FISA to \nan appellate court. I think the appellate courts are fully capable of \nredacting, going into closed session if they have to, but then you have \na real trial, with a real advocate on both sides. I think that is \nimportant as well.\n  I do have one question or a question that you may be able to reframe \ninto a question; that is, can you give the public a general idea of \nwhat percentage of the overall problem of collecting Americans' data is \nin the form of bulk data and what percentage do you think is coming \nfrom Executive order and what do you think is coming from the 702 \nbackdoor collection of data.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I would say that all of the matters we have talked about \nthis afternoon, this evening, would be significant concerns with \nrespect to ensuring the liberties of the American people are protected \nwithout compromising our safety. Let's check them off: bulk phone \ncollection, millions and millions of phone records of law-abiding \nAmericans; the Executive order No. 12333 that we talked about today, \nanother very important area; and then section 702, the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act area, where a foreigner is the target and \nthe records of Americans are swept up. So I think we are addressing \nexactly one of the concerns that has come out in the last few days with \nrespect to what Americans are concerned about.\n  I know there has just been a brand-new major survey that has been \ndone. My colleagues may have touched on it sometime in the course of \nthe day. Americans particularly want to know what information about \nthem is being collected and who is doing the collecting. In each of \nthese three areas that I mentioned, there are substantial questions \nwith respect to the privacy rights of Americans.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Well, one of the comments that we went through tonight was \nan opinion by one of the attorneys in the Bush administration. They \nsaid, basically, that there were authorities that they were given that \nwere inherent authorities under article II that gave them the right to \ncollect data on Americans. But they also then concluded by saying that \nCongress had no business at all reviewing this data; that there was no \nauthority--that they were basically powers given to the President and \nthat Congress has no ability--I guess I would be interested, in the \nform of a question, if the Senator can answer whether he believes there \nare article II powers of surveillance of American citizens that \nCongress has no business questioning?\n  Mr. WYDEN. My colleague is--and I remember those days well--basically \nsumming up the argument of the Bush administration. I and others pushed \nback and pushed back very hard, because it would essentially, if taken \nto this kind of logical analysis, basically strip the legislative \nbranch of its ability to do vigorous oversight.\n  So my colleague has summed up what was the position of the Bush \nAdministration. But like so many other positions that were taken during \nthat period of time, once there was an opportunity to make sure people \nunderstood how sweeping it was--what my colleague has described is an \nextraordinary sweep of executive branch power basically relegating any \nrole for congressional oversight to that much--and not on the central \nquestion. So my colleague has summed up what the Bush administration \nsaid in those early days.\n  I had joined the Intelligence Committee shortly before 9/11. I was \nstruck, because this really was the first example I saw of just how \nsome in the executive branch would try to lay out a theory of executive \nbranch power that really just takes your breath away.\n  Mr. PAUL. I guess a followup to that would be this: Are those \narguments still being floated from this administration that there are \narticle II powers? There is a debate going on over this Executive Order \n12333. The question is whether people are still trying to maintain that \nCongress has no ability to oversee or review it?\n  But I have seen, at least in the lay press--I think they say in the \nlay press that there is some special investigation. Without going into \ndetail, is there some kind of investigation or evaluation of the \nExecutive order being done by us or one of the congressional bodies? \nThat was in the lay press.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, what I can tell you is that I think there have been \nsome changes, some improvements. But it continues to be a challenge. \nThe reality is you kind of look back from that period. In those early \ndays, for example, John Poindexter made a proposal for something called \nOperation Total Information Awareness. It would have been the most \nsweeping invasion of privacy, in my view, in the country's history. We \ndecided, much like when my colleagues talked about those early \ninterpretations in the Bush administration, that this was an \nunacceptable expansion of executive branch power.\n  But it was not until a young intern who was in our office late one \nnight found some of the true excesses of this project--in fact, this \nyoung intern found that the program would actually encourage, as part \nof an experiment, debate about assassinating foreign leaders. People \njust found that so out of the mainstream that when we brought it to \nlight, Operation Total Information Awareness was gone within about 48 \nhours.\n  So we have seen--my colleague highlighted the Bush administration \nproposal to basically have unchecked executive branch power in \nOperation Total Information Awareness. My colleague asked about 12333, \nwhich we have been reviewing.\n  So, yes, it is going to remain an ongoing concern, an ongoing \nchallenge, because I think there is a sense that the executive branch \nis the only one that can really deal with this kind of information in a \ntimely kind of fashion. Well, what we have seen, with respect to bulk \nphone record collection, is that this has been a program that has not \nbeen about timely access to relevant information.\n  Experts with national security clearances--we talked about those \nindividuals this afternoon--said this program does not make us safer, \nand we could get rid of it and obtain the information by conventional \nsources. So I think we have begun to reign in this unchecked executive \nbranch power. I think a big part of it has been the very valuable work \nmy colleague has done in terms of trying to highlight these kinds of \npractices and why I have appreciated the chance to work closely with my \ncolleague since I came to the Senate.\n  Mr. PAUL. I think one of the most exciting things probably is the \ncourt case--the Second Circuit Court of Appeals--and their ruling. My \nhope,\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\nthough, had been that it would go to the Supreme Court. My \nunderstanding is it has been remanded to a lower court. I think one of \nthe things that we really need is that we need a ruling that updates \nMaryland v. Smith. We need a ruling that talks about the fact that most \npeople's records are being held in a virtual fashion. I think there \nneeds to be a ruling that comes from the Court that acknowledges that \nyou still retain a privacy interest in your records, even when they are \nbeing held outside of your house.\n  The idea of old fashioned papers in your house--the concept is good, \nthat we should protect that privacy. But I think also the concept \ntechnologically is that you know you will not have papers in your \nhouse, but you will have private matters that will be held virtually \noutside the house--and whether or not the Fourth Amendment protects \nthose. You often have advocates from the government who say that the \nfourth amendment does not apply to any records once they are outside \nyour house or in other hands. I really think that you do not give up \nyour privacy interest when you let someone else hold your records, that \nyou still maintain an interest in privacy even though someone else \nholds these records.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think my colleague has made an important point with \nrespect to the Smith case. The Smith case was not made for the digital \nage. That is a big part of what we have sought to do throughout this \ndebate, is to try to make sure that people really understand the \nimplications in the digital age of what these policies, you know, mean \nfor their privacy.\n  I see my colleagues are on the floor and I want to give them some \ntime. But since you mentioned this question of the court cases, I think \nthere was really striking language recently by Judge Leon of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia, talking about what the \nscooping up of all of these records really means. Judge Leon said, ``a \nfew scattered tiles of information'' when collected in mass, can \n``reveal an entire mosaic'' about a person including their religion, \ntheir sexual orientation, medical issues, and political affiliations.\n  So you combine what the judge has described, I think correctly, as \nbulk collection, outdated court cases such as the Smith case, which \nreally was not updated in terms of what we would be facing in the \ndigital age, and I think this really combines to create policies that \nhave a chilling effect on liberty and liberty for innocent law-abiding \nAmericans.\n  So I want to say it again to my colleague who is now approaching 10 \nhours on his feet. I very much appreciate his focusing on these issues. \nWe have a lot of work to do because we know that there has been a \npattern in the past where when we really get down to the final days--\nthe last couple of days--there is always a lot of pressure to go along \nwith some kind of short-term extension. That has been the pattern year \nafter year, every time there has been an expiration of the act.\n  I think what has been shown today is that kind of business as usual \nis just not going to be acceptable any longer. You have made that \npoint. I want it understood that we are going to be pursuing the effort \nto make sure that this time we are not just going to re-up a bad law, \nre-up a flawed policy and say that it is OK to continue a program.\n  This was reauthorized, in effect, by the President a few months ago. \nThis is going to be the last extension. This has got to be the last \nextension. I am committed to working closely with the Senator and our \ncolleagues to make sure that that is the case and to take the steps \nnecessary to ensure this is finally the last extension of a badly \nflawed law. I thank my colleague for his good work.\n  Mr. PAUL. Thank you. I think the American public is ready to end bulk \ncollection. I think there is a bipartisan, across-the-aisle approach \nthat people want to end bulk collection. The time is now. We cannot \nkeep extending this.\n  I think probably the biggest deal is that the PATRIOT Act does not \neven justify this. This is a program that needs to end because even \nthose who read the PATRIOT Act, even those who love the PATRIOT ACT, \nacknowledge that the PATRIOT Act does not even give permission for \nthis. This is something we are doing that there is no permission for. \nIt has to end. I think the American people will be very disappointed in \nus as a body if it does not end.\n  This is the time to do it. I agree with the Senator. We are going to \ndo everything we can to stop it. I see the Senator from Utah. Does the \nSenator from Utah have a question?\n  Mr. LEE. I do. At the outset of my question, I would like to point \nout that while I disagree with you, Senator Paul, with regard to the \nspecific question of whether we should allow section 215 of the PATRIOT \nAct to expire in its entirety, I don't believe we need to do that. I \nwould prefer that we pass the USA FREEDOM Act as passed by the House of \nRepresentatives by an overwhelming margin of 338 to 88 last week.\n  While we disagree on that issue, I absolutely stand with you, Senator \nPaul, and I believe with the American people, on the need for an open, \ntransparent process and debate regarding this issue. I also stand with \nthe Senator with regard to the belief that bulk metadata collection is \nwrong. It is not something that we can support. It is not something \nthat the American people feel comfortable with and that it is \nincompatible with the spirt if not the letter of the Fourth Amendment \nto the Constitution of the United States that we have all sworn an oath \nto uphold and protect and defend.\n  Let's remember the text of the Fourth Amendment. The text of this \namendment, penned in 1789, ratified in 1791, says: ``The right of the \npeople to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and \nno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or \naffirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and \nthe persons or things to be seized.\n  These are not idle words. They are not surplusage. They are not there \njust for ornamental purposes. They are there to put important \nlimitations on the power of government, to make sure that when \ngovernment goes after things--things that are important to our personal \nlives, things that are part of our houses, things that are part of our \npapers, our personal effects--those things cannot just be grabbed \nrandomly by government.\n  Government has to have a reason for going after them, and government \nhas to be constrained in some meaningful way in the way it goes after \nthem.\n  When the government relies on a warrant, the warrant needs to \ndescribe the things or the places to be searched with particularity. \nThe people subject to them need to be identified with some \nparticularity.\n  And, you know, these words were meant to be flexible. They were meant \nto be molded from time to time in different circumstances. They are not \nabsolute in their terminology, and that is one of the reasons they have \nendured for well over two centuries and why they have been able to \nadapt to changes in technology. But there is not any reasonable \nconstruction of this language that I think can countenance what the NSA \nis doing and what we are talking about here, which is the bulk \ncollection of telephone metadata.\n  Now, what is happening is that the NSA is getting these orders, these \norders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and these \norders basically tell the telephone service providers: Give us all your \ndata. Give us all your records, all of them. We don't really care \nwhether they are relevant to an ongoing investigation of a particular \nperson or of a particular terrorism ring or a particular foreign \nintelligence group of activities. We want all of them. Send all of them \nto us. We are going to put them all in a database and we are going to \nsearch them when we feel like it.\n  Now, I don't dispute the claim made by the NSA that there are a \nlimited number of people who have access to this database, nor do I \ndispute, at least for purposes of this discussion I am not going to \ndispute--and I have no basis for refuting--the assertion that the \npeople who work at the NSA are well intentioned, that they have our \nnational security interests at heart, that they are there to protect \nus.\n  But even if we don't dispute any of those things, even if we accept \nall of those things as a given, we have to acknowledge the very real \nrisk that the same people who work there now might not be--in fact, we \nare certain they\n\n[[Page S3169]]\n\nwill not be--the same people who work there 1 year from now or 2 years \nfrom now or 5 years or 10 years or 15 years from now.\n  And we know something about human nature, which is that humans, when \ngiven power, will sometimes abuse that power. Sometimes they will abuse \nthat power to the detriment of others. Sometimes they will do it for \npersonal financial gain. Sometimes they will do it for political gain. \nSometimes they will do it in order to further certain agendas.\n  That is exactly why it is so important to put boundaries around the \nauthority of government. That, of course, is what the Constitution is. \nThis is our set of boundaries. This is our fence around government \nauthority. It is there for a reason. It is there to make sure the \nAmerican people are protected against government.\n  So, first, the Founding Fathers put in place this structure that \nexplained how government would work. It established the government, and \nthen it carefully positioned this series of fences around the \ngovernment to make sure power wasn't abused against the people.\n  It is interesting, when the PATRIOT Act was enacted and when it was \nsubsequently reauthorized several years later, Congress put in place a \nrelevance requirement. Congress put in place--in section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act--a requirement that the business records that were obtained \nby the NSA, pursuant to section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, had to be \nrelevant to an investigation, relevant to some things they were doing.\n  Here again, as with the language of the Fourth Amendment of the \nConstitution, there is some play in the joints of the term \n``relevance.'' Some things might be relevant in one situation and not \nanother. Whether it is relevant is going to depend on a lot of facts \nand circumstances pertinent to the investigation in question, but it \nstretches the term ``relevant'' or the concept of relevance beyond its \nbreaking point, beyond any reasonable definition.\n  If you deem something to be relevant, so long as it might in some \nfuture investigation--one that has not yet arisen--become relevant, \nsuch that you had to gather every record of every phone call made in \nAmerica, such that NSA wants to go after every record of every phone \ncall made by every American going back 5 years, storing that series of \nrecords in a single database that can be queried for up to 5 years in \nadvance.\n  Let's just go through this exercise for a minute. Think to yourself, \nhow many phone calls have I made in the last 5 years? How many distinct \nphone numbers have I called in the last 5 years?\n  Well, if somebody has called 1,000 phone numbers--or, let's say, made \nphone calls to 500 phone numbers and received phone calls from another \ngroup of 500 phone numbers, for a total of 1,000 phone numbers over the \nlast 5 years, then that is 1,000 numbers. Then the NSA goes out one hop \nbeyond that and connects each person, each phone number with whom the \noriginal person had contact. Let's assume that each of those phone \nnumbers had, in turn, contact with 1,000 phone numbers. You get to 1 \nmillion phone numbers pretty quickly.\n  But each time the NSA collects these data points, each data point \ntaken in isolation might not say much about that person. But as our \nfriend and our colleague from Oregon noted a few minutes ago, it is by \nusing that combination of data points, by aggregating all of those data \npoints together, someone can tell an awful lot about a person.\n  In fact, there are researchers who, having used similar metadata and \nsimilar sets of metadata in their own databases, have concluded that \nthey can tell what religion a person belongs to, what political party \nsomeone belongs to, their degree of religiosity, and their degree of \npolitical activity.\n  They can tell what someone's hobbies are. They can tell whether they \nhave children, whether they are married. They can tell how healthy they \nare, what physical ailments they might suffer from. In many instances, \nthey can tell what medications they are on. And all of these things are \nmade more efficient by virtue of the automation in this system.\n  So while it is true people point out that under section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act, under this particular program, the NSA is not listening to \ntelephone conversations. They are not listening to them.\n  Interestingly enough, this is very often a straw man argument that is \nthrown out by those who want to make sure that section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act is reauthorized without any reforms. They claim that those \nwho are opposed to this type of action are out there falsely claiming \nthat the NSA is listening to phone calls over this program.\n  Well, that accusation of falsehood is, itself, false. That accusation \nof falsehood is, itself, a straw man effort. It is a red herring. It is \na lie. It is a lie intended to malign and mischaracterize those of us \nwho have genuine, legitimate concerns with this very program, because \nthe fact is we don't make that argument. The argument we are making is \nthat the NSA doesn't even need to do that. The NSA can tell all kinds \nof things about people just by looking at that data.\n  Because it is automated and because it is within a system that \noperates with a series of computers, they can tell very quickly it is a \nlot less human resource-intensive than it would be if they were having \nto listen to countless hours of phone conversations. It is a lot more \nefficient.\n  Again, I want to be clear. I have no proof that the NSA is currently \nabusing this particular program. I am not aware of any evidence that \nsuch abuse is occurring. And I am willing to assume, for purposes of \nthis discussion, that is not occurring, that the men and women who work \nat the NSA have nothing but the best interests of the American people \nand American national security at heart.\n  But how long will this remain the case? And how safe, how fair is it \nof us to assume that will always be the case? We can scarcely afford--\nfor the sake of our children, our grandchildren, and those who will \ncome after them--we cannot afford to simply assume this will always be \nthe case.\n  We have to remember what happened a few decades ago when Senator \nFrank Church and his committee looked into wiretap abuses that had \nhappened within the government. We have to remember the Church report \nthat was released at the end of that investigation.\n  That report concluded that every Presidential administration from FDR \nthrough Richard Nixon had utilized law enforcement and intelligence-\ngathering agencies within the Federal Government to go engage in \npolitical espionage. So that technology, which was then only a few \ndecades old, had been abused. It had been abused for a long time. The \nabuse of this technology had gone, of course, unreported for many \ndecades, but it had nonetheless been occurring.\n  Again, I don't know, I can't prove it. I have no evidence that such \nabuse is going on right now. But I think all of us, in order to be \nhonest with ourselves, would have to acknowledge that there is at least \nsome risk that if it is not occurring now, at some point it will occur \nin the future. This temptation is simply too strong for most mortals to \nresist, particularly in an area such as this where there is, with good \nreason, very little ability for the outside world to observe what is \ngoing on inside that particular government agency.\n  Now, that is exactly why I happen to support what was passed by the \nHouse of Representatives last week. What was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives last week in the form of the USA FREEDOM Act was \nsomething that would require the NSA to, instead of going out to all \nthe telephone companies and saying, send us all of your records, we \nwant your calling records, just give us your records, we don't care \nwhether it is relevant to a particular phone call, particular to a \nspecific number that was itself involved in terrorist activity or \nforeign surveillance activity, we don't care about that, just send it \nto us--far from doing that, what the USA FREEDOM Act would require is \nfor the government to show that they needed records related to a \ntelephone number that was itself involved in some kind of activity. \nThey wouldn't have the ability to go to all the phone companies and \njust say send us everything.\n  They would instead have the power to get a court order, to get those\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nrecords of those phone calls that might well be connected to terrorism \nbased on their contact with a phone number that was related to such \nactivities or their contact with somebody else, with some other phone \nnumber that was, in turn, having some kind of communication with \nsomeone involved in those activities.\n  Not all of us agree on this and, Senator Paul, you and I don't agree \non this particular bill, but we do agree on the underlying issue. And \nwe also agree that the Senate works best, that the Senate serves the \nAmerican people well when it lives up to its self-described reputation \nas being the world's greatest deliberative legislative body. We would \nall be better off if we were able to put this bill on the floor right \nnow--if this bill were able to come to the floor and it were subjected \nto open, honest debate and discussion so the American people could see \nwe were debating this and so that you, Senator Paul, and some of our \nother colleagues who have ideas as to how we could make this \nlegislation better would have the opportunity to introduce, in the form \nof an amendment, improvements to this legislation.\n  I heard you outline quite articulately just a few hours ago some very \nthoughtful reforms, some very well-thought-through improvements, \namendments that you would make to this legislation. I think we would \nall be better off if we took that kind of approach.\n  Now, we have seen in the last few months what can happen. When we \ncame back in January, we saw that the desks in the Senate Chamber had \nbeen rearranged. Many of us were pleased. We didn't shed a tear at the \nrealignment of the desks, and we have noticed that this realignment of \nthe desks reflected a change in the political attitude among Americans. \nBut, more importantly for us, it was the precursor to some very \npositive developments in the Senate.\n  We saw that within just a few weeks after this shift in power had \noccurred, we had cast more votes on the floor of the Senate than we had \nin the entire previous year. Within a few months, we had cast more \nvotes on the floor of the Senate than we had cast in the 2 years \nprevious to that. This was a good sign.\n  This is a good sign. It is not just because we are here and we cast \nvotes; it is because those votes represent something--they represent \nthe fact that we are actually debating and discussing and we are \nallowing each Senator to have his or her views heard. We are putting \nourselves on record as to what we believe represents good policy and \nwhat does not.\n  I think we would be in a much better position to address the national \nsecurity needs of our great country if we had such an opportunity with \nrespect to this legislation. That is one of the reasons I came to the \nfloor yesterday, along with one of our colleagues, the senior Senator \nfrom Vermont, and asked unanimous consent to bring this bill--the \nHouse-passed USA FREEDOM Act, H.R. 2048--to the floor and to have open \ndebate and discussion and an open amendment process, with the \nunderstanding we would turn back to the trade promotion authority bill \nas soon as we had properly disposed of this legislation, as soon as we \nhad finished debating and discussing it, voting on amendments and \nvoting on the legislation.\n  I am a big believer in free trade. I like free trade. I think free \ntrade is good. I would like to see us get to both of these pieces of \nlegislation. But importantly, H.R. 2048 is a piece of legislation that \nhas kind of a fuse attached to it. Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act is \nset to expire at the end of this month, and many of us believe we ought \nto at least have a debate and discussion before that happens, a debate \nand discussion about what, if anything, would take its place, about \nwhether we need something to put in its place and if so, what that \nmight look like. So that is why we made this request. This request we \nregarded as a very reasonable one was, unfortunately, one that drew an \nobjection, so we were not able to bring it to the floor.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based in New York, \nrecently addressed this issue of whether section 215 of the PATRIOT Act \ncan appropriately be read to authorize the NSA to engage in this bulk \nmetadata collection program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit answered that question in the negative and concluded there is \nno statutory authority for the NSA to collect this type of metadata. It \ndoesn't have the authority. It cannot collect bulk metadata on this \nbasis.\n  As the Second Circuit concluded, the business records sought under \nthat provision have to be relevant. There has to be some relevance to \nsomething they are investigating. And of course their only relevance \nhere, under this program, is that they exist; it is that they represent \nphone calls made by someone in the United States, that they were made \nunder a telephone network in the United States. That can't be the \nanswer. That cannot reflect a proper understanding of this concept of \nrelevance that is in section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. It can't, and it \ndoesn't.\n  This court ruling is one of the many reasons why we need to be having \nthis debate and why we shouldn't be willing to simply reauthorize \nsection 215 of the PATRIOT Act with the understanding that the NSA will \ncontinue operating this program as is if we reauthorize it.\n  It is one of the reasons why I have been so insistent on having this \ndiscussion and so unwilling to support even a shorter term \nreauthorization of the PATRIOT Act--because they are interpreting \nsection 215 in the PATRIOT Act beyond its logical breaking point.\n  We have to remember that the Constitution is worth protecting. It is \nworth protecting even when we can't point to anything bad that is \nhappening right now, even when we can't point to any specific abuse \nthat is occurring.\n  Bulk data collection is itself a type of abuse. There is a type of \nconstitutional injury even though we can't point to anything secondary \nfrom that. We can't point to any horrible secondary effect from it; it \nis in and of itself wrong.\n  The wrongness of this program can be illustrated when we take to its \nlogical conclusion the very arguments presented by the NSA for this \ntype of activity. Let me explain. The metadata that is collected by the \nNSA right now relates exclusively to telephone calls. The records they \ncollect involve records of who you call, when you called them, who \ncalls you, when they called you, and how long the phone call at issue \nlasted. That is it.\n  But if the NSA is correct in its interpretation of section 215, which \nit is not, but if it were correct, there is absolutely no reason why \nthe NSA could not also collect a number of other types of metadata--\nmetadata records, for example, involving the use of your credit card, \ninvolving hotel reservations, involving airplane reservations, metadata \nregarding emails you have either sent or received, who you sent them to \nand who you received them from, your Internet traffic, where you have \npurchased online, who has purchased something from you online, and all \nkinds of things. From that metadata, they could clearly paint a much \nmore vivid picture of you, a profile built as a mosaic from a billion \ndata points. They can tell everything about you from that type of \nmetadata.\n  Sure, the NSA is not collecting that type of metadata right now. They \nare not doing it right now. But if we reauthorize this without \nlimitation, if we reauthorize section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and we \ndon't include any kind of restriction on it, there is absolutely no \nreason why the NSA couldn't conclude tomorrow or next week or a year \nfrom now or later that it wants to collect this kind of data as well.\n  I would suspect nearly all Americans would be shocked and horrified \nto think the NSA could and would and might at some point in the future \ncollect that kind of information on where you shop online, your credit \ncard bills, your hotel reservations, things like that, things that \ncould easily be connected back to an individual and easily give rise to \nabuse either for partisan political purposes or for some other \nnefarious purpose.\n  I also want to point out that those who are in favor of this program \nand those who vigorously defend its constitutionality routinely rely on \na decision rendered by the Supreme Court in the late 1970s in a case \ncalled Smith v. Maryland. They point out that in Smith v. Maryland the \nSupreme Court upheld the constitutionality of some police activity that \ninvolved the collection of calling data. The Supreme\n\n[[Page S3171]]\n\nCourt concluded in that case that there was not a sufficiently \nsignificant expectation of privacy in records of calls that somebody \nhad made and received such that the collection of that data would \nrequire a search warrant.\n  I am not altogether certain that Smith v. Maryland was decided \ncorrectly, but let's assume for a minute it was decided correctly and \njust address the fact that it is a decision that remains on the \nbooks. It is precedent that is followed throughout the courts of the \nUnited States. That is fine. Let's just accept the fact that it is on \nthe books. But it is very, very different--not just quantitatively \ndifferent but also qualitatively different--when you are dealing not \nwith one target of one single criminal investigation and not just with \nmaybe a few weeks of calling records but when you are dealing with 5 \nyears of calling records not on one person, of one target in one \ncriminal investigation by one group of law enforcement officers, but \n300 million people stretched out over 5 years.\n\n  That calling data becomes more significant, moreover, when Americans \nbecome more attached to their telephones, when their telephone isn't \nsomething that is just plugged into the wall but something that is \ncarried with them every moment of every day. This, by the way, adds to \nthe potential list of metadata that could be collected because of \ncourse many people now have telephones that track their location. I \ndon't see any reason why, based on the interpretation of section 215 of \nthe PATRIOT Act and the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the \nNSA has put forward, they couldn't start collecting the location data \nas well, which would further undermine privacy issues.\n  So Smith v. Maryland, whether you like it or not, is precedent. It is \nprecedent that is followed by the courts in America, but it is not the \nend of the story. It certainly doesn't get you over the hump when it \ncomes to this type of collection. Saying that what was covered by Smith \nv. Maryland is the same thing as what the NSA is trying to do here is a \nlittle bit like comparing a pony ride to a ride to the Moon and back. \nThey both involve some form of transportation, but they are worlds \napart, drastically different, and so much so that they can't really \neven be compared.\n  Our technology has changed dramatically over the years--so much so \nthat if we don't stop and think about it, we might not even recognize \nit.\n  A few years ago when my son James was about 10 years old, he came up \nwith a really good idea that he announced to us. He said: You know, I \nhave been thinking about it, and I am going to invent something.\n  We said: What is that?\n  He said: Well, I am going to invent a telephone that is attached to \nthe wall. It will be attached to the wall so it can't be removed. It \nwill have a wire that runs into the wall, and that is how the telephone \nwill work.\n  We looked at him and wondered what gave him this idea and what gave \nhim the idea that that was somehow unique.\n  We said: Well, first of all, what makes you think that hasn't already \nbeen invented? And secondly, why would you want to do that?\n  He said: Well, I think it is a great idea because it is the only way \nyou wouldn't lose your phone.\n  Only then did we realize what he was saying. Only then did we realize \nthat what he was telling us was that during his lifetime, he had never \nseen in our home a phone that was attached to the wall. He had seen \ncell phones and he had seen cordless landline phones, and he had seen \ntelephones get lost from time to time.\n  So our technology does change, and as our technology changes, we have \nto take that into account. Well, our technology has changed now to the \npoint where our government can learn all kinds of personal facts about \nus through metadata, through the type of metadata involved here, and it \nis only getting more and more this way every single day as we transact \nmore and more of our day-to-day business over our telephones and as our \ntelephones become more sophisticated, more portable, and more capable \nof processing more and more data.\n  The text of the Fourth Amendment I quoted just a few minutes ago is \nstill very relevant today. The fact that the Fourth Amendment refers \nspecifically to the right of the people to be secure in their persons, \ntheir houses, and their papers and effects is still relevant today and \nshould remind us of the fact that our persons, our houses, and our \npapers and effects more and more really become a part of this--they \nreally become a part of our telephones.\n  Our papers are not always physical papers. More and more, they are \nnot. Increasingly, we are even asked to sign documents that previously \nwould have been physically signed on a hard copy, a stack of papers--\nincreasingly you can do business transactions without ever handling a \nphysical paper. Increasingly, you can do those things electronically. \nPeople often prefer to do it that way. It saves time. It saves money. \nBut as more and more of our lives are played out on these portable \ndigital devices, it becomes more and more important for us to be \nremember there are Fourth Amendment ramifications when the government \nwants to get involved in what we do on those same devices.\n  That is why it is not really fair any more to simply rely reflexively \non Smith v. Maryland to say this is all constitutional, nor is it fair \nto say that your phone company already has this record, so there is no \nreason why the government shouldn't have it. I actually don't even see \nthat comparison.\n  Some people think this is somehow persuasive. I don't find it \npersuasive at all. There is a world of difference between allowing a \nprivate business with which you have voluntarily chosen to interact to \nhave your business records, particularly when it is a private business \nthat you want to have that information so that private business can \nkeep track of how much you owe them or how much they owe you--there is \na world of difference between a private business entity having those \nrecords and the government having those records.\n  The worst thing that a private business can do is perhaps send you \ntoo many emails that you don't want asking you for more business or \nmaybe it can give some of your personal data to somebody else who will \nin turn make phone calls you don't want to receive or send you emails \nyou don't want to receive.\n  That private business has no ability to put you in prison. That \nprivate business has no ability to levy taxes on you. That private \nbusiness has no ability to make your life a living hell in the same way \nthat your government has the ability to do those things--not just the \nability but, lately, with increasing frequency, with strong and \nseemingly irresistible inclination.\n  This is not a victimless offense against the spirit and, arguably, \nthe letter of the Constitution. These kinds of things have real-world \nramifications. They ought to be troubling to all of us, and we ought to \nwant to do something about them.\n  So for these reasons, Senator Paul, I would ask you, don't you think \nit would be much better to put this bill on the floor now and allow for \nan open amendment process, one in which you and each of our other \ncolleagues could have an opportunity to provide input, to try to \nimprove the legislation, and to try to do something meaningful with \nthis legislation, rather than just simply ignore it, pretend it didn't \nexist, sweep it under the rug or wait until we are up against a cliff--\nthis critical cliff between when the Senate, much to my chagrin and the \nchagrin of many of our colleagues, is set to adjourn and leading up to \nthe moments when this program is set to expire? Wouldn't we be better \noff to take this up and debate this under the light of day, under the \nview of the American people?\n  Mr. PAUL. I think the Senator from Utah asked a great question, and I \nthink he framed the debate over the Fourth Amendment very well.\n  I think if we asked to put the bill on the floor at this hour, we may \nnot be able to find anybody awake to ask permission to have the bill \nthis evening. We haven't been able to locate anyone to get the bill \nthis evening, so I am afraid we will have to say no.\n  But we have been asking for a full and open debate. Your solution, as \nwell as mine, as well as Wyden's, as well as other's, is to have a full \ndebate on the floor for this.\n  There were a couple of things you said that I thought were \nparticularly worth commenting on.\n\n[[Page S3172]]\n\n  People say that because there is no evidence that the program is \nbeing abused, there is no evidence that we are searching the records of \ncertain people of certain race or religion or abusing people for some \nreason, that is proof somehow that no abuse is occurring.\n  But I agree with you that the collection alone is an abuse in and of \nitself. To me, the basic point and the biggest part of the point is \nthat what we are dealing with is something that is a generalized \nwarrant.\n  There is nothing specific about collecting all of the records from \nall Americans all of the time. There is nothing specific about the name \n``Verizon.'' I tell people that I don't know anybody named Mr. Verizon. \nSo that can't be a specific individualized warrant. That is a general \nwarrant. That is what we fought the Revolution over--to individualize \nwarrants, to individualize what we were requesting, and, above all, \nprobable cause.\n  We accepted a lower standard to go after foreigners, to go after \nterrorists. And part of me says that maybe we could do that just for \nterrorists. But now we are using it for domestic crime.\n  One of the biggest things I would like to change is that nothing \nwithin the PATRIOT Act or any of this could be used to convict somebody \nin a domestic court.\n  Section 213--sneak-and-peak--99.5 percent of the time is used for \ndomestic drug crime now. We have the NSA sharing data that is supposed \nto be collected on foreigners with the domestic DEA and then making up \nanother scenario where they might have heard about this. But they \ndidn't really hear about this from the NSA.\n  I think the public at large thinks we have gone way too far--way too \nfar with the bulk collection records. It is not only what we have done, \nbut it is just that there is absolutely--even in the PATRIOT Act, which \nI object to--no justification for collecting the records. The idea that \nrecords could be relevant to an investigation that has not yet occurred \nputs logic on its head, puts it topsy-turvy to where words don't mean \nanything.\n  I am very concerned that there is a lot of surveillance that we don't \nknow about, not only through the PATRIOT Act justification but through \nExecutive order justification. It concerns me that there are still \npeople who are arguing that article II gives unlimited authority to the \nPresident, that there is no congressional check and balance to the \nPresident with regard to surveillance. There are people making that \nargument--that there is no limitation to Presidential power.\n  I think one of the best things our Founding Fathers gave us was this \ncheck and balance so we had coequal branches. I think it is a great \nthing with the Fourth Amendment that a warrant had to be signed by \nsomebody who wasn't a policeman, who wasn't a soldier.\n  This is one of the additional things I would like to do because we \ndon't get to talk about this very much. We have the ability, and we are \ntalking about the bulk collection of records, but we should also talk \nabout whether we should have hundreds of thousands of warrants written \nby policemen, by FBI agents. I think warrants should have a check and \nbalance where you have a judge.\n  There is something that is so civilizing and something that levels \nthe playing field and keeps abuse from happening when a policeman \ntonight in DC, in front of a house, who wants to go in, is calling \nsomeone who is not in hot pursuit and who hasn't just had a physical \naltercation with the people they are chasing--someone who is \ndispassionate and unconnected to the heat of the crime--who is going to \ngive permission for this policeman to go into a house.\n\n  We say that a man's house is his castle, and he can defend it. That \nwas the whole idea--that things within the castle were the man's or \nwoman's, we would say now. But it is not only that your records are in \nthe castle anymore. They are in the cloud. And records are virtual. We \nhave whole households that have no paper records.\n  The amazing thing about records is they are now saying that with \nmetadata records, they can discover more than we could have discovered \nin a lifetime of looking at your personal letters in your house, \nbecause so much information is there, so much can be connected between \nthe dots between all of these things.\n  I am still not convinced that we aren't collecting data on credit \ncards, on emails. I think some of this is done through the Executive \norder that most of us are not privy to. The only people that know \nanything about Executive Order 12333 and what they are doing on it are \npeople on the Intelligence Committee. I am not convinced we aren't \ncollecting email data.\n  They currently say that your email--this is the bill you promoted--\nafter 6 months, your email has no protection. Before 6 months, I think \nthe only protection is to the content, not to the header, not to the \naddressee.\n  We currently have the opinion. We desperately need the Supreme Court \nto rule on this. We have the Smith v. Maryland decision, which was in \nthe premodern age, as far as data goes and as far as your papers being \nheld. We desperately need a decision.\n  My hope was that the appellate court decision would go to the Supreme \nCourt. But my understanding--being just a doctor--is it went the other \nway. It has been remanded lower and may never make it to the Supreme \nCourt. I don't know that. But I think we do need something at the \nSupreme Court level.\n  There have been many who are now arguing that the appellate court--\nthis again from a physician, not a lawyer--is really binding and that \nthere could eventually be some legal injunction against what the \ngovernment is doing.\n  But for goodness sake, it perplexes me that the President says: Oh, \nyes, we need a balanced approach, and I am listening to my privacy \ncommission. I am listening to the review board. Yet I created this out \nof whole cloth as an Executive order, and I am unwilling to stop it \neven though the appellate court has told me it is illegal.\n  He is unwilling to stop it. I think that sort of defines \ndisingenuous--that he is going to stop it as soon as Congress stops it.\n  It is so hard to get anything done here. We have had vast \nmajorities--not only for the USA Freedom Act but for Thomas Massey's \nact. We had a vast majority over there to defund it--for Justin Amash, \nfor defunding things that we were doing--big majorities. It is another \nevidence that the Senate is further distanced from the people, that the \nHouse is closer. They are hearing the message stronger.\n  I think the message is a strong one, and the message is that nobody--\nI mean, really, the vast majority of Americans are very unhappy with \nhaving all of their records collected. That really to me gets back to \nthe whole idea of whether we should accept or validate general \nwarrants. It is still part of my concern, a little bit, with the \nreform. I want the reform--it could go a long way if we no longer have \nthe ability to put the word ``corporate'' in there and if it were \nspecifically individuals. And I think we have a chance to go maybe even \na little further than we have gone in the reform that is being offered \nto say that we shouldn't be able to request all of the records from a \ncorporation, because there is some retained privacy and there is some \nretained property interest even in your records. And I think there \nalways has been.\n  They talk about an expectation of privacy. I would think that if you \nhave a contract, when you sign the agreement, you are agreeing to a \nprivacy contract with an Internet provider or a search provider or a \ntelephone company. I think that is indicating, as they talk about in \nthe cases, an expectation of privacy. Well, I have signed an agreement \nwith the company, and they promised me and I promised them. I would \nthink that for certain is an expectation of privacy in the eyes of the \ncourt.\n  (Mr. RUBIO assumed the Chair.)\n  So I don't understand how they can argue we have completely given up \nour records, and that we have no ability at all to retain an interest \nin our records.\n  I am very much convinced this is an important debate--that the Bill \nof Rights is something that we shouldn't look at lightly; that we \nshould, as we move forward, make sure we do protect the things that are \nimportant. We shouldn't hurry up and have deadlines, and then say we \nare not going to have time to debate it.\n\n[[Page S3173]]\n\n  I see the Senator from Texas, who is also a defender of the Fourth \nAmendment, is here, and I would be happy to take a question without \nlosing the floor.\n  Mr. CRUZ. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I would note that he and \nI agree on a great many issues, although we don't agree entirely on \nthis issue. But I want to take the opportunity to thank the Senator \nfrom Kentucky for his passionate defense of liberties. His is a voice \nthis body needs to listen to.\n  I would note that the Senator from Kentucky's father spent decades in \nthe House of Representatives as a passionate advocate for liberty. Both \nhis father's voice and the Senator from Kentucky's voice have altered \nthe debate in this Chamber and have helped refocus the Congress and the \nAmerican people on the critical importance of defending our liberty.\n  I think protecting the Bill of Rights is a fundamental responsibility \nof the Federal Government. And it is heartbreaking that over the last 6 \nyears we have seen a Federal Government that not only fails to protect \nthe Bill of Rights but that routinely violates the constitutional \nliberties of American citizens and routinely violates the Bill of \nRights.\n  I listened to the learned remarks and questions from the Senator from \nUtah, where he noted that under the justifications for the current bulk \ncollection of metadata, it is the position of the Federal Government \nthat they have the full constitutional authority not only to collect \nmetadata but to collect the positional location of every American. If \nany of us carry our cell phone, wherever we go, it is the position of \nthe Obama administration that the Federal Government has the full \nconstitutional authority to track the location of every American \ncitizen no matter where we are. That is a breathtaking assertion of \npower.\n  I would note that we do not merely need to speculate that that is the \nObama administration's position. Indeed, in a recent case before the \nU.S. Supreme Court, the Obama administration argues that law \nenforcement could place a GPS locator on the automobile of any and \nevery law-abiding citizen in this country and track the location of \nyour automobile and my automobile with no probable cause, no \narticulable suspicion, no nothing.\n  The Obama administration argued that the Fourth Amendment and the \nBill of Rights say nothing about the Federal Government placing a GPS \nlocator on the automobile of private law-abiding citizens.\n  Thankfully, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected that position. It did not \nreject that position 5 to 4 or 6 to 3 or 7 to 2; the U.S. Supreme Court \nrejected that radical antiprivacy position of the Obama administration \nunanimously, 9 to 0.\n  I am entirely in agreement with my friend the Senator from Utah that \nthe right resolution of the issue before this body is for the U.S. \nSenate to pass the USA FREEDOM Act. I am an original sponsor of that \nbipartisan legislation.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act does two things: No. 1, it ends the Federal \nGovernment's bulk collection of phone metadata for law-abiding \ncitizens. I am entirely in agreement with my friend, the Senator from \nKentucky, that the Federal Government should not be collecting the data \nof millions of law-abiding citizens with no evidentiary basis to do so. \nIt is long past time to end this program, and the USA FREEDOM Act does \nthat.\n  At the same time, the USA FREEDOM Act maintains the tools to target \nterrorists. We are living in a dangerous world with the rise of ISIS \nand Al Shabaab and Boko Haram, not to mention Al Qaeda and radical \nIslamic terrorism across the globe. The threat to the American homeland \nhas never been greater.\n  It is critical that law enforcement and national security maintain \nthe tools so that if there is a credible basis to believe that a \nparticular individual is planning a terrorist attack, we can intercept \ntheir communications and we can prevent that terrorist attack before, \nGod forbid, they murder innocent Americans in the homeland. Those \ncritical words there are ``particular individual.''\n  What the Fourth Amendment envisions is not that law enforcement's \nhands are tied; law enforcement has tools to stop crimes. But as my \nfriend the Senator from Kentucky has so powerfully observed, the Fourth \nAmendment was designed to prevent general warrants. It was designed to \nprevent the government from assuming that everyone in the country is \nautomatically guilty and we will seize your information. Rather, the \ntools of law enforcement and national security should be particularized \nbased on the facts of the evidence.\n  That is why I support the USA FREEDOM Act because it accomplishes \nboth goals. It protects our privacy rights and the Bill of Rights of \nlaw-abiding citizens, but it ensures we have the tools to prevent acts \nof terrorists.\n  I would note two points that are important. There are a number of \nMembers of this body, including a number of Members of my party and the \nparty of this Senator from Kentucky, who argue that the PATRIOT Act \nshould be reauthorized with no changes, and they argue to do anything \nelse would jeopardize our national security.\n  There are two facts that are critical to assess to responding to that \nargument. No. 1, the Members of this body have received confidential \nclassified briefings from the national security officers of this \nadministration. We are not at liberty to convey the specific details of \nthose briefings. But the Members of this body have been told, No. 1, \nthe USA FREEDOM Act would provide effective tools so that we can \nprevent acts of terrorists.\n  Indeed, they have gone further to say that it is entirely possible \nthat under the USA FREEDOM Act, the national security team would have \nmore effective tools to stop actual terrorists than they do today under \nthe bulk metadata collection of law-abiding citizens. That is worth \nunderscoring. The national security professionals advising this body \nhave said the USA FREEDOM Act could well be more effective in providing \nthe tools to stop terrorists than the current status quo. That argument \nneeds to sit in for everyone arguing that we have to maintain the \nstatus quo to stop terrorism. If it is the case, as we have been told, \nthat the USA FREEDOM Act could be more effective, that argument \nsuddenly falls to the ground.\n  Secondly, I address my friends in the Republican Party who have \npreferred to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. Even if that is their \npreference, it is abundantly, abundantly clear that a clean \nreauthorization to the PATRIOT Act ``ain't'' passing this body and it \ncertainly ``ain't'' passing the House of Representatives. I would note \nthat the USA FREEDOM Act passed the House of Representatives 338 to 88. \nIt was not a narrow victory. It was overwhelming. So even if Members of \nthis body would prefer to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act in its entirety, \nthe votes ``ain't'' there. So the choice they face is letting it expire \naltogether, losing the tools we have to prevent real terrorists from \ncarrying out acts of terrorism or accepting a commonsense middle ground \nthat vigorously protects the Bill of Rights while maintaining the tools \nto target the bad guys.\n  I will say this: With my friend the Senator from Kentucky, I entirely \nagree that he is fully entitled to introduce his amendments to that \nbill. This body should engage in a full and open debate considering \namendments, and the Senator from Kentucky should be able to propose \nreasonable commonsense improvements to the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  We ought to debate them on the merits in a full and open process. \nThere was a time not too long ago when this body was called the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. Debate is what we are supposed to do on the \nmerits.\n  If the defenders of the PATRIOT Act right now are so confident of \ntheir position, they should be prepared to debate the Senator from \nKentucky on the merits, to debate each of the Members of this body on \nthe merits, and to arrive at the right policy that both protects our \nconstitutional rights and ensures we have all the tools we need to \nprotect the safety of American citizens against acts of terrorism.\n  I will note standing here with the Senator from Kentucky and with the \nSenator from Utah at 11:40 p.m., I am reminded of the movie ``The Blues \nBrothers'' saying: Jake, we have got to get the band back together \nagain. I am reminded of previous evenings standing here with this same \nband of brothers in the wee hours of the morning. I will make a couple \nof final observations in\n\n[[Page S3174]]\n\nthis question. The first is, the very first time I ever spoke on the \nSenate floor, when I was a brand-new freshman Senator, was during the \nlast time the Senator from Kentucky was filibustering. Senator Rand \nPaul was filibustering against the Obama administration's policy of \nuncontrolled drone strikes and the refusal of the Obama administration \nto acknowledge that the Constitution prohibits the Federal Government \nfrom using a drone to target a U.S. citizen with lethal force if that \ncitizen does not pose an imminent threat on U.S. soil.\n\n  When the Senator from Kentucky began that filibuster that morning, he \nhad asked if I might come out and support him. I told him at the time, \nas a newbie in this body, that I wanted to respect the institutions of \nthe Senate, which included the tradition that the freshman Senator \nshould stay quiet for a number of months before speaking. So initially \nI said: No, I am not going to come down; it is not yet time for me to \nspeak on the Senate floor. Yet he stood there and 1 hour and 2 hours \npassed. I could not stand back without joining him in the support in \nthat epic fight. That time I am reminded it was an anniversary of the \nBattle of the Alamo. So I had the opportunity to read to my friend \nWilliam Barret Travis's letter from the Alamo and to give him the \nencouragement of Texans who gave their lives in defense of liberty and, \nindeed, at the time to read tweets that were sent in support of the \nSenator from Kentucky. I said many times I will go to my grave in debt \nto Senator Rand Paul for the first opportunity I had to speak on the \nSenate floor which was his epic filibuster.\n  I would also note that following that filibuster, Senator Paul gave \nme two pieces of advice, both of which proved very helpful for a \nfilibuster I was to do of my own several months later. Advice No. 1, he \nsaid, was wear comfortable shoes. I would note that I observed the last \ntime Senator Paul did that, he did not follow this advice. He had not \nplanned to speak as long as he had. He told me his feet hurt for 2 \nweeks. I will confess, it was to my great shame that I am wearing today \nmy argument boots, which I wear every day on the Senate floor. But when \nI filibustered on ObamaCare, I shamefully left my boots in the closet \nand went and purchased black tennis shoes. As the hours wore on, I was \nvery grateful I had abided by Senator Paul's good advice and wore the \ntennis shoes.\n  I would note, as I am sitting here today, that the good Senator is \nwearing tennis shoes today. So I am glad to see he follows his own \nadvice, and I have no doubt that his calves and thighs will thank him \ntonight and in the morning.\n  The second bit of advice Senator Paul gave me was to drink very, very \nlittle water. That was advice he acknowledged likewise he had not \nfollowed in his own filibuster. I will note that not too long ago I was \nsitting in the President's chair presiding, and the entire hour I was \nthere, there was a glass of water on Senator Paul's desk, and he did \nnot drink a sip of it.\n  I will note that was advice I endeavored to follow. It was good \nadvice, and I am glad to see my friend is following it as well.\n  This is an exceptionally important issue that this body should be \nfocused on, the responsibility to protect the Bill of Rights and the \nconstitutional rights of every American.\n  The question I would ask my friend the Senator from Kentucky is, is \nthere any excuse for this body not taking seriously our obligation to \nprotect the Bill of Rights and the constitutional rights of privacy of \nevery American?\n  Mr. PAUL. I want to thank the Senator from Texas for joining in the \nbattle to defend the Bill of Rights and the Fourth Amendment. I know he \nis sincere in that approach. There is absolutely no excuse, no excuse \nnot to debate this and no excuse not to vote on a sufficient amount of \namendments, to try to make this better, to try to make the bulk \ncollection of records go away. That is what the American people want. \nIt is what the Constitution demands. My voice is rapidly leaving. My \nbedtime has long since passed. I think it is time we summarize why we \nare here today and what my hope is for the future with this issue.\n  We have had a dozen Senators come down from both parties, from right, \nleft, conservative, liberal, progressive, and Libertarian. We have had \nseveral friends come over from the House as well. There is a hunger in \nAmerica for somebody to stand up, for all of us to stand up, for \nsomebody to do the right thing, to say that the Bill of Rights needs to \nbe defended, that the Bill of Rights is important.\n  When I think of the Bill of Rights, I think it is not so much for the \npopular person, it is not so much for the high school quarterback or \nthe prom queen; the Bill of Rights is for the least among us and the \nBill of Rights is to try to prevent any kind of systemic bias from \nentering into the law for the way we treat people. People say: Well, we \ncollect all this data, but we are not abusing anyone. We are doing it \nperfectly in order.\n  I agree with Senator Lee that just the collection of the data is the \ninfringement in itself. The whole idea that we could put one name on a \nwarrant and collect 100 million records goes against everything we \nbelieve in. It goes against everything we fought for in the Revolution \nwhen we fought to be left alone. I think Justice Brandeis put it best \nwhen he said that the right to be left alone is the most cherished of \nrights, the most prized among civilized men, to be left alone in our \ncastle, or in today's world, to be left alone in our cloud--the time \nhas long since passed where we are going to have paper records--and \nthat is going to be our exact home or exact castle that we are \nprotecting.\n\n  The time is now in the digital age that we need to protect our \nprivacy when we loan out our records, and it is different to loan out \nyour records and allow them to be held by a telephone company or by an \nInternet provider or in the cloud. It doesn't mean you give up your \nright to privacy. I think you have an expectation of privacy with or \nwithout a contract, but often we have an explicit privacy agreement, an \nexplicit privacy contract that we actually have with the phone company \nand Internet provider. They are supposed to protect our interests. It \nsends exactly the wrong signal to give liability protection to these \ncompanies and say to them that they can run roughshod with us and that \nthey can give their information out.\n  The bulk collection must end, and I think we have the votes to do it \nnow. We need to end the bulk collection of records, but that is not \nwhere this battle ends. There is still a question as to whether the \nExecutive is gathering a great deal of information through Executive \norder. I think that has to be reviewed, and it has to be reviewed in \npublic.\n  I agree with my friend Senator Wyden that the specifics of \nintelligence--who the agents are, how we break code, how we \ntechnologically gather information--by all means does not need to be \ndiscussed in public, but whether we should collect all Americans' phone \nrecords all the time should be discussed in public. It should have been \nrevealed in an honest way.\n  The fact that the Director of our National Intelligence lied to us \nand said the program didn't even exist I think is unforgivable and \nmakes him unsuitable to lead our intelligence agency. We have to have \ntrust. Because of this great and enormous power we allow our \nintelligence agencies to have, we have to have trust, and you cannot \nhave trust when Congress is lied to.\n  I think, as we move forward today, we have made great strides in \npresenting arguments in the debate for how we would make things better, \nhow we would better circumscribe this great and ominous power, and how \nwe would better make this power conducive to the Constitution.\n  The ultimate success will be that we can actually change things, but \npart of the success will be that we have debated them today, and my \nhope is that the debate today will let the American public, as well as \nour leadership in the Senate, know that we are serious about this and \nthat we want to vote on reforms and that we want to vote on several \ndifferent ways we can fix this issue. If this issue comes up every 3 \nyears, for goodness' sake, can't we spend a couple of days trying to \namend this and make it better?\n  I thank the Senate staff for coming in and staying. I don't think \nthey had much choice in the matter, but I thank them for staying and \nnot throwing things. We will try not to do this but every couple of \nyears or so.\n\n[[Page S3175]]\n\n  I thank my staff for their help in a long day, and I thank the \nAmerican people for considering the arguments and for helping us to \nhopefully push this toward the reform where we all respect the Fourth \nAmendment and the Bill of Rights once again.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I relinquish the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a recent \ndecision of the Government of Colombia to end the aerial fumigation of \ncoca.\n  Since the beginning of Plan Colombia 15 years ago, the United States, \nat huge cost, has financed a fleet of aircraft, fuel, herbicide, and \npilots to spray coca fields in Colombia. When this first began we were \ntold that in 5 years the spraying, along with billions of dollars in \nU.S. military and other aid, would cut by half the flow of cocaine \ncoming to the United States.\n  Fifteen years later, that goal remains elusive. While the cultivation \nof coca has been reduced, aerial fumigation was never the solution to \nthis problem. It is prohibitively expensive and unsustainable by the \nGovernment of Colombia. It also defies common sense. One Colombian \nofficial told me the cost of aerial fumigation is approximately $7,000 \nper hectare, while the cost to purchase the coca produced in one \nhectare is $400. In other words, for one-fifteenth the cost of aerial \nfumigation you could buy the coca and burn it.\n  The process also ignores the reality of rural Colombia where most \ncoca farmers are impoverished and have no comparable means of earning \nincome. Absent viable economic alternatives they resort to the \ndangerous business of growing coca, often at the behest of the FARC \nrebels or other armed groups.\n  The active ingredient in the herbicide used in the fumigation is \nglyphosate, a common weed killer. It is used by farmers and gardeners \nin the United States and other countries, including Colombia.\n  But controversy has plagued the aerial fumigation since its \ninception. It is no surprise that Monsanto, which manufactures the \nchemical, insists that glyphosate poses no threat to humans. But some \nColombian farmers, whose homes are often located next to their fields, \nhave claimed that they or their children suffered skin rashes, \ndifficulty breathing, and other health problems after their property \nwas sprayed. Others have complained that the herbicide has drifted into \nand destroyed licit food crops.\n  Scientists have studied glyphosate for many years and have differed \nabout its safety. Some studies have concluded it is harmless. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency says it has ``low acute toxicity.'' \nOthers have linked it to birth deformities in amphibians. Most \nrecently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, IARC, an \naffiliate of the World Health Organization, reported that glyphosate is \n``probably carcinogenic to humans,'' and that there is ``limited \nevidence'' that it can cause non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and lung cancer.\n  I have been concerned for years about aerial fumigation in Colombia. \nWhile I am no scientist, I have wondered how the people of my State \nwould react to the repeated aerial spraying of a chemical herbicide in \nareas where they live, grow food, and raise animals. I have also noted \nthe conflicting views in the scientific literature, and we are all \naware of instances when manufacturers insisted that a product was safe \nonly to discover years later--too late for some who were exposed--that \nit was not. And, of course, there have been times when companies knew \nof the risk and chose to either ignore it or cover it up, motivated by \nprofit over the welfare of the public.\n  It is for these reasons that I have included a provision in the \nannual Department of State and foreign operations appropriations bill \nthat requires the Secretary of State to certify that ``the herbicides \ndo not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans, including \npregnant women and children, or the environment, including endemic \nspecies.'' Each year, the Secretary has made the certification.\n  The IARC study changes things. Although glyphosate remains \ncontroversial and Monsanto points out that the IARC study is not based \non new field research, President Santos has responded in the only \nresponsible way unless further research definitively contradicts it. It \nwould simply be unconscionable for the Government of Colombia to ignore \na study by the World Health Organization that a chemical sprayed over \ninhabited areas is potentially carcinogenic.\n  I commend President Santos for this decision. I am sure it was not an \neasy one, as it will inevitably be blamed for increases in coca \ncultivation. But anyone who thinks that spraying chemicals from the air \nis a solution to the illegal drug trade is deluding themselves. It is \nenormously expensive and not something U.S. taxpayers can or should pay \nfor indefinitely. It has already gone on for a decade and a half. And \nit does nothing to counter the economic incentive of coca farmers to \nsupport their families.\n  The Department of State reacted with the following statement:\n\n       Any decision about the future of aerial eradication in \n     Colombia is a sovereign decision of the Colombian government, \n     and we will respect that. The United States began eradication \n     at the government's request and our collaboration has always \n     been based on Colombia's willingness to deploy this useful \n     tool. Given the recent suspension, we intend to redouble our \n     efforts to use other tools such as enhanced manual \n     eradication; interdiction (both land and maritime); and \n     improved methods to investigate, dismantle, and prosecute \n     criminal organizations, including through anti-money \n     laundering programs. We will also continue our longer-term \n     capacity building programs, especially those related to rule \n     of law institutions, and continue to help Colombia increase \n     its governmental presence in the countryside as we recognize \n     those to be the real keys to permanent change.\n\n  That was the right response. President Santos has staked his legacy \non negotiations to end the armed conflict in Colombia. After five \ndecades of war that have uprooted millions of people and destroyed the \nlives of countless others, a peace agreement would finally make it \npossible to address the lawlessness, injustice, and poverty that are at \nthe root of the conflict. The United States should support him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3175-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3175-S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO POLICE CHIEF MICHAEL SCHIRLING\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with great appreciation and a touch \nof sadness that I note the pending retirement of Michael Schirling, who \nhas served as police chief of the city of Burlington, VT, with great \ndistinction for the last 7 years.\n  His youthful appearance belies the fact that Chief Schirling has been \nwith the department for more than 25 years, first serving as an \nauxiliary officer while still attending the University of Vermont.\n  Chief Schirling has held many titles over those years: patrol \nofficer, detective, investigator, director, commander, deputy chief, \nand finally chief. In other words, this Burlington native rose through \nthe ranks. And throughout this impressive career, Chief Schirling has \nalways sought a better way to do the job.\n  Earlier in his career, he co-founded the Vermont Internet Crimes \nAgainst Children Task Force, which recognized the potential for abuse \nas the Internet came of age. The task force has been critical to the \ninvestigation and prosecution of high-technology crimes that target \nthose who are most vulnerable.\n  After he took reins of the department, Chief Schirling grew concerned \nthat officers were spending too much time on paperwork and data entry, \ntaking precious time away from policing. In response he designed his \nown dispatch and records management software system. The Valcour \nsystem--\n\n[[Page S3176]]\n\nnamed after an island with historical significance on Lake Champlain--\nwas launched in 2011. Not only has it proven more efficient, it has \nresulted in enormous cost savings for his department and others \nthroughout Vermont that have since adopted it.\n  But perhaps most important, Chief Schirling has been a leader in \nunderstanding the importance of community policing. He stepped up foot \npatrols around the neighborhoods, stressing the importance of public \nengagement. He hosted community outreach events, including barbeques \nand monthly coffee sessions. He developed data-driven policing efforts \nto track the hot spots for crime. He implemented a street outreach \nprogram in coordination with the local mental health agency. The list \ngoes on, but it is fair to say that the work of Chief Schirling will \nleave its mark on our State's largest city for many years to come. \nChief Schirling recognized the value of 21st century policing long \nbefore we heard the term. For these reasons, I have often called on \nChief Schirling to share his experience and ideas in testimony before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. His guidance on issues of critical \nimportance, including his support for the Bulletproof Vest Partnership \nProgram, has been invaluable over these years.\n  Chief Schirling and the Burlington Police Department recently marked \nthe 150th anniversary of the department, and I was grateful to be a \npart of that celebration. As he prepares for retirement, I have no \ndoubt there is another chapter for Chief Schirling still to be written. \nI will eagerly await his next move.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3176-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LGBT VETERANS MONUMENT AT LINCOLN NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

With repeal, our country took a step to move past the prejudices \nof the past and toward a day when all Americans can serve the country \nwith honesty and pride. This monument recognizes that service with a \nfitting dedication that reads:\n\n       Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people have served \n     honorably and admirably in America's Armed Forces.

Mr. President, May is recognized as National Military \nAppreciation Month. In addition to a time when we honor the men and \nwomen who wear our Nation's uniform, we must also remember our military \nfamilies who make tremendous sacrifices.\n  These husbands and wives support our troops at home, during training \nmissions and deployments. Military spouses are essential to the \nwellbeing of our service members and the strength of our national \ndefense. We honor them with a special day honoring their role--National \nMilitary Spouse Appreciation Day.\n  Arkansas is home to thousands of military personnel. Their spouses \nare the homefront heroes who serve our country out of uniform. I asked \nArkansans to share the roles their spouses play in their military \ncareer. I want to highlight some of the ways Arkansas National Guard \nspouses support their partners' call to service.\n  MSG Tracy Onassis Hayes and her husband, Cedric, have been married \njust over 1 year. Master Sergeant Hayes says her husband had no idea \nwhat he was getting into when he married a soldier. He has had to deal \nwith the early mornings, late nights, and long weeks of her being away \nfrom home all while taking care of their 15-year-old son Ke'cy and \nmaking certain he gets to school, practice and all his other events \nwhile Master Sergeant Hayes travels out-of-State for training. He also \nmakes sure the family pets are well cared for all while maintaining a \ntraveling choir of over 30 children. Master Sergeant Hayes shared with \nme:\n\n       He makes it look easy. My husband's support of the past \n     year has made serving a whole lot less stressful. I am very \n     thankful for his love and support. He is my hero. Thank you \n     Cedric for your commitment.\n\n  Naomi Howard is familiar with military life as the daughter of CW4 \nArthur Troy. The military also paved the way for her love connection to \nher husband SFC James Howard. The couple met after James attended the \nEmployer Support of the Guard and Reserve, ESGR, briefing given by \nNaomi upon his return from deployment to Egypt. The couple spent the \nfirst 14 months of their marriage apart while James was deployed with \nthe HHC 39th IBCT to Iraq.\n  In 2004, the couple settled into a routine life in Cabot, AR, with \nJames serving on Active Guard/Reserve duty, and Naomi working as a \ncivilian at the National Guard Bureau Professional Education Center. In \n2007, James deployed to Iraq again and was away from home for more than \n1 year. James told me:\n\n       During this time Naomi did an amazing job raising four \n     young children on her own. Since then, Naomi has continued \n     working at the National Guard Bureau's Professional Education \n     Center and supporting me in my continued military service. \n     Being in the military requires long hours and time away from \n     home, yet my wife has continued to support me, more than I \n     could have ever imagined.\n\n  Not only is she a strong support for her husband and children, but \nshe is doing this all while working and attending college as a full-\ntime student. She was named to the Central Baptist College President's \nList for Fall 2014 for maintaining a 4.0 GPA. ``She juggles more than I \ncould ever imagine and she excels at doing so,'' James said.\n  Wanda Thomen has been married for 28 years to Deputy Commander CPT \nRex Thomen of the 61st CST/WMD and is a mother of two children, Myranda \nand Phelan. Wanda served as an active duty airman and was honorably \ndischarged in March 1998. Her prior service experience helps her to \nunderstand both sides, as a servicemember and as a spouse. She \npreviously served as president of the Auxiliary of the National Guard \nAssociation of Arkansas whose motto is ``The Other Half.''

Mr. President, I wish to welcome some of West Virginia's \nmost outstanding citizens to Washington. This week, as part of the \nfifth annual Always Free Honor Flight Program, we will recognize \nveterans from my home State for their dedicated commitment to our \ncountry. In light of West Virginia's proud tradition of military \nservice, it gives me great pleasure to honor these brave men and women \nwho answered the call of duty during America's hour of need.\n  Since its inception, the Always Free Honor Flight Program has taken \nup the important task of thanking those to which we owe our deepest \ngratitude. As the daughter of a World War II veteran, this is something \nvery near and dear to my heart. This year, we are joined by 29 Vietnam, \nKorea and World War II veterans from all across southern West Virginia.\n  These brave patriots sacrificed the comforts of home to defend the \ncause of freedom in a foreign land. The perseverance of our soldiers \nduring these conflicts cannot be overstated. These individuals embody \nthe extraordinary sacrifice exhibited by our service men and women \nthroughout the greatest conflicts of the 20th century.\n  One veteran on this year's trip, SGT John M. Watson, Jr., who served \nwith the renowned Tuskegee Airmen, will be honored with the \nCongressional Gold Medal for his service during World War II.\n  In addition to Sergeant Watson, West Virginia veterans participating \nin this year's Always Free Honor Flight Program include Joseph F. \nGraham, Bluefield, WWII; Staff Sergeant Robert Graham, Hinton, WWII and \nKorean war; First Sergeant Melvin L.

Hurley, Cyclone, Vietnam war; Corporal William \nCox, Bluefield, Vietnam war; and Corporal William L. Harry, Butler, TN, \nKorean war.\n  Veterans participating in the Honor Flight as ``guardians'' include \nCommand Sergeant Major Kevin L. Harry from Milton; Sergeant First Class \nMark A. Harry from St. Albans, and Specialist Selena K. Barker of \nMilton. These men and women are voluntarily dedicating their time to \nhelping ensure that our veterans receive the thank-you they deserve.\n  A great debt of gratitude is also owed to Dreama Denver, president of \nthe Denver Foundation and Little Buddy Radio. These nonprofit \norganizations, which were founded by Dreama and her husband, Bob \nDenver, established the Always Free Honor Flight Network in West \nVirginia.\n  I am so proud of the service and sense of duty that defines the \nAmerican people. As the beneficiaries of that service, one of the most \nsacred tasks we hold is properly honoring the dedication of our \nveterans. In bringing them together with the symbols of their \nsacrifice, we can express our unyielding gratitude while demonstrating \nour lasting commitment to preserving their memory. One of the greatest \nhonors of serving in the United States Senate is representing citizens \nwho have given so much to their country. I take seriously the duty of \nensuring that their sacrifice is honored with the same steadfast \nconviction with which they defended the rights and freedoms of every \nAmerican. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming and \nthanking these exceptional West Virginia veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3177-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING KAREN LOVE\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the city of South Bend \non its 150th anniversary and to recognize the many contributions of \nSouth Bend's citizens to the great State of Indiana, to our country and \nthe world.\n  South Bend's history stretches back to the 1600s, when the St. Joseph \nPotawatomi settled along the future St. Joseph River. European settlers \nestablished fur trading posts in the early 19th century. Soon after, \nFather Edward Sorin arrived and founded the University of Notre Dame. \nLess than a decade later, in 1851, the first train passed through South \nBend and development and economic growth soon followed. The town of \nSouth Bend became the city of South Bend on May 22, 1865, when it was \ngranted a city charter.\n  The city of South Bend quickly became a manufacturing leader and \ncontinues to innovate to this day. In 1852, Henry and Clement \nStudebaker opened the H Studebaker blacksmith shop.\n\n[[Page S3178]]\n\nAfter the Studebakers' younger brothers joined them, they became the \nStudebaker Brothers Manufacturing Company. Studebaker became the \nworld's largest wagon and buggy manufacturer and then entered the \nautomotive industry. The company had some famous customers, such as \nThomas Edison, who purchased the second Studebaker electric car in \n1902. The Studebaker Corporation would go on to bring opportunity and \nhundreds of jobs to families across northern Indiana.\n  As business boomed for the Studebaker Corporation, new businesses \nopened and South Bend grew. In the early 1900s, the Bendix Corporation, \nHoneywell, the South Bend Toy Company, AlliedSignal, and other well-\nknown companies opened their doors. Like many communities across the \ncountry, South Bend changed with the times. Companies, like Studebaker, \nwere forced to close their doors, but the innovative spirit of South \nBend carried on. Now, South Bend is taking its manufacturing roots in a \nnew direction, creating a high-tech hub in northern Indiana. \nTransforming old factory grounds into the high-tech Ignition Park, the \ncity has opened its doors to data centers and turbomachinery research. \nThere are many exciting entrepreneurial efforts that will continue to \ncreate jobs and opportunities for South Bend residents.\n  Today, South Bend is one of the largest cities in Indiana and has a \npopulation of more than 100,000 citizens. The city is not only critical \nto Indiana's economy but also a top destination for visitors to our \nState. Top attractions in the South Bend area include Potawatomi Park \nZoo, the Studebaker National Museum, South Bend Chocolate Company, and \nthe nearby University of Notre Dame.\n  A center of world-renowned academic excellence, the University of \nNotre Dame grew from a small school for boys founded by Father Sorin in \n1842 to one of the most prestigious universities in the country. With \nexcellent academic and athletic programs, Notre Dame attracts students \nfrom around the Nation and about 90 different countries. Important to \nour South Bend community, the university is the area's largest employer \nand an active member of the community. Our community is home to other \noutstanding higher education institutions, including, St. Mary's \nCollege, Holy Cross College and Indiana University at South Bend, which \ndraw the best and brightest students from across the State.\n  The city of South Bend also has a long history of outstanding public \nservants. Vice President Schuyler Colfax was a South Bend native, \nserving as Congressman, then Speaker of the House during the Civil War, \nand finally as Vice President to Ulysses S. Grant. Former Indiana \nGovernor Joe Kernan once led the city as mayor and continues to call \nSouth Bend home. Former Congressman John Brademas, a South Bend Central \ngraduate, was an active participant in the civil rights movement, \nworking hard to both integrate schools and increase their funding \nacross the entire country.\n  Today, I also congratulate the current leaders of South Bend: mayor \nPete Buttigieg, the members of the South Bend Common Council, and all \nof the other hardworking city officials for their many contributions to \nmaking this ``21st Century City'' the thriving city it is today.\n  The city of South Bend reflects our Hoosier values, and its citizens \nserve as an example of how hard work and dedication lead to success, \nopportunity, and prosperity. I came to South Bend as a student in 1972. \nI was privileged to have met my wife and raised our family here. And \ntoday, we continue to call the South Bend community our home.\n  It is also a great honor to represent the city of South Bend in the \nSenate. On behalf of the State of Indiana, I congratulate each and \nevery citizen of South Bend on the city's 150th anniversary and wish \nyou an equally bright and prosperous future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3178-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               HOPKINTON, NEW HAMPSHIRE 250TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I honor Hopkinton, NH--a town \nin Merrimack County that is celebrating the 250th anniversary of its \nfounding. I am proud to join citizens across the Granite State in \nrecognizing this special milestone.\n  Hopkinton, previously known as New Hopkinton by the original settlers \nfrom Hopkinton, MA, was incorporated in 1765 by colonial Governor \nBenning Wentworth, and included the three communities of Hopkinton, \nContoocook Village, and West Hopkinton. As a centrally located town, \nHopkinton gained an influential reputation. Its farms thrived on \nfertile land fed by local bodies of water and businesses continued to \nprosper as State leaders and prominent business owners moved to the \narea to be closer to the center of activity.\n  As the town's influence grew, it came to be known as one of the most \npowerful locations in the State. Coincidentally, the New Hampshire \nLegislature met in Hopkinton four times during the years of 1798 to \n1807. The civic-minded residents of the town later petitioned for \nHopkinton to become the State's capital city, but the neighboring town \nof Concord eventually won the bid in 1814 and now houses the New \nHampshire Legislature.\n  Hopkinton is home to two historic covered bridges, including the \nRowell's Bridge that was built in 1835 and the Contoocook Railroad \nBridge that spans the beautiful Contoocook River and is the oldest \ncovered bridge of its kind in existence. With 1290 acres of protected \nland, Hopkinton is rich in natural beauty with sprawling forests, \nnumerous hiking and biking trails, as well as access to countless \noutdoor activities including canoeing, kayaking and cross country \nskiing.\n  The town's population has grown to over 5,500 residents, but their \nrecord of service is indicative of a much larger town. The people of \nHopkinton have a strong commitment to the spirit of community and \nvolunteerism, as evidenced by the hard work and dedication of its \nresidents involved with the planning and celebration of the 100th \nanniversary of the renowned Hopkinton State Fair this coming September \nand the town's special sestercentennial anniversary.\n  Hopkinton and its residents have greatly contributed to the life and \ngrowth of New Hampshire. I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nextending congratulations to the people of Hopkinton as they celebrate \nthe town's 250th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3178-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3178-S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DIANE JUERGENSMEYER\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to honor Diane Juergensmeyer \nof St. Elizabeth, MO, for her dedication and service to St. Elizabeth \nHigh School, her community, and the entire State of Missouri. From 1980 \nthrough 2010, Juergensmeyer coached St. Elizabeth High School's women's \nsoftball team to 489 victories, including 358 fall championship wins, \nwhile also teaching reading skills, English, speech, and drama in the \nclassroom.\n  Overall, the St. Elizabeth Lady Hornets won eight conference titles \nunder her leadership, not to mention three Class 1 State championship \ntitles in 1992, 1994, and 2002, and another as an assistant in 2011.\n  As the daughter of Leonard and Marie Schanzmeyer, Juergensmeyer grew \nup in a large family on a farm where a fundamental respect for hard \nwork and competition were instilled in her at a young age. She played \non St. Elizabeth's first softball team and has remained a key \ncontributor to the growth of the sport's popularity as it is seen in \nMissouri today.\n  After graduating from St. Elizabeth High School in 1976, she attended \nCentral Missouri University. Shortly after graduating from Central \nMissouri University, she returned to her local high school to coach, \nteach, and even drive the bus. Her dedication to her community has \nremained constant and has remained a force in her efforts to make the \nSt. Elizabeth Lady Hornets the respected softball program that it is \ntoday.\n  In addition to her coaching and teaching careers, Juergensmeyer \nserved on the Missouri Softball Advisory Committee for 8 years and the \nNational Federation Softball rules committee for 4 years. She was also \nnamed the 115th District's Outstanding Missourian in 2004.\n  Diane Juergensmeyer has played a major role in the success of the \nLady\n\n[[Page S3179]]\n\nHornets and the St. Elizabeth community, and her legacy will continue \nto impact future generations through the foundations she helped put in \nplace, so her induction into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame comes as \nno surprise. I congratulate Coach Juergensmeyer on her many successes \nand wish her the best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3179-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING ROD DANIELS\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize WBAL-TV 11 \nanchorman Rod Daniels for his career of journalistic service to the \nresidents of the Greater Baltimore area. Mr. Daniels has been a trusted \nvoice on WBAL-TV 11 for more than 30 years, and his steady and colorful \nreporting has remained consistent and creative throughout that time. On \nthe occasion of his final nightly broadcast, which will occur this \nFriday, I would like to thank Mr. Daniels both for his years of service \nand his dedication to bringing viewers the nightly news with a regular \nmeasure of hope.\n  At the time of his retirement, Mr. Daniels will have distinguished \nhimself as the longest continually serving nightly news anchor in the \nBaltimore media market, no small accomplishment against the backdrop of \nindustry-wide newsroom downsizing that has characterized the media \nbusiness during much of his career. Mr. Daniels came to Baltimore in \n1984 and has been there for the city through tragedies like the 9/11 \nattacks and all-too-recent riots following the death of Freddie Gray. \nHis exclusive coverage when the Roman Catholic Church elevated \nBaltimore archbishops to its College of Cardinals rightly garnered \nnational awards. So it was no surprise, then, that Baltimore turned to \nMr. Daniels when it was time to host the welcome celebration for Pope \nJohn Paul II at Camden Yards, an enormous compliment and honor.\n  Throughout his career, Mr. Daniels has shown an ongoing commitment to \ncraft, charity, and community. He has spent countless hours speaking to \nschool groups, serving on the boards of organizations like the National \nAquarium in Baltimore, and hosting events to battle deadly diseases \nlike cystic fibrosis and cancer. Mr. Daniels even has taken the Polar \nBear Plunge into the frigid waters of the Chesapeake Bay to help a \nworthy cause, while finding the time to film public service \nannouncements against animal cruelty.\n  Mr. Daniels began his career as a weekend sports anchor at WIS-TV in \nColumbia, SC. He then moved to WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh as a weekend \nanchor and reporter, and then moved to WISN-TV in Milwaukee. Mr. \nDaniels is an alumnus of William Patterson University in Wayne, NJ, and \nreceived the Legacy Award for Distinguished Alumni from the William \nPatterson University Foundation in 2011. He also has completed \nenrichment programs through the Community Film Workshop Council.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing sincere appreciation and \ncongratulations to Mr. Daniels for his many contributions and \naccomplishments throughout his distinguished career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3179-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING ESTHER B. NEWMAN\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Esther B. \nNewman, the founder and chief executive officer of Leadership \nMontgomery, a not-for-profit community organization dedicated to public \nservice and management training in Montgomery County, MD. Mrs. Newman's \nvision of compassionate outreach, effective and inspirational \nleadership, and community improvement have long nurtured the people of \nMontgomery County, effecting positive change for nearly 40 years.\n  Ms. Newman was born and raised in Washington, DC. She began her \nsecondary education while balancing the responsibilities of motherhood. \nShe graduated from Montgomery College, one of Maryland's premier \ncommunity colleges, with an associate's degree in mental health in \n1975. She later earned a B.A. in human service administration from \nAntioch University and an M.S. in applied behavioral science from Johns \nHopkins University.\n  The foundations of Ms. Newman's legacy of public service were \nestablished shortly after her graduation from Montgomery College when \nshe established the Family Life Center of Montgomery County in 1976, \nwhere she served as director until 1979. She then transitioned into \nwork at Olney, MD's Montgomery General Hospital as a public relations \nconsultant, simultaneously contributing to the local Courier-Gazette \nnewspapers as a community correspondent and serving as an officer on \nthe Upper Montgomery Community Mental Health Center Citizens Advisory \nCommittee.\n  Throughout the 1980s, Ms. Newman continued to serve in an extensive \ncapacity across Montgomery County, encompassing a diverse portfolio of \nhealth care focused outreach, volunteer service, and civic leadership \npositions. In 1981, Ms. Newman joined the Olney Chamber of Commerce and \nbecame a board member in 1984. By 1983, she had moved into a leadership \nrole as the program director of the YWCA of Montgomery County and later \njoined the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce, where she held the \nrole of executive director from 1986 through 1988.\n  As the decade drew to a close, Ms. Newman drew on her years of public \nservice and leadership experience and formulated a curriculum of \nmanagement training retreats, lectures, and educational guidelines. She \nworked with the late Larry Pignone of the United Way to establish \nLeadership Montgomery in 1989, where she has served as director ever \nsince. The core program of Leadership Montgomery, which incorporates \nyouth, business executive, senior, and emerging leader training \nmodules, is aimed at inspiring the next generation of business and \ncivic leaders in Montgomery County and beyond. Above all, Leadership \nMontgomery strives to establish a more inclusive management community, \ncomprised of leaders of diverse backgrounds and perspectives.\n  In the 26 years since its founding, Leadership Montgomery has \nenriched and educated more than 2,000 graduates. The success of this \nmission is reflected in the program's accomplished alumni, with local \nBoard of Education members, Circuit Court judges, members of both the \nMaryland Senate and House of Delegates, and Montgomery County \nCouncilmembers among them.\n  Throughout her career in public life, Esther Newman has also helped \nto raise more than $5 million in contributions for scholarships and \nprograms, in addition to nearly $3 million of in-kind donations. For \nher unparalleled commitment to service, generosity, and tireless \ndevotion to the betterment of Montgomery County, she has been \nrecognized with numerous accolades, including Jewish Women \nInternational's Women to Watch Community Leadership Award in 2011, the \nCorporate Volunteer Council President's Award in 2009, the Victims' \nRights Foundation's Game Changer Award in 2014, and an honorary degree \nin public service from her alma mater Montgomery College in 2002.\n  Ms. Newman will be retiring from her position as director of \nLeadership Montgomery in September, after more than a quarter-century \nof education and guidance. Her compassionate spirit, inspirational \nleadership, and unwavering devotion to civic improvement have long \ninspired the greater Montgomery County community. Many of the people \nMs. Newman have touched have taken the lessons that they have learned \nat Leadership Montgomery into business and government. Though she will \nsoon step down as a director, I have no doubt that Ms. Newman will \ncontinue to be involved in the community and will continue to inspire \nothers to enter leadership roles. I ask my colleagues to join me is \nwishing her all the best for a restful and fulfilling \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3179-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3179-S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DAVID G. BAKERIAN\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise on behalf of the Delaware delegation to honor the service of David \nG. Bakerian upon his retirement as president, CEO and treasurer of the \nDelaware Bankers Association. David has dedicated the past 22 years of \nhis life to helping lead the banking industry and keeping it alive and \nthriving in Delaware for the countless people it employs and serves.\n  As president of the Delaware Bankers Association, David's priority \nhas been to ensure that a significant part of America's banking \nindustry--one of Delaware's top employers--maintained\n\n[[Page S3180]]\n\nits home in in the First State and continues to thrive while serving \ncustomers in the First State and around the world. Tens of thousands of \nDelawareans rely on the good jobs that our State's financial services \nprovide, jobs that have enhanced the lives of many. Dave is known for \nbeing honest, and even if someone didn't always like the answer, they \nrespected him for doing the right thing, not what was easy or \nexpedient. He also is admired for his positive, can-do attitude \nregardless of the magnitude of the challenges he and the members of the \nDelaware Bankers Association have faced over the years.\n  Over more than two decades, David has worked with three Governors and \ntestified before and advised 11 separate Delaware General Assemblies on \na variety of banking legislative matters, including credit cards, trust \nadministration, interstate banking and branching, foreclosure \nmediation, and consumer protection. In 2001, David led the Delaware \nBankers Association in a cooperative venture with the University of \nDelaware's Center for Economic Education and Entrepreneurship, the \nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and the Consumer Credit \nCounseling Services of Delaware and Maryland to form Keys to Financial \nSuccess, a high school credit course focusing on financial literacy. \nThe program is still offered today in 28 high schools in Delaware with \nmore than 4,200 students participating. In 2004, David was elected to a \n1-year chairmanship of the State Association Division of the American \nBankers Association. In this role, he became the national spokesperson \nfor the 50 State bankers associations and held a seat on the American \nBankers Association board of directors. He is the only Delawarean ever \nto serve in this national leadership role. His service in that role is \na source of pride to our State.\n  While David is passionate about banking, he actually began his career \nin education and studied to become a college professor. He possesses a \nremarkable ability to write clearly and communicate effectively. Those \nskills have helped him go on to such a successful career in banking, in \npart because of his ability to explain highly complex issues to almost \nanyone and everyone. His passion for education can be seen in his own \nacademic achievements. After receiving his bachelor's degree from Siena \nCollege in New York, he went on to receive a master's degree from the \nUniversity of West Florida and a postgraduate certificate in higher \neducation administration from the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to \nhis appointment at the Delaware Bankers Association, he served as \nexecutive director of the Delaware Chapter of the American Institute of \nBanking. He began his tenure at Delaware AIB in 1985 and oversaw the \neducational unit.\n  Through his tireless efforts, David Bakerian has made a positive \ndifference in not only the banking community but the education \ncommunity and the community writ large. I am delighted to salute David \nand thank him for his many years of service to Delaware and to \ncongratulate him on a truly remarkable and distinguished career. I know \nhe looks forward to spending more time with his grandchildren in his \ngarden and refining his culinary skills in the kitchen. In closing, on \nbehalf of the people of Delaware, as well as on behalf of Senator Coons \nand Congressman Carney, I want to wish David and his wife Pam, his son \nNick, and his daughters Alex and Catherine, along with his son-in-law \nJeff and his grandchildren Adam and Madeline, the very best in all that \nlies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3180-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH BLONG\n\n Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a man who \nwas well known across my State, and in many circles across our Nation. \nBobby Andrew, an Alaska Native Yupik leader, passed away on May 12 at \nthe age of 73 near Aleknagik in southwest Alaska.\n  Aleknagik is 16 miles northwest of its hub community of Dillingham, a \nsmall town of about 2,500 residents, which sits at the confluence of \nthe Nushagak River, an inlet of Alaska's Bristol Bay.\n  Bobby was seen as a leader by many Native and non-Native Alaskans. At \na young age Bobby attended territorial and BIA schools in Southwest \nAlaska and then went off to Ohio to earn an accounting degree from Dyke \nSpencerian Business College, now known as Chancellor University in \nCleveland. He then returned home to bring his education back to Alaska.\n  Bobby was a lifelong subsistence hunter and fisherman who was \nrespected by many across the State. He taught many of the importance of \ntraditional knowledge and passing along important Alaska Native values.\n  Bobby was a known advocate for land and water protection in Alaska. \nAs a writer and public speaker Bobby took his advocacy across the \nState, Nation, and overseas. He often visited places like Juneau, \nWashington, DC, and London when asked to speak about Alaska. It was \nsaid about Bobby that ``anywhere he was needed, he would go . . .''\n  Bobby was once quoted saying, ``I find myself fighting for the future \nof our renewable fish and wildlife resources. They are the central part \nof my culture,'' he said. ``We need to let the rest of the world know \nso we can all work together to protect the environment, air, water and \nlands that produce subsistence resources on which we depend.''\n  Bobby loved Alaska, loved his family--especially his grandchildren--\nand he was an important voice for Alaska. He passed naturally at his \ncabin, a place he loved, where he went to rest after fishing. He will \nbe missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3181-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING COLONEL KEVIN KENNEDY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Colonel Kevin \nKennedy, commander of the 28th Bomb Wing, Ellsworth Air Force Base, \nnear Rapid City, SD. Colonel Kennedy has been the commander at \nEllsworth for the past 2 years, and has served in his position \nadmirably.\n  Colonel Kennedy began his career at the Air Force Academy in \nColorado. He is a B-1 pilot who went on to serve at Ellsworth on \nmultiple occasions, including as deputy commander of the 28th \nOperations Group as recently as 2010. During his career he also served \nas the vice commander of the 379th Air Expeditionary Wing in South West \nAsia and as the director of the Air Force Strategic Study Group at the \nPentagon here in DC.\n  When he came back to Ellsworth 2 years ago as base commander, my \noffice was working with the Air Force on a 9-year project to expand the \nPowder River Training Complex, which is the primary training airspace \nfor the B-1 bombers based at Ellsworth, as well as the B-52 bombers \nbased in Minot Air Force Base, ND. When Colonel Kennedy arrived at \nEllsworth as base commander, he made the completion of the Powder River \nTraining Complex one of his top priorities, and he assured me that this \nairspace expansion would be completed under his watch. This was not a \npledge he took lightly. Be it emphasizing the need for this airspace \nwithin the Air Force hierarchy or driving out to Montana to meet with \nNative American tribal leaders, Colonel Kennedy was willing to go the \nextra mile to bring this airspace home.\n  As a result of his efforts, in January of this year the Air Force \nsigned the Record of Decision for the Powder River Training Complex \nexpansion, which was approved by the FAA a few months later. Once this \nairspace is charted and operational, Ellsworth Air Force Base will save \nup to $23 million a year by being able to train closer to home. In \naddition, other aircraft from around the Nation can come to South \nDakota to utilize this training space, improving overall readiness. The \nexpanded Powder River Training Complex is a national treasure.\n  I want to thank Colonel Kennedy for his commitment to this project \nand for his service to our Nation. He really is a shining example of \nthe dedication and leadership that makes America's Air Force the \ngreatest in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3181-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3181-S3182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING INNOGENOMICS TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses often have the \nunique ability to pinpoint serious problems in their communities while \nworking with local agencies and other small businesses to get things \ndone. Sometimes these small businesses provide ground-breaking, \ninnovative technological solutions to problems that have gone unsolved \nfor decades. As we close out National Small Business Week, I am proud \nto recognize InnoGenomics Technologies of New Orleans, LA. as a Small \nBusiness of the Day for National Small Business Week.\n  In the wake of Hurricane Katrina's devastation, Dr. Sudhir Sinha, \npresident and CEO of InnoGenomics Technologies, had the idea to develop \na new DNA marker system to aid in identifying victims of natural \ndisasters. Developed with the support of National Science Foundation \nSmall Business Innovation Research, SBIR, grants, InnoGenomics \nTechnologies' patented technology gives forensic scientists the ability \nto test the most challenging DNA submissions to solve crimes and save \nlives. Additionally, the InnoGenomics Technologies team is currently \ndeveloping a new method to detect and monitor cancer--a liquid biopsy \nthat can be conducted through a minimally invasive blood test. \nCombined, these two groundbreaking endeavors are advancing and \nrevolutionizing healthcare and forensic investigations.\n  Congratulations again to InnoGenomics Technologies for being selected \nas a Small Business of the Day for National Small Business Week.\n\n[[Page S3182]]\n\nThank you for your continued commitment to innovating DNA technologies \nto solve crimes and save lives right in the heart of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3182-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING HARING CATFISH\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, small businesses often set a high \nstandard for quality and service across the United States. Commitment \nto reaching these high thresholds is most important in our agriculture \nand food industries. One small business that has continually held \nitself to the highest bar for quality and service is Haring Catfish, \nlocated in Wisner, LA--the Small Business of the Day for National Small \nBusiness Week.\n  Louisiana is known for its fresh, high-quality, and delicious \nseafood. Opened in the early 1960s by Walter Carl ``Pete'' Haring, Sr., \nHaring Catfish has since grown to processing over 300,000 pounds of \ncatfish per week. Haring Catfish's commitment to the highest quality \ncatfish through healthy, high protein diets has elevated them to be one \nof the most-recognized catfish farms in the United States. Haring \nCatfish has received numerous distinguished awards, including the \nLouisiana Catfish Farmer of the Year Award, Catfish Farmers of America \nAward of Excellence, and the Small Business Person of the Year Award by \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration.\n  Congratulations again to Haring Catfish for being selected as a Small \nBusiness of the Day for National Small Business Week.

Mr. President, just as important as it is to \nrecognize our small businesses, it is often important to also recognize \nour small business success stories--especially those that make a \nsubstantial impact in their industries and in their communities. As a \npart of National Small Business Week, I am proud to recognize the \nLouisiana small business success story of Raising Cane's Chicken \nFingers.\n  In the early 1990s, Todd Graves was inspired to open a chicken finger \nrestaurant. After the bank turned down the fresh-out-of-college \ngraduate for a loan, Graves spent the next few years working various \njobs to earn and save the money necessary to open Raising Cane's in \nBaton Rouge, LA. in 1996. In the years since, Raising Cane's Chicken \nFingers has opened over 150 locations across the United States and has \ngained a fandom following. Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers prides itself \non their commitment to the absolute highest quality products and \nservices--a model that has earned them numerous ``Best Places to Work'' \nawards from regions across the country. Never forgetting its small \nbusiness roots, Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers stays true to Louisiana \nand regularly gives back to the communities their establishments serve. \nTodd Graves and the entire Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers crew are an \ninspiring example of the hard work, courage, and dedication that go \ninto running American small businesses.\n  Congratulations again to Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers for being \nrecognized as a small business success story during the 2015 National \nSmall Business Week. Your commitment to giving back to your local \ncommunities and remembering your small business beginning is recognized \nand greatly appreciated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3182-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL WILLIAM P. DAVIS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I honor the career of one of \nLouisiana's heroes and most accomplished residents, retired Marine \nCorps Col. William P. Davis. Colonel Davis was born at Camp Pendleton, \nCA, the son of a career marine, and spent his youth following his \nfather's military postings. He is a combat veteran of Operation Desert \nStorm, and subsequently assigned as the supply, fiscal, and contracting \nofficer for Landing Force Training Command Atlantic. In 1997, he was \nassigned to his first tour at the Marines Forces Reserve in New \nOrleans, LA. During that period, he was a parent volunteer for the \nYoung Marines chapter in Slidell, LA, where he organized training \nevents and tours to units and bases. In addition, he provided classes \nfor the annual regimental encampment as well as at recruit training \nevents.\n  Colonel Davis was operations officer for Joint Task Force Civil \nSupport, a military organization under the U.S. Northern Command at \nFort Monroe, VA, where he led a team of technical experts in planning \npost-incident recovery from chemical, biological, radiological or \nnuclear incidents. He supported planning for the 2006 Winter Olympics, \n2006 Southeast Asian Games, and other exercises across the world. \nDuring Hurricane Katrina's aftermath in 2005, he worked with Federal, \nmilitary, State, and local authorities in support of response \noperations.\n  Colonel Davis returned to New Orleans in 2006, becoming assistant \nchief of Staff at Marine Forces Reserve. He led a staff of 80 people \ncharged with overseeing construction, maintenance, and repairs of 187 \nreserve sites nationwide, including the construction of the 29-acre \nMarine Corps Support Facility in New Orleans. From 2011 until recently, \nColonel Davis was the inaugural commandant of the New Orleans Military \nand Maritime Academy, a charter high school where all students are \ncadets of the Marine Corps Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps \nProgram and are focused on college preparation with an emphasis on \nscience, technology, engineering, and math. In his job as commandant, \nColonel Davis has helped positively shape the lives of several hundred \ncadets from the region. After 4 years of operation, the academy has \ntest results and student performance improvement ranked well above \naverages by more established schools. Beginning in 2016, Colonel Davis \nwill leave Louisiana to become the next national executive director and \nCEO of the Young Marines.\n  Colonel Davis is an accomplished executive whose commitment to young \npeople has always been fundamental during his career. He is highly \nregarded for strategic thinking, sound financial management, marketing \nexpertise, and exceptional project management skills. He is a \ndistinguished leader who will bring military expertise and business \nexperience to the Young Marines.\n  I am pleased to join with the Senate in honoring the career of \nretired Col. William P. Davis. We thank him for his service to our \ncountry and congratulate him as he begins the next chapter of his \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3182-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3182-S3183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:49 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 178.

A bill to reinstate certain mining claims in the State of \nAlaska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nin a dramatically different form to reinstate two small miner's claims, \nwhich have been taken from them because of an inequitable federal \nadministrative process.\n  Under revisions to the Federal Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 28(f) \nholders of unpatented mineral claims must pay a claim maintenance fee \noriginally set at $100 per claim by a deadline, set by regulation, of \nSeptember l each year. Since 2004 that fee has risen to $140 per claim. \nBut Congress also provided a claim maintenance fee waiver for ``small'' \nminers, those who hold 10 or fewer claims, so that they do not have to \nsubmit the fee, but that they must file to renew their claims and \nsubmit an affidavit of annual labor, work conducted on the claim, each \nyear, certifying that they had performed more\n\n[[Page S3186]]\n\nthan $100 of work on the claim in the preceding year, 30 U.S.C. \n28f(d)(1). The waiver provision further states: ``If a small miner \nwaiver application is determined to be defective for any reason, the \nclaimant shall have a period of 60 days after receipt of written \nnotification of the defect or defects by the Bureau of Land Management \nto: A) cure such defect or defects or (B) pay the . . . claim \nmaintenance fee(s) due for such a period.''\n  Since past revisions of the law, there have been a series of \nincidents where miners have argued that they submitted their \napplications and affidavits of annual labor in a timely manner, but due \nto clerical error by U.S. Bureau of Land Management staff, mailing \ndelays or for unexplained reasons, the applications or documents were \nnot recorded as having been received in a timely fashion. In that case \nBLM has terminated the claims, deeming them null and void. While mining \nclaim holders have argued that the law provides them time to cure claim \ndefects, BLM has argued that the cure only applies when applications or \nfees have been received in a timely manner. Thus, there is no \nadministrative remedy for miners who believe that clerical errors by \nBLM or mail issues resulted in loss or the late recording of claim \nextension applications and paperwork.\n  There have been a number of cases where Congress has been asked to \noverride BLM determinations and reinstate mining claims simply because \nof the disputes over whether the claims had been filed in a timely \nmanner. Congress in 2003 reinstated such claims in a previous Alaska \ncase. Claims in two other incidents were reinstated following a U.S. \nDistrict Court case in the 10th Circuit first in 2009 in the case of \nMiller v. United States and in a second Alaska case in 2013. \nLegislation to correct the provision to prevent this problem actually \nwas approved by the Senate in 2007, but did not ultimately become law.\n  In the past three Congresses I have introduced legislation intended \nto short circuit continued litigation and pleas for claim reinstatement \nby clarifying the intent of Congress that miners do have to be informed \nthat their claims are in jeopardy of being voided and given 60 days of \nnotice to cure defects, including giving them time to submit their \napplications and to submit affidavits of annual labor, should their \nsubmittals not be received and processed by BLM officials on time. If \nall defects are not cured within 60 days--the obvious intent of \nCongress in passing the original act--then claims should be subject to \nvoidance. But this administration has opposed the legislation arguing \nthat it would be too expensive to notify all small miners who fail to \nfile their small miner waiver documents on time and giving them time to \nsolve the defect prior to the loss of their claims. It has even been \nsuggested that giving small miners simple due process would just \nencourage miners to ignore the deadline for filing of their fee \nwaivers.\n  I clearly find the cost argument unpersuasive. Many Federal \ndepartments and agencies, the Federal Communication Commission, as one \nexample, routinely sends out notices on permit and license \napplications. The FCC sends out hundreds of thousands of such notices \nto Americans who have small radio licenses expiring yearly, warning \nthem that they need to file applications for license renewal. The \nBureau of Land Management certainly should be able to afford a few \nhundred stamps to perform a similar service. Given the value of claims \nplaced at risk and the bother, inconvenience and fear of loss of \nclaims, it is highly unlikely that miners would avoid filing their \nwaiver paperwork on time just because a notification process was \nclearly in place before claims could be terminated.\n  But after facing the clear opposition of this administration over 6 \nyears to resolving this inequity, today I simply file legislation to \nremedy the injustices for two of my constituents who have lost their \nrights, in one case to nine mineral claims on the Kenai Peninsula, near \nHope, Alaska, and in the second case to a single placer claim in the \nFortymile District of northeast Alaska. The transition language \nproposed will reinstate claims for Mr. John Trautner, who has lost \ntitle to claims that he had held from 1982 to 2004. Mr. Trautner \nsuffered this loss even though he had a consistent record of having \npaid the annual labor assessment fee for the previous 22 years. The \nlocal BLM office did have a time-date-stamped record that the \nmaintenance fee waiver certification form had been filed weeks before \nthe deadline, but just not a record that the affidavit of annual labor \nhad arrived when he dropped it at the office in Anchorage at the same \ntime.\n  In the second case, it will reinstate a claim held by Mr. and Mrs. \nVernon Thurneau, now of Wasilla, who lost their claim after mining it \ncontinuously for 38 years in 2009, simply because of a holiday season \nerror. In this case the Thurneau's paid their fees on time, and turned \nin their proof of labor affidavit to the Fairbanks Recorders Office in \nDecember before the deadline. They received a time and date stamp that \nthey produced the information in a timely manner. But because of the \nChristmas holidays they simply forgot to turn/mail in the form to the \nBLM Anchorage office until after Jan. 1, missing the BLM's required \nDec. 31 deadline. Because of a holiday delay, they lost their claims \nand 38 years of work.\n  This legislation, supported in the past by the Alaska Miners \nAssociation, will simply reinstate the two sets of claims, claims that \nhave been held by the government over the past decade. In response to \ncomplaints by the Department of the Interior that past versions of my \nlegislation improperly would have resulted in the patenting of the \nclaims by the granting of a first half final certificate in the \nTrautner case, I have modified this bill simply to reinstate the \nclaims, but not to take steps to confirm patents. By this bill Mr. \nTrautner will have to wait like many other miners for Congress to \nreconsider the merits of the moratorium on patent issuance first \nimposed on the Mining Law of 1872 by Congress in 1995.\n  It is simple justice that Mr. Trautner and the Thurneau family \nreceive their claims back, since Congress clearly thought it was giving \nminers a guaranteed opportunity to remedy claim defects when it created \nthe small miner waiver provisions in 1993. Return of the claims will \ncost the government nothing and likely will result in added federal \nrevenues, hopefully preventing this bill from facing any procedural \nissues. I hope that justice will finally prevail in these cases this \nCongress, even though I regret that I see no means to fix the larger \ninequity in the interpretation of the small miner waiver statute for \nthe foreseeable future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1397.

A bill to provide for the annual designation of cities in \nthe United States as an ``American World War II City''; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \ndirect the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate one city each \nyear as a World War II city, beginning with Wilmington, NC, as \nAmerica's first World War II City.\n  The names of the 10,000 Tarheels, who paid the ultimate price in \nWorld War II are memorialized on the bulkhead of the battleship USS \nNorth Carolina in downtown Wilmington.\n  During World War II, the USS North Carolina, known affectionately \nthroughout the Navy as the ``Showboat'', ``participated in every major \nnaval offensive in the Pacific area of operations and earned 15 battle \nstars. She steamed over 300,000 miles. Although Japanese radio claimed \nsix times that North Carolina had been sunk, she survived.\n  After serving as a training vessel for midshipmen, North Carolina was \ndecommissioned June 27, 1947 and placed in the Inactive Reserve Fleet \nin Bayonne, New Jersey, for the next 14 years. In 1958 the announcement \nof her impending scrapping led to a statewide campaign by citizens of \nNorth Carolina to save the ship and bring her back to her home state. \nThe Save Our Ship, SOS, campaign was successful and the battleship \narrived in her current berth on October 2, 1961. She was dedicated on \nApril 29, 1962, as the State's memorial to its World War II veterans\n  At home, North Carolina's coast was a war zone. On April 13-14, 1942, \nthe first U-boat, German U-85, was sunk off the North Carolina Coast. \nMr. President, 397 ships were sunk or damaged and nearly 5,000 people \nwere killed within sight of our shores. For 6 months at the beginning \nof America's war, 65 German U-boats hunted Allied merchant vessels \npractically unopposed. The greatest concentration of these attacks came \noff North Carolina.\n  During World War II, Wilmington was the home of the North Carolina \nShipbuilding Company. The shipyard was created as part of the U.S. \nGovernment's Emergency Shipbuilding Program. Workers built 243 ships in \nWilmington during the five years the company operated.\n  The city was the site of three prisoner-of-war, POW, camps from \nFebruary 1944 through April 1946. At their peak, the camps held 550 \nGerman prisoners. The first camp was located on the corner of Shipyard \nBoulevard and Carolina Beach Road; the old Confederate post Fort Fisher \nhoused German prisoners and also served as a training site for the \nCoastal Artillery and anti-aircraft units. A smaller contingent of \nprisoners was assigned to a smaller site, working in the officers' mess \nand doing grounds keeping at Bluethenthal Army Air Field, which is now \nWilmington International Airport. Bluethenthal Army Air Field was used \nby the United States Army Air Forces' Third Air Force for antisubmarine \npatrols and training.\n  I want to thank my colleague Senator Burr for bringing this idea to \nestablish a process to recognize Wilmington and other American cities \nfor their efforts during the war years, to the Senate. But I also wish \nto single out Wilbur Jones, a Wilmington native and military historian \nwho has poured so much of his time and soul into ensuring that the \npeople of southeastern North Carolina never forget the contributions of \nour state to victory in the Atlantic and the Pacific.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1402. A bill to allow acceleration certificates awarded under the \nPatents for Humanity Program to be transferable; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the American intellectual property system \nis rightly held as the global standard for promoting innovation and \ndriving economic growth. This is particularly true of our patent \nsystem. The fundamental truth that our Founders recognized more than \n200 years ago, that limited exclusive rights for inventors incentivize \nresearch and development, continues to benefit consumers and the \nAmerican economy at large.\n\n[[Page S3188]]\n\n  A healthy patent system should do more than drive economic \ndevelopment; it should incentivize research and discoveries that \nadvance humanitarian needs. I have worked to promote policies that \nencourage intellectual property holders to apply their work to address \nglobal humanitarian challenges. Today, I continue that effort by \njoining with Senator Grassley to introduce the bipartisan Patents for \nHumanity Program Improvement Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation strengthens a program created by the \nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office, PTO, in 2012. The PTO's \nPatents for Humanity Program provides rewards to selected patent \nholders who use their invention to address a humanitarian issue that \nsignificantly affects the public health or quality of life of an \nimpoverished population. Those who receive the award are given a \ncertificate to accelerate certain PTO processes, as described in the \nprogram rules.\n  The innovations that have been recognized by this program help \nunderserved people throughout the world. Award winners have worked to \nimprove the treatment and diagnosis of devastating diseases, improve \nnutrition and the environment, and combat the spread of dangerous \ncounterfeit drugs. These are innovations that will make a real \ndifference in the lives of people who are not always the beneficiaries \nof cutting-edge technology.\n  Following a Judiciary Committee hearing in 2012, I asked then-PTO \nDirector Kappos whether the Patents for Humanity program would be more \neffective, and more attractive to innovators, if the acceleration \ncertificates awarded were transferable to a third party. He responded \nthat it would, and that it would be particularly beneficial to small \nbusinesses that win the award. Since that time, other small start-ups \nand global health groups have emphasized that making the certificates \ntransferable would improve their usability and increase the incentives \nof the Patents for Humanity Award. The Patents for Humanity Program \nImprovement Act makes this enhancement to the program. It is a \nstraightforward, cost-neutral bill that will strengthen this award and \nencourage innovations to be used for humanitarian goods.\n  When Congress can establish policies that provide business incentives \nfor humanitarian endeavors, it should not hesitate to act. I urge the \nSenate to work swiftly to pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/20/senate-section/article/S3188-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3188-S3190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 17--ESTABLISHING A JOINT SELECT COMMITTEE \n                      TO ADDRESS REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ROUNDS (for himself, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Thune, Mr. Inhofe, Mrs. \nCapito, Mr. Risch, Mr. Hoeven, and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 17\n\n       Whereas there are more than 3,500 rules issued every year \n     by more than 50 Federal agencies;\n       Whereas a rule is defined in section 551 of title 5, United \n     States Code, as ``the whole or part of an agency statement of \n     general or particular applicability and future effect \n     designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or \n     policy'';\n       Whereas subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title \n     5, United States Code (commonly known as the ``Administrative \n     Procedure Act'') established standards for the issuance of \n     rules using formal rulemaking and informal rulemaking \n     procedures;\n       Whereas informal rulemaking, also known as ``notice and \n     comment'' rulemaking or ``section 553'' rulemaking, is the \n     most common type of rulemaking;\n       Whereas in rulemaking proceedings, formal hearings must be \n     held and interested parties must be given the chance to \n     comment on the proposed rule or regulation, and once adopted, \n     the rule or regulation is required to be published in the \n     Federal Register;\n       Whereas, according to a 2005 study commissioned by the \n     Small Business Administration, the cost of all rules in \n     effect was approximately $1,100,000,000,000 per year, more \n     than the people of the United States paid in Federal income \n     taxes in 2009;\n       Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments \n     report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the top 6 \n     Federal rulemaking agencies (which, in 2013, were the \n     Departments of the Treasury, Commerce, Interior, Health and \n     Human Services, and Transportation and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency) account for 49.3 percent of all Federal \n     rules;\n       Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments \n     report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, small \n     businesses pay more in per-employee regulatory costs, and \n     firms with fewer than 20 employees pay an average of $10,585 \n     per employee, compared to $7,755 for those with 500 or more \n     employees;\n       Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments \n     report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory \n     costs amount to an average of $14,974 per household, which is \n     23 percent of the average household income of $65,596 and 29 \n     percent of the expenditure budget of $51,442;\n       Whereas, according to a 2011 study by the Weidenbaum Center \n     at Washington University, it is estimated that the budgetary \n     cost of administering and enforcing Federal regulations by \n     Federal agencies for fiscal year 2012 amounted to more than \n     $57 billion (in 2005 dollars), which represents a 10.5 \n     percent increase in 2 years;\n       Whereas chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code (commonly \n     known as the ``Congressional Review Act'') established a \n     mechanism through which Congress could overturn Federal \n     regulations by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval;\n       Whereas the Congressional Review Act requires that rules \n     that have a $100,000,000 effect or more on the economy are \n     submitted by agencies to both Houses of Congress and the \n     Government Accountability Office and have a delayed effective \n     date of not less than 60 days to pass a resolution of \n     disapproval rejecting the rule, which must be approved by the \n     President; and\n       Whereas, since the enactment of the Congressional Review \n     Act in 1996, the procedures under the Act have been used 1 \n     time to overturn a rule: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRADE FACILITATION AND CAPACITY BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As a land-locked least-developed country, Nepal has \n     severe challenges reaching markets and developing capacity to \n     export goods. As of 2015, exports from Nepal are \n     approximately $800,000,000 per year, with India the major \n     market at $450,000,000 annually. The United States imports \n     about $80,000,000 worth of goods from Nepal, or 10 percent of \n     the total goods exported from Nepal.\n       (2) The World Bank has found evidence that the overall \n     export competitiveness of Nepal has been declining since \n     2005. Indices compiled by the World Bank and the Organization \n     for Economic Co-operation and Development found that export \n     costs in Nepal are high with respect to both air cargo and \n     container shipments relative to other low-income countries. \n     Such indices also identify particular weaknesses in Nepal \n     with respect to automation of customs and other trade \n     functions, involvement of local exporters and importers in \n     preparing regulations and trade rules, and export finance.\n       (3) Implementation by Nepal of the Agreement on Trade \n     Facilitation of the World Trade Organization could directly \n     address some of the weaknesses described in paragraph (2).\n       (b) Establishment of Trade Facilitation and Capacity \n     Building Program.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall, in \n     consultation with the Government of Nepal, establish a trade \n     facilitation and capacity building program for Nepal--\n       (1) to enhance the central export promotion agency of Nepal \n     to support successful exporters and to build awareness among \n     potential exporters in Nepal about opportunities abroad and \n     ways to manage trade documentation and regulations in the \n     United States and other countries;\n       (2) to provide export finance training for financial \n     institutions in Nepal and the Government of Nepal;\n       (3) to assist the Government of Nepal in maintaining \n     publication of all trade regulations, forms for exporters and \n     importers, tax and tariff rates, and other documentation \n     relating to exporting goods on the Internet and developing a \n     robust public-private dialogue, through its National Trade \n     Facilitation Committee, for Nepal to identify timelines for \n     implementation of key reforms and solutions, as provided for \n     under the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade \n     Organization; and\n       (4) to increase access to guides for importers and \n     exporters on the Internet, including rules and documentation \n     for United States tariff preference programs.\n\n     SEC. 306. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall \n     monitor, review, and report to Congress on the implementation \n     of this title, the compliance of Nepal with section 303(a), \n     and the trade and investment policy of the United States with \n     respect to Nepal.\n\n     SEC. 307. TERMINATION OF PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT.\n\n       No preferential treatment extended under this title shall \n     remain in effect after December 31, 2025.\n\n[[Page S3195]]\n\n     SEC. 308.
