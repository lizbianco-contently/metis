Mr. President, tonight we will welcome President Obama \nto the Capitol. We look forward to hearing what he has to say.\n  We are looking forward to Senator Ernst's address, as well. Joni \nErnst understands the concerns of hard-working families in a way much \nof Washington has not. That is why the people of her State sent her \nhere--to fight for them. She will explain the commitment of this new \nCongress to work for policies aimed at the good jobs and better wages \nAmericans deserve.\n  Tonight is a big moment for the President--and for our country. The \ntone he strikes and the issues he highlights will tell us a lot about \nwhat to expect in his Presidency's final act. There is a lot riding on \nit, and we will be listening closely.\n  One option is the path he has been on for so many years. I sincerely \nhope he makes a different choice. The American people just spoke in \nclear terms about this direction. They called for a new one. We should \nwork together to make Washington focus on their concerns.\n  Working with the new Congress for positive change--that is the second \noption for President Obama. It is the one struggling families and \nserious policymakers urge him to choose. The new Congress has already \nstarted to take up smart, bipartisan ideas focused on jobs and reform. \nBut when we have asked the White House for constructive engagement, \nwhat we have seen, at least so far, has been pretty discouraging. We \nneed to change this dynamic. We need to turn the page. The State of the \nUnion offers that opportunity.\n  The American people aren't demanding talking point proposals designed \nto excite the base but not designed to pass. What they said they are \nhungry for is substance and accomplishment. They want Washington to get \nback to work and focus on a serious jobs and reform agenda. They said \nthey are ready to see more constructive cooperation, especially on \nbipartisan jobs initiatives--bipartisan jobs initiatives such as the \nKeystone infrastructure bill. Keystone has support in both parties. It \nis an important piece of infrastructure for our country. According to \nwhat the Obama administration's own State Department has said \npreviously, constructing a pipeline would support literally thousands \nof jobs. It has already passed the House. We are currently working to \npass it through the Senate. It will be on the President's desk before \nlong. We see no reason for him to veto these jobs.\n  But whatever he decides, we are going to keep working for positive, \nmiddle-class jobs ideas here in Congress. As I have said before, we are \nnot here to protect the President from a good idea. If the President is \nwilling to work with us, there is much we can get accomplished for the \nAmerican people.\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\n  We have already identified several areas of potential cooperation, \nsuch as tearing down trade barriers in places such as Europe and the \nPacific, building jobs with comprehensive progrowth tax simplification, \nand working to prevent cyber attacks. On each of these issues, the \nPresident has previously sent some positive signals. Now we need some \nconstructive engagement.\n  We will be looking for signs of that in the speech he delivers \ntonight.\n  What I hope is that he presents some positive, bipartisan ideas of \nhis own that can pass the Congress Americans just voted for. Give us \nnew ideas to prevent Iran from becoming a country with nuclear weapons \nor to confront the threats posed by terrorism or to remove regulations \nthat hurt struggling coal families. Challenge us with truly serious, \nrealistic reforms that focus on growth and raising middle-class \nincomes--reforms that don't just spend more money we don't have. And if \nthe President is ready for a new beginning beyond canceled health plans \nand partisan executive overreach, work with us to pursue an achievement \nthat history will actually remember. Reach across the aisle to allow us \nto save and strengthen Medicare. Cooperate with both parties to save \nSocial Security. The President should tell America his plan for \nresponsible reforms that aim to balance the budget and not just more \ntired tax hikes.\n  Achieving important reforms such as these would represent a win for \nhard-working families. It would deliver the kind of commonsense \nprogress Americans deserve.\n  So we welcome the President tonight. We look to his address with \ninterest. If the President is ready to play offense, then we urge him \nto join the new Congress in playing offense on behalf of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S250-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tonight President Obama will deliver his \nState of the Union Address to outline his plan to make life better for \nmiddle-income families and those struggling in our strengthening \neconomy. I have heard from both sides--Democrats and Republicans--the \nlament that even though many hard-working families are doing their best \nand businesses are more profitable because our workers are more \nproductive, a lot of families don't see it in their paychecks. They \nstruggle from paycheck to paycheck to pay for the basics in life. So we \nhave to ask ourselves: What will we do about this? Will we do anything?\n  I worry that the comments just made by the majority leader suggest \nthat he is relying on faith alone--faith in our free market system; \nfaith in the belief that if we have an expanding economy, which we do, \nand if we have profitability in corporations, which we do, that it will \ntranslate into a better standard of living for working families. Well, \nit may be an article of faith, but it is one that can be challenged \nbecause that is exactly what has been happening in America for years. \nThe economy has been growing, and we have seen an increase in jobs for \n58 straight months. At the same time, we have noted that working \nfamilies across America don't see any change in their lives. They don't \nsee any income change.\n  Then we look at the reality. The reality shows that the gap between \nthe rich and poor in America just grows larger and larger. We can talk \nseparately about the compensation for CEOs and corporations. It is \nreaching record levels--far beyond the excesses of previous moments in \nAmerican economic history.\n  What we are finding is that people at the very top of the corporate \nladder are taking out more money from the economy than the workers who \nare generating the profits they are gleaning. That is not right. The \nPresident is going to challenge us to get beyond faith in our free \nmarket system to good works by Congress. He is going to talk about \nspecifics--ideas the average family can understand and appreciate, such \nas the earned income tax credit. Here is an effort to say if you are \nworking, we will make sure that your tax burden gives you a break so \nthat you have additional money for your family to pay for daycare for \nthe kids, to make certain you can pay for the utility bills and the \nbasics of life. I have joined with Sherrod Brown of Ohio. We want to \ntry to make the earned income tax credit available to more and more \nworking Americans so we can supplement their income as they struggle to \nget by paycheck to paycheck. That is one of the first ideas we can \npursue.\n  The second initiative the President will address is college \naffordability. There are plenty of critics of the President's plan, but \nI think he has put his finger on reality. We can no longer be satisfied \nby saying it is the responsibility of our society to provide education \nfrom kindergarten through the grade 12. That doesn't reflect the \nreality of work today. In just a few years, more than a third of the \njobs across America will require a college degree. What are we doing to \nprepare the workforce in America for 21st century requirements when it \ncomes to education? Now, we know what is happening. More and more \nstudents are getting deeper and deeper in debt, and many are dropping \nout because of it. Those who finish and earn a diploma are saddled with \na debt which changes their lives. President Obama has said: Let us \nstart moving forward to make 2 years of community college a commitment \nin America for those students who are in need, No. 1, and No. 2, are \nwilling to meet the standards. And the standards are graduation within \n3 years.\n  I look at some of the comments made in criticism of this, and they \noverlook the second part of the President's proposal--that part which \ndemands that those students perform in order to receive assistance from \nour government in paying for community college.\n  We have to look at a new model in America--in Arkansas, in Illinois, \nand across America--that is a K-14 model. That is reality. Certainly, \nwe have to improve the K-12 performance. When two-thirds of community \ncollege students in many States, including my own, come to community \ncolleges not performing at the 12th grade level, there is work to be \ndone in the lower grades. But let's assume the obvious: If people want \na good-paying job in the future, they need additional training. The \naffordable place to go is a community college, and we ought to make \nthat a pathway that is affordable for every dedicated, hard-working \nstudent and their family.\n  That isn't all. The President also acknowledges and will acknowledge \ntonight the reality of the housing market. Since 2009, our housing \nmarket in America has been recovering from a recession. Home building \nhas more than doubled, yielding a lot of jobs for construction workers. \nHome prices are going back up. Millions of families whose home value \nwas less than what they owed on their mortgage are now turning the \ncorner. But for many Americans, buying a home is still out of reach. \nThe President plans to reduce the FHA mortgage insurance premiums which \nis going to help responsible Americans afford a home.\n  We need faith in our free market but good works by Congress when it \ncomes to these essentials. The President is also going to propose a \nHealthy Families Act. Here is something that gets to the reality of \nlife for working Americans. It would provide for businesses with 15 or \nmore employees up to 7 paid sick days each year. You might say to \nyourself: What is a business going to do with people taking 7 days off \nin sick leave?\n  What we found is if the employer will stand behind the employees when \nit comes to the basics such as sick leave, they will get more loyalty \nand more performance from those employees. That is a fair trade. It is \none the President will propose this evening.\n  I would say to the majority leader and those who share his position, \nfaith in the free market is a good thing but not enough. We need to \nstep in and make sure we have faith in working families, faith in the \nbelief that if they can improve their lot in life, if their struggle \npaycheck to paycheck is somehow lessened, we are all going to be better \noff for it. I support the President's message this evening and look \nforward to hearing it delivered.\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S251-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                  CUBA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. On a separate topic, late last night I returned from \nHavana, Cuba, with Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator Stabenow, Senator \nWhitehouse, Congressman Van Hollen, and Congressman Welch of Vermont. \nIt was a whirlwind trip.\n  In a matter of 2 days we had a number of visits with a variety of \ndifferent people in Havana. They included government officials. Bruno \nRodriguez, who is the Foreign Minister of the Cuban Government; we had \na lengthy meeting with him yesterday.\n  We had a meeting with about 10 different Ambassadors to Cuba from \nforeign countries. We met as well with a dozen reformers or dissidents, \nopponents of the current Castro regime in Cuba, and had individual \nmeetings with ministries. This was a productive and important \ndelegation trip, important because starting tomorrow we are going to \nhave face-to-face negotiations in Havana between the United States and \nCuba pursuant to President Obama's December 17 announcement. We are \nsetting out to change the foreign policy of the United States as it \nregards Cuba. It is time for change.\n  For over 50 years we have been committed to a policy of exclusion, \nbelieving if we had embargoes and blockades we could force internal \nchange in Cuba. The policy failed. The Castro brothers still reign, and \nlife in Cuba is not what we want to see.\n  What the President has said is let's engage them at a different \nlevel, a constructive level where we try to find ways to open the Cuban \neconomy and Cuban society. That, to me, is the best course. It isn't \njust a theory that is the best course, it has been proven.\n  When the Soviet Empire came to an end, what happened to the Warsaw \nPact nations allied with the Soviet Union? They opened their doors to \nthe West, they saw what they could anticipate to be part of their life \nin the future, and they made the conscious choice to move toward \ndemocracy, to move toward a free market economy. I think the same can \nhappen in Cuba.\n  One young man came to speak to us. He had gotten in trouble because \nhe challenged the Cuban Government. They put him back on a pig farm to \nwork, but he was still determined to aspire to a better place in Cuba \nin the future. He said to us: What President Obama's announcement has \ndone is to pull the blanket off the caged bird in Cuba. Those of us who \nlive in Cuba are still in the cage of communism, but we can see out now \nabout opportunities and a future. That, I believe, is part of what the \nPresident's new policy is all about.\n  When we were discussing our current blockade with Cuba with their \nleadership, we learned that powdered milk comes to Cuban citizens from \nNew Zealand--halfway around the world--when there is an ample supply in \nthe United States. What we are trying to do is to not only open the \nCuban economy to powdered milk but to the power of ideas, the exchange \nof values, the belief that if the Cuban people see a better model for \ntheir future, they will gravitate toward that model.\n  This negotiation which opens this week is the beginning of this \nconversation. The President is moving in areas of trade and travel, as \nwe hope he will do, to expand these opportunities, but we have to do \nour part in Congress. As contentious and spirited as the debate may be \nabout changing our policy in Cuba, it wasn't that long ago that we \nstood on the floor of the Senate and considered establishing diplomatic \nrelations with Vietnam. There were some with fresh memories of all we \nhad lost, over 40,000 American lives in Vietnam, who said we shouldn't \nhave a normal relationship with what is a repressive regime in a \ncountry we just concluded a war with. Others with cooler minds \nprevailed, and we established diplomatic relations and I think to the \nbetterment of both nations.\n  Let us move forward, not forsaking our principles, not turning our \nback on our belief that the Cuban society should be more open, fair, \nand legitimized by the voters at the polls but believing we can work \nwith this country as we have with others around the world, even when we \ndisagree with their form of government and their practices, to try to \nstrive to reach that democratic ideal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S251-2", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S251-S252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The last point I would like to make relates to a motion \nthat was made this morning by the majority leader. It was related to \nthe appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. Why \nare we bringing up this appropriations bill at this moment? Because \nwhen we agreed last December to fund our government, the Republicans in \nthe House insisted we carve out the Department of Homeland Security and \nnot give it its regular budget, instead give it emergency spending, a \ncontinuing resolution.\n  This is not the way to run any department of government, certainly \nnot the Department of Homeland Security. Why is it important to fund \nthis department? One need only look to what has happened in the last \nfew days in Paris to understand that the threat of terrorism to the \nworld is still very real. One of our first lines of defense when it \ncomes to terrorism is our Department of Homeland Security. There is no \nexcuse for us to be dealing with this continuing resolution to fund \nthis department. They should have the resources they need to keep \nAmerica safe, but instead what has happened is this: The House of \nRepresentatives last week said they will only agree to fund this \ndepartment properly if they can provide certain riders and changes in \nthe law as part of it.\n\n  I would tell you that the change that has been proposed by the House \nof Representatives is unacceptable. The President has said he is going \nto veto it if it is sent to his desk, and I totally support his \nposition.\n  Here is what they have come up with in the House of Representatives. \nIf you are familiar with the DREAM Act, which I introduced in Congress \n14 years ago, it says: If a young person is brought to the United \nStates at an early age, parents making the decision to come to this \ncountry, and that young person grows up in the United States, finishes \nhigh school, no serious criminal problems, willing to go forward to \nhigher education or to the military, we will give them a chance of \nbecoming legal in America. That is the DREAM Act. It has been \nconsidered and passed on the floor of the Senate, considered and passed \non the floor of the House but never in the same session, and so it is \nnot the law of the land.\n  President Obama, a little over 2 years ago, came out with an \nExecutive order program known as DACA. DACA said to these young people \nwho would qualify under this law: If you will come forward and register \nwith our government, if you will pay the filing fee, if you will allow \nus to do the background check, we will allow you to stay, go to school, \nand work in America and not be deported. Six hundred thousand young \npeople have come forward. We estimate there are some 2 million \neligible, and 600,000 have come forward. Thirty thousand are from my \nState of Illinois. Who are these young people?\n  Let me introduce you to one of them, Oscar Vazquez. Oscar Vazquez \ngrew up in Phoenix, AZ. His mother and father brought him to that city \nfrom Mexico, and he was undocumented. He attended Carl Hayden High \nSchool in Phoenix. He was a member of the Junior ROTC. His goal was to \nserve in the U.S. Army.\n  When he went to the recruiter to sign up, the recruiter said: I need \nyour birth certificate.\n  Oscar said: Come on. We are fighting a war. Can't you look the other \nway and just let me join?\n  He said: No, young man. You don't have the proper documents. You \ncan't enlist in the U.S. Army.\n  He was despondent because that was his goal. He went home and got \nengaged in another project which is the subject of a new movie called \n``Spare Parts,'' which George Lopez produced, directed, and starred in, \nwhich I saw last week. I will not give away the whole story, but I can \ntell you this: Oscar Vazquez and three other students at Carl Hayden \nHigh School entered into an underwater robotics competition. They \ncompeted with colleges such as MIT and they won. Their high school team \nwon the underwater robotics competition.\n  The talented young man, Oscar, said: I am going to Arizona State \nUniversity. Without any government assistance, he graduated with a \ndegree in mechanical engineering. After he got his degree and a wife \nand a baby, he\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\nsaid: Now I have to get right with America. I have to resolve this \nissue of being undocumented.\n  That means Oscar decided to move back to Mexico. He was living in \nMexico--the law required him to stay there for 10 years. That is how \nthe law is written. He petitioned the United States for a chance to \ncome back in. Eventually he was given a waiver. Oscar Vazquez came \nback, became a citizen of the United States of America, and the first \nthing he did was enlist in the U.S. Army. He went into combat in \nAfghanistan, and he came home after having served our Nation honorably \nand now is working for a major railroad in the State of Montana, with \nhis wife and children.\n  That is the story of one DREAMer, one DREAMer who was given a chance \nand has made a difference in America. He not only served in our \nmilitary, but he had a degree in mechanical engineering. He is going to \nbe a job creator, a job builder himself.\n  So what do the House Republicans want to do to people such as Oscar \nVazquez? Deport them. That is exactly what they called for. They are \ndream killers. That isn't right. We ought to give Oscar, young men and \nwomen just like him a chance to succeed and a chance to make America \nbetter.\n  I have stood on this floor over 50 times with color photographs such \nas this one by my side and told the stories of DREAMers. This last \nweekend I was in Chicago and six of them came forward and told their \nstories. Each and every one of them had a compelling reason for us to \ndefeat this mean-spirited amendment that came out of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  The President will veto it if it gets to his desk, but I hope we will \ndo better in the Senate. I hope there are enough Senators on both sides \nof the aisle, 60-plus, who will stand up for the DREAMers of America. \nThis is a test. It is a test as to whether we believe in fairness and \njustice and the value that immigrants such as Oscar Vazquez bring to \nthe future of America.\n  The House of Representatives just doesn't see it. They are blinded by \ntheir hatred for these immigrants, and they continue to pass these \nmean-spirited amendments. We can do better. We must do better as a \nnation. Let us stand up for the DREAMers, and let us all be dedicated \nto passing comprehensive immigration reform. Our immigration laws are \nbroken. Our system is broken. It is time for us to accept our \nresponsibility and repair it.\n  We passed a bill a year and a half ago on the floor of the Senate \nwith 68 votes--14 Republicans--Republicans and Democrats voted for it \nand sent it over to the House of Representatives and it languished for \na year and a half. They refused to even call it or consider it. Our \nimmigration system is still broken. Withholding money from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, threatening with these riders that are \ndream killers for so many young people in America, that is \nunacceptable.\n  I will stand on this floor as long as it takes to defend this DREAM \nAct and people such as Oscar Vazquez, who contribute to America and \nmake it a better nation. I hope we will have bipartisan support for \ndefeating the House of Representatives' riders that have been branded \nby the President as unacceptable and he will veto.\n  I yield floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S252-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, people who work in politics sometimes \nsuffer a bad image. People who run for office, obviously, sometimes \nsuffer a bad image. But sometimes even worse is the image that what we \ncall the political handlers have--those people who have made a career \nof professionally helping people get elected. They are seen as \nruthless, as hired guns, as aggressive, even soulless, unprincipled. I \nam here to talk about one of those political operatives, but this \npolitical operative was special. This political operative was my \nfriend. He was principled, he was brave, but most of all he was a \npatriot. Pat Gray passed away very recently and he will be missed.\n\n  Pat grew up in Oklahoma. After serving 4 years in the Navy, he moved \nto Kansas City where he took a job with the Kansas City Power and Light \nCompany. He also became very active in the Jaycees. He found that work \nas part of the Jaycee organization was exhilarating. He had his first \ntaste of working on campaigns to improve the community and he was \nhooked.\n  Very quickly he moved into advertising. That advertising job then \nmorphed into working on political campaigns. Pat made his bones in 1982 \nas a political consultant when he took on the city incumbent county \nexecutive in Jackson County, MO. Jackson County is the county where the \nperson who used to have this desk is from, Harry Truman. Jackson County \nis the county that contains Kansas City.\n  It was then and still is a place where Democrats do well. So for Pat \nGray to take on a candidate to be a sitting incumbent county executive \nwas quite brave because, as I am sure the Presiding Officer \nunderstands, politics is rough locally. When someone takes on a \npowerful person in the predominating party in a community, there is \nusually a price to pay, but Pat was not deterred. His candidate, Bill \nWaris, beat that sitting county executive, Dale Baumgardner, in 1982.\n  The following year Pat was hired in an important mayoral campaign \nwhere he was also successful, electing the Kansas City mayor. Pat was \nlow key, but he was aggressive. Pat had little ego but lots of laser-\nlike strategy. He was very easy going, but he was very hard on his \nopponents. As one Kansas Citian put it after Pat had passed away: Pat \nslid into second with his spikes in the air. So you either had to make \na very good throw or get out of the way.\n  That was his style, very hands-on. He wanted to win badly. Pat was \ninstrumental in electing the first woman as Jackson County executive, \nthe first woman as Jackson County prosecutor--my campaign for that \noffice in 1992--and the first woman as mayor of Kansas City.\n  He helped to elect mayors, legislators, city council members, too \nmany for me to name, too many campaigns, too many candidates. Nine out \nof ten times he was successful. He helped me throughout my career. I \nremember vividly in 1990, when I was running for the county \nlegislature, his coming to my home in Coleman Highlands with a camera \nand shooting a commercial with me sitting on my living room couch, just \nthe two of us. He became a trusted advisor and my dear friend until his \ndeath.\n  As I stand at the very desk Harry Truman used in the Senate, I stand \nhere in part because of his help and his loyalty. I will be reaching \nfor the phone to call Pat Gray countless times in the coming years. \nWhile he helped many candidates, including me, it was on community \nissues that his record was particularly impressive. The e-tax renewal \nin Kansas City, which many thought had no chance, Pat successfully \nsteered; the renewal and invigoration of our sports complex in Kansas \nCity, the home of the division champion Kansas City Royals and our \nKansas City Chiefs. Pat Gray strategized a brilliant campaign to \nrevitalize downtown Kansas City through the building of a major sports \narena, which has now resulted in blocks and blocks of revitalization. \nIn fact, real estate in Kansas City--residential real estate in \ndowntown Kansas City--is now a hot ticket in large part because of Pat \nGray; the very first area transportation tax, which gave a lifeline to \nthousands of Kansas Citians in the urban center, allowing them to find \nthat way to get to work; a property tax for indigent care at Truman \nMedical Center.\n  Can you imagine anything that might be more difficult to pass? Asking \npeople to pay more property taxes to help care for the poor who were \nturning up in the emergency room at our major local hospital, Pat Gray \ndid that; additional tax moneys for both police and\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\nfire and an issue very near and dear to my heart. He helped me renew \nthe community antidrug tax in Kansas City, which has been so \ninstrumental in doing research and development on the antidrug \nstrategies that work--not just more police, not just more prosecutors, \nnot just more jail space but also prevention and treatment. Pat Gray \nwas there helping me as we started one of the very first drug courts in \nthe country in Kansas City, as a result of his help with the COMBAT tax \ninitiative.\n  Pat adored his family. His wife Brenda always patient and smiling, he \nreally adored Brenda. She climbed into the roller coaster with Pat Gray \nin the late 1970s. While she had to hold on hard during part of the \nride, there was never any question that they were a team and she was \nhis rock.\n  His children, Christopher, Donna, and Lauren, he was their guiding \nlight and they were his pride and joy. Pat loved this country. He loved \nhis family. He loved his city. He loved his friends and he loved his \nwork. But most of all, he loved this country.\n  Pat's biggest secret, as a sometimes rough-and-tumble political \nbrawler: he was an idealist who was inspired every day by our grand and \nglorious democracy. He had deep respect for the system he worked \nwithin. He understood that in America a good idea is sometimes enough; \na good idea helped along by a professional consultant who was a \npatriot.\n  We will miss you, Pat Gray. We will miss you, Pat Gray, the patriot.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I rise in support of two \namendments that will make it clear to the American people exactly what \nthis bill to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline is all about and whom \nour Republican friends from across the aisle are trying to help.\n  The amendments offered by Senators Markey and Franken would ensure \nthat the pipeline benefits the American consumer and the American \neconomy. Without them, the bill to authorize the pipeline will benefit \nnarrow special interests, such as foreign oil companies, not hard-\nworking Americans.\n  We have heard from several of my friends on the other side of the \naisle, including the lead sponsor, that the Keystone bill is a jobs \nbill and an energy bill. That may be true, but without Senator Markey's \namendment it is nothing but a Canadian energy bill, and without Senator \nFranken's amendment it is a paltry jobs bill.\n  First, on energy, in short, the Keystone bill will allow one Canadian \ncompany to use the United States as a middleman to ship oil to the \nhighest bidder abroad. The Canadian oil company, TransCanada, refuses \nto commit to keeping the crude oil or the refined products in America. \nCanadian tar sands oil is already traveling through gulf coast \nrefineries on its way to foreign markets, and, as the Wall Street \nJournal has reported, much of the crude oil that would flow through the \nKeystone XL Pipeline would ultimately be exported as refined product.\n  Why not add to this bill a requirement that any oil products \ntransported through the Keystone XL Pipeline be consumed in America? \nPlain and simple, that is exactly what Senator Markey's amendment would \ndo. If Republicans are serious about improving our energy security, \nthey will support Senator Markey's amendment.\n  Second, let's talk about whether this is a real jobs bill. \nRepublicans and supporters of the project like to cite that building \nthe pipeline will support American industries and American jobs in iron \nand steel, but a 2011 analysis by Cornell University found that 50 \npercent or more of the steel pipe will be manufactured outside the \nUnited States.\n  It is no wonder that even the most optimistic job projections about \nthe Keystone Pipeline are a drop in the bucket compared to just 1 month \nof job growth in our country. In the final tally, the State Department \nreport says it will create only 35 permanent jobs.\n  Why not guarantee in the bill that U.S.-made iron, steel, and \nmanufactured goods be used to build the pipeline? That is exactly what \nDemocrats have offered in an amendment worked out by Senators Franken \nand Wyden.\n  These amendments should be bipartisan. Republicans have supported \nseveral measures in the past. I know many of my Republican colleagues \nvoted to ban the export of oil drilled in the ANWR in Alaska. I hope \nthey will join us on this amendment as well.\n  If Republicans oppose us, they will be making it crystal clear to \nAmericans that they are on the side of narrow special interests instead \nof on the side of America's middle class. They will be supporting \nspecial interests over American jobs.\n  Let me be clear. We think the Keystone Pipeline should not be built, \nand there are several reasons for that, among them that the pipeline \nmay accelerate global climate change. Tar sands oil is far dirtier than \nconventional crude oil. Democrats would much rather see an energy bill \nthat promotes clean energy sources such as solar and wind, industries \nwhich create far more jobs, both construction and manufacturing, using \nfar cleaner energy than the pipeline.\n  Why not have a policy that produces many more jobs with the cleanest \nof energy rather than very few jobs with the dirtiest energy on the \nNorth American continent?\n  But if Keystone is going to be built, we think it shouldn't only \nbenefit Canadian oil companies and overseas steel manufacturers but \nshould actually benefit average families and the American worker.\n  To conclude, I note that instead of a real energy bill or a real jobs \nbill or a real infrastructure bill or immigration or any bill to \naddress the greatest problems facing our country at the moment--the \ndecline in middle-class incomes and the lack of middle-class jobs--for \ntheir first proposed action in the 114th Congress, S. 1, Republicans \nhave chosen a permit for a foreign oil company that would create 35 \npermanent jobs. This is not an opening with a bang; this is an opening \nwith a whimper. It is like leading off a new baseball game with a bunt.\n  Democrats can't change what bills Republicans put on the calendar, \nbut our amendments will show a clear and stark contrast if Republicans \nvote no. On these amendments and more, Republicans are going to have to \nmake a choice: Will they continue to fight for narrow special interests \nor will they work with Democrats to advance America's middle class by \ncreating more jobs and putting more money in the pockets of American \nfamilies? Time and these votes will tell.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President.

Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States \nwill lay out his agenda for the year, but unfortunately it sounds as if \nmuch of it will be a rehash of the same stale, top-down ideas Democrats \nhave been trotting out for the past 6 years: more taxes, more spending, \nmore regulation--in other words, more government. If Democrats could \nsum up their agenda in one phrase, it would be ``government knows \nbest.'' But the past 6 years have very clearly demonstrated that \ngovernment does not know best. The past 6 years of the Obama economy \nhave not been kind to American families.\n  It is time for new ideas. It is time to change the focus from \nbuilding up government to building up people. Americans need more jobs, \nbetter wages, and lower costs for health care, education, and energy, \nand the Republicans' priority is meeting those challenges. We want to \nrebuild the economy from the ground up and increase economic \nopportunity for every American.\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\n  Tonight the President will talk about helping middle-class families, \nand Republicans are pleased to see the President pivoting back to \nmiddle-class concerns--something Republicans have never looked away \nfrom. We hope President Obama is serious about wanting to work with \nRepublicans to address the challenges facing the middle class, but it \nis a little hard to take the President seriously when he is talking \nabout helping middle-class families while simultaneously issuing veto \nthreats for bills that would benefit them.\n  Within the past 2 weeks, the President has issued veto threats for \ntwo bills that would help create jobs for middle-class families--a bill \nto fix ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek provision, which is affecting \nemployees' hours and wages, and a bill to approve the Keystone \nPipeline. The House passed both of these bills earlier this month, and \nthe Senate is currently in the process of considering the Keystone \nlegislation. If it weren't for the President's veto threat, Keystone XL \ncould be approved in the next few weeks, but thanks to the President, \nthe future of the pipeline is still in doubt.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline is supported by bipartisan majorities in \nboth Houses of Congress. Six of the Senate Keystone bill's original \nsponsors are Democrats. The American people support the pipeline. \nUnions--a traditionally Democratic constituency--support the pipeline \nbecause their members want the jobs the pipeline would create. In fact, \na number of unions sent letters just this month reiterating their \nsupport for the pipeline.\n  This is what James P. Hoffa, president of the International \nBrotherhood of Teamsters, said:\n\n       The Teamsters Union continues to believe that the Keystone \n     XL pipeline will contribute to enhanced energy security, \n     economic prosperity, and, of critical importance, the \n     creation of good-paying jobs.\n\n  Those aren't Republican talking points; that is a letter from James \nHoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n  Edwin D. Hill, president of the International Brotherhood of \nElectrical Workers, said something similar:\n\n       At a time when job creation should be a top priority, the \n     Keystone XL Pipeline project will put Americans back to work \n     and have ripple benefits throughout the economy. During \n     construction the project is expected to support at least \n     42,000 jobs and contribute $3.4 billion to the U.S. Gross \n     Domestic Product.\n\n  Again, that is from Edwin D. Hill, president of the International \nBrotherhood of Electrical Workers.\n  Yet, despite all this support, President Obama is willing to turn his \nback on American workers to appease the only people who seem to oppose \nthe pipeline; that is, members of the far-left environmental wing of \nthe Democratic Party.\n  Over the years, the President has offered various excuses for why he \nis not yet ready to approve the pipeline. He has cited environmental \nconcerns. The only problem with that, of course, is that the \nPresident's own State Department has stated the project will have \nminimal impact on the environment. The President has also cited the \ncourt case over the pipeline's Nebraska route as a reason for waiting \non the pipeline approval. Well, as of a week and a half ago that excuse \nis gone. The Nebraska Supreme Court has now upheld the pipeline's \nroute. The administration responded by reiterating the President's veto \nthreat.\n  President Obama has tried to minimize the impact of the pipeline \ndelays by diminishing the importance of the jobs the pipeline would \ncreate. He has repeatedly mentioned that most of the jobs the pipeline \nwould create would be temporary. Well, tell that to a construction \nworker who is looking for a job. Does the President oppose all \ninfrastructure projects because some of the jobs they create are \ntemporary? Or does he just oppose projects when the jobs they create \nare opposed by the fringe elements of his party?\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline will be a boon to our economy and to \nAmerican workers. The President's own State Department has stated that \nthe pipeline would support more than 42,000 jobs during construction \nand contribute $3.4 billion to the economy. In my home State of South \nDakota the pipeline will support 3,000 to 4,000 jobs during \nconstruction and generate over $100 million in earnings, according to \nthe President's State Department. These are not my figures. These are \nfigures from the President's own State Department.\n  Keystone will bring in millions of dollars in State and local taxes \nfor a host of local priorities--from schools to law enforcement to \nroads and bridges. In addition to providing jobs and generating revenue \nfor State and local governments, the Keystone XL Pipeline will also \nhelp America's farmers get their goods to the market. Rail backlogs \nthis fall left too many farmers struggling to ship their harvests. \nKeystone XL would help alleviate future backlogs by taking 100,000 \nbarrels of North Dakota and Montana oil off the rails, which would free \nup substantial space for farmers and for other rail shippers.\n  Finally, the Keystone XL Pipeline will strengthen our energy security \nby reducing our dependence upon energy supplies from volatile \ncountries. This increased energy security will also keep energy prices \nlow for American families. Recent gas price reductions are largely due \nto increased North American energy development which has reduced our \ndependence on oil from countries such as Venezuela, Russia, and Iran. \nThe Keystone XL Pipeline will help us continue to replace oil imports \nfrom volatile countries with our own oil and imports from our friend \nand ally Canada. That in turn will help keep American families' energy \nbills low. With energy bills accounting for more than a quarter of \nafter-tax income for families making less than $30,000, lowering \nAmericans' energy costs should be a priority.\n  It is time for the President of the United States to fish or cut \nbait. Approving the Keystone XL Pipeline should be a no-brainer. \nRepublicans support it, Democrats support it, unions support it, and \nthe American people support it. The pipeline would create jobs. It \nwould increase revenue for local governments. It would strengthen our \nenergy security, and it would do all of this--all of this--without \nspending a dime of taxpayer money.\n  President Obama can talk all he wants tonight about helping American \nworkers and middle-class families, but it is his actions that will show \nwhether he really means what he says.\n  If the President is serious about helping middle-class families, if \nhe is serious about standing with American workers, then he will \napprove the Keystone XL bill when it gets to his desk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S254-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S254-S255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STATE OF THE UNION\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, tonight we will gather in the House \nChamber to listen to the President's State of the Union Address. This \nwill be the first time in Barack Obama's Presidency that he delivers a \nState of the Union Address to a Republican-led House and Senate. Some \nsee this as a prescription for gridlock. Others, including myself, see \nthis as an opportunity for the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch to work together to actually get some things done. There is \nrecent precedent that shows this arrangement can work. In fact, it is a \nperiod of our history where an Arkansan played a huge role.\n  During the final 6 years of Bill Clinton's Presidency, he faced the \nsame situation as our current President. He worked with Republicans to \nreform the welfare system. He worked with Republicans to balance the \nbudget--an accomplishment that hasn't been repeated since. He worked \nwith Congress--not tried to go around them.\n\n  Now, I don't expect us to always agree. There are stark ideological \ndifferences between President Obama and our Republican majority for \nwhich there is really no agreement to be had without one side or the \nother abandoning their principles, and certainly I do not intend to do \nthat. I don't see the President doing that either. What I do hope is \nthat the President will find common ground with not only Congress but \nthe American people. When that happens, work gets done here.\n  Even in the last Congress, with a Democratic majority in the Senate \nblocking almost everything in an effort to protect President Obama, we \nstill had flashes of bipartisan agreement. We agreed on the new farm \nbill, which\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\nensures the continued safety, affordability, and reliability of our \nfood supply while achieving real savings in Federal spending. We \nreformed the VA to address the horrific wait times our veterans face \nwhile trying to receive the health care they earned. And we passed a \nspending agreement that brings discretionary spending to its lowest \nlevel in almost a decade and has a number of provisions that adhere to \nconservative principles.\n  Both parties did not get everything they wanted in any of these \ninstances, but the final product was the result of individuals coming \nfrom different starting points and arriving at the same finish line. \nThat is what the American people want, but that takes an honest \ncommitment from all parties involved.\n  One way the President can show he is really ready to work with \nCongress is to abandon his misguided plan to circumvent Congress and \ngrant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. I anticipate that \nPresident Obama will try tonight, once again, to defend his actions by \nblaming Congress for not passing immigration reform. The truth is \neveryone in this Chamber is eager to tackle immigration reform.\n  The President is acting unilaterally because he knows Congress does \nnot support his amnesty proposal. He knows the final product of our \nwork will not include that provision. So he intends to go around \nCongress to get his way. Now the President seems intent to dig his \nheels in deeper by threatening to veto our efforts to defund his \nactions. This is just one of the veto threats President Obama has \nalready issued just weeks into the new Congress. This start doesn't \nbode well for bipartisanship.\n  I hope tonight's speech is light on the veto threats and heavy on the \nareas where we can find common agreement. I think those are plentiful, \nand I sincerely believe it is possible.\n  A fair and simple tax system, creating jobs, and making Washington \nmore efficient, effective and accountable--these are the issues that \nAmericans want us to address and areas where compromise is possible. \nThat is where our focus should be and what the country wants--not just \nwhat the President wants.\n  If everyone comes to the table ready to work, I think we can surprise \neveryone with what we can achieve. But it will take Presidential \nleadership. An Arkansan showed it can be done. President Obama should \nlook to the example of President Clinton for how to move forward and to \nwork with a Republican Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are back on the bill before us, a \nmeasure that would allow for the permit to be approved to allow for \nconstruction of the Keystone XL Pipeline from Canada into the United \nStates. We had good discussion last week, certainly on Friday.\n  We have several amendments that are pending before the body. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has one on oil exports, Senator Portman on \nenergy efficiency, and there is another measure sponsored by Senator \nFranken relating to American steel. Obviously, it is important that we \nbegin to process these amendments because we have a significant amount \nof interest in the issues in front of us. At this point in time there \nare--we had over 50 filed amendments as of Friday evening. As of this \nmorning, we maybe have more on deck. There is clearly a great deal of \ninterest not only on Keystone XL but other energy-related amendments as \nwell.\n  As we work through finalizing the events for this afternoon, I would \nlike to alert Members that we would like to have votes on at least the \nthree pending amendments that are before us that I just mentioned, \nhopefully by midafternoon. We are aware the Senate will close early \ntoday because of the President's State of the Union this evening. So my \nhope is that we would be able to process these three.\n  It has come to our attention that Senator Portman's amendment may \nneed to be modified. He is in the process of doing that, and it may be \nthat we will be able to accept that amendment this afternoon by voice \nvote.\n  At this point in time, I would encourage Members to come to us as the \nfloor managers here, and let's figure out how we can get these \namendments pending before the Senate. On the Republican side we have \nthree folks who are queued up ready to offer theirs when it is \nappropriate. As we had agreed last week, we will go from side to side \nin terms of the amendments that will be considered. Hopefully this will \nbe the beginning of a good, constructive week as we turn to regular \norder here in the Senate processing amendments.\n  With that, I would turn to my colleague on the energy committee, \nSenator Cantwell, for any comments she might care to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, just to reiterate our opposition to this \nlegislation, new polling has come out showing that the American public \nreally does--over 60 percent--support going through a normal process \nand not subverting what are environmental laws. But we are going to \nmove forward in getting this legislation voted on. My colleague just \noutlined a process for this afternoon. So I would encourage Members to \ncome to the floor to offer their amendments. I know Senator Franken is \ncoming to speak on his amendment, and I see the Senator from \nMassachusetts here to speak on his amendment. So hopefully while they \nare speaking we can get a vote schedule firmed up and talk about other \namendments besides the three we have pending. But I would agree with \nthe Senator from Alaska that Members should come down here and talk on \ntheir amendments and we should keep the process moving.\n  With that, I am not sure who is queued up to speak.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe the sponsor of this \nlegislation, Senator Hoeven, would like to address the Chamber for a \nfew minutes this afternoon not only on the amendments that are pending \nbut the bigger picture of Keystone XL.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. May I inquire of the Senator from Alaska and Senator \nHoeven how long he intends to speak to make sure our colleague from \nMassachusetts knows he has his time before we get locked out for lunch?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, my inquiry would be: How much time does \nthe Senator from Massachusetts need? I would be willing to defer my \ntime until later, as long as I know I would have approximately 10 \nminutes before the hard break of 12:30 p.m.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would think that if it is OK to allow \nthe Senator from Massachusetts to proceed, knowing that our hard stop \nis 12:30 p.m., that at least--I would make this request: that both \nSenators be allowed to speak for 10 minutes, starting\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\nwith Senator Markey, followed by Senator Hoeven. If they want to extend \ntheir remarks, they can make a unanimous consent request to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. May I ask a parliamentary inquiry. It would be this. Is \nit possible for me to speak for 5 minutes, then reserve the remainder \nof my time and have the Senator from North Dakota speak, and then I can \nreclaim the remainder of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will take unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are about to engage in a historic \ndebate; that is, over whether the Canadians--a Canadian oil company--\nshould be allowed to take the dirtiest oil in the world, the Canadian \ntar sands oil, to have the United States accede to the construction of \na pipeline, like a straw through our country, which would then go down \nto the Gulf of Mexico, with no promise from the Canadians that they \nwill not export the oil from the United States.\n  So the issue which is raised, of course, is what is in it for the \nUnited States, since there is a very small number of jobs for our \ncountry once the pipeline is completed? We understand why the Canadian \ncompany wants to do this. If they can get that oil out onto the global \nmarketplace, using the United States as the conduit, they can get a \ndramatically higher price for that oil. We understand their motivation. \nBut what is in it for the United States of America?\n  Ultimately, we have to decide what is in our best interests. My \namendment says that if this pipeline is constructed, the oil stays \nhere, our country gets the benefit, and our consumers get the benefit. \nOtherwise, it is not about energy independence; it is not about North \nAmerican energy independence. It is about a Canadian company exporting \nthe oil, using the United States as a conduit, as a straw, as a \npipeline. That is it. What is in it for us?\n  The American people right now are enjoying historically low oil \nprices. They love it. It is like a tax cut to every American. If this \nCanadian oil gets exported, you better believe it is going to act as a \nspur to raise the price of oil. The more oil that is here, the better \nfor us. The more oil that leaves our country, the worse for us.\n  I will give you another number, if you want to know, because this is \na Canadian export pipeline. The United States of America right now is \nthe leading importing country for oil in the world. We are No. 1. We \nimport net about 5 million barrels of oil a day. We are No. 1. We are \nthe No. 1 importing country. Then comes China, then comes India, then \nJapan. Five million barrels a day--how can we be exporting oil when we \nare the leading importer of oil?\n  What countries do we import the oil from today, 2015? We import the \noil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, from Iraq, from Russia, from \nNigeria. How can we be exporting our young men and women in uniform \nover to the Middle East in order to protect these ships coming in with \noil in them and simultaneously be exporting oil out of the United \nStates, while we are still importing 5 million barrels of oil a day?\n  That is what this debate is all about. It does not make any sense. \nThis is the dirtiest oil in the world. This oil is going to dangerously \nadd to the warming of the planet. The Canadian--the American Petroleum \nInstitute will not promise the oil stays here, even though their ads on \nTV say that it is all about North American energy independence.\n  So we have a huge choice we have to make here. Do we want to help our \neconomy? Do we want to help our national security, help our consumers, \nhelp our manufacturers by giving them this lower price of energy--which \nexcept for labor is the No. 1 component in industry in the United \nStates--and keep that price low? The Markey amendment says: Yes, that \noil stays here in the United States of America for our own strength, \nour own economy, our own consumers, our own job creation, and will not \nbe sent off onto the world so the Canadian oil company can get a much \nhigher price for that oil while we take all of the risk. We would not \nbe Uncle Sam, we would be Uncle Sucker if we did not keep that oil \nhere.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to engage in \na discussion with my colleague from Massachusetts on the important \nissues. He has raised several issues in regard to oil export and then \nalso in regard to the environmental aspects.\n  If I could take a minute to address both of those, for starters, I \nwould point out that it is interesting that the Senator, my good friend \nfrom Massachusetts, is opposed to this pipeline project and talks about \nour need to import oil, and therefore we should not allow any exports, \nbecause we need to import oil. Yet he is opposed to a project that \nwould not only bring Canadian oil to our country, 830,000 barrels a \nday, but also would help us move 100,000 barrels of oil a day from my \nState of North Dakota and my neighboring State of Montana--light sweet \nBakken crude. So he objects to that, and he talks about our need to \nimport oil. The irony here is that if he is successful and he and the \nother critics or opponents of this pipeline and the infrastructure are \nsuccessful, then what Canada will do is they will build a pipeline to \nthe west coast of Canada, and they will export that oil to China--100 \npercent of it.\n  So it appears that his argument is that because some portion of this \noil may be exported if we build the pipeline, somehow it is better to \nforce Canada to export 100 percent of it to China. Now, I do not begin \nto understand that argument. So if we cannot have 100 percent--every \nsingle drop--stay here, then we are better off to send all 100 percent \nto China. That is my opponent's argument. I do not understand it. It \ndoes not make sense to me.\n  The second point I would like to make is if he goes to the \nenvironmental impact statement issued by the Obama State Department, \nthe environmental impact statement says that the oil would be used in \nthe United States. If he looks at the Obama administration's Department \nof Energy report, he will see that the report also indicates that this \noil is going to be used in the United States.\n  Now, that does not mean that we use every drop of it. I will give you \nsome statistics. The United States retains 99 percent of all crude oil \nwithin the country that we produce. The United States uses 97 percent \nof the gasoline that we refine in this country. So, remember, this oil \ncomes to refineries in Patoka, IL, and to the gulf coast. It goes to \nCushing, and it gets refined.\n  The statistics are that we use 97 percent of that gasoline from oil \nthat is refined in our country. The other thing I would point out is \nthat the oil that comes in on this pipeline, along with the crude that \ncomes from the Bakken, is both Canadian and domestic oil. That cannot \nbe exported without approval from the Secretary of Commerce of the \nObama administration.\n  So here again, my good friend from Massachusetts is putting forth an \namendment that absolutely no oil in this one pipeline can be exported \nat any time to anywhere from the country, yet they already have \nprovisions in law that it cannot be exported without the Secretary of \nCommerce's approval. The Secretary of Commerce is appointed by \nPresident Obama.\n  So, again, if you look at the administration's own reports, and they \nhave been done over more than 6 years that this project has been \npending--the administration now has had 6 years to review this project, \nhas done so, and has produced five environmental impact statements. The \nconclusion of those environmental impact statements is ``no significant \nenvironmental impact.'' That is the administration's own environmental \nimpact statements produced by the State Department.\n  But after 6 years, they have come out and said: This oil will be used \nhere, and to be exported, it would have to be approved by the Secretary \nof Commerce, as other oil exports are handled in this country. \nFurthermore, if we do not build the pipeline, it is either all going to \nbe sent to China--so then we would not get any of it--or we are going \nto have to move it via railcars--1,400 railcars a day, creating more \ncongestion on our railways.\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\n  So at this point, I would inquire as to how much time I have used of \nmy 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. At this point, I would yield back to my good friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Senator very much. Year 2014 has just been \nreported by NASA as the single warmest year ever recorded in the \nhistory of the planet, going back to the earliest records. You do not \nhave to be a detective to figure out what is going on. The world is \ndangerously warming. The United States can no longer preach temperance \nfrom a bar stool and tell the rest of the world they should be better \nwhile we continue to burn these fuels.\n  But if they are going to build this pipeline, at least the American \npeople should be the beneficiaries of the Canadian activity to sell all \nof this oil out onto the global market. What we are being told is: No, \nwe do not want any restrictions. We do not want there to be any way in \nwhich we can keep that oil here, to keep prices at least low for the \nAmerican consumer and for American job creation, to keep oil here so we \ncan maybe back out the Saudi Arabian oil, maybe back out the Kuwaiti \noil, maybe back out the Russian oil that we are importing right now as \nwe sit here. But we are being told we cannot do that. We are being told \nthe Republican leadership thinks that is a bad idea.\n  When I asked the head of the TransCanada pipeline in the hearing if \nhe agree to keep the oil in the United States, he just looked at me and \nsaid no. So this is what is going on.\n  What happens for the American consumer? Well, I will tell you what \nhappens. It is a very simple formula. Every time there is a $10 \nincrease in the price of a barrel of oil, it knocks two-tenths of a \npoint to three-tenths of a percentage point off of the growth rate of \nthe American economy.\n  When Americans pay less for American oil and we import less foreign \noil, consumers have more money in their pockets from that discounted \nAmerican oil. That is like a direct economic stimulus for middle-class \nfamilies and small businesses across the country. Analysts say the drop \nin oil prices will give hundreds of billions back to consumers and \nother parts of our economy. Every penny reduction in gas prices \ntranslates into $1 billion in consumer savings.\n  So when the polling is done on this issue and the American people are \nasked if they would support the exportation of American oil, by a 3-to-\n1 margin people say, all across the country, regardless of party: No, \ndo not export it. Keep that oil here to make America stronger here at \nhome.\n  That is not Democrat. That is not Republican. That is not \nIndependent. That is all people being polled across the board.\n  That is just common sense because they know the more oil we export, \nthe higher the prices are going to be for consumers here because we \nhave less oil. This is a simple debate.\n  The planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms for \nplanets. We have to engage in preventive care. The Republican \nleadership thinks they have the votes in order to pass this bill which \nwill dangerously warm the planet. My amendment says if that is going to \nbe the case--and I am not voting for that bill--at least let's keep the \noil here, at least let's get the benefit for consumers so we keep \nprices low for gasoline, prices low for home heating oil, prices low \nfor jet fuel, prices low for diesel. Let's keep the oil here, let's get \nthe benefit in our economy, and let's not allow oil companies to set \nthe agenda.\n  The Republican leadership keeps saying it is all of the above. Ladies \nand gentlemen, this bill basically says: No. No, it is oil above all. \nThat is what it is all about. It is not even oil that is necessarily \ngoing to stay in the United States, so it is a very simple argument I \nam making.\n  We import 5 million barrels of oil a day. They come from the worst \nplaces in the world that we should be dependent upon--5 million barrels \na day. We export young men and women over to the Middle East to protect \nthat oil coming in. The least we owe to those young men and women is \nwhen we get a chance to reduce our dependence upon imported oil, we \ntake that chance, that we send that message to the rest of the world \nthat we understand our Achille's heel. We understand what makes us \nweak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. MARKEY. I thank the Presiding Officer, and I urge an ``aye'' vote \non the Markey amendment.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I appreciate this debate. It is an \nimportant debate to have. Clearly, the Senator from Massachusetts and I \nhave very different ideas about how this should be addressed, but this \nis the debate we should have. This is about the energy future we are \nbuilding for this country.\n  I am pleased we are engaged in this debate. Let's work to build the \nkind of energy plan that is going to truly make our country energy \nsecure.\n  To do that, we not only need to produce energy domestically, we need \nto work with our closest friend and ally, Canada. At the same time, as \nwe produce that energy, we need the infrastructure to move it to our \nmarkets rather than sending it overseas.\n  So it is ironic on the one hand the Senator is proposing an amendment \nsaying: Oh, no. If we get any of this oil, we have to have all of it. \nHe is making an argument that doesn't work in a global economy, where \nhe is saying if we can't have 100 percent of it every single day--not \none drop leaves--then export all of it. I want 100 percent or nothing.\n  That doesn't make sense.\n  The whole point is we have just finished showing that the oil will be \nused here, and for any of it to be exported we need the Secretary of \nCommerce's approval. But we have to talk about it in a larger context \nbecause this debate we are having isn't only about the Keystone \nPipeline, it is about the future of energy security for our country.\n  Are we going to work to produce oil and gas domestically? Are we \ngoing to work with Canada to bring their oil and gas that they produce \nas well to us, rather than having them export it to China, so we are \nenergy secure?\n  What I mean by that is we produce more oil and gas in North America \nthan we consume. When we do that we become energy secure. As far as \nthis argument about any kind of other source of energy or renewable, \nthat this somehow precludes it, it doesn't. Let's produce all those \nother energy sources as well. They are not mutually exclusive.\n  Preventing us from producing more oil and gas and working with Canada \nto produce more oil and gas so we don't have to get it from OPEC in no \nway excludes any other type of energy development. They are not \nmutually exclusive.\n  So, yes, let's do it all but don't block this effort to make us \nenergy secure in oil and gas so we don't have to depend upon OPEC. That \nis the real issue underlying this debate. That is why we have to build \nthis vital infrastructure. Right now when Americans go to the pump, \nthey are paying--I think I saw today the national average is about \n$2.05 for gasoline. Why is that?\n  As I have said before on this floor, it is not because OPEC decided \nto give us a Christmas present. When OPEC can, they will try to push \nthose gas prices right back up. The reason gas prices at the pump are \ndown now for all our consumers and for all our small businesses is \nbecause we are producing more oil and gas at home and we are getting \nmore from Canada.\n\n  The United States uses about 18 million barrels per day of oil. Right \nnow we produce about 11 million barrels in the United States. We import \nanother 3 million from Canada. That gets us up to about 14 million, so \nwe are down to only importing about 4 million a day.\n  If we continue to work with Canada and develop our own energy \nresources, pretty soon we will be at that point where we produce more \nenergy than we consume, but we have to have this discussion about \nneeding the infrastructure and also our ability to operate in global \nmarkets.\n  I will talk more about that, because if we produce more oil and gas, \nit puts downward pressure on oil prices on the world market. Most of \nthose world markets are priced off of Brent crude.\n  As we produce more oil, we not only help ourselves, we help our \nallies. So\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\nwe have to understand what it takes to build an energy plan and do it \nthe right way rather than blocking the very infrastructure and doing \nthe very things that have led to incredible benefits today for our \nconsumers at the pump.\n  If that were a tax cut, that reduction of more than $1 in the gas \nprices is $100 billion in our consumers' pockets. That is the impact.\n  So it is about jobs. It is about energy, it is about jobs, it is \nabout growing our economy, it is about national security--but not by \nblocking these efforts that are benefitting our consumers, making our \ncountry stronger, safer, and helping our allies but by continuing to \nmove forward with them.\n  I look forward to discussing that more and the environmental impact.\n  One more statistic before I turn to my good colleague from Nebraska. \nSince 1990, the greenhouse gas emissions from oil sands-produced oil \nhave gone down 28 percent, almost one-third, because in Alberta they \nare taking huge steps to continue to improve the environmental \nstewardship of this production.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I look forward to discussing that further. I think I have \ncontrol of the floor time until 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not controlled.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. All right. Under prior agreement, I turn to my colleague \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I see my colleague from Minnesota who wanted to speak \non his amendment which is pending, and I know our colleague from \nNebraska is here. She has been waiting, so I hope before we adjourn we \ncould accommodate both of them.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that we turn to my colleague from \nNebraska, and I would be willing to confer, as far as time, to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his comments.\n  Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor to speak on the great \nimprovements to our economy due to energy production.\n  The American oil and gas surge has created jobs across this country \nand renewed investments in infrastructure, transforming many unlikely \nStates and cities into energy hubs for fuel production.\n  Over the past 5 years alone the United States has increased our \ndomestic supply of oil and gas by 50 percent. In an amazing turnaround \nthe United States is now on track to overtake Saudi Arabia as the \nworld's top oil producer, resulting in the creation of thousands of \nAmerican jobs and greater savings for consumers.\n  The natural gas industry has also grown tremendously and in the \nUnited States has become one of the world's No. 1 producers.\n  Across this great Nation we are fortunate to have a diverse portfolio \nof energy resources, including coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, natural \ngas, and multiple renewable energy resources such as ethanol, wind, and \nsolar. These resources can be used to improve the lives of all \nAmericans.\n  American consumers are now blessed with multiple options to obtain \nthe affordable, reliable energy that is being produced in an \nenvironmentally responsible manner, but in order to maintain and grow \nour domestic energy security we need to have policies that support that \ngoal.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama has given only lip service to an ``all \nof the above'' energy strategy while pushing a counteragenda that has \nrestricted domestic production and energy choices. That costs Americans \nbillions of dollars.\n  Meanwhile, the EPA is taking this anti-American energy agenda to a \nnew level with proposals that jeopardize the affordability and \nreliability of electricity for all Americans.\n  The EPA's proposed rule for existing powerplants would force the \npremature retirement of efficient, low-cost coal-fueled generation, \nleading to the potential loss of billions of dollars of investments \nmade over the past decade to make coal plants cleaner.\n  These proposals would make it nearly impossible for the United \nStates--which possesses the world's largest reserves of coal--to \ncontinue to utilize this affordable and abundant energy source. \nNebraska's families and businesses, which depend on coal-fired \ngeneration for nearly two-thirds of their electric needs, are going to \nbe disproportionately penalized under this plan.\n  Under this administration the Federal Government has quashed energy \nprojects by slow-walking, politicizing, and rejecting routine permits \nto build energy infrastructure such as the Keystone Pipeline. This \nimportant project has the clear capacity to grow our economy and \nmaintain our energy security.\n  On this floor we have heard many comments during this debate about \nthe Nebraska Legislature and what was done with regard to the Keystone \nPipeline. Let me set the record straight. I was in the Nebraska \nLegislature at that time. In fact, the proposed pipeline route crosses \nmy former legislative district.\n  By the way, I am a cattle rancher. I live in the Nebraska Sandhills \nand I live over the Ogalalla Aquifer. The legislation was not coerced \nand the Nebraska Legislature was certainly not confused, as some of my \ncolleagues on the other side have implied.\n  The Nebraska Legislature is a very open and public process. Every \nbill--every single bill that is introduced--has a public hearing, and \nour citizens are welcome and encouraged to come to those public \nhearings to express their opinions before legislative committees.\n  We also have three stages of debate. We have three stages of debate \non every single bill before that final vote.\n  The Nebraska Legislature made decisions dealing with the pipeline \nsiting within our borders.\n  The bill passed on a 44-to-5 vote. I would also mention that the \nentire Nebraska congressional delegation--which does include a \nDemocratic Congressman from the Second Congressional District who also \nserved in the Nebraska Legislature--is united in our support for this \nbill. Last week this bill was called an opening gambit or spin by some \nof my colleagues.\n  For the vast majority of Nebraskans, this is about certainty. \nNebraskans want a decision made. This has been going on for 6 years. It \nis time for the President to make a decision.\n\n  I am also working on some commonsense amendments to improve the \narduous NEPA approval process and to protect private property energy \nproduction. I am also going to be offering amendments to set \ncommonsense limitations for Federal land designation.\n  I am excited about the opportunities we have to pursue policies where \nwe can champion the productive use of America's energy resources in \nthis Congress and where we will be able to capitalize on our country's \nenergy prosperity. I am excited and looking forward to an open \namendment process where we can do our jobs, where we can offer \namendments, where we can debate those amendments, and most importantly \nwhere we can vote because that is the only way we are held accountable \nto our constituents, the American people.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMurphy be recognized for up to 5 minutes following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I have \noffered with Senators Stabenow and Manchin, which is amendment No. 17 \nto S. 1. Our amendment recognizes the importance of the iron and steel \nindustries in our country and ensures that if the pipeline is built, it \nis built with American iron and steel so we can create more jobs and \nstrengthen our economy.\n  Congress has had a long history of using ``Buy American'' provisions \nin order to maximize the economic benefits of infrastructure projects. \n``Buy American'' provisions ensure that more goods and manufactured \nitems used in infrastructure and other projects are\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\nproduced here at home. In fact, as recently as 2013 Congress passed a \nprovision in the WRDA Act--the Water Resources Development Act--to \nrequire the use of iron, steel, and other domestically produced goods \nin water infrastructure projects. That is important because it means \nthat we keep jobs and profits here at home instead of sending them \nabroad.\n  Unfortunately, there is no such requirement when it comes to \nconstruction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In fact, according to \nTransCanada itself, half of the pipe for the U.S. portion of the \npipeline would be sourced from foreign countries. And for the other \nhalf that would be put together here in the United States, much of the \nraw material, such as the steel that goes into the pipe, could be \nsourced from overseas. This is the problem our amendment addresses. Our \namendment would require the use of domestic iron, steel, and other \nmanufactured goods in the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, \nprovided the material is readily available and affordable.\n  If adopted, the amendment would create jobs for iron ore miners, such \nas the ones across the Iron Range in my State of Minnesota. It would \ncreate more jobs for shippers who ship the ore across the Great Lakes \nor by rail or down the Mississippi River. It would create more jobs for \nour steelworkers who work in steel mills across this country.\n  At the same time, we specify in our amendment that these requirements \nwould be implemented consistent with our trade agreements.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said we \nshouldn't put such restrictions on a private company. But we have to \nremember that this isn't your typical private company. The underlying \nbill to authorize the pipeline would throw out the established approval \nprocess for the construction of a cross-border pipeline by a foreign \ncorporation. That means all of the important assessments regarding \nthings such as safety and the environment that our Federal agencies \nmight have made on this project are tossed by the wayside. So if \nCongress is going to intervene on behalf of this foreign company, then \nthe least we can do is to make sure the company building the pipeline \nuses American-made iron and steel.\n  This is a very pragmatic amendment. We all have different views on \nthe approval process for this pipeline, and while I believe Congress \nshould not circumvent the approval process we have in place, I think we \ncan all agree that we want jobs here in America. So I invite my \ncolleagues to stand up for our domestic iron and steel producers by \nsupporting my amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I come to the floor to support the amendment which is the pending \nbusiness on the floor today.\n  This is only my second session in the Senate, but I imagine that it \nmeans something to be Senate bill 1. It probably means something even \nmore to be Senate bill 1 in the new Republican-majority Senate. Why? \nBecause my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had 8 years in the \nminority to think about what should be the first bill, the No. 1 \npriority of this new Republican Senate, 8 years to think about every \nproblem American families are facing, to vet every possible solution to \nthese problems and decide what is going to be the first bill we are \ngoing to debate to make this country a better place. There were a lot \nof measures the new majority could have chosen. We could have been \nsitting here talking about a tax cut for the middle class or we could \nhave been talking about a proposal to make college more affordable. We \ncould have been talking about a proposal to grow small businesses all \nacross the country. But we are not talking about those things. After 8 \nyears of stewing over the problems America faces, Senate bill 1 is an \noil pipeline.\n  As my colleagues who are in opposition to the underlying bill have \nsaid, this isn't just any oil pipeline; this is a pipeline to ship \nforeign oil right through the heartland of the United States, most \nlikely on its way to foreign customers. And it is not just any oil; it \nis the dirtiest oil you can dream up.\n  Building this pipeline and increasing the development of tar sands in \nCanada is the pollution equivalent, according to one study, of putting \n4 million new cars on North American roads. But not to worry, say many \nof the proponents of the bill. Admittedly, many dispute some of those \nunderlying studies. But the real point here is jobs. It is about \ncreating jobs here in the United States.\n  This is a sight which is familiar to every single American. It is a \nMcDonald's franchise. On average, a McDonald's franchise employs about \n30 to 40 people. That is nothing to sneeze at. Thirty to forty people \nhaving jobs is a big deal. But the Senate doesn't normally worry itself \nwith debating the establishment of a new McDonald's franchise. It is a \nbig deal to a local community, but it is not something that necessarily \nmoves the needle in terms of the national economy. Yet the Keystone \nPipeline would create the same number of permanent full-time jobs as \nthe average McDonald's franchise. Yes, it creates construction jobs, \nand I don't want to discount the fact that it puts a lot of people to \nwork building the pipeline. But do you know what also puts people to \nwork? Building a new high school. Building a new rail line. Improving \nour crumbling infrastructure. That puts a lot of people to work as \nwell. In the end, the added value to the economy of a new school or a \nnew bridge or a new rail line dwarfs that of a pipeline which, without \nthe adoption of the Markey amendment to be offered later, will quite \npossibly just take the oil from one country and send it through the \nUnited States to another country--never mind all of the environmental \nside effects of continuing to develop this oil.\n  So I am going to oppose the underlying bill, but I am here to support \nSenator Franken's amendment because if we are going to approve this \npipeline, let's do everything we can to ensure that even though we are \nonly going to create 40 full-time jobs, that we are creating as many \npart-time jobs as possible. That is why it makes sense to require that \nthe iron and steel that are going into this pipeline come from America. \nAnd we know we need to pass this amendment because Keystone has already \npromised that half of the steel and half of the iron is going to come \nfrom overseas companies. Mr. President, 330,000 tons of pipeline is \ngoing to come from overseas companies.\n  This concept is not new. We do it all the time. We just passed the \nWRDA bill with bipartisan consensus. ``Buy American'' provisions were \nin there. The American Recovery Act--``Buy American'' provisions were \nin there. We have had laws on the books for a long time that apply \n``Buy American'' provisions to private companies that are doing \nbusiness in and around industries regulated or funded by the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURPHY. So this amendment will just make sure that at least in \nthe short-term we are going to put a few more Americans to work, even \nif we are not going to do anything about the rather paltry economic \nnumbers in the long run.\n  I am supporting the Franken amendment, and I encourage my colleagues \nto support it as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would like to make a couple of points. One is that in \nregard to this amendment, to my knowledge, they are talking about \nsituations where a project is publicly funded, funded with taxpayer \ndollars. In this case, I would point out by way of closing that this is \nroughly an $8 billion project, but it is privately financed. This isn't \na publicly funded project; it is financed by private companies and, in \nfact, will create hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue--State, \nlocal, and Federal Government level--to provide dollars back to the \ntaxpayers, with absolutely no tax increase.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S259-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S259-S260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand we \nare on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the bill.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, let me say that I rise in general opposition to the \nKeystone Pipeline, and I rise in favor of Senator Markey's amendment. \nAfter long and careful deliberation--and after having had the benefit \nof a hearing on the pipeline in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee--I have decided to oppose this bill for four basic reasons.\n  First, on the bill, I am deeply concerned that if approved this \npipeline will be the first of many pipelines opening one of the largest \nsources of carbon on Earth to exploitation.\n  Second, contrary to what many believe, I am convinced this pipeline \nwill simply not enhance, help or--in any positive way--improve our \nenergy profile.\n  Third, in my view, it is completely absurd for Congress to take the \nrole of permitting pipelines. It is a role we have never assumed and \nshould not assume now.\n  Fourth, I believe it is ridiculous that our Republican colleagues \ninsist on language banning eminent domain for national parks \nlegislation but oppose it when it comes to foreign or private projects \nsuch as Keystone.\n  Furthermore, we cannot underestimate the environmental impacts of \nthis pipeline. The facts are clear. The resource in Alberta is \nenormous; the tar sands formation is the size of Iowa; tar sands oil is \n17 percent more greenhouse gas intensive than other forms of oil \nbecause it takes an enormous industrial process to extract it.\n  It has been estimated that if this resource were fully exploited, it \nwould release more carbon dioxide in the air than the United States has \nemitted in its entire history.\n  As James Hansen, one of the foremost climate scientists in the world, \nhas said, building the Keystone pipeline would be ``game over for the \nplanet.''\n  There are also more local risks. Over the weekend, landowners are \nseeing the pipeline spill in the Yellowstone River in Montana. It is \nhappening right now, and landowners are wondering if their family farm \nwill be the victim of a similar spill, wondering if property that has \nbeen in their family for generations can still be farmed and passed on \nto the next generation.\n  While some jobs will be created by the pipeline, the fact is--after 2 \nyears of construction--it will create only 35 permanent jobs--35. That \nis not a lot of jobs.\n  If we want to create millions of permanent infrastructure jobs, I \nurge the supporters of the pipeline to support our efforts to increase \ntransportation funding. I urge them to continue incentives for clean \nenergy. I ask them to do all they can to help local governments rebuild \nlocal infrastructure systems. That is how we create permanent jobs that \nbuild our economy and help us keep our competitive advantage.\n  By comparison, the number of jobs created by Keystone is hardly an \nargument for passage of this legislation. As you all know, we also have \nthe issue of eminent domain--the power of any governmental entity to \ntake private property and convert it to public use subject to \nreasonable compensation.\n  Many, including some of my most conservative friends on the other \nside, were outraged by the idea that eminent domain proceedings could \nbe used to seize private property for private gain. I have been working \nvery closely with Senator Cantwell on an amendment, and we agree with \nour conservative colleagues that using eminent domain proceedings for \nprivate gain is pretty outrageous. Here, on the issue of Keystone, a \nforeign-owned company is using eminent domain to seize private property \nso it can better export Canadian oil--a foreign-owned company using \neminent domain to seize private property so it can better export \nCanadian oil. The project is not in the public interest but clearly in \nthe private interest. Senator Cantwell and I feel this amendment should \nbe a no-brainer--an easy amendment every Senator can support.\n  In recent years Republicans have insisted on similar language \nprohibiting the use of eminent domain when we establish national parks. \nIf eminent domain cannot be used to establish a national park in the \npublic interest to conserve our national treasures and preserve \nAmerica's beauty for future generations, then surely--surely--it should \nnot be used to benefit private interests; in this case, in the interest \nof a foreign-owned oil company seeking to ship its product around the \nworld, which brings me to the amendment of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 13\n\n  We know the oil that will flow through this pipeline will flow \ndirectly to foreign markets. That is why I support the amendment from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. Foreign oil is not subject to America's \ncrude oil export ban, but whether it is shipped as crude or refined \nhere and then exported, we all know this oil is not going to help the \nAmerican consumers.\n  The intent of the Markey amendment can be summed up very simply, \nusing an old adage that President Reagan was fond of: ``Trust but \nverify.''\n  For months now supporters of the Keystone XL Pipeline have been \ntelling us the tar sands that will travel through the United States \nwill help advance our energy security. They have been telling us the \npipeline will bring a reliable source of fuel from a close ally and \nthat it will reduce prices at the pump, helping U.S. consumers and \nbusinesses.\n  The Markey amendment does nothing more than confirm the promises \nmade--time and time again--by supporters of the pipeline. It would \nrequire the tar sands that travel through the United States stay in the \nUnited States. It says that if Americans are to accept all of the \ndownsides of the pipeline, if U.S. property owners are to have their \nlands taken away for TransCanada's benefit, if Americans are forced to \nlive with the risk of an oilspill of dirty tar sands that we do not \neven know how to clean up properly, then the very least we can do is \nget a guarantee in law that the United States will reap the benefits \nthat come with all of these risks.\n  So all this amendment does is put into writing the promises we have \nheard over and over again from supporters of the pipeline. It codifies \nin law what we previously had to take on faith.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for offering the amendment, \nand I would note he has a long history of working to improve America's \nenergy security. He and I have worked closely since he came to the \nSenate to protect the longstanding requirement that U.S.-produced crude \noil stay here at home to benefit the U.S. consumer rather than being \nshipped across the globe.\n  This amendment is another commonsense protection to make sure our \nNation's energy policy is aimed at helping consumers rather than \nhelping oil companies' bottom line, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  For the last several Congresses I have introduced the American Oil \nfor American Families Act, a bill to ensure that oil or petroleum \nproducts that originate within America's public lands or waters are not \nexported as crude or in refined form. That bill would increase our \nenergy supply at home, lowering prices for consumers and businesses, \nand I intend to reintroduce that legislation in this Congress.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the Markey \namendment. I intend to vote against the bill, which in my view is \nnothing more than an earmark for Big Oil. The pipeline will have \nenormous environmental impacts, it will not significantly help the \nAmerican economy, it will not benefit American consumers, and it will \nneedlessly harm landowners for generations.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                       State of the Union Address\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, tonight the President of the United States \nwill address the Nation on the state of our Union and talk a little bit \nabout his priorities for the coming year.\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n  I am not sure how much more there is for the President to say than \nhas already been leaked in the press in the drip, drip, drip of social \nmedia and other stories, but I am concerned he simply did not get the \nmessage that was delivered loud and clear on November 4 by the American \nvoters.\n  Just a couple of months ago they sent a message that was loud and it \nwas clear. They are fed up with the way things operate in Washington, \nDC. They are fed up with the dysfunction, and they are fed up with the \nlack of real leadership that focuses on their concerns, not \nWashington's concerns--concerns such as more money in their pocket.\n  I was amused to listen to our good friend, our colleague from New \nJersey, complaining about additional exports of oil or actually \ngasoline and other fuel. It is actually the supply, the glut of \ngasoline onto the global markets that has caused a pay raise for most \nhard-working, middle-class families. The price of gasoline has \nplummeted because of the glut of supply.\n  But we ought to be focused like a laser on how we put more money into \nthe pocketbook of hard-working American taxpayers--after years of \nstagnant jobs and stagnant wages, the stagnant number of jobs for the \nrecord number of Americans who have been looking for them.\n  So after sending a message loud and clear on November 4, what is the \nPresident's response? He says more of the same. He is set to announce a \n$320 billion tax hike and hundreds of billions of dollars in more \nspending--yes, hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes and \nhundreds of billions of dollars in more Federal spending. Sadly, the \nPresident has doubled down on the same agenda which, in his own words, \nwas on the ballot this last fall and was soundly rejected.\n  But this agenda and these policies are not only wrong for America \ntoday, they are certainly wrong for the America of our future. Future \ngenerations deserve a country that provides them more opportunity than \nour parents had or than we have. That is called the American dream. But \nhundreds of billions of dollars in new spending and new taxes--when we \nalready face an $18 trillion debt--well, that makes the American \npromise one unlikely to be fulfilled.\n  The cause of this problem is pretty clear: The President remains \nfocused on the priorities in Washington, DC, and not on the priorities \nof hard-working American taxpayers working from paycheck to paycheck, \ndealing with rising costs of living when it comes to food and other \ncommodities and who are sorely in need of additional money in their \npocket.\n  Things clearly need to change. That to me was what the voters said on \nNovember 4. I think I speak for many Americans and many Texans when I \nsay: Mr. President, enough is enough. The American people expect \nbetter, and, more importantly, they deserve better.\n  Sure, we know there are always going to be big challenges, and they \nare not easy to deal with by any stretch of the imagination. But \nsurely--surely--we can come up with better solutions than more taxes \nand more spending. This is really doubling down over the last 6 years. \nOne would think that the President, giving the State of the Union now \nin his seventh year in office, could come up with something a little \nbit different, particularly after his own party lost nine Senate seats \nafter this referendum on his failed policies that took place on \nNovember 4.\n  The great news--and there is good news--is we do not have to start \nfrom scratch. We need to look no further than some of the laboratories \nof democracy--that is what Louis Brandeis called the State: the \nlaboratories of democracy--to see what actually works. We know what \ndoes not work. So let's look and see what does work.\n  We could learn a lot from States such as Arizona, where the Presiding \nOfficer is from, and my home State of Texas. We are not perfect, but I \nthink we have learned a few important lessons we could teach to the \npolicymakers in the White House. Many policymakers in Washington seem \nto have forgotten the secret sauce, the formula, the recipe by which \nstrong, sustainable economic growth that lifts the middle class in \nTexas and in so many other States across the country--why that is alive \nand well and why those policies actually work.\n  Just last Friday I had the opportunity to visit Southeast Texas. I \nwas in Beaumont, TX, actually, where the existing gulf coast leg of the \nKeystone Pipeline is already operating.\n  I bet many of my colleagues would be amazed to know that we are \nalready transporting Canadian crude from Canada all the way across the \ncountry, by and large on railcars, to refineries on the gulf coast. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline--the legislation that we will be voting on today--\nwill increase the supply, which means more product, and hopefully, that \nwill result in downward pressure on prices for hard-working American \ntaxpayers.\n  While the President stood in the way of the building of this \ncompleted pipeline and the tens of thousands of jobs it would support, \nthe gulf coast leg of the Keystone Pipeline in Texas is already \nbooming. But they are hungry for more crude feedstock so they can \nproduce more and thereby create more jobs.\n  It has been good for communities. I talked to the mayor of Beaumont \nand other communities. I talked to a county judge. These taxes, which \nare provided by investment from the Keystone XL Pipeline, not only \ncreate good jobs, but the tax base is necessary to educate our kids in \nK-12 education. They provide the products and services from local \nbusinesses that sell goods. In other words, projects such as the \nKeystone XL Pipeline is a force multiplier when it comes to our economy \nand economic growth and opportunity, and of course, it has been good \nfor thousands of construction workers who built the pipeline.\n  I heard our colleagues on the other side of the aisle try to \ndenigrate these construction jobs. They say that they are just \ntemporary jobs. Mr. President, you and I have a temporary job. We are \nelected for a term of office, and if we are not reelected, it is a \ntemporary job. In effect, every job is a temporary job. But to \ndenigrate these good, high-paying construction jobs, including those \nperformed by welders--in Texas, properly trained welders can make \n$140,000 to $150,000 a year. Those are good, high-paying jobs, and we \nought to respect and encourage them.\n  That is just one example of how some of the folks at the White House \nlook down their nose at these construction jobs and try to denigrate \nthe economic contribution of projects such as the Keystone XL Pipeline \nand what they could learn from this project.\n  In my State we reduced taxes, cut red tape in favor of sensible \nregulations, and encouraged businesses to come to Texas to grow and \ncreate jobs. If I heard the story one time, I heard it 100 times. In my \nState, Governor Perry has contacted people in California and said: Come \nto Texas, where you are welcome and the cost of doing business is lower \nand the cost of living is cheaper. You can actually buy an affordable \nhome for your family. People have voted with their feet and have come \nwhere the opportunity is.\n  If we add it all up, over the last 6 years two-thirds of all new net \njobs created in the United States of America came from just one State, \nand that is my home State.\n  Another thing Washington could learn from Texas is how to balance a \nbudget. We actually balance our budget every year. Earlier I mentioned \nthat the President seems to be proud of the fact that the deficit is \nactually going down. As the Presiding Officer knows, that is the annual \ndifference between what we take in and what we spend.\n  What he doesn't tell you is that we are actually adding to the debt \nevery year because we are still spending more money than we are \nbringing in, and it has now gone up about $8 trillion during his \nadministration to an unprecedented $18 trillion national debt. We need \nto roll up our sleeves, and we invite the President to join us and take \non the priorities of hard-working American taxpayers in every State \nacross the country.\n  We know this is not going to be easy, but that is what we volunteered \nfor. I know there are colleagues here in the Senate--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike--who are eager to address the challenges that confront \nour country--whether it is economic, national security, or you name it. \nThese are things that need to get done.\n  At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what I think the \nState of our\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nUnion is or, for that matter, it doesn't really matter what the \nPresident thinks the State of our Union is. What matters is whether the \nteacher in Katy, TX, believes his students will have the opportunities \nhe did growing up or whether the single mom waiting tables in Fort \nWorth can find enough work to feed her family.\n  Our Nation is truly strong when its people believe it to be, and I \nhope the President understands that and tries something new rather than \nthe same old failed policies of the past.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  I wish to urge my colleagues to oppose any motion to table my \namendment. My amendment is about making sure that, if we do build the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, it is built with American iron and steel. Those \nare jobs. I don't wish to short-circuit the process here, but if the \npipeline is built, it should be built with American steel.\n  The Presiding Officer's State produces a lot of American steel and \nvery often with iron ore from my State. These are American jobs.\n  TransCanada has said that 50 percent of the iron and steel will be \noutsourced from other countries, and the iron and steel for some of the \nother pipes could come from other countries. They also said they can \nuse those pipes in other projects, including other projects in Canada.\n  I agree with Senator Cornyn when he said these construction jobs that \nwill help build the pipeline are real jobs. Just because they are not \npermanent jobs does not mean they are not real jobs. Providing the iron \nand steel and other manufactured products for this project will also \nprovide real jobs. Our amendment will do this entirely and consistently \nwithin the language of the bill and within our trade obligations.\n  I ask that my colleagues not vote to table this amendment because a \nvote to table this is a vote against American jobs. It is a vote \nagainst jobs in Ohio and Minnesota. It is a vote against the shippers \nwho ship our iron ore over the Great Lakes or by rail or over the \nMississippi so it can be used to make steel. We have done ``Buy \nAmerica'' legislation before. We just did it in 2013 on the WRDA bill. \nI ask that my colleagues please not vote against American jobs.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes before \nwe vote to speak to the Franken amendment. I think all of us want to \nbuy American and buy local whenever and wherever we can. We strongly \nsupport that since it does mean jobs--whether we are talking about a \npipeline or otherwise.\n  But I think the bigger question here--and what we have in front of us \nwith the Keystone XL Pipeline--is what this amendment would do. This \namendment would mandate specific materials for the Keystone XL \npipeline, and I think we need to put this into context. This pipeline \nis a private project. This is not a federally funded infrastructure \nproject. This would be the first time that Congress has directed or \nforced private parties to purchase domestic goods and materials.\n  We actually asked the Congressional Research Service to look into \nthis to see if there was any other instance at the Federal level where \nprivate parties were told that they must purchase 100-percent domestic \ngoods and materials, and so far the answer to that inquiry has been \nthat they can find no instance of that.\n  I think we need to be careful about this as a precedent because if we \nare going to direct this particular project--the Keystone XL--to have \nthis requirement on it, where do we go next? What will happen to the \nnext project that we have? Will it be the next pipeline or the next \nrenewable energy project? Where does this slippery slope go?\n  I think it is fair to note that TransCanada has made a commitment to \nhave 75 percent of the pipes for this project come from North America, \nand fully half of that--more than 332,000 tons of steel will come from \nthe State of Arkansas.\n  I am with the Senator from Minnesota. We want to make sure we get as \nmany jobs as we absolutely can and make sure they are good-paying \njobs--whether it is in steel making or widget making or welders. This \nis about jobs. This is what we want to do to encourage jobs. I think we \nneed to be very cognizant of what this particular amendment would do. \nThis amendment--for the first time ever--would direct a private entity \nto utilize all American-made products throughout the process of the \nconstruction.\n  It is important to note that the American Iron and Steel Institute \nhas been a strong supporter of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We have all \nreceived a letter--they called it a Steelgram--from the American Iron \nand Steel Institute. They let us know very clearly and in no uncertain \nterms that they support Keystone XL. They said it is essential that \nCongress act to ensure the approval of the Keystone XL Pipeline without \nfurther delay. Again, I agree.\n  We need to get moving on it. We need to do it without delay. I do \nthink it is interesting to note that the amendment does allow for the \nPresident to waive the requirements for American materials based on \ncertain findings he can make. I appreciate that is in there, and I \nthink that is good. But think about where we are. It has been 3,200-\nand-some-odd days now where we have been waiting for the President to \nact to make a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. So I don't have any \nreal confidence that he will move to act quickly on any kind of a \nwaiver requirement.\n  I just wanted to put that out there before we moved to take up the \namendments that we have pending before us this afternoon and note that \nwe will be doing that in a few short minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Alaska. I wish to say a few things about this private \ncompany. This company is asking us to do an extraordinary thing. We are \ndebating this on the floor because they are asking us to circumvent the \nenvironmental and safety process here and possibly expose the United \nStates--and the path of this pipeline--to tremendous environmental \ndamage. This is very different.\n  The Senator asked: Why won't this extend to every private enterprise? \nThis is something we are here debating and voting on, and that should \nsay something about the nature of this issue.\n  The United Steelworkers have endorsed my amendment. This is about \nAmerican jobs. The question is: If we do build this pipeline, should it \nbe built with American steel or should it be built with steel from \nother countries?\n  Again, in the bill, we make sure this is compliant with our trade \nobligations. There is nothing to stop us from doing this. This is a \nprivate foreign company that is asking us to circumvent our normal \nprocesses, and because of that, I feel we have the right to say this \nshould be made with American steel and with jobs in the State of Ohio \nand in the State of Minnesota--American jobs. If this is about American \njobs, let's make it about American jobs.\n  Again, this is a company that is asking us to circumvent our normal \nprocesses. So all I will say is that TransCanada has said the pipes \nthat have been made for this can be used in other projects in Canada.\n  If we are going to build this project, let's make it about American \njobs.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about jobs--\nespecially jobs in the U.S. steel industry.\n  This November I went to a ceremony at Sparrows Point a former steel \nplant in Maryland. It was a bittersweet day. I was there to honor the \nlegacy of Bethlehem Steel and all of the Steelworkers in Baltimore.\n  The site is being demolished but Sparrows Point has over 3,000 acres \nof land, access to ports, rails, and roads to attract companies to \ncreate jobs today and tomorrow.\n  We don't have steel in Maryland anymore. Many of us still mourn its \nloss. But we still have steel in America and I am still for steel.\n  If this Keystone bill is really a jobs bill, then let us put some \nmade-in-America jobs in it and show our support for American steel.\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n  For over a hundred years, workers at Sparrows Point produced the \nsteel that built America. Members of my own family worked at this steel \nmill. My father would open the doors to his grocery store early so that \nBethlehem Steel workers could pick up their lunch on their way to work.\n  America's steel and steelworkers protect the United States and our \nfreedom. At Sparrows Point, they rolled gun barrels, made steel for \ngrenades, shells and landing craft during World War II.\n  God help us all if America stops making steel. During times of war--\nwill we depend on foreign steel to build our ships, aircraft carriers \nand weapons?\n  American steelworkers work hard, play by the rules and serve their \ncountry. In war: building ships, tanks and weapons. In peace: making \nsteel for our buildings and cars.\n  Yet for over 50 years, the steel industry withered--not because steel \nwas unproductive or overpriced. The steel industry withered in America \nbecause Congress didn't do everything possible to protect American \nsteel from factors in the international steel market, raw material \ncosts, slumping demand, low steels prices, and a global recession. The \ngovernment looked the other way when foreign imports began to drive \ndown our prices and drive down our steel mills.\n  Our government singles out specific industries all the time when it \nis in our national interest. We single out specific industries and then \ntalk about their value to America. I agree with that.\n  We single out industries when it is in our national interest because \nwe need them as part of our economy or as part of our national \nproduction.\n  Helping the farmers or the airlines because of the national interest \nmeans national responsibility. In 2008, we bailed out the banks and we \nbailed out the auto industry for stability, security, and American \nindependence. Where is the help for the steel industry and the \nsteelworkers?\n  I have fought for steel in the past. Now I am fighting for steel \nagain. I fought so hard year after year to protect the lives and \nlivelihoods in Baltimore, in Dundalk.\n  I have fought for more than 25 years to reverse this tide against \nAmerican manufacturing and against American steel. I am going to keep \non fighting.\n  I fought to keep Sparrows Point open. And when that wasn't possible, \nI fought for a safety net for workers Trade Adjustment Assistance, \nunemployment insurance and health care benefits.\n  I think about Maryland steelworkers every day--what they are going \nthrough these past few years have been tough on workers, their \nfamilies, and the community.\n  I am supporting an amendment that protects American steel like steel \nhas protected us. It is simple. Let us put American workers back to \nwork in good, solid steel jobs, by requiring that the pipeline's \nconstruction, connection, operation, and maintenance all be done with \nmade-in-America, U.S. steel.\n  Let us get to work for American workers and let us put the jobs in \nthis jobs bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at this time I call for regular order \nwith respect to Markey amendment No. 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the Markey amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? There is a unanimous \nconsent request. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Is there a request from the Senator from Massachusetts to speak to \nthis amendment for 1 minute? What is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He asked unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. MARKEY. To this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, this is a motion to table the Markey \namendment, which is an amendment to have every Member of the Senate be \nput on record as to whether or not the oil coming through the Keystone \nPipeline\n\n[[Page S266]]\n\nis then exported out of the United States. Each Member of the Senate \nshould be recorded on that issue.\n  We import 5 million barrels of oil per day into the United States. We \nshould not allow the Canadians to use the United States as a straw to \nbe able to then go down to the Gulf of Mexico and send that oil out of \nthe country. We export young men and women over to the Middle East in \norder to protect oil coming in from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This is a \nchance to keep oil in America so we don't have to export it.\n  I do not believe the appropriate vote for Members is to support a \ntabling of the Markey amendment so that we don't actually reach the \nheart of this substantive issue, which is that we should be working to \nhave energy independence in America. When we are importing 5 million \nbarrels of oil a day from Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, we are in \nno way independent.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join my colleague Senator Portman from \nOhio in a bipartisan amendment on energy efficiency. This is a very \nshort version that passed overwhelmingly in the House last year. It \ndoesn't pick favorites in terms of fuel sources, and it is good for \nevery region of the country. This is something we all ought to be able \nto get behind. I am very pleased and hope we get a very strong vote in \nthe Senate.\n  I am pleased to support this amendment, and I thank my colleague from \nOhio, Senator Portman, for his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. The Senator from New Hampshire said it well. This is a \nno-brainer. It is three relatively small provisions, one of which is \nvery timely with regard to water heaters, about which we are very \nconcerned. I ask that we move on this amendment in a bipartisan way. It \nhas already passed the House, so it shouldn't be controversial over \nthere either. We hope we will be able to bring the larger legislation \nto the floor in the future, but this is a good downpayment.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have disposed of three pending \namendments that were before us. As we mentioned earlier, we are looking \nforward to Members coming down to the floor to offer their amendments. \nWe have agreed to a process here this afternoon.\n  Today will be a somewhat truncated day on the Senate floor because of \nthe State of the Union Address, but it is our hope that we will be able \nto get three amendments pending on our side and three amendments \npending on the Democrats' side.\n  The Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Fischer, is prepared to speak to her \namendment, and then we will move to the other side of the aisle. After \nthat, I will be calling up an amendment from Senator Lee. We will then \ngo to the Democratic side and come back here for a third round.\n  Just to give Members an idea of what we will have in front of us, we \nwill not be having votes on these amendments today, but I do think it \nshould be clear to Members that we will be looking forward to doing a \nsimilar series of votes tomorrow. So I would encourage folks to come to \nthe floor, talk to us, and let's get this process moving.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 18 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 18.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mrs. Fischer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 18 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide limits on the designation of new federally \n                            protected land)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON DESIGNATION OF NEW FEDERALLY PROTECTED \n                   LAND.\n\n       (a) Definition of Federally Protected Land.--In this \n     section, the term ``federally protected land'' means any area \n     designated or acquired by the Federal Government for the \n     purpose of conserving historic, cultural, environmental, \n     scenic, recreational, developmental, or biological resources.\n       (b) Findings Required.--New federally protected land shall \n     not be designated unless the Secretary, prior to the \n     designation, publishes in the Federal Register--\n       (1) a finding that the addition of the new federally \n     protected land would not have a negative impact on the \n     administration of existing federally protected land; and\n       (2) a finding that, as of the date of the finding, \n     sufficient resources are available to effectively implement \n     management plans for existing units of federally protected \n     land.\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, this amendment would create limitations \nfor new Federal land designations to ensure responsible management of \nour natural resources. These limitations are modeled on those in the \nNational Marine Sanctuaries Act, which authorizes the protection of \nnational marine sanctuaries. Under the act, the Commerce Secretary \ncannot designate a new sanctuary unless the Secretary publishes a \nfinding that, No. 1, the addition of a new sanctuary will not have a \nnegative impact on the overall system, and No. 2, sufficient resources \nwere available in the fiscal year in which the finding is made to \neffectively implement management plans for each sanctuary in the \nsystem.\n  These are commonsense limitations that ensure the administration will \nnot add more land to the Federal system without considering the impacts \nto the overall system and without sufficient funds to manage those \nresources effectively. At a time when the national park system has a \n$13 billion maintenance backlog, we need to consider the impacts to the \noverall system and whether there are sufficient resources to \neffectively manage additional land holdings.\n  In the context of energy policy, we should also consider our \nstewardship choices. American energy production on private and State-\nowned lands has increased significantly in recent years while \ndecreasing on Federal lands. Through leasing restrictions and \npermitting delays, the Obama administration has tied up energy \nproduction on Federal lands in redtape. Since 2009 oil production on \nFederal lands is down by 6 percent, and natural gas production on \nFederal lands is down 28 percent. Meanwhile, oil production on non-\nFederal land has risen by 61 percent, and natural gas production on \nnon-Federal land is up by 33 percent.\n  By limiting Federal land designations, more land should continue to \nbe held privately or managed by States and local governments, \nincreasing the opportunity for productive and beneficial use.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, as we go back and forth on offering \namendments, I wish to turn to the Senator from Hawaii for him to offer \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 58 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nset aside the pending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 58.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Schatz] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 58 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding climate change)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The environmental analysis contained in the \n     Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement referred to \n     in section 2(a) and deemed to satisfy the requirements of the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et \n     seq.) as described in section 2(a), states that--\n       (1) ``[W]arming of the climate system is unequivocal and \n     each of the last [3] decades has been successively warmer at \n     the Earth's surface than any preceding decade since 1850.'';\n       (2) ``The [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], in \n     addition to other institutions, such as the National Research \n     Council and the United States (U.S.) Global Change Research \n     Program (USGCRP), have concluded that it is extremely likely \n     that global increases in atmospheric [greenhouse gas] \n     concentrations and global temperatures are caused by human \n     activities.''; and\n       (3) ``A warmer planet causes large-scale changes that \n     reverberate throughout the climate system of the Earth, \n     including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and \n     altered weather patterns (e.g. an increase in more extreme \n     weather events).''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Consistent with the findings under \n     subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) climate change is real; and\n       (2) human activity significantly contributes to climate \n     change.\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. This amendment affirms something very simple; that is, \nclimate change is real and human activities significantly contribute to \nclimate change. It also states that a warmer planet causes large-scale \nchanges, including higher sea levels, changes in precipitation, and \naltered weather patterns, such as increases in more extreme weather \nevents.\n  This amendment cites for its evidence the findings of national and \ninternational scientific institutions, including the IPCC, the National \nResearch Council, and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. All of \nthese organizations are cited and quoted in the State Department's \nfinal supplemental environmental impact statement on Keystone XL \nPipeline. This is the same environmental review document that plays a \nprominent role in the text of the underlying bill, S. 1, and the \nsubstitute amendment.\n\n[[Page S268]]\n\n  The purpose of this amendment is simply to acknowledge and restate a \nset of observable facts. It is not intended to place a value judgment \non those facts or to suggest a specific course of action in response to \nthose facts. It is just a set of facts derived from decades of careful \nstudy of our land, air, and water.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AWARD OF LITIGATION COSTS TO PREVAILING PARTIES IN \n                   ACCORDANCE WITH EXISTING LAW.\n\n       Section 11(g)(4) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1540(g)(4)) is amended by striking ``to any'' and all \n     that follows through the end of the sentence and inserting \n     ``to any prevailing party in accordance with section 2412 of \n     title 28, United States Code.''.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Very briefly on Senator Lee's amendment--he will be \nhere to speak to it--this is a measure which would ensure that the rate \nof legal fees that are paid in Endangered Species Act cases would be \nconsistent with those in other cases that are eligible for lawyer's fee \ncompensation. Right now there is no cap on the hourly rate lawyers can \nbe paid in connection with lawsuits that are brought regarding \nviolations under the ESA. So this amendment would standardize the award \nof attorney's fees to parties prevailing against the Federal Government \nby applying a $125-an-hour rate cap under the Equal Access to Justice \nAct requirement. This applies to small business-related claims, among \nother things, and this would apply the same standard to ESA cases.\n  This is a measure Senator Lee will come to the floor to speak to \nfurther, but I would just give a little preview of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I would like to call on the Senator from Illinois to \noffer his amendment.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 69 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment to call up amendment No. 69.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 69 to amendment No. 2.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, about 1 year ago I was invited to go to \nthe southeast part of the city of Chicago. It is an area that used to \nbe populated by steel mills and now there are a lot of struggling \nfamilies. The manufacturing jobs were not replaced.\n  These are hard-working people--many are Mexican-American people. They \nsustain what you might expect--great parishes and churches and a great \nspirit among them, but now they are in a constant struggle. They live \nin a part of Chicago that has seen better days. They are doing their \ndarndest for their families.\n  They invited me to see something. They wanted me to see what they \nwere living next door to. I went down to that part of the city of \nChicago--within the boundaries of the city of Chicago--and I could not \nbelieve what I saw. They live in little houses such as these, and \nacross from them is a mountainous gathering of something called \npetcoke.\n  What is petcoke? If you take the Canadian tar sands that will move \nthrough the Keystone XL Pipeline to a refinery and put them through a \nprocess where you can end up with a viable product, such as gasoline, \njet fuel, diesel fuel or whatever it might be, you have to clean out \nall of this petcoke that creates the tar sands composition that they \nare dealing with.\n  When it is all over with--and if the process has been successful--\nthere is a lot of waste. In fact, there are 61 pounds of petcoke for \nevery barrel of oil. Keep in mind that the Senator who is sponsoring \nthe underlying legislation--we are dealing with moving hundreds of \nthousands of barrels a day through this pipeline.\n  Now take every one of those barrels and have 61 pounds of petcoke \nleft over as a result of the refining process. What happens to it? This \nis what happened to it in Chicago. It was dumped in the neighborhood.\n  The people invited me to come to their homes, and I did. I walked \ninto this woman's home, and she said: I have sealed the windows. I \ntaped them shut because this black, sooty petcoke blows through my \nwindows night and day. I cannot stop it. Is it something to worry \nabout?\n  It turns out that the petcoke is not a benign material. We are not \ntalking about dust in the air. We are talking about a composition that \nincludes--according to those who have taken a close look at it--heavy \nmetals. Would you want your baby in your home--or my home or my \ngrandchildren--breathing in this filthy, petcoke-infested dust night \nand day? They are not making it up. They showed me the window sills, \nand you could see the black, sooty petcoke.\n  I will tell you the details of the story. The environmental review \nfor the project of Keystone XL notes that communities throughout the \nMidwest have noticed large piles of petroleum coke--or petcoke--\nbuilding up as more and more tar sands are processed.\n  This picture tells a story. This is near a body of water which is \ncarrying this petcoke on the water. These poor folks deal with it as it \nblows through the air.\n  This type of crude oil is carried by the Keystone XL Pipeline, a \npipeline which the Republican majority has decided is their No. 1 \npriority in the Senate. Under the new Republican majority it is S. 1. \nThis pipeline, on behalf of a Canadian company, TransCanada, is the \ntopic we are facing.\n  We just had a vote and unfortunately could not prevail with the \nnotion that at least the oil that comes out of the pipeline ought to be \nfor the benefit of American consumers. We lost that vote. I think the \nvote was 57 to 42. It was tabled.\n  Let's talk about the actual process itself. According to the EPA--as \nI mentioned, the environmental impact statement--every barrel of tar \nsands contains 61 pounds of petcoke. That means the Keystone XL \nPipeline alone will produce 15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day--\n15,400 metric tons of petcoke every day. Would you like to live next \ndoor to that? That is what is happening in the city of Chicago, but it \nnot the only one.\n  This petcoke comes from the BP, British Petroleum, refinery in \nWhiting, IN. It is on the very southern tip of Lake Michigan. We can \nsee it from the city of Chicago. They went through a\n\n[[Page S269]]\n\n$4 billion upgrade and put in new equipment so they could start \nprocessing the Canadian tar sands which will come down through the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  Soon after they started this processing with $4 billion of new \nequipment, the people living in this part of Chicago looked out their \nwindows to see the massive piles of petcoke building up, and as a \nconsequence they got worried. They are worried for their children. On \nwindy days--it is, in fact, the ``Windy City''--black clouds of this \ndust blow from piles into this working-class neighborhood.\n  It always seems to be the case, doesn't it? If somebody tried to put \nthis on the North Shore of Chicago, they would scream bloody murder. \nBut the company that owns this petcoke put it outside a poor \nneighborhood--a working-class neighborhood in Chicago. The petcoke dust \nsettles on window sills and porches.\n  I met the kids running outside.\n  They are producing 6,000 tons of petcoke every single day at the \nBritish Petroleum refinery in Whiting, IN--6,000 tons a day. At that \nrate the plant only has room to store a few days' worth of production \nonsite. So they ended up selling the petcoke to a company called KCBX. \nIt is a subsidiary company owned by the Koch brothers--yes, those Koch \nbrothers.\n  Connect the dots. The highest priority of the Republican majority in \nthe Senate was to call up a bill for a Canadian company to transport \ntar sands across the United States with no promise that the American \nconsumers would ever be able to access it, and the process of refining \nthe Canadian tar sands ends up inuring to the benefit of many \ncompanies, such as British Petroleum and KCBX, which again is owned by \nthe Koch brothers. These are the same Koch brothers who are viable \npolitical players in our political campaigns.\n  This means the people in southeast Chicago are forced to breathe this \ndirty air that members of National Nurses United say causes severe \nhealth threats. Petcoke contains high levels of heavy metals, such as \nvanadium and nickel, and dust particles get trapped in residents' \nlungs, triggering asthma and exacerbating heart and lung conditions.\n  When I go to a school--whether it is rural or urban--I make a point \nto ask a very basic question: Does any student here know anyone with \nasthma? Half of the hands are up in every classroom. Our pages are \nstarting to raise their hands, of course.\n  So here we have a national problem, a respiratory problem, which has \nbeen made dramatically worse by the byproduct, petcoke, of the Keystone \nXL Pipeline. That is a fact. What I have argued to you now so far is \nindisputable.\n  The community and members of the Southeast Environmental Task Force \nthat I visited with in Chicago are fighting back with the help of the \nNational Resources Defense Council. They worked with Mayor Emanuel and \nChicago officials to put standards in place for petcoke storage sites \nthat protect public and environmental health. They have come up with a \nradical notion--if you want to store this dangerous petcoke, then for \ngoodness' sake put it inside a building so it doesn't blow all over the \nneighborhood.\n  They are suing KCBX and Koch Industries for the damages caused by \npetcoke piles after the Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice \nto the company of Clean Air Act violations.\n  The people who hate the EPA like the devil hates holy water do not \nwant them to come in and look at something as outrageous as this and \ntell you the obvious. This is a public health danger. Petcoke from \nCanadian tar sands, and part of the Keystone XL Pipeline, is a public \nhealth hazard.\n  Unfortunately, petcoke just isn't an issue in Chicago or Illinois. My \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Gary Peters, told me a story earlier. \nHe can tell you what happened in Detroit when another Koch brothers-\nowned company decided to store large piles of petcoke on the Detroit \nRiver.\n  If you look online, you can still find the YouTube video of black \nclouds blowing off the piles of the Koch brothers' petcoke into the \nriver. In fact, Senator Peters said that at one point this black cloud \nwas so dense it obscured the Ambassador Bridge between the United \nStates and Canada. You could not see it.\n  It took years of complaints and lawsuits from local communities to \nget shipping ports in California to require piles of petcoke that was \nbeing stored there to be kept in enclosed facilities and covered at all \ntimes.\n  Other communities continue to fight, including my city of Chicago, \nwhich I am proud to represent. As the U.S. refines more and more tar \nsands--that is what this bill is all about, refining more and more \nCanadian tar sands. Every single day tons of this petcoke is produced \nwith no end in sight and no way of protecting the people who live \naround that area from the damage it will cause to the lungs of children \nand other vulnerable people, such as elderly people with respiratory \nchallenges.\n  Residents in Houston, TX, and the State of Ohio have complained about \nhow these petcoke piles stored in their neighborhoods are damaging \ntheir homes and health, but many Americans affected by petcoke don't \nhave the money or power to take on big companies, so it is up to \nCongress. It is up to us to ensure that every person in America--rich \nor poor, whether they live in a good neighborhood or a struggling \nneighborhood--has the protection against public health hazards.\n  There is a current exemption of petcoke from environmental laws. When \nyou think of all of the things blowing in the air, how in the world did \npetcoke end up being treated like fairy dust? It is exempt from laws \nrelating to basic things, such as the Superfund. It is exempt from laws \nrelating to hazardous waste and materials. They must have had friends \nin high places to make sure this miserable source of respiratory \nproblems would be exempt from Federal law.\n  My amendment would change that. It would end this exemption so they \nwould be held to environmental and public health standards when it \ncomes to this miserable byproduct of Canadian tar sands and the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  My amendment goes on to require the EPA and the Department of \nTransportation to implement rules for petcoke storage and \ntransportation to protect the public health and environment.\n  Is there anyone here who will tell you that the folks, TransCanada or \nthose refining this, should not have that responsibility? I would not \nwant to see this anywhere. I would not want to see it in Alaska, and I \nwould not want to see it in Oklahoma. I sure don't want to even see it \nin the city of Chicago. But to think it goes unregulated--absolutely \nunregulated--is amazing, and that is what my amendment addresses.\n  The United States already produces millions of tons of petcoke each \nyear. Building this pipeline is just going to add dramatically to that \namount. By fixing the legal status of petcoke and making it subject to \nthe same laws as all other dangerous materials, we can help ensure that \nclean air and clean water is something everyone enjoys, whether they \nare rich or poor and no matter what State they happen to live in.\n  I hope the Senate will have a chance to vote on my amendment to close \nthis loophole for petcoke and establish reasonable guidelines for \nhandling the material.\n  It is time we put the health and well-being of Americans ahead of the \nprofits of any industry involved in the processing of Canadian tar \nsands because no community--especially the southeast side of Chicago--\nshould be considered a dumping ground for companies to make money off \nthe lungs and health of vulnerable children, elderly, and poor people.\n  No family should be forced to live next door to a three-story-high \npile of petcoke, and that is what is going on. No kid should have to \nmove from a ball field to play inside so they are not exposed to \nhazardous chemicals.\n  I know what will happen. Somebody is going to make a motion to table \nthis amendment. We can run, but we can't hide, just as we can run, but \nwe can't hide from blowing petcoke. If my colleagues won't allow a vote \non this amendment to classify this as a material that should be \nregulated for the safety of the environment and public health, they \nwill be on record if they vote to table this amendment.\n\n  I urge my colleagues--even if they dearly love the Keystone XL \nPipeline\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nand even if they can't wait to bring in the Canadian tar sands--think \nabout this as if this were your hometown, your neighborhood, and you \nlived in a house such as this and you looked across the road at that \nmiserable pile, three stories high, of petcoke blowing in for your \nchildren and your grandchildren to breathe every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 41 to Amendment No. 2\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment to call up the Toomey amendment No. 41.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To continue cleaning up fields and streams while protecting \n    neighborhoods, generating affordable energy, and creating jobs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STANDARDS FOR COAL REFUSE POWER PLANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) 19th-century mining operations left behind more than \n     2,000,000,000 tons of coal refuse on surface land in various \n     coal mining regions of the United States;\n       (2) coal refuse piles--\n       (A) pose significant environmental risks;\n       (B) have contaminated more than 180,000 acres of land and \n     streams; and\n       (C) are susceptible to fires that endanger public health \n     and emit an estimated 9,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide each \n     year, in addition to other uncontrolled pollutants;\n       (3) the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of \n     Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and the \n     Department of Environmental Protection of the State of \n     Pennsylvania recognize the significant public health benefits \n     of power plants that use coal refuse as fuel;\n       (4) since the inception of coal refuse power plants, the \n     plants have removed 210,000,000 tons of coal refuse and \n     restored 8,200 acres of contaminated land; and\n       (5) due to the unique nature of coal refuse and the power \n     plants that use coal refuse as a fuel, those plants face \n     distinct economic and technical obstacles to achieving \n     compliance with regulatory standards established for \n     traditional coal-fired power plants.\n       (b) Definition of Coal Refuse.--In this section, the term \n     ``coal refuse'' means any byproduct of coal mining, physical \n     coal cleaning, or coal preparation operations that contains \n     coal, matrix material, clay, and other organic and inorganic \n     material.\n       (c) Emission Limitations for Certain Electric Utility Steam \n     Generating Units.--\n       (1) In general.--The general emission limitations \n     established by the Environmental Protection Agency in the \n     final rule entitled ``Federal Implementation Plans: \n     Interstate Transport of Fine Particulate Matter and Ozone and \n     Correction of SIP Approvals'' (76 Fed. Reg. 48208 (August 8, \n     2011)) (or a successor regulation) shall not apply to an \n     electric utility steam generating unit described in paragraph \n     (3).\n       (2) Hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.--The emission \n     limitations for hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide \n     contained in table 2 of subpart UUUUU of part 63 of title 40, \n     Code of Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), \n     entitled ``Emission Limits for Existing EGUs'' shall not \n     apply to an electric utility steam generating unit described \n     in paragraph (3).\n       (3) Description of electric utility steam generating \n     units.--An electric utility steam generating unit referred to \n     in paragraphs (1) and (2) is an electric utility steam \n     generating unit that--\n       (A) is in operation as of the date of enactment of this \n     Act;\n       (B) uses fluidized bed combustion technology to convert \n     coal refuse into energy; and\n       (C) uses coal refuse as at least 50 percent of the annual \n     fuel consumed, by weight, of the unit.\n       (d) Effective Date.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, this section takes effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, obviously, Senator Toomey will come to \nthe floor to speak to his amendment.\n  I wish to follow up on the comments of the Senator from Illinois, who \nwas referring to petcoke. Senator Toomey in his amendment is attempting \nto deal with a situation in specific parts of the country that are \nimpacted by coal refuse. Coal refuse, as it is defined in his \namendment, effectively comes about from some centuries-old, 19th \ncentury mining operations that left behind this coal refuse in certain \nparts of the coal mining regions around the country. They remain a \nlegacy problem that is acknowledged, a legacy problem that creates \nenvironmental issues, including contamination of local streams with \nheavy metals, acid, and mine drainage, that, again, I think we all \nrecognize there is a responsibility to address.\n  The good news is there is a solution to cleaning up this problem. \nCoal refuse powerplants take this coal and these waste piles and turn \nthem into energy and heat for consumers, for businesses. They follow \nEPA regulations. This is not a situation where we are bypassing EPA \nregulations when it comes to the emissions issues. But remediating \nthese mine sites, removing these waste piles, and at the same time \ngenerating electricity with the coal and applying the basic ash from \nthe process reclaims the land at a lower cost. So we are able to do \nseveral things at the same time. We are dealing with an environmental \nissue that has been in place for far too long. We are generating \nelectricity that can be used to the benefit of consumers and \nbusinesses, and we are also able to reclaim the land.\n  So it is viewed, clearly, as a win here. It also creates some jobs. \nIt improves the environment and it boosts economic growth.\n  Burning these coal waste piles is basically a carbon-neutral process \nbecause the carbon in these piles is currently being emitted into the \natmosphere through the slow chemical process that is at play there, and \nwe also have fires that burn within these piles. So just sitting there \nis not an answer to a better environment and reduced emissions.\n  The plants that burn this waste coal cannot economically be as clean \nas plants using higher quality coal. But the side benefits of removing \nthese waste piles, again, from the perspective of dealing with \nemissions, generating electricity, and reclaiming the land--the \nbenefits do compensate for the differences that are out there.\n  Historically, environmental regulators have recognized these \nbenefits. They have carved out the plants from regulatory standards \nthat would cause them to shut down. There have been EPA regulations \nrecently that have failed to sustain this approach and, thus there is \nthe amendment of the Senator from Pennsylvania that would allow these \ncoal waste plants to run.\n  I encourage my colleagues to look at this amendment in front of us \nand consider the merits as Senator Toomey has laid out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I know we are running against a time \nclock here in getting ready for the State of the Union Address tonight. \nI appreciate my colleague from Alaska going back and forth on these \namendments and allowing both sides of the aisle to set up some pending \namendments. I will just say the Toomey amendment asks for an exemption \nof the Clean Air Act which I wouldn't support. I know we will have a \nchance later on to have that discussion.\n  Our colleague from Nebraska came to the floor and offered an \namendment that would make it incredibly difficult without first proving \nthere was negative management of Federal land to get any more national \nmonuments. National monuments have been big economic drivers in a lot \nof communities and have preserved some very unique parts of our \ncountry. We will have a chance to talk about that a little bit later. \nBut I wish to make sure we get our colleague recognized so he can offer \nhis amendment. Then, I think we will probably, as my colleague from \nAlaska said, be finished for this afternoon as it relates to offering \namendments back and forth. I wish to recognize the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 29 to Amendment No. 2\n\n       (Purpose: to express the sense of the Senate that climate \n     change is real and not a hoax)\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside \nthe pending amendment so that I may call up my amendment No. 29.\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Whitehouse] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 29 to amendment No. 2.\n       On page 3, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that climate change is real \n     and not a hoax.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the energy committee and her ranking member \nfor allowing this process to go forward to the point where I am able to \ncall up this amendment.\n  It is a convention here when amendments are called up to ask \nunanimous consent that the reading be dispensed with, but in this \namendment, the effective language is only eight words: ``Climate change \nis real and not a hoax.'' So I went ahead and allowed the clerical \nstaff to read the whole operative text of this amendment.\n  This is an extremely simple amendment. We are here in this remarkable \nbody in which so much history has taken place and in which so many \ngreat achievements have been fought through, many of them with powerful \ninterests and strong arguments on opposite sides. And through that \nconflict, here in this body, we have been able to generate some of the \ngreat compromises and some of the great resolutions that have defined \nthe course of the history of this country. So what a wonderful place \nthis is to have the opportunity to serve.\n  Now, in this great deliberative body, called by many the greatest \ndeliberative body, we have a great issue before us--perhaps as many \nsay, the issue of our time--and that is what our carbon pollution--the \nexcess carbon that we burn when we burn fossil fuels--is doing to our \natmosphere and what it is doing to our oceans. There is no factual \ndebate about what it is doing to our atmosphere and our oceans. It is \ncrystal clear, and the consequences are crystal clear as well.\n  If my colleagues don't believe me, fine, go ask the U.S. military. \nAsk Admiral Locklear. Ask the Secretary of the Navy. Ask the Joint \nChiefs of Staff. If my colleagues don't want to believe in the \nmilitary, ask our religious leaders. Ask the U.S. Conference of \nCatholic Bishops. If my colleagues only believe what corporations tell \nus, ask some of our biggest and most successful American corporations. \nAsk Walmart. Ask Coca-Cola. Ask Nike, ask Apple, ask Google. Go on \nthrough the corporate heraldry, and virtually every American \ncorporation that is not actively involved in the fossil fuel industry \nwill tell us this is a real and serious problem. And many of them are \ndedicating an enormous amount of internal effort to try to solve it \nwithin their corporate boundaries. Again, Walmart and Coca-Cola come \nright to the head of the list.\n  Of course, we don't have to ask our scientists any longer. They are \npretty clear. They use words such as ``unequivocal'' and ``undeniable'' \nat every single scientific society that represents the major elements \nof the profession in this country. Every single one has made this a \npriority. If people just want to go out to farmers, foresters, and \nfishermen, they are already seeing the changes around them.\n  So here we are in this great deliberative body with this \nextraordinarily important issue that we have to face, and what do we \nsee? Silence, virtually dead silence, because one side of this body \nwon't even discuss the question. Many refuse to believe that climate \nchange even exists, and for those who do, the political perils of using \nthat phrase have now become so great that there is no serious \nconversation back and forth about climate change.\n  In the first week we debated the Keystone Pipeline, which the \nenvironmental impact statement said will have a dramatic effect on \nclimate change--the equivalent of 6 million added cars on our highways \nfor 50 years, not to mention the petcoke and the byproducts, and just \nthe carbon effect of it--no mention. The only time it was mentioned was \nwhen our distinguished energy committee chairman mentioned the \ntestimony of a witness in her committee. She was good enough to make \nsure that climate change was raised in her committee, and she mentioned \nthat there had been a witness who in turn mentioned climate change. But \nthere was no direct mention in all of the debate that we heard in that \nweek about climate change. It is the word that cannot be said.\n  That is wrong. We cannot ignore this problem. It is too real for my \nfishermen in Rhode Island. It is to real for the people who are living \nnear coasts and are seeing beaches they used to be able to play on \neaten away. It is too real for the people whose homes have fallen into \nthe sea. It is too real for us not to discuss it.\n  Now, it is not going to be easy, and we have to start somewhere. So \nthis is a start. I am going to ask my colleagues to vote on such a \nsimple question: Is climate change real or is it a hoax? Both points of \nview have been expressed in this body. Where do we come down? Let's \nactually find out if there are people on the Republican side of the \naisle who are willing to say climate change is real. My moose up in New \nHampshire, one could say, are suffering unprecedented infestations of \nticks because there is no snow for them to fall off and die, and the \nmoose are getting overwhelmed. We could say that in the University of \nOklahoma, the leading dean is an IPCC member and led the establishment \nof Climate Central. One could go to the Carolina coasts and hear from \nthe coastal agencies about sea level rise. One could go to Arizona and \nhear about the desertification and the drought. We can go all over the \nplace and find these things, and they are real.\n  We have to have this conversation. It has to begin with as simple a \nproposition as this. Then, I hope if we can build off this if we can \nfind a few Republican Senators who will say publicly that climate \nchange is real. We can then go on to if it is real, let's have a \nconversation about what we do about it, because recklessly continuing \nto dump megatons of carbon into the atmosphere every year is not a \nsolution. And I don't want to be a part of a generation of which our \nkids and our grandchildren look back and ask: Where were they? Why \ncould they not address this question? There they were in this great \ndeliberative body. There they were with this great issue of our time. \nWhy would they not even discuss it?\n  So I hope this amendment gets the conversation under way. It is one I \nlook forward to. I think there are very sensible ways to solve this \nproblem, including ways that have been supported by everyone from \nRepublican Secretaries of the Treasury to the lead economist for Ronald \nReagan, the famous Mr. Laffer. There are ways we can make these \nadjustments. But we have to have the conversation, and I hope this \nbegins it.\n  With that, I yield the floor. Again, I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the energy committee for her courtesy in allowing us to \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I think \ndiscussions we have had just in the past hour here since we have had \nthe vote and the various amendments we now have pending before us--this \nis a good conversation. This is a good discussion and debate for us to \nbe having as a body. We haven't had energy-related issues brought \nbefore this floor in some years now. We had a very limited debate on \nKeystone back in December, but I am hopeful that with the opportunity \nfor amendments--and again, not just some amendments we on our side have \nhandpicked and then decided what the Democrats might be able to move on \ntheir side--an opportunity for some real issues to be brought forward \nand to be debated on this floor.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is very passionate on the issue of \nclimate change. I think it is fair to say that he has singlehandedly \nraised the awareness not only in this body but for those loyal \nfollowers on C-SPAN.\n  When it comes to the issue of climate change, I think the Senator \ncomes up once a week with his charts and a series of speeches that I \nthink is meant to educate colleagues. I don't agree with all of it. I \nthink that is a fair statement to say. But what is equally fair is that \nthere is a care and concern for not only our country and our country's \nenvironment--truly the public\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nsafety of our people, a care for our land, the stewardship we have as \nAmericans--but it goes well beyond our borders to that of our entire \nglobe, our entire planet, and how we care for planet Earth and how we \nmove forward responsibly.\n  One aspect of the energy debate that I continue to advance is that we \nmust ensure that if we are to make advances when it comes to caring for \nour environment and truly the whole issue of global climate, we have to \nbe a nation that is economically secure in the sense that the \ntechnologies we will have to help us be cleaner in all that we do, do \nnot come without cost. Here in this country, we have been the leaders, \nwe have been the innovators when it comes to clean-energy technologies, \nand we should challenge ourselves every day to do more in that regard, \nto build out, to push out that R so that we are making--whether it is \nmaking clean coal truly clean, whether it is advancing those clean \nenergy technologies.\n  I, for one, coming from a fossil fuel-producing State, am a huge \nproponent of nuclear-powered generation in this country because I \nbelieve very strongly that it is the cleanest energy source we have at \nthis point in time.\n  So what are we doing in this country to make sure our energy is \nabundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure? These are the \nchallenges I put out to my colleagues.\n  I clearly appreciate the need that we have in this body and in this \ncountry to be moving forward with technologies that allow us to have \nreduced emissions, to have a cleaner environment, but I also want to \nmake sure we do so in a way that doesn't cripple our economy. So how we \nlead in this way, which I believe we must, while keeping our economy \nwhere it must be--in the front and moving forward all the time--is our \ngreat challenge.\n  Again, I look forward to the debate we will have. I am pleased we \nwere able to process the amendments we had before us today. I look \nforward to advancing those that we have pending in front of us now and \nto good, continued, and robust discussion on this floor.\n  I note the majority leader is here, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S272-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

PRO\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the career of \nthe Honorable Philip M. Pro, who is retiring from the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Nevada.\n  For more than 25 years, Judge Pro has sat on the district court. He \nwas nominated by President Ronald Reagan, and he took office on July \n23, 1987. From 2002 to 2007, he served as chief judge for the district \ncourt. Since being appointed to this distinguished position by \nPresident Reagan, his consistent leadership and responsiveness to the \npublic and the court have not gone unnoticed. In October 1993, then \nU.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist appointed Judge Pro \nas chair of the Committee on the Administration of the Magistrate \nJudges System of the Judicial Conference of the United States. In 2007, \nU.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Judge Pro to \nthe board of the Federal Judicial Center.\n  Beyond his remarkable career at the district court, Judge Pro has had \na tremendous impact on the entire legal community. He served for \nseveral years on the Study Committee to Review the Nevada Rules of \nCivil Procedure. He was actively involved in numerous international \nrule-of-law programs in countries such as Hungary, Spain, Norway, \nMalawi, and South Africa. Judge Pro was integral in the establishment \nof the William S. Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las \nVegas. He served on the Law Advisory Committee for the law school and \nthe advisory board of the school's Saltman Center for Conflict \nResolution.\n  In addition to his impressive work in the legal community, he has \nworked since 1987 to educate Nevada's youth about civic duties through \nhis role with the We, the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution \nProgram.\n  On a personal basis, I was chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission \nduring tumultuous times, when it was discovered mob influences \ninfiltrated Nevada's gaming establishments; Phil was one of my \nattorneys. We have joked, since then, that he was able to beat, on \nbehalf of the State of Nevada and its gaming authorities, the best \nlawyers that the adverse interest could buy. He was then an advocate of \nthe law. Phil understood the law, for which I will always be grateful. \nI would also be negligent if I did not announce to everyone within the \nsound of my voice my envy for his great voice. He has a deep baritone \nspeaking ability, which sets him apart from almost everyone else. I \nthank Phil Pro for his friendship.\n  Through his years of professional and voluntary service, Judge Pro \nhas become a fixture in the Nevada legal community. I congratulate him \non his many successes and decades of dedicated public service. I wish \nhim the best in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S272-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S272-S273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE, SCIENCE, AND TRANSPORTATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

In the \n     event a witness fails to file a timely written statement in \n     accordance with this rule, the Chairman of the Committee or \n     subcommittee, as applicable, may permit the witness to \n     testify, or deny the witness the privilege of testifying \n     before the Committee, or permit the witness to testify in \n     response to questions from members without the benefit of \n     giving an opening statement.\n       4. Field Hearings.--Field hearings of the full Committee, \n     and any subcommittee thereof, shall be scheduled only when \n     authorized by the Chairman and ranking minority member of the \n     full Committee.\n\n                            RULE II--QUORUMS\n\n       1.

This rule may be waived with the \n     concurrence of the Chairman and the ranking minority member \n     of the full Committee.\n\n                   RULE V--SUBPOENAS; COUNSEL; RECORD\n\n       1. Subpoenas.--The Chairman, with the approval of the \n     ranking minority member of the Committee, may subpoena the \n     attendance of witnesses for hearings and the production of \n     memoranda, documents, records, or any other materials. The \n     Chairman may subpoena such attendance of witnesses or \n     production of materials without the approval of the ranking \n     minority member if the Chairman or a member of the Committee \n     staff designated by the Chairman has not received \n     notification from the ranking minority member or a member of \n     the Committee staff designated by the ranking minority member \n     of disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours, excluding \n     Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the subpoena. If \n     a subpoena is disapproved by the ranking minority member as \n     provided in this paragraph, the subpoena may be authorized by \n     vote of the Members of the Committee, the quorum required by \n     paragraph 1 of rule II being present. When the Committee or \n     Chairman authorizes a subpoena, it shall be issued upon the \n     signature of the Chairman or any other Member of the \n     Committee designated by the Chairman. At the direction of the \n     Chairman, with notification to the ranking minority member of \n     not less than 72 hours, the staff is authorized to take \n     depositions from witnesses. The ranking minority member, or a \n     member of the Committee staff designated by the ranking \n     minority member, shall be given the opportunity to attend and \n     participate in the taking of any deposition. Witnesses at \n     depositions shall be examined upon oath administered by an \n     individual authorized by law to administer oaths, or \n     administered by any member of the Committee if one is \n     present.\n       2. Counsel.--Witnesses may be accompanied at a public or \n     executive hearing, or the taking of a deposition, by counsel \n     to advise them of their rights. Counsel retained by any \n     witness and accompanying such witness shall be permitted to \n     be present during the testimony of the witness at any public \n     or executive hearing, or the taking of a deposition, to \n     advise the witness, while the witness is testifying, of the \n     witness's legal rights. In the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Chairman may rule that representation by \n     counsel from the government, corporation, or association or \n     by counsel representing other witnesses, creates a conflict \n     of interest, and that the witness may only be represented \n     during testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not \n     from the government, corporation, or association or by \n     personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     paragraph shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event the witness's counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such manner as to prevent, \n     impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of a hearing or the taking of a deposition. \n     This paragraph may not be construed as authorizing counsel to \n     coach the witness or to answer for the witness. The failure \n     of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse the witness \n     from complying with a subpoena.\n       3. Record.--An accurate electronic or stenographic record \n     shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in executive \n     and public hearings and depositions. If testimony given by \n     deposition is transcribed, the individual administering the \n     oath shall certify on the transcript that the witness was \n     duly sworn in his or her presence and the transcriber shall \n     certify that the transcript is a true record of the \n     testimony. The transcript with these certifications shall be \n     filed with the chief clerk of the Committee. The record of a \n     witness's testimony, whether in public or executive session \n     or in a deposition, shall be made available for inspection by \n     the witness or the witness's counsel under Committee \n     supervision. A copy of any testimony given in public session, \n     or that part of the testimony given by the witness in \n     executive session or deposition and subsequently quoted or \n     made part of the record in a public session, shall be \n     provided to that witness at the witness's expense if so \n     requested. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Clerk of the Committee, a witness may \n     request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors. The witness may also \n     bring to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman or a member of the Committee staff \n     designated by the Chairman shall rule on such requests.\n\n                   RULE VI--BROADCASTING OF HEARINGS\n\n       Public hearings of the full Committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, shall be televised or broadcast only when authorized \n     by the Chairman and the ranking minority member of the full \n     Committee.\n\n                        RULE VII--SUBCOMMITTEES\n\n       1. Hearings.--Any member of the Committee may sit with any \n     subcommittee during its hearings.\n       2. Change of Chairmanship.--Subcommittees shall be \n     considered de novo whenever there is a change in the \n     chairmanship, and seniority on the particular subcommittee \n     shall not necessarily apply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S273-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S273-S274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RYAN RINGEL\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I wish today to honor Ryan Ringel, a \nmember of my Senate staff who recently went to work for a fellow Member \nof the Senate.\n  Ryan, who is from Rexburg, ID, has been an invaluable member of my \nSenate staff for the past 16 years. After attending Ricks College, now \nBrigham Young University-Idaho, Ryan graduated from Boise State \nUniversity in 1998 with a bachelor of science degree in political \nscience, international relations, and Spanish. With his strong support \nfor BSU sports, particularly football, he will likely continue to cheer \nfor his team from his new position, even though he is working for \nanother State.\n  Also in 1998 he joined my campaign as a staff assistant and then \ninterned in my Boise office before moving to Washington, DC to become \nsystems administrator in the Senate office as it opened in 1999. During \nhis Senate tenure, Ryan met his wife, Noelle, and they have built a \nbeautiful family that includes three sons, Zachary, Andrew and Michael.\n  In addition to being an effective member of my staff, Ryan is a \ntrusted friend. Ryan's high regard for the privilege of serving fellow \nIdahoans is evident. His know-how and sensible guidance have been \ninstrumental and will be greatly missed. Countless times he has taken \nmy calls at any hour and fixed whatever it was that was broken or in \nneed of replacement. All the while, he brings a good humor to \nchallenges and figures out ways to get things done right.\n  It is no surprise that Ryan's knowledge and skill have been \nrecognized by others, and I wish Ryan all the best in his future career \npath. Thankfully, he is not going far, and I will still get to see Ryan \nand Noelle in the halls of the Senate. Congratulations, Ryan, Noelle, \nZachary, Andrew and Michael, on the start of a new chapter. Thank you, \nRyan, for your outstanding service. I wish you all the very best life \nhas to offer.\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S274-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SAM CHAPMAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize my great friend and former colleague Sam \nChapman, who is retiring on February 1, 2015, after a long and \ndistinguished career in public service.\n  I first had the opportunity to work with Sam when we were both county \nsupervisors in northern California. When I was elected to the Marin \nCounty Board of Supervisors in 1976, Sam had already served 2 years on \nthe neighboring Napa County Board of Supervisors after successfully \ndefeating an incumbent. He was only 26 at the time, but he had been \nmotivated to launch his underdog run after watching the incumbent fall \nasleep at a public meeting. Although he called his 1974 win ``the \nbeginning of my career in politics,'' Sam had already shown a deep \ndedication to the ideals of public service.\n  After receiving his law degree from the University of California at \nBerkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, Sam joined Volunteers in Service \nto America, VISTA, a national public service program envisioned by \nPresident John F. Kennedy and implemented by President Lyndon Johnson \nto fight poverty in America. He worked with VISTA as a volunteer \nattorney in the field of poverty law and later became a staff attorney \nfor the Napa County Legal Assistance Agency. He then opened his own \ngeneral practice law office in Napa prior to running for supervisor.\n  Sam and I have always shared so many values--he has always been a \nstrong advocate for the environment and other progressive causes--and \nduring the 6 years we served together, we worked to improve the lives \nof people throughout our North Bay communities. When I was elected to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives in 1982, I knew right away that I \nwanted Sam on my team. For more than 20 years--as press secretary, \nlegislative director, and finally as my chief of staff--Sam worked \ntirelessly every day to serve the people of the State of California.\n  In 2004, seeking a new way to serve his community, Sam left the U.S. \nSenate to become the publisher of the Pacific Sun, a weekly newspaper \nfocused on Marin County. He always had an interest in the news media, \nhaving worked as a reporter and editor for the Napa Valley Register \nprior to receiving his law degree. In 2010, following his lifelong \ninterest in the environment and renewable energy issues, he became the \nState and Community Affairs Manager at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, \nwhere he has worked to strengthen the lab's ties with the local and \nregional community.

Madam President, on July 6, 2015, the Johnson City \nChamber of Commerce will celebrate its centennial.\n  For 100 years the chamber has promoted business, enhanced economic \nand community development, and served as a catalyst for improving the \noverall quality of life for people in the Tri-Cities.\n  In many cities across Tennessee, chamber of commerce members are the \nlifeblood of the community. They are our educators, our bankers, our \ndoctors, our pharmacists, and more, and they share a common dedication \nto improving the quality of lives of their fellow citizens.\n  As a former businessman, chamber member and mayor, I know firsthand \nthat what we do here in Washington, including Federal regulations and \ntax policies, has a direct impact on businesses and communities across \nTennessee.\n  For far too long, Washington has put off addressing these issues as \nwell as what I believe should be our top priority: getting our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  As I speak with Tennessee chamber of commerce groups, one thing is \nobvious. They are ready for Washington to govern responsibly and \nfinally focus on growing our economy, repairing our fiscal house and \nstrengthening our Nation's role in the world.\n  Some of America's greatest achievements and longest-lasting solutions \nhave occurred when one party controls Congress and another the White \nHouse.\n  It will take hard work, but I am optimistic. If the President rolls \nup his sleeves and provides leadership and if Congress acts \nresponsibly, I truly believe we can begin to solve some of the big \nissues members of the chamber care most about.\n  I congratulate the Johnson City Chamber of Commerce on their \ncentennial celebration. I appreciate their input on how we can \nstrengthen our communities and unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of \nour local businesses. I thank them for making the Tri-Cities a great \nplace to live and do business, and I look forward to working with them \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S274-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S274-S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT ESSAY FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord finalist essays written by Vermont High School students as part \nof the Fifth Annual ``What is the State of the Union'' Essay contest \nconducted by my office. These 20 finalists were selected from over 400 \nentries.\n  The essays follow:\n\n\n             Sam Anglum, Burr And Burton Academy (Finalist)\n\n       We marched along for roughly 5 miles, part of which was \n     right through Times Square. While holding up our signs and \n     chanting what we wanted to see change in our government's \n     priorities, I looked to my left and gazed at the skyline full \n     of skyscrapers atop the canopy of Central Park.\n       My class and I were marching alongside 400,000 New Yorkers, \n     Americans, and globally aware citizens at the 2014 NYC \n     Climate March. Climate change is a very serious issue that \n     not many people are sensitive enough about. My hopes going \n     into the march were to be a part of bringing global awareness \n     to the massive shift in attitude I feel is going to save the \n     Earth from its imminent doom.\n       After participating in such a momentous event, I want my \n     voice to echo further than the streets of Manhattan. I want \n     the United States government to consider helping by promoting \n     climate education in schools across the nation so that this \n     kind of action becomes a part of the everyday agenda. As a \n     high school student in Vermont, I urge my very own state \n     senators including Governor Shumlin to consider spreading \n     this type of education across the State of Vermont. I imagine \n     the future generations as the key components to setting goals \n     and battling for solutions to the problems that people are \n     fighting against today.\n       Not everyone will be an activist, or even care nearly as \n     much as they should, but as long as more of the youth is \n     aware of these pressing global issues, the amount of people \n     that will create change will no doubt be multiplied. Our \n     world's economic foundation is based on the over-extraction \n     of fossil fuels, and because of this one in four carbon \n     emissions comes from humans. I am aware that Vermont has a \n     goal of making restrictions on fossil fuels and ultimately \n     becoming 90 percent renewable by 2050. Every student in \n     Vermont should be aware of this goal. I strongly urge the \n     United States government to contribute to that further by \n     promoting this kind of discussion within classrooms.\n       New York City Councilman Donovan Richards, a man on the \n     panel for 350.org, spoke to us the night before the march, \n     and his words stuck with me. ``Rulership does not coincide \n     with leadership.'' The streets of Manhattan were full of \n     leaders on Sunday, September 21, and our desire was to \n     influence our rulers. However, if our voice is transmitted to \n     our ``rulers'' such as yourself, our governments can ``lead'' \n     us into a more sustainable and renewable world.\n\n\n    Caroline Arthaud, Champlain Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and \n     fellow Americans:\n       Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``This country will not be a \n     good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a good \n     place for all of us to live in.'' At this time, it is my duty \n     to lead this country towards such a place. I stand here today \n     to address our successes, but also our deficits. Although \n     Americans have many reasons to be proud of our \n     accomplishments, it is unrealistic and inaccurate to declare \n     ourselves flawless. We must muster the courage to confront \n     the issues that hold us back.\n       Although the unemployment rate has decreased from 9.7 \n     percent in 2010 to 5.8 percent in November of 2014, there are \n     still 9 million\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\n     Americans without jobs. This is not acceptable.\n       Beyond this, our precious environment is deteriorating. \n     What many seem to struggle to understand is that the gradual \n     warming of the earth is not an issue affecting only polar \n     bears and penguins, but a growing danger to humans, as well.\n       To begin to address issues of unemployment and environment, \n     it is important that we, the American people, do our part to \n     raise awareness and call for action. America needs to \n     initiate large-scale production of renewable energy sources. \n     This will help us in two ways: it will expand employment and \n     create new jobs, and it will also transition this country \n     from dependence on pollution-causing energy sources to \n     cleaner solutions. We can sleep easier knowing that we have \n     stopped engaging in a process sure to leave our children and \n     grandchildren with a world too far gone to rehabilitate.\n       Yet, another issue has escalated severely in recent years. \n     It is one that has resulted in the violent deaths of 20 \n     innocent six-year-olds in 2012, and that continues to take \n     the lives of an average of 289 Americans daily. Many of us \n     don't want to look at the problem of gun violence, but it has \n     become something we can no longer ignore. We must formulate \n     legislation that demands the renewal of gun permits on a \n     regular basis, and work to improve the quality of mental \n     health treatment. We must insist upon implementing stricter \n     background checks on anyone wishing to bear weapons.\n       Change is difficult. It's difficult on an individual basis, \n     and vastly more difficult on a national one. However, I \n     believe that the ability to change is a big part of what has \n     made this nation so great. Americans are resilient and \n     creative, and I believe that if we set our minds to it, we \n     can improve the state of our union. I call upon you, all of \n     you, to help continue the legacy of this remarkable country \n     by working with me to better the lives of all Americans. \n     Unemployment, environmental degradation, and gun violence are \n     a lot to take on; however, we live in a country capable of \n     anything.\n       Thank you. God bless you, and God bless the United States \n     of America.\n\n\n               HAR WA BI, Winooski High School (Finalist)\n\n       ``There is a lot that happens around the world we cannot \n     control. We cannot stop earthquakes, we cannot prevent \n     droughts, and we cannot prevent all conflict, but when we \n     know where the hungry, the homeless and the sick exist, then \n     we can help,'' says Jan Schakowsky, the U.S. Representative \n     from Illinois. We can't help what nature creates, but being \n     homeless is not nature. It is produced by humans and only \n     humans can erase it. It is our nation's fault for letting \n     people become homeless and live in poverty. We need to help \n     the homeless and not let the poor become homeless.\n       According to studentsagainsthunger.org in United States, \n     each year more than 3.5 million people become homeless. They \n     are forced to sleep in parks, under bridges, in shelters or \n     cars. In fact, 35 percent of the homeless population are \n     families with children, which is the fastest growing segment \n     of the homeless population. And, 25 percent of the homeless \n     population suffer from some form of mental illness. According \n     to the feedingamerica.org, 45.3 percent of the people lived \n     in poverty in 2013. This included 26.4 million people ages 18 \n     to 64, 4.7 million children under the age of 18, and 4.2 \n     million seniors 65 and older.\n       I believe poverty happens in the United States because \n     housing and hospital bills are too expensive. Lower-income \n     workers cannot afford food and shelter. After we pay for \n     housing, nothing is left for us. We don't have a higher \n     income, we have food stamps which are low because the \n     government cut it off, including for my family. And, my mom \n     is the only one who works. According to homeaid.org, some \n     part of the homelessness is caused by the loss of loved ones, \n     job loss, domestic violence, divorce and family disputes. \n     Other impairments such as depression, untreated mental \n     illness, post-traumatic stress disorder, and physical \n     disabilities are also responsible for a large portion of the \n     homeless. I want government to help those people who need and \n     try to stop it from happening, and to make our nation become \n     better.\n       I believe only government can decrease homelessness and \n     help to increase the income, which all poor people need. We \n     need to decrease the cost of hospitals or anything that costs \n     a lot. Please help us poor and homeless because the \n     government is our only hope. We will be waiting for the \n     results of our government's actions.\n\n\n         Peter Camardo, South Burlington High School (Finalist)\n\n       A democracy is a government ruled by the people. In a \n     democracy, the citizens hold the responsibility of making \n     decisions. This is why United States of America has been \n     successful throughout history. A democracy is the most \n     productive way to run society when its citizens are engaged, \n     but it loses its superiority when the population is plagued \n     by ignorance.\n       In my lifetime, Americans have been fortunate to live on \n     our homeland without major threat to our national security. \n     We have grown accustomed to lives of guaranteed safety. \n     Unfortunately with this privilege, we have begun to feel \n     entitled and to neglect our responsibility as American \n     citizens. Issues of great concern are being ignored by the \n     American population as if they mean nothing. Americans are \n     sitting back and waiting for others to take action while \n     grave matters are left undebated by the American public. I \n     think back to President Kennedy's inaugural speech, and when \n     he said the famous words, ``Ask not what your country can do \n     for you--ask what you can do for your country.'' It is \n     important that we American citizens remind ourselves of these \n     words in everything we do, and to remember that our \n     government is built upon the strong, independent voices that \n     make up a democracy.\n       I don't believe there is one significant issue concerning \n     the United States that is more urgent than the rest. Each \n     issue we face is vital for our nation to address \n     appropriately. Regardless of which issue we undertake at \n     which time, the first step to solving it is to become \n     educated, and to stop ignoring problems just because they are \n     not affecting us directly. All the members of a democracy \n     must understand a conflict before it can be solved. In an age \n     where people have infinite information at their fingertips, \n     it can be easy to lose sight of important information. We \n     must be educated before we can solve our issues of today.\n       The responsibility to educate the public lies with the \n     elected members of our government. It is important for our \n     government to be straightforward and honest. It is important \n     that when there are protests and movements the voices of the \n     American people are heard and represented. Most importantly, \n     the United States Congress should set an example for \n     leadership and communication, and should inspire the people \n     of the United States through proactive legislation and \n     positive inter-party communication.\n       We are the greatest nation on earth. We are far too \n     experienced and wise to get caught up in a bipartisan \n     conflict. When we get caught up in a battle with ourselves, \n     it dejects us. The reason why the citizens of America have \n     lost a sense of American pride is because our leaders seem to \n     have lost a sense of purpose. The objective of our government \n     is to, ``Establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, \n     provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, \n     and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our \n     posterity,'' and the government should put aside their \n     personal beliefs in an effort to make that happen.\n\n\n     Taylor Devaney, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       President Obama once said that, ``The nation cannot prosper \n     long when it favors only the prosperous'', and as a young \n     Vermonter, I agree with this statement. I am concerned with \n     the state of our union due to the ever-growing, unequal \n     wealth distribution. As the rich get richer, the poor get \n     poorer, and in many situations wealth distribution gets \n     ignored. The middle class population used to be the backbone \n     of the nation, but every year it gets harder to make ends \n     meet, as they slide lower down the economic class scale. \n     America leads the world in the widest gap between the have \n     and have nots, making the idea of America being the land of \n     opportunity seem more of an unlikely dream.\n       The most recent studies from the Federal Reserve show that \n     a mere 3 percent of American families own 54 percent of the \n     wealth in the United States. The unbalanced wealth \n     distribution is dangerous for the nation as a whole. \n     Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman state that in \n     their research that the wealth distribution has grown to the \n     same levels as in the 1920's. The top 1 percent owns upwards \n     of 40 percent of the wealth in the United States. As a \n     nation, we have experienced the disastrous effects of an \n     economic crash during the Great Depression, due to unbalanced \n     wealth. We as a nation have failed to learn from our mistakes \n     and are continuing down a dangerous path. The middle class is \n     still at risk for being hurt the most, as they are left to \n     clean up the mess of the high rollers. An unfair task when \n     their wages remain stagnant, as the profits and wages soar \n     for those at the top of the corrupted corporate ladder. The \n     hard working American people do not deserve to struggle and \n     something must be done.\n       The mega-rich are not paying appropriate amount of taxes \n     for their wealth, making the middle and lower class make up \n     for the difference. Many of the people who control the tax \n     rates are also the ones who make the most. Members of \n     Congress are creating laws to benefit themselves. Big money \n     and government fit together well, for politicians look for \n     the wealthy to support them financially.\n       We can no longer only provide for wealthy men and women who \n     indirectly control our government. Creating a scaled taxation \n     system will help balance the wealth in the nation. Making \n     sure the wealthy are paying their fair share is key to \n     balancing out our nation's prosperity. The U.S. can take note \n     from the most famous, and down to Earth business from \n     Vermont, Ben & Jerry's. This company had a system of a pay \n     ratio between the highest paid employee and the lowest paid \n     employee of 5 to 1 in its early years. These numbers are \n     relatively small, but scaling them could make an impact on \n     businesses today. Unequal wealth distribution benefits only a \n     small portion of the country and will be the cause of a \n     failed economy.\n\n\n             Connor Drown, Winooski High School (Finalist)\n\n       America. Home of the brave and land of the free. It is at \n     its heart known as a free country, with opportunity just \n     waiting for someone to snatch it up for themselves. It is a \n     land where one desires the ``American\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\n     Dream.'' Unfortunately, this is not remotely possible, and \n     many citizens of the United States have difficulties living \n     in this country. The United States of America is a great \n     country to live in, if not the best, but is also far from \n     perfect.\n       Everything in America could be improved in one way or the \n     other. Education and health care are huge government issues \n     that need improvement in order to make the United States of \n     America a more suitable place to live.\n       Firstly, education in America is one of if not the most \n     important factors to a successful career and life for US \n     citizens. Getting a high school diploma is still very \n     important, but it is now becoming more and more of a \n     necessity to attend college and get a degree. According to \n     usnews.com, the value of a college degree is greater than it \n     has been in nearly half a century, at least when compared to \n     the prospect of not getting a degree. Among millennials ages \n     25 to 32, median annual earnings for fulltime working college \n     degree holders are $17,500 greater than for those with high \n     school diplomas only. The only problem is that college has \n     increasingly become less and less affordable.\n       According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition \n     and fees for the 2013-2014 academic year was $30,094 at \n     private colleges, $8,893 for state residents at public \n     colleges, and $22,203 for out-of-state residents attending \n     public universities. Most Americans don't even consider \n     public schools, which are most often referred to as the least \n     expensive, affordable. According to the Huffington Post, 62 \n     percent said they believe most people are not able to afford \n     the cost of a public college education. If the majority of \n     America could afford college to achieve their career goals, \n     America will be a better and more successful country. If \n     something such as raising taxes benefits colleges in that it \n     will be more affordable, America will have more opportunity \n     to strive for success.\n       Health care is another issue that I feel should be \n     mentioned. It is said that President Obama and the United \n     States in general wants to make healthcare more affordable to \n     everyone. Government run health care systems, such as \n     Obamacare, are free and low-cost government run programs that \n     result in higher costs and everyone receiving the same poor \n     quality health care. Health care should remain privatized so \n     that the people who may need better health care and can also \n     afford it without a huge deductible may receive it.\n       In conclusion, ensuring that health care remains the same \n     and reducing the cost of education will undeniably improve \n     America.\n\n\n         Spencer Eckert, Woodstock Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Remember when you got your first job? I'm sure it was an \n     exciting and proud moment. It could be that you weren't even \n     concerned about your hourly pay, but as time went by, I'm \n     certain that changed and you realized that you work hard and \n     want to be compensated for that. In today's society, it can \n     be hard to earn a good living wage from a ``decent'' job. But \n     for many people, they don't get good pay even when they \n     should. The low minimum wage today makes it difficult for \n     people to survive and make a living.\n       There are a number of compelling reasons to increase the \n     minimum wage. Let's begin with the economy. It's simple; \n     raising the minimum wage would have a positive effect on the \n     economy by giving workers more money to spend. It would be \n     good to raise the minimum wage to $15 because there would be \n     more money being pumped into the economy. If workers get paid \n     more, then they are happier and with a better mood they will \n     want to spend more. It gives people the confidence to spend \n     more and when they spend more they are fueling the economy. \n     ``A raise for minimum wage earners will put more money in \n     more families' pockets, which will be spent on goods and \n     services, stimulating economic growth locally and \n     nationally,'' according to the ``Minimum Wage Mythbusters.''\n       Increasing minimum wage has a positive impact on the \n     working family. It helps them to make ends meet, and at the \n     same time enables them to spend some money. When they spend \n     money, they are fueling the economy.\n       Raising the minimum wage would not cause any job loss or \n     unemployment, and most work places would not go out of \n     business if they were to raise the minimum wage. In fact \n     there would probably be less turnover. Therefore, companies \n     would reduce the amount of money they spend on training. If \n     companies compensate their employees with better wages than \n     those employees are happier and more committed to that \n     company. So raising the minimum wage can have a positive \n     effect on companies. ``Raising the minimum wage would be good \n     for our economy. A higher minimum wage not only increases \n     workers' incomes--which is sorely needed to boost demand and \n     get the economy going--but it also reduces turnover, cuts the \n     costs that low-paid employers impose on taxpayers, and pushes \n     businesses toward a high-road, high-human-capital model.'' \n     (Said T. William Lester, David Madland, and Jackie Odum, in \n     their article Raising the Minimum Wage Would Help, Not Hurt, \n     Our Economy)\n       One reason why the minimum wage should be increased to $15 \n     is because it would help a lot of people get out of the \n     poverty level. Too many people in the country who work at \n     minimum wage jobs currently depend on the government for \n     other help. People subscribe to government programs such as \n     food stamps and school breakfast and lunch programs, just to \n     name a few. ``According to a Michigan survey shows that \n     families who work at fast food businesses are much more \n     likely to enroll in safety net programs than the workforce as \n     a whole, such as food stamps.''\n       Another reason why the minimum wage should be increased to \n     $15 is because of the positive psychological benefits. It \n     would raise people's self-esteem and self-worth and would \n     also allow children in these poverty-level homes to have \n     better opportunities in the future. If these children are \n     able to improve their performance in school, then they are \n     likely to continue education which would allow them to pursue \n     better paying jobs in the future. If they have better paying \n     jobs, they are no longer on government programs and they have \n     the opportunity and confidence to spend money which fuel the \n     economy. It is a positive cycle. ``A raise in the minimum \n     wage would not only help many families escape or avoid \n     poverty, but could also significantly boost their children's \n     academic performance and future adult earnings,'' said Yannet \n     M. Lathrop, a Policy Analyst who has conducted studies on \n     raising the minimum wage.\n       There really is no downside to raising the minimum wage. \n     Raising the minimum wage to $15 would be good for employers, \n     workers, families, and the economy. Raising the minimum wage \n     would lead to these dramatic outcomes: getting families out \n     of poverty, giving children a better education and future, \n     giving employers committed workers, putting more money into \n     the economy, giving people the confidence to spend more and \n     making people happy.\n\n\n      Jacob Gallow, Missisquoi Valley Union High School (Finalist)\n\n       Jean-Jacques Rousseau stated, ``A man is born free, but \n     everywhere we are in chains.'' Freedom is something everyone \n     seeks, but most will never experience it. Given more power, \n     the government becomes a wolf among sheep. People flock to \n     the sight of freedom, only to see that even something so \n     great has its limits. Governments tend to give more things to \n     the people, things to give them a sense of security, a place \n     to sleep, somewhere to work, to do as they wish. Those things \n     come at a price, the price of freedom. The more the people \n     receive, especially on the topic of security, the more \n     liberties are contracted.\n       Are we truly free? America sits in the shadow of threats \n     every day, for there will always be some person who despises \n     the place we call home. Security is something we, as \n     Americans, take for granted. While we sit in the shadows, not \n     even aware of it, brave men and women risk their lives and \n     die every day for the security of their homeland, wishing for \n     a safe place for their friends and family to live. Yet, here \n     we sit in the symbolic country of freedom, with someone \n     always looking over our shoulder. That security we take for \n     granted tends to take away the liberties and freedoms we were \n     given many years ago. The more of a grip the government has \n     on its people, the more the people are caged.\n       Our troops are out fighting for our government, and our \n     government's wishes, but have we ever stopped to think of \n     what our own troops went through? According to Veteran's \n     Inc., around 529,000 and 840,000 veterans are homeless each \n     year, one in ten veterans are disabled related to war \n     injuries. According to CNN, 22 veterans take their own lives \n     each and every day, some resulting from PTSD, a disorder \n     soldiers get after experiencing the horrors of war. Veteran \n     unemployment rate is another issue among all of these. What \n     can we, as Americans, do to help our Veterans. We surely are \n     not doing enough, and those numbers keep climbing. What about \n     those families of soldiers, what do they have to go through \n     each and every day with a spouse, parent, or sibling off at \n     war, fighting people because our governments wants to be \n     ``involved.''\n       We don't need to be caught in everyone else's business, \n     unless it becomes our business, and if we do get involved, we \n     need to back up our soldiers first. Our country had to solve \n     our own problems in 1861-1865, let others do the same.\n       Freedom isn't really free. Here in America, we are promised \n     freedom, but the securities we receive and the democracy we \n     spread binds us in chains, not allowing us to roam free. Sure \n     there needs to be laws enforced, yes there needs to be \n     security, but we need freedom too. Our government needs to \n     focus on our country. Will we as Americans allow the \n     anaconda, known as the government, to strangle us, the \n     people, as mice?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S276-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S276-S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to honor the University of \nOregon's football team for its tremendous season. The Fighting Ducks of \nOregon accumulated 13 wins with only 2 losses this year, which accounts \nfor the most wins in team history. This season culminated with the \nDucks winning their 11th Pac-12 Conference championship, playing in the \nfirst NCAA college football playoff, winning their third-ever Rose Bowl \nand reaching the National Championship game. It is truly a great year \nto be a Duck.\n  Recognition should not only be given to this football team's success \non the\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\nfield but also to the hard work and effort demonstrated by players, \ncoaches, and staff off the field. From volunteering at local \nafterschool programs to honoring our military, members of the Oregon \nDucks football team have shown dedication and commitment to their \nschool and their community.\n  Special recognition should go to head coach Mark Helfrich--a native \nOregonian--for leading this group of young men to success on and off \nthe field. I am also proud to honor Oregon quarterback Marcus Mariota \nfor winning the University of Oregon's first Heisman Trophy. Marcus is \nthe first athlete of Polynesian descent to win this award, which makes \nhim the pride of his home State of Hawaii. His acceptance speech during \nthe Heisman Trophy presentation was truly moving. I am proud to watch \nhim represent the University with such class.\n  The Oregon Ducks have seen tremendous success throughout this 2014 \nseason, scoring an average of 45.4 points per game, 90 total \ntouchdowns, and amassing more than 3,000 total yards rushing. Marcus \nMariota set a school record for single-season passing yards--more than \n4,400 yards in 15 games--and, following completion of the regular \nseason, two members of the Oregon football team were honored as first-\nteam All-Americans by the Associated Press.\n  It has been a remarkable season all around, and I look forward to \nmore years watching Coach Helfrich encourage his players to win the \nday. Go Ducks!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S277-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S277-S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF \n                   CONGRESS ON JANUARY 20, 2015--PM 1\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was ordered to lie on the \ntable:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow \nAmericans:\n  We are 15 years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with \nterror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation \nfighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread \nacross our Nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time \nfor many.\n  But tonight, we turn the page.\n  Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is \ngrowing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. Our \nunemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. \nMore of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people \nare insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign \noil as we've been in almost 30 years.\n  Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in \nAfghanistan is over. Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops \nserved in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we \nsalute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 \nGeneration who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful \nfor your service.\n  America, for all that we've endured; for all the grit and hard work \nrequired to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:\n  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the state of the Union is \nstrong.\n  At this moment--with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling \nindustry, and booming energy production--we have risen from recession \nfreer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now \nup to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for \ndecades to come.\n  Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly \nwell? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising \nincomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\n  Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly \nconflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will \nwe lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats \nand protect our planet?\n  Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against \none another--or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has \nalways propelled America forward?\n  In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas \nthat are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll \ncrisscross the country making a case for those ideas.\n  So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and \nfocus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.\n  It begins with our economy.\n  Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds. \nShe waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was \non the way.\n  They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much \nbetter than that.\n  ``If only we had known,'' Rebekah wrote to me last spring, ``what was \nabout to happen to the housing and construction market.''\n  As the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs \nhe could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of \ntime. Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, \nand retrained for a new career. They sacrificed for each other. And \nslowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second \nson, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben is back in \nconstruction--and home for dinner every night.\n  ``It is amazing,'' Rebekah wrote, ``what you can bounce back from \nwhen you have to . . . we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made \nit through some very, very hard times.''\n  We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, \nvery hard times.\n  America, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the \nmillions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and \nretooled. You are the reason I ran for this office. You're the people I \nwas thinking of 6 years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, \nwhen I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild \nour economy on a new foundation. And it's been your effort and \nresilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge \nstronger.\n  We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new \njobs to our shores. And over the past 5 years, our businesses have \ncreated more than 11 million new jobs.\n  We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect \nour planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is \nnumber one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much \nsolar power as we did in all of 2008. And thanks to lower gas prices \nand higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save \n$750 at the pump.\n  We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. \nAnd today, our younger students have earned the highest math and \nreading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an \nall-time high. And more Americans finish college than ever before.\n  We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, \nshield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition. Today, we \nhave new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer \nwatchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card \npractices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured \nAmericans finally gained the security of health coverage.\n  At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too \nambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, \nwe've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits \ncut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care \ninflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.\n  So the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works. Expanding \nopportunity works. And these policies will continue to work, as long as \npolitics don't get in the way. We can't slow down businesses or put our \neconomy at risk with Government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't \nput the security of families at risk by taking away their health \ninsurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting \npast battles on immigration when we've got a system to fix. And if a \nbill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will \nearn my veto.\n  Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nmore lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more \nsmall business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any \ntime since 2007. But here's the thing--those of us here tonight, we \nneed to set our sights higher than just making sure Government doesn't \nhalt the progress we're making. We need to do more than just do no \nharm. Tonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard \nwork and growing opportunity for every American.\n  Because families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are \nworking as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so \nthey can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Basic childcare \nfor Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much \nas a year at the University of Minnesota. Like millions of hardworking \nAmericans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that \nwe look for more ways to help families get ahead.\n  In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, \nthis country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and \nto make sure everyone gets a fair shot. We set up worker protections, \nSocial Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the \nharshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, \ninfrastructure and the internet--tools they needed to go as far as \ntheir effort will take them.\n  That's what middle-class economics is--the idea that this country \ndoes best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair \nshare, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. We don't just want \neveryone to share in America's success--we want everyone to contribute \nto our success.\n  So what does middle-class economics require in our time?\n  First--middle-class economics means helping working families feel \nmore secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks \nafford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement--and my \nbudget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working \nfamilies and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each \nyear.\n  Here's one example. During World War II, when men like my grandfather \nwent off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was \na national security priority--so this country provided universal \nchildcare. In today's economy, when having both parents in the \nworkforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need \naffordable, high-quality childcare more than ever. It's not a nice-to-\nhave--it's a must-have. It's time we stop treating childcare as a side \nissue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic \npriority that it is for all of us. And that's why my plan will make \nquality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every \nmiddle-class and low-income family with young children in America--by \ncreating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per \nyear.\n\n  Here's another example. Today, we're the only advanced country on \nEarth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to \nour workers. Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave. \nForty-three million. Think about that. And that forces too many parents \nto make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at \nhome. So I'll be taking new action to help States adopt paid leave laws \nof their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot \nlast November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington. Send me \na bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven \ndays of paid sick leave. It's the right thing to do.\n  Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. \nThat's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a \nwoman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work. Really. It's \n2015. It's time. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime \nthey've earned. And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to \nraise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work \nfull-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it. \nIf not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America \na raise.\n  These ideas won't make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship. \nThat's not the job of Government. To give working families a fair shot, \nwe'll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings \nand recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's \nlong-term interest. We still need laws that strengthen rather than \nweaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child \ncare and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums \nand a higher minimum wage--these ideas will make a meaningful \ndifference in the lives of millions of families. That is a fact. And \nthat's what all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--were sent here \nto do.\n  Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, \nwe have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.\n  America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, \nsent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in \nthe world. But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like \nnever before, we need to do more.\n  By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require \nsome higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a \ncountry where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the \neducation they need. It's not fair to them, and it's not smart for our \nfuture.\n  That's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the \ncost of community college--to zero.\n  Forty percent of our college students choose community college. Some \nare young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better \njob. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back \ninto the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to \ngraduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, \nyou've got to earn it--you've got to keep your grades up and graduate \non time. Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a \ncity with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community \ncollege is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America, so \nthat 2 years of college becomes as free and universal in America as \nhigh school is today. And I want to work with this Congress, to make \nsure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their \nmonthly payments, so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams.\n  Thanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job \ntraining system, we're connecting community colleges with local \nemployers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and \nnursing, and robotics. Tonight, I'm also asking more businesses to \nfollow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more \neducational benefits and paid apprenticeships--opportunities that give \nworkers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don't have a \nhigher education.\n  And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every \nopportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend. Already, \nwe've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to \nthe highest quality care. We're slashing the backlog that had too many \nveterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we're making \nit easier for vets to translate their training and experience into \ncivilian jobs. Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by \nMichelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and \nmilitary spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me \nrepeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, hire a \nveteran.\n  Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to \nkeep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.\n  Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, \nJapan, and all advanced economies combined. Our manufacturers have \nadded almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our \nauto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans \nwho work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago--jobs at \ncompanies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.\n  So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs \nof the future. But we do know we want them here in America. That's why \nthe third part of middle-class economics is about\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\nbuilding the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where \nbusinesses want to locate and hire.\n  Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure--\nmodern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. \nDemocrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our \nsights higher than a single oil pipeline. Let's pass a bipartisan \ninfrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many \njobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.\n  Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to \nsell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more \nthan ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as \nwe speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest-\ngrowing region. That would put our workers and businesses at a \ndisadvantage. Why would we let that happen? We should write those \nrules. We should level the playing field. That's why I'm asking both \nparties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American \nworkers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren't \njust free, but fair.\n  Look, I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always \nlived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries that \nbreak the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers \nlive outside our borders, and we can't close ourselves off from those \nopportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said \nthey're actively looking at bringing jobs back from China. Let's give \nthem one more reason to get it done.\n  Twenty-first century businesses will rely on American science, \ntechnology, research and development. I want the country that \neliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of \nmedicine--one that delivers the right treatment at the right time, in \nsome patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a \ndisease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I'm launching a new \nPrecision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases \nlike cancer and diabetes--and to give all of us access to the \npersonalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families \nhealthier.\n  I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to \nevery classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest \nnetworks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and \nentrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.\n  I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that \nunleash new jobs--converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating \nrevolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his \ncountry can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System \nnot just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new \nspacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send \nAmerican astronauts to Mars. In two months, to prepare us for those \nmissions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space. Good luck, \nCaptain--and make sure to Instagram it.\n  Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and \nbasic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this chamber. \nMembers of both parties have told me so. Where we too often run onto \nthe rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't \nmind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, \ntoo. But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with \nloopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full \nfreight. They've riddled it with giveaways the superrich don't need, \ndenying a break to middle class families who do.\n  This year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close \nloopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and \nreward those that invest in America. Let's use those savings to rebuild \nour infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring \njobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small business owner \nfile based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of \naccountants she can afford. And let's close the loopholes that lead to \ninequality by allowing the top 1 percent to avoid paying taxes on their \naccumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for \nchildcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly \nhelps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and \nwe can achieve that together.\n  Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools \nthey need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the \nconditions for growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs \nto go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will \nmake our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep \ninto the century ahead.\n  Of course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's \nthat we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our \nshores.\n  My first duty as Commander in Chief is to defend the United States of \nAmerica. In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the \nworld, but how. When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines \ninstead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is \nto send in our military--then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary \nconflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more \nprosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do.\n  I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when \nwe combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our \npower with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind us to \nthe opportunities that this new century presents. That's exactly what \nwe're doing right now--and around the globe, it is making a difference.\n  First, we stand united with people around the world who've been \ntargeted by terrorists--from a school in Pakistan to the streets of \nParis. We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their \nnetworks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we've done \nrelentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a \ndirect threat to us and our allies.\n  At the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 \nyears.\n  Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've \ntrained their security forces, who've now taken the lead, and we've \nhonored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first \ndemocratic transition. Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, \nwe're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny \nsafe haven to terrorists who threaten America. In Iraq and Syria, \nAmerican leadership--including our military power--is stopping ISIL's \nadvance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the \nMiddle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, \nto degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We're also \nsupporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this \neffort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt \nideology of violent extremism. This effort will take time. It will \nrequire focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this \nCongress to show the world that we are united in this mission by \npassing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\n  Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and \ndiplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't \nbully the small--by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine's \ndemocracy, and reassuring our NATO allies. Last year, as we were doing \nthe hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some \nsuggested that Mr. Putin's aggression was a masterful display of \nstrategy and strength. Well, today, it is America that stands strong \nand united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy \nin tatters.\n  That's how America leads--not with bluster, but with persistent, \nsteady resolve.\n  In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration \ndate. When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to \ntry something new. Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a \nlegacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for \nrestrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the \nhand of friendship to the Cuban people. And this year, Congress should \nbegin the work of ending the embargo. As His Holiness, Pope Francis, \nhas said, diplomacy is the work of ``small steps.''\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nThese small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba. And \nafter years in prison, we're overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he \nbelongs. Welcome home, Alan.\n  Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first \ntime in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and \nreduced its stockpile of nuclear material. Between now and this spring, \nwe have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a \nnuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies--including Israel; \nwhile avoiding yet another Middle East conflict. There are no \nguarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on \nthe table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this \nCongress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy \nfails--alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran \nstarts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. That is why \nI will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this \nprogress. The American people expect us to only go to war as a last \nresort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.\n  Third, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the \npast to shape the coming century.\n  No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our \nnetworks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American \nfamilies, especially our kids. We are making sure our Government \nintegrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done \nto combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass \nthe legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-\nattacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. \nIf we don't act, we'll leave our Nation and our economy vulnerable. If \nwe do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed \nuntold opportunities for people around the globe.\n  In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses \nand healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola--saving countless lives \nand stopping the spread of disease. I couldn't be prouder of them, and \nI thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts. But \nthe job is not yet done--and the world needs to use this lesson to \nbuild a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future \npandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.\n  In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure \nthat other nations play by the rules--in how they trade, how they \nresolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common \ninternational challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief. And \nno challenge--no challenge--poses a greater threat to future \ngenerations than climate change. 2014 was the planet's warmest year on \nrecord. Now, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does--14 of the 15 \nwarmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this \ncentury.\n  I've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not \nscientists; that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm not \na scientist, either. But you know what--I know a lot of really good \nscientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities. The best \nscientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are \nchanging the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we'll continue \nto see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and \nfloods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, \nconflict, and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate \nchange poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act \nlike it.\n  That's why, over the past 6 years, we've done more than ever before \nto combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we \nuse it. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than \nany administration in history. And that's why I will not let this \nCongress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock \non our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives \ninternational action. In Beijing, we made an historic announcement--the \nUnited States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, \nand China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. \nAnd because the world's two largest economies came together, other \nnations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the \nworld will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've \ngot.\n  There's one last pillar to our leadership--and that's the example of \nour values.\n  As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, \nwhich is why I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use \nof new technology like drones is properly constrained. It's why we \nspeak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in \ncertain parts of the world. It's why we continue to reject offensive \nstereotypes of Muslims--the vast majority of whom share our commitment \nto peace. That's why we defend free speech, and advocate for political \nprisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious \nminorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. \nWe do these things not only because they're right, but because they \nmake us safer.\n  As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice--so it makes \nno sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a \nprison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit. Since \nI've been President, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of \nGTMO in half. Now it's time to finish the job. And I will not relent in \nmy determination to shut it down. It's not who we are.\n  As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties--and we need to uphold \nthat commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and \nindustry in our fight against terrorist networks. So while some have \nmoved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven't. As \npromised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the \nrecommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and \nbuild more safeguards against potential abuse. And next month, we'll \nissue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country \nsafe while strengthening privacy.\n  Looking to the future instead of the past. Making sure we match our \npower with diplomacy, and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet \nnew challenges and opportunities. Leading--always--with the example of \nour values. That's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us \nstrong. And that's why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the \nhighest of standards--our own.\n  You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I \nsaid there wasn't a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black \nAmerica or a white America--but a United States of America. I said this \nbecause I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone \nlike me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races \nand customs; because I made Illinois my home--a state of small towns, \nrich farmland, and one of the world's great cities; a microcosm of the \ncountry where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people \nof every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.\n  Over the past 6 years, the pundits have pointed out more than once \nthat my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they \nsay, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as \nproof not just of my own flaws--of which there are many--but also as \nproof that the vision itself is misguided, and naive, and that there \nare too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship \nand gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.\n  I know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the \ncynics are wrong.\n  I still believe that we are one people. I still believe that \ntogether, we can do great things, even when the odds are long. I \nbelieve this because over and over in my 6 years in office, I have seen \nAmerica at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates \nfrom New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, \nAnnapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I've mourned with grieving \nfamilies in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West \nVirginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf \nCoast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-\nAtlantic seaboard. I've seen something like gay marriage go from a \nwedge issue used to drive us apart to a\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nstory of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in States \nthat seven in ten Americans call home.\n  So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the \nAmerican people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother's \nkeeper, and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those of us who \nserve here to set a better example.\n  So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, \ncan better reflect America's hopes. I've served in Congress with many \nof you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, \non both sides of the aisle. And many of you have told me that this \nisn't what you signed up for--arguing past each other on cable shows, \nthe constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the \nbase will react to every decision.\n  Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we \ndid something different.\n  Understand--a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their \nagenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.\n  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic \ndecency instead of our basest fears.\n  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each \nother; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, \nrather than ``gotcha'' moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake \ncontroversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives.\n  A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark \nmoney for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting \nyoung people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking \nthem to join in the great mission of building America.\n  If we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments--but let's \nmake them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.\n  We still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely we \ncan agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are \nnearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the \nhealth care she needs.\n  Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see \nsomething of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no \none benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that \nit's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of \nlaws and a nation of immigrants.\n  We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the \nright to vote is sacred; that it's being denied to too many; and that, \non this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery \nand the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single \nAmerican.\n  We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. \nBut surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home \nwithout being harassed. Surely we can understand the wife who won't \nrest until the police officer she married walks through the front door \nat the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it's a good thing that for \nthe first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate \nhave come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats \nand Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform \nAmerica's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us \nall.\n  That's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. \nThat's how we move this country forward. That's what the American \npeople want. That's what they deserve.\n  I have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda for the next 2 years \nis the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the \nsteps of this Capitol--to do what I believe is best for America. If you \nshare the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand. \nIf you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me \nwhere you do agree. And I commit to every Republican here tonight that \nI will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to \nmake this country stronger.\n  Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth--that \nfor all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the \nstrength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common \neffort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other \nside of the world.\n  I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your \nlife matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as \nwe are for our own kids.\n  I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our \ndifferences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity \nand worth of every citizen--man and woman, young and old, black and \nwhite, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and \nstraight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.\n  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we \nstill know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red \nStates and blue States; that we are the United States of America.\n  I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah \ncan sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up \nthese past 6 years:\n  ``It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to . . . \nwe are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, \nvery hard times.''\n  My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, \nhave made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new \ncentury, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun \nagain the work of remaking America. We've laid a new foundation. A \nbrighter future is ours to write. Let's begin this new chapter--\ntogether--and let's start the work right now.\n  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, January 20, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/20/senate-section/article/S281-1", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 240.

A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code to clarify \nthe rule allowing discharge as a nonpriority claim of governmental \nclaims arising from the disposition of farm assets under chapter 12 \nbankruptcies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Franken, the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of \n2015. I thank Senator Franken for his work on this bill and for his \nsupport. We introduced identical legislation in the 113th Congress and \nsimilar legislation in the 112 Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate has \nnever had the opportunity to consider these bills and the problem we \nseek to correct.\n  This bipartisan bill addresses the 2012 United States Supreme Court \ncase Hall v. United States. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled \nthat a provision I inserted into the 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention \nand Consumer Protection Act didn't accomplish what we in Congress \nintended. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 \ncorrects this and clarifies that bankrupt family farmers reorganizing \ntheir debts are able to treat capital gains taxes owed to a \ngovernmental unit, arising from the sale of farm assets during a \nbankruptcy, as general unsecured claims. This bill will remove the \nInternal Revenue Service's veto power over a bankruptcy reorganization \nplan's confirmation, giving the family farmer a chance to reorganize \nsuccessfully.\n  In 1986 Congress enacted Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code to provide \na specialized bankruptcy process for family farmers. In 2005 Chapter 12 \nwas made permanent. Between 1986 and 2005 we learned what aspects \nworked and didn't work for family farmers reorganizing in bankruptcy. \nOne problematic area was where a family farmer needed to sell assets in \norder to generate cash for the reorganization. Specifically, a family \nfarmer would have to sell portions of the farm to generate cash to fund \na reorganization plan so that the creditors could receive payment. \nUnfortunately, in situations like this, the family farmer is selling \nland that has been owned for a very long time, with a very low cost \nbasis. Thus, when the land is sold, the family farmer is hit with a \nsubstantial capital gains tax, which is owed to the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  Under the Bankruptcy Code, taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service \nreceive priority treatment. Holders of priority claims must receive \npayment in full, unless the claim holder agrees to be treated \ndifferently. This creates problems for the family farmer who needs the \ncash to pay creditors to reorganize. However, since the Internal \nRevenue Service has the ability to require full payment, they hold veto \npower over a plan's confirmation, which means in many instances the \nplan will not be confirmed. This does not make sense if the goal is to \ngive the family farmer a fresh start. Thus, in 2005 Congress said that \nin these limited situations, the taxes owed to the Internal Revenue \nService would be\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\nstripped of their priority and treated as general unsecured debt. This \nremoved the government's veto power over plan confirmation and paved \nthe way for family farmers to reorganize.\n  Unfortunately, in Hall v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that \ndespite Congress's express goal of helping family farmers, the language \ninserted into the Bankruptcy Code in 2005 conflicted with the Tax Code. \nThe Hall case was one of statutory interpretation. There is no question \nwhat Congress was trying to do; rather, did Congress use the correct \nlanguage? My goal, along with others at the time, was to relieve family \nfarmers from having their reorganization plans fail because of huge tax \nliabilities to the Federal Government. Justice Breyer noted this in the \ndissent: ``Congress was concerned about the effect on the farmer of \ncollecting capital gains tax debts that arose during (and were \nconnected with) the Chapter 12 proceedings themselves. . . . The \nmajority does not deny the importance of Congress' objective. Rather, \nit feels compelled to hold that Congress put the Amendment in the wrong \nplace.'' Hall v. United States, 132 S.Ct. 1882, 1897, 2012.\n  As a result of the Hall case, family farmers facing bankruptcy now \nfind themselves caught in a tough spot. The rules have now been changed \nand must be corrected in order to provide certainty and clarity in the \nlaw. The Family Farmer Bankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 will \nprovide the clarity needed to help family farmers.\n  This bill adds a new section 1232 to title 11 of the United States \nCode. This new section, along with other conforming changes to the \nBankruptcy Code, gives guidance and certainty to debtors, \npractitioners, and courts as to how these claims are to be treated \nduring bankruptcy. I am pleased that the bill we are introducing today \nwill help family farmers who are facing hard times. The Family Farmer \nBankruptcy Clarification Act of 2015 ensures that what Congress sought \nto do in 2005 actually occurs.

Res. 29\n\n       Whereas, on January 7, 2015, armed gunmen violently \n     attacked the offices of the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo in \n     Paris,\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n     killing 12 people and injuring at least 11 others;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 2015, two suspects in the Charlie \n     Hebdo attack were killed after taking hostages in a printing \n     firm and firing at police;\n       Whereas, on January 9, 2015, another gunman perpetrated an \n     anti-Semitic attack on Hyper Cacher, a kosher supermarket, \n     killing four of 19 hostages before French police stormed the \n     building and rescued the surviving hostages;\n       Whereas President of the Republic of France Francois \n     Hollande condemned these events as a terrorist attack on the \n     French Republic as a whole and called for a day of national \n     mourning to honor the lives of the courageous political \n     cartoonists, columnists, police officers, and others who were \n     killed and injured;\n       Whereas the Republic of France is America's oldest ally, \n     and the people of the United States owe France an eternal \n     debt of gratitude for our independence and freedom;\n       Whereas the people and Governments of the Republic of \n     France and the United States have stood shoulder to shoulder \n     throughout history to defend our shared democratic ideals and \n     values;\n       Whereas the people of the Republic of France have always \n     expressed solidarity with the people of the United States, \n     including following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, which claimed the lives of thousands of innocent \n     civilians in the United States;\n       Whereas United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, \n     together with the President of the United Nations General \n     Assembly and the United Nations Security Council, has \n     expressed outrage over these cold-blooded and unjustifiable \n     terrorist attacks in Paris;\n       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted \n     by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, \n     holds that ``everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and \n     expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions \n     without interference and to seek, receive and impart \n     information and ideas through any media and regardless of \n     frontiers'';\n       Whereas the show of solidarity from hundreds of thousands \n     of people in the Republic of France, the United States, and \n     worldwide under the banner ``Je suis Charlie'' (``I am \n     Charlie'') makes known that the international community of \n     nations stands together to reaffirm freedom of expression and \n     to denounce terrorism;\n       Whereas Muslim majority nations around the world, including \n     Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Malaysia, Morocco, Iran, \n     Lebanon, Indonesia, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria, and Qatar, and \n     leading institutions such as the Arab League, Egypt's al-\n     Azhar University and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation \n     have all condemned and rejected these terrorist attacks as \n     contrary to the Islamic faith;\n       Whereas, on Sunday, January 11, 2015, more than 40 world \n     leaders and 1,000,000 people gathered to march in Paris \n     honoring the victims of the terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the outpouring of support from people around the \n     world reveals that an attack on the free press in the \n     Republic of France is an attack on human liberties;
