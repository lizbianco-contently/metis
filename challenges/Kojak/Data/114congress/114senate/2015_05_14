Mr. President, I was glad to see our Democratic \nfriends accept our path forward on trade yesterday. Under our plan, the \nSenate will avoid the poison pills that had been floated in favor of \nthe very type of bipartisan approach we have been advocating for all \nalong. It follows the regular order. It allows Senators to express \nthemselves without endangering more American trade jobs for the people \nwe represent.\n  So this is good news. It is good news for bipartisanship. It is good \nnews for a new Congress that is getting back to work. And it is good \nnews for America's middle class.\n  The people we represent deserve the kind of good jobs we could secure \nby knocking down unfair trade barriers. One estimate shows that trade \nagreements with Europe and the Pacific could support as many as 1.4 \nmillion additional jobs here in our country. In Kentucky, they can \nsupport more than 18,000 additional jobs.\n  But we can't get there without first passing the kind of legislation \nwe will vote to open debate on this afternoon. It is the only way to \nenact clear standards and guidelines that our trade negotiators need to \nmove forward, and that Congress needs to appropriately assert its \nauthority in this area.\n  So yesterday's agreement is significant. I thank Chairman Hatch and \nhis negotiating partners for the good, bipartisan cooperation that got \nus to where we are.\n  I would like to thank the President, too. No, you are not hearing \nthings. President Obama has done his country a service by taking on his \nbase and pushing back on some of the more ridiculous rhetoric we have \nheard. He was right to remind everyone that ``you don't make change \nthrough slogans'' or ``ignoring realities.'' He should be recognized \nfor it.\n  The American people sent a divided government to Washington. But it \ndoesn't mean they don't want us to work together on issues where we can \nagree. And on this issue, we do agree.\n  Today's vote brings us closer to achieving a positive outcome for the \npeople we represent. I look forward to continued positive engagement \nfrom both the President and Members of both parties as we move forward \non these bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2897-6", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2897-S2898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is good to see forward momentum on \ntrade. That is certainly good for the American people. But there are \nother issues that both parties should want to address, too, such as the \nbroken promises of ObamaCare. It would be nice to see more bipartisan \nsupport there, and I hope we will at some point, because we all know \nthat ObamaCare is a law filled--literally filled--with broken promises. \nWe all keep seeing reminders of how it failed so many of the same \npeople we were told it would help.\n  Back in my State in Kentucky, we are seeing how hospitals and their \npatients are feeling the negative effects of this partisan law. That is \nparticularly true in the rural areas of my State. A recent report \nshowed that ObamaCare's multibillion-dollar attack on hospitals in \nKentucky is expected to result in a net loss of $1 billion over the \nnext few years--a net loss to Kentucky hospitals of $1 billion over the \nnext few years.\n  These hospitals are expected to lose more money under ObamaCare than \nthey are expected to gain in new revenue from the Medicaid expansion. \nAnd, largely due to ObamaCare, these losses are forcing Kentucky \nhospitals to cut jobs, reduce or freeze wages, and, in some instances, \neven close altogether. We have lost at least two rural critical-access \nhospitals this year.\n  Officials report that Kentucky hospitals are suffering partly because \nmore than three out of every four Kentuckians who signed up for \nObamaCare were in fact put on Medicaid, and we know that Medicaid \nreimburses hospitals for less than it costs to treat patients.\n  So despite promises that greater access to coverage would decrease \nvisits to the emergency room and the cost associated with those visits, \nthe vast majority of emergency room doctors now say they have actually \nexperienced a surge--a surge--in patients visiting the ER since \nObamaCare came into effect.\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\n  In fact, a recent survey reported that thousands of ER doctors have \nactually seen an increase in emergency room visits since the start of \nlast year. One physician from Lexington was quoted as saying he had \nseen ``a huge backlog in the ER because the volume has increased.'' He \nwent on to say that ER volume rose by almost a fifth in the first few \nmonths of this year, which is nearly double--nearly double--what he saw \nlast year in the same period.\n  There are a lot of reasons for these increases, but as one ER \nphysician put it, ``visits are going up despite the ACA, and in a lot \nof cases because of it.''\n  Volume in the ER is driven as a result of coverage expansion, adding \na lot of new people, that has largely been born by the Medicaid \nprogram. As I have said previously, though, increasing coverage doesn't \nguarantee access to care, and prior to Medicaid expansion, Kentucky \nalready faced a shortage of physicians participating in Medicaid. Now, \nthere are more than 300,000 additional enrollees--adding 300,000 new \npeople to an already broken system. So when Americans on Medicaid get \nsick and can't find a doctor, who will treat the Medicaid patients? \nWhere do they end up? Of course, in the emergency room.\n  Here is how one Kentucky newspaper described it last year:\n\n       That's just the opposite of what many people expected under \n     ObamaCare, particularly because one of the goals of health \n     reform was to reduce pressure on emergency rooms by expanding \n     Medicaid and giving poor people better access to primary \n     care.\n       Instead [what is happening], many hospitals in Kentucky and \n     across the nation are seeing a surge of those newly insured \n     Medicaid patients walking right into emergency rooms.\n\n  One Kentucky doctor described it as a ``perfect storm''--a perfect \nstorm. ``We've given people an ATM card,'' he said, ``in a town with no \nATMs.''\n  Given ObamaCare's most famous broken promise about Americans being \nable to keep the health plans they liked, it is easy to see how a \nperson who had access to good insurance and quality care before \nObamaCare would find himself or herself forced onto Medicaid and into \nthe emergency room today. A recent report found that among certain \nhospitals in Kentucky, as many as one in five individuals covered by \nMedicaid had previously had private health insurance.\n  So, unfortunately, it wasn't hard to see this coming. A lot of us \nwarned about it. We warned that providing supposed health coverage, \nwithout actually giving someone access to health care, is really just a \nhollow promise. You could promise coverage, but it doesn't mean \nanything if there is nobody there to care for the people who are \ncovered.\n  The same could be said of warnings regarding the impact of \nObamaCare's deep Medicare cuts and the impact of that on hospitals. I \nwish the politicians who rammed ObamaCare through over the objections \nof the American people had heeded these warnings. We made all these \nwarnings 6 years ago.\n  So this is just one more reminder why ObamaCare is bad for Kentucky, \nwhy it is bad for the middle class, and why it is bad for our country.\n  But here is the good news. The new Congress just passed a balanced \nbudget this week with legislative tools that will allow us to begin to \naddress ObamaCare's broken promises. I hope President Obama and our \ncolleagues across the aisle will work with us to do so.\n  We owe the American people more than ObamaCare's broken promises. We \nowe them real health reform that lowers costs and increases choice.\n  I hope our friends across the aisle will work with us in a bipartisan \nway to help achieve that important outcome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2898-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the House of Representatives voted \noverwhelmingly--with approximately 330 votes--to end the bulk \ncollection of Americans' phone records. Last week a Federal court, the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that the Federal Government's \nbulk collection program is illegal.\n  The majority leader seems prepared to lead the Senate into \nreauthorizing an illegal program. He has spoken here on the floor in \nthat regard. So how can one reauthorize something that is illegal?\n  This is not a partisan issue. Democrats and Republicans are united in \nfavor of reforming the National Security Agency and how they collect \ntheir data.\n  The House, yesterday, as I indicated, voted in favor of reform, \noverwhelmingly, but Republicans in the Senate want to move forward \nwithout making any changes. I don't think so.\n  The Republican leader is isolated in his desire for a clean extension \nof illegal spying programs. For example, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the House of Representatives, Mr. Goodlatte, said \nyesterday that if the House gets an extension of FISA--the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act--it will go nowhere. It is dead, \naccording to the chairman.\n  Republicans and Democrats have vowed to filibuster a clean extension \nif the Republican leader brings one to the floor. That is what is going \nto happen here in the Senate. I have heard extended statements by the \njunior Senator from Kentucky, who said that. There are others who feel \nthe same way. Even if my friend plows forward in the face of what the \nbipartisan opposition is to this matter, it will take at least a week \nto secure the vote. And maybe that isn't even possible.\n  We have a chance to take bipartisan action that protects Americans' \ncivil liberties. It would be irresponsible for us to squander this \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2898-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMTRAK TRAIN DERAILMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, my heart goes out to \nthose who suffered in the terrible accident of Amtrak's Northeast \nRegional Train No. 188, on Tuesday night at 9 p.m., when the accident \noccurred. As we now know, the train was going more than 100 miles an \nhour on a curve where it should have been going 50 miles an hour.\n  It is very tragic. Seven people died and scores are injured. There \nwere about 250 people on the train. It is unfortunate that sometimes it \ntakes an event such as this before policymakers learn what they need to \nlearn. But worse still would be if policymakers fail to learn anything \nat all.\n  National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said there \nis technology available called positive train control that would have \nprevented this accident. That technology is in place in a few places in \nthe Northeast corridor. This Northeast corridor, millions of people \ntravel there, but it is not yet in place where the accident happened.\n  There are Members of the Republican Senate who have for years \ndenigrated, belittled, and harmed the Amtrak system. I have watched \nthis, and it is really unfair. They attack Amtrak every year, every \nappropriations process. Many on the far right regularly try to punch \nthe Nation's train system right in the gut. They have made it a \npunching bag.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives approved a bill that \nunderfunds Amtrak by another one-quarter of a billion dollars. The day \nafter that tragic accident, they say: We are going to help Amtrak by \ncutting spending by another one-quarter of a billion dollars.\n  A nation's train system can be efficient and productive. It can be a \npoint of national pride, but too often neglect of Amtrak has left \nAmerica's train system a disappointing embarrassment. Amtrak is a vital \npart of our Nation's economy, and everyone should understand that. It \nhelps--I repeat--millions and millions of people get where they need to \ngo. It takes cars off congested highways. It takes people away from \nairports.\n  For the safety of rail passengers, for the business it helps to \nfoster, and for the reputation of our great Nation, I hope we can learn \nto invest more in this important national resource. They need more, not \nless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2898-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2898-S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend, the Republican leader, must be in \ndenial to come to the floor and talk\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nabout ObamaCare the way he did. He is neglecting the facts. I will only \nrepeat a few of them.\n  No. 1, there are 17 million people who now have health insurance who \ndidn't. Using his own numbers, he said: One out of every five people \nwho went to the emergency room in Kentucky had insurance, private \ninsurance. Four-fifths of them had no insurance. They have it now. That \nsays it all.\n  Rather than cut Medicare and cut Medicaid, as in the Republican \nbudget--they should not be doing that. The reason there are long \nwaiting lines is because Republicans are not helping us fund Medicare \nand Medicaid in an appropriate fashion.\n  The late Senator Ted Kennedy once said: ``An essential part of our \nprogressive vision is an America where no citizen of any age fears the \ncost of health care.''\n  We are not there yet, but since the Affordable Care Act became law, \nthat vision has become more of a reality every day. The facts are \nindisputable. Health care costs are growing at a historically low rate.\n  The overall health of Americans is improving, and health care \nproviders are now finding innovative ways to reduce health care \nspending while improving the quality of care that patients have.\n  Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that \na key pilot program created by the Affordable Care Act saved Medicare \nalmost $400 million in 2 years. This is good news.\n  The Pioneer accountable care organization model was launched by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services in an effort to improve \nhealth care delivery and payment options.\n  An independent evaluation of this model shows an average of about \n$300 in savings per beneficiary every year. Rather than being a model, \nit should cover all patients. Right now this model is serving more than \n600,000 Americans.\n  The idea is called accountable care. Accountable care organizations \ntie provider reimbursements to quality metrics and reductions in the \ntotal cost of care for patients--better care, less costs.\n  What is most remarkable about this program is that huge savings are \nbeing achieved without threatening the quality of care the patients \nreceive. In fact, the quality of care is improving.\n  Medicare beneficiaries within the Pioneer accountable care \norganization model have reported more timely care and improved \ncommunication with the health care providers. They now have an ability \nto understand what is happening to their health care. Their questions \nare being answered. These patients use inpatient hospital services less \nand have fewer tests and have fewer procedures. That is what it is all \nabout.\n  Last week's announcement shows that the Affordable Care Act is \nworking, to the tune of $400 million.\n  Can you imagine the impact this pilot program will have on health \ncare costs when it is expanded? It is true that we have more work to do \nto ensure quality affordable health care for every American. These \nreports show Senator Kennedy's vision for America's health care system \nis beginning to become a reality.\n  Mr. President, would you be kind enough to announce the business of \nthe day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2899-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to honor Cascade County Deputy \nSheriff Joe Dunn, a dedicated public servant who died in the line of \nduty on August 14, 2014.\n  On behalf of all Montanans, I want to thank Deputy Dunn for his \nservice to our Nation and to the community of Great Falls, MT. Before \nenlisting to serve and protect his neighbors as a deputy sheriff, Joe \nDunn served our Nation in the U.S. Marine Corps and deployed to the \nbattlefields of Afghanistan.\n  Upon returning to Montana, Deputy Dunn married the love of his life, \nRobynn. They had two children, Joey and Shiloh, who were the center of \nhis universe. Deputy Dunn's deep commitment to Jesus and his love for \nhis family were the guiding principles in which he lived his life.\n  Montana's leaders have permanently honored the life and service of \nDeputy Dunn by naming an 8-mile stretch of Interstate 15 outside of \nGreat Falls, MT. It is named the Joseph J. Dunn Memorial Highway.\n  On May 15, 2015, Peace Officers Memorial Day, Deputy Dunn's name will \nbe enshrined forever alongside 273 other brave peace officers who were \nkilled in the line of duty.\n  During his lifetime of service, Deputy Dunn always went beyond the \ncall of duty to ensure the safety of those he served, often working the \nevening shift and long hours away from his family. Deputy Dunn always \nput others above himself, and he is the kind of leader every Montanan \ncan be proud of.\n  Everyone who knew Deputy Dunn has been touched by his commitment to \nserve others and his passion for making his community a better place to \ncall home. But above all, Joe Dunn was a family man. Regardless of the \nlength of his shift or the difficulty of his day, his top priority was \nthat of being a father.\n  Today, as a body, we offer our deepest thoughts and prayers to his \nfamily, Robynn, Joey, and Shiloh.

Mr. President, today, at this moment, we begin the debate \non one of the most important bills to come in front of the Senate this \nyear, to guarantee that Americans can find a more level playing field \nas we compete in the world economy to show that Americans should not be \npatsies for other countries that are cheating and altering records and \ninformation they submit to trade authorities.\n  This is an opportunity to close an 85-year-old loophole that has \nallowed us to import products produced by slave labor and child labor \nand to fix our currency system so countries and their companies, \nespecially in East Asia and South Asia--mostly East Asia--cannot \ncontinue to cheat and sell into our country with a bonus and penalize \nus when we try to sell our products to their countries.\n  This body delivered one strong message this week which was \nunprecedented. I can't think of the last time the Senate spoke with \nsuch an emphatic voice on a trade issue. The simple message: We cannot \nhave trade promotion without trade enforcement.\n  We should not be passing new agreements while doing nothing, which \nthe Senate tried to do on Tuesday, but the Senate stood up and said no. \nWe should not be passing new agreements while doing nothing to enforce \nexisting laws and support American companies dealing with unfair \ncompetition.\n  We need to stand up particularly for our small businesses, which are \nalways hurt to a much greater degree than large businesses. When a \nlarge company in Cleveland, Toledo or Lima shuts down production and \nmoves overseas to Xi'an, Beijing or Wuhan, China, so they can get a tax \nbreak from our government--amazingly enough, this body will not close \nthat tax loophole--and sell products back to our country, that \ncompany's bottom line may be a bit better, but the supply chain for \nthose large companies--the companies in our communities in Lima, \nToledo, Mansfield, and Wooster--that sell to those big companies have \nlost their biggest customers in far too many cases. Those businesses go \nout of business, those workers get laid off, those plants close, and we \nknow what happens. That is why we especially need to stand up for those \nsmall businesses that play by the rules and are drowning from a set of \nimports from countries that manipulate their currency and practice \nillegal dumping. Dumping is when companies subsidize water, capital, \nland, labor costs or other inputs, such as energy, and sell under the \nreal cost of production into the United States--that kind of illegal \ndumping.\n  It is one thing to talk about statistics, but I want to stop and \nthink about the costs of imports to our companies, communities, and \nfamilies.\n  In the State of Pennsylvania, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nespecially between Pittsburgh and Philly or Western Pennsylvania, the \narea I am more familiar with because I represent the adjoining State, \nwe see time after time companies in small towns--when a company shuts \ndown in a place like Jackson, OH, or Chillicothe, OH, so often because \nof the size of the town, both the husband and wife each lose their jobs \nbecause they both work at that company, their entire family income is \nwiped out, and they are likely to lose their home to foreclosure. We \nknow all of those problems that happen because we don't enforce our \ntrade rules. That is why I want us to stop and think about the real \ncosts to families, communities, and companies.\n  In Ohio, we have seen how dumping by Korean companies has hurt our \nsteel industry. Neither President Bush nor President Obama has stepped \nup on trade the way each had promised in their campaigns, and neither \nhas stepped up the way that they should to preserve our workers, our \nbusinesses, and our livelihoods. We both promised, on Korea, \nthousands--that there would be tens of thousands of new jobs, billions \nin increased exports for our companies. Yet the reality of the Korea \ntrade agreement was absolutely the opposite of that. We had major job \nloss and a major loss in the import-export ratio because of that South \nKorea trade agreement they pushed on the U.S. Congress, and the people \nhere too willingly passed.\n  Natural gas production has increased demand. I will explain Korea for \na moment. Natural gas production has increased demand for the world-\nclass tubular steel made in plants such as U.S. Steel in Lorain, \nYoungstown, and Trumbull County. Tubular steel is the steel piping that \nis particularly strong and durable. It is subjected to great pressure \nand great heat as they drill for natural gas--in so-called fracking--or \nthey drill for oil.\n  Mr. President, 8,000 workers in 22 States make these Oil Country \nTubular Goods. Each one of those jobs supports another seven positions \nin the supply chain. We know when we talk about manufacturing, it is \nnever just the manufacturing jobs, as important as they are, it is the \njobs in the entire supply that go into the assembly of the airplane or \nthe automobile or the steel production of Oil Country Tubular Goods. \nThese producers increasingly lose business to foreign competitors that \nare not playing by the rules. Imports for OCTG, Oil Country Tubular \nGoods, have doubled since 2008. By some measures, imports account for \nsomewhat more than 50 percent of the pipes being used by companies \ndrilling for oil and gas in the United States.\n  Korea has one of the world's largest steel industries, but get this, \nnot one of these pipes that Korea now dumps in the United States--\nillegally subsidized--is ever used in Korea for drilling because Korea \nhas no domestic oil or gas production. In other words, Korea has \ncreated this industry only for exports and has been successful because \nthey are not playing fair. So their producers are exporting large \nvolumes to the United States, the most open and attractive market in \nthe world, at below-market prices. That is clear evidence that our \nworkers and manufacturers are being cheated, and it should be \nunacceptable to the Members of this body. It hurts our workers, our \ncommunities, and our country. It is time to stop it.\n  I toured Lorain's best U.S. Steel plant in 2013 and saw the No. 6 \nquench and temper finishing line, which was part of a $100 million \nexpansion project.\n  The naysayers who talk about our country, workers, and businesses say \nwe cannot compete because we are not up-to-date or our workers are not \nproducing--all the whining from these naysayers who support these trade \npolicies is insulting to our workers, insulting to our communities, and \ninsulting to our small businesses. They say we are not modern enough.\n  Well, look at the investment. I have seen the $100 million investment \nin Lorain, for instance, and what that means. The first time in the \nhistory of steel production in this world, ArcelorMittal workers \ncreated about 1 ton about 5 years ago. When they passed this threshold, \n1 person-hour created 1 ton of steel. They are the most productive \nsteelworkers in the world, working in the most productive steel company \nin the world.\n  The expansion project with Lorain's U.S. Steel plant was made \npossible, in part, because we were able to crack down on Chinese steel \npipe imports that flooded the market with illegal and cheap products. \nThey made this investment because we won that trade case. Then, along \ncame Korea to again try to inflict the same damage on our producers and \nour workers. It is clear that once again we need to ensure that other \nNations don't unfairly dump steel into the U.S. market.\n  Last year, I visited the same plant and joined in with workers, \nmanagers, and union leaders to send one message: It is time for America \nto stand up to these lawbreakers; pure and simple, strip it all away--\nthese countries are lawbreakers.\n  Here is the bad news: In January, U.S. Steel--in part because of \nKorea's dumping--announced 614 temporary layoffs at the plant in Lorain \non Lake Erie. Those layoffs began in March.\n  I spoke on the floor before about one of the U.S. steelworkers I met, \nRyan, who has been out of work for weeks. He has four kids at home and \ndoesn't know when or if he will be back at work. Will his home be \nforeclosed down the road if he can't go back to work? He has played by \nthe rules. He has been living a responsible life, by taking care of his \nkids, paying his mortgage, engaged in the union and community as a \ngood, strong, productive worker. There are hundreds more like Ryan in \nLorain and around Ohio.\n\n  In March, Republic Steel in Lorain announced 200 temporary layoffs. I \nsay\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\n``temporary'' because the company is hopeful that our government will \nenforce trade rules and that the dumping of steel will abate a bit.\n  TMK is one of the largest producers of oil country tubular goods in \nthe world, with a facility in Brookfield, OH, north of Youngstown. \nSince 2008, the company has invested $2 billion in their U.S. \noperations. They are keeping up on technology and modernizing their \nplant with very productive workers. But how do they compete with Korea \nor China or other nations that are cheating?\n  Other companies make similar investments to stay on the cutting edge, \nbut instead of expanding production to keep up with increasing demand, \nthese companies operate under tighter and tighter margins and lay off \nworkers. Last week, TMK announced plans to reduce operating hours at \nthree of its facilities and completely idled another one.\n  I visited Byer Steel in Cincinnati. I spoke with Mr. Byer just \nyesterday when I met with some steel company executives, many of them \nfrom small businesses like his, where I first announced the Level the \nPlaying Field Act to his company in Cincinnati.\n  American companies--Byer, TMK, U.S. Steel, Republic Steel, so many \nothers--know firsthand that they are not in a fair fight. These \nmanufacturers across Ohio and all over our country suffer enough from \nunfair trade practices distorting the market. It is their workers who \nsuffer even more. Think about what even a temporary layoff can do to a \nfamily. They are facing mounting bills, facing mounting uncertainty. \nThey may have to start to turn to credit cards and payday lenders to \nget by, and then the downward spiral begins.\n  I don't think too many in this body who are dressed like this and who \nhave good-paying jobs and titles and far too often an adoring staff end \nup--we don't think much about this, but think about the laid-off worker \nwho has for 7 years--she and her husband have lived in Lorain, where I \nused to live, which is an industrial city west of Cleveland--they have \nlived in Lorain and paid their mortgage. They are involved in their \nkids' activities in soccer and school and go to the programs at school. \nThey are living lives the way we hope they would. But then she loses \nher good-paying, 18-dollar-an-hour job. She has a mortgage she meets \nevery month. She has bills she pays every month. Then she loses her \njob. She faces the uncertainty of what happens next, and she faces a \nsharply declined income. At some point, her kids understand their mom \nlost her job and their dad's hours have been cut back. Then they face \nthe question--and this is what we don't think much about in this body, \npeople who dress like us and make good incomes and have good benefits \nand have a staff who helps them--then she has to sit down with her kids \nand say: We may lose our home because we can't keep up with these \nbills. It is not because they speculated, not because they stole, not \nbecause they are morally inadequate in some ways; simply because they \nlost their job.\n  My State--and the Presiding Officer's State is not too far behind \nthis, I don't think--my State for 14 years in a row had more \nforeclosures than the year before. That is not because Ohioans are \nirresponsible; it is because Ohioans have lost so many of these \nmanufacturing jobs. They were paying their bills and meeting their \nobligations and raising their kids, and then all of a sudden they \ncouldn't.\n  So they have to face their 12-year-old daughter and say: Honey, we \nare going to have to move. We can't afford to keep this house anymore. \nI don't know where we are going to move. I don't know what school you \nare going to go to. I am sorry.\n  I don't think people around this place think very much about the \nhuman face of these kinds of decisions. That is why this is so \nimportant.\n  We can do something about this. When jobs are lost due to cheap, \nflooded, illegal imports and at the same time we aren't increasing our \nexports, we need to do all we can to stop this practice and protect our \nworkers.\n  The other side will say we are increasing our exports. We are a bit, \nbut the imports are much higher in almost every one of these cases. \nThat is why we need to pass this Customs bill that incorporates the \nLevel the Playing Field Act to crack down on foreign companies that are \ncheating. We welcome competition. We are a competitive country. We \nsucceed in competing among ourselves and around the world. But it has \nto be fair; it has to be a level playing field. That is why the Level \nthe Playing Field Act, title V of this Customs bill, is so very \nimportant.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum calls be equally divided between the parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                              PATRIOT Act\n\n  Today, I rise to express my longstanding concerns about the PATRIOT \nAct and in particular section 215, which is set to expire on June 1. A \nmajor use of this section--the bulk collection of Americans' phone \nrecords--has just been ruled illegal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Second Circuit. If we didn't already have enough concern about \nreauthorizing section 215, this decision should raise alarm bells. Yet, \nthe majority leader is asking us to act quickly to reauthorize this law \nunchanged for another 5 years.\n  Without significant reforms to the law, I cannot support an extension \nof any length of time, and I urge my colleagues to listen to the court \nand listen to the numerous oversight groups from within the \nadministration and the millions of citizens who are saying that \nCongress needs to rethink whether this program is violating our rights \nin the name of keeping us safe.\n  Ben Franklin was very fond of saying, ``Those who give up liberty in \nthe name of security deserve neither.'' That is where we are today. \nCongress passed the PATRIOT Act over a decade ago after the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks. Our Nation was devastated. Our security was at \nstake. But this legislation was hasty, it was far-reaching, and it \nundermined the constitutional right to privacy of law-abiding citizens. \nIt still does.\n  I have made my opposition clear in the years since 2001. The major \nadvocates of this law--primarily former President Bush and his key \nnational security officials--used a potent combination of fear and \npatriotism to drive this bill through. I was one of only 66 Members to \nvote against the PATRIOT Act in the House of Representatives. I also \nvoted against the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act in 2006 and the \nFISA Amendments Act of 2008.\n  In 2011, I opposed once again the extension of three controversial \nprovisions of the PATRIOT Act: roving wiretaps, government access to \n``any tangible items,'' such as library and business records, and the \nsurveillance of targets that are not connected to any identified \nterrorist group.\n  Back in 2001, I said on the House floor that I was unable to support \nthis bill because it does not strike the right balance between \nprotecting our liberties and providing for the security of our \ncitizens. I went on to say: The saving grace here is that the sunset \nprovision forces us to come back and to look at these issues again when \nheads are cooler and when we are not in the heat of battle.\n  That is exactly what we should do. To govern in a post-9/11 world, we \nhave to strike the right balance, to fight terrorism without trampling \nour Constitution. We can do both. The Bill of Rights was established \nimmediately following a war. Our Founders knew the tension between \nfreedom and security. Our Nation was founded on the right of individual \nliberty, in stark contrast to the long tradition of total sovereign \nauthority of most other governments.\n  I strongly believe we should not force through a reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act without a hard look at the long-term ramifications of \nthe law. We must look at how the law is being used for things such as \nthe collection of all Americans' phone records. We must consider \nwhether that use is necessary\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\nto keep us safe and whether it is in line with the Constitutional \nrights we are sworn to uphold.\n  I urge our colleagues not to be swayed by the false argument that \nthis provision must be reauthorized urgently, that we will be \nvulnerable to attack if we let it expire--another false argument.\n  Here is the reality. This provision is being used to sweep up the \nphone calls of all Americans across this country. Yet there is zero \nconclusive evidence that it has kept us safe from attack.\n  What we do have, however, is ample evidence that the PATRIOT Act, \nsection 215, has been used to violate the privacy of everyday \nAmericans. I believe it has violated the Constitution. I certainly \nagree with the Federal court of appeals which last week ruled that the \nbulk phone record collection goes far beyond what Congress intended \nwhen the law was passed.\n  We have a decade of hindsight. Let's be honest in this debate and \nlet's be thorough. The entire law bears careful scrutiny. Senators Lee \nand Leahy have introduced the USA FREEDOM Act to reform the law while \nreauthorizing the expiring provisions. I commend their efforts, but I \nthink we can go even further.\n  The House also overwhelmingly passed its version of the USA FREEDOM \nAct just yesterday. It deserves Senate consideration. Congress has a \nduty for robust oversight, to ensure real constitutional privacy rights \nare upheld. I pushed for this from when I was in the House. I advocated \nthen for the creation of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard, also called PCLOB.\n  In June 2013, after details about NSA's bulk collection program were \nmade public, I led a bipartisan call for the PCLOB to conduct an \nindependent review. Their review assessed the impact of NSA's spying \nprogram on Americans' constitutional rights and civil liberties. The \nBoard concluded what many Americans had feared: One, that the spying \nprogram is an unconstitutional intrusion on their privacy right, and, \ntwo, that it has almost no impact on safety.\n  The Board's oversight role is crucial. Its independent evaluation of \nsection 215 demonstrates why. It has an important job, and it requires \nmore support so it can do its job. That is why yesterday Senator Wyden \nand I reintroduced the Strengthening Privacy, Oversight, and \nTransparency Act, or SPOT Act. Our bill, with bipartisan cosponsors in \nthe House, would strengthen the Board. This is key to real oversight, \nand it should be included as part of any reauthorization of the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  The SPOT Act extends the Board's authority to play a watchdog role \nover surveillance conducted for purposes beyond counterterrorism. It \nalso allows the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to issue \nsubpoenas without having to wait for the Justice Department to issue \nthem. It makes the Board member's positions full-time.\n  Finally, it makes the Board an authorized recipient for whistleblower \ncomplaints for employees in the intelligence community, so they can \ntake concerns to an independent organization, one that understands the \nintelligence community. I know we must protect the Nation from future \nattacks. But there must also be balance. We cannot give up our \nconstitutional protections in the name of security. To do so does not \nprotect our Constitution nor does it increase our security.\n  We need to have a serious debate about these issues and allow \nSenators to offer amendments. This is important to the American people, \nto our security, and to our liberties. Congress cannot just leave town \nand leave this work undone.\n  I voted against the PATRIOT Act and the FISA Act amendments, because \nthey unduly infringed on the guaranteed rights of our citizens. I \nbelieve that time has shown that to be true, and the time has come to \ncorrect it. We all value the work of our intelligence community. Their \nefforts are vital to our Nation's security. But I believe these \namendments are crucial.\n  We can protect our citizens and their constitutional rights. We acted \nin haste before. It was a mistake then. It would be a mistake now to \napprove a straight reauthorization of that law. We need to take the \ntime this time to get it right.\n  I see Senator Wyden is on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today the Senate is formally kicking off \nthe trade debate here in the Senate. What I intend to do, starting \ntoday and in the days ahead, is to come back to what I think needs to \nbe the central statement of this discussion; that is, the NAFTA \nplaybook. The playbook for trade in the 1990s is gone. It is a new day \nin trade policy.\n  So I have summarized why the trade promotion act is not the trade \npolicy of the 1990s and is not the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nWhat we are going to do today is essentially start with the question of \nhow vigorous trade enforcement ought to be at the forefront of \nAmerica's trade policy in 2015 and beyond, and how our new approach on \nenforcement is different than the policy of the 1990s.\n  The reality is, we can pass trade agreements full of lofty goals and \nprinciples. You can amass all of the enforcement ideas you might want, \nbut it does not do any good if you do not have real enforcement tools \nand you make sure that they are not locked in a shed.\n  In my view, that has been happening for way, way too long. The status \nquo on trade enforcement simply no longer does the job. As I have \nlistened for many months to Senators on both sides of the aisle, I \nbelieve there is widespread recognition that our approach to trade, \nparticularly trade enforcement, has to change, because without that \nchange, we are not going to have the best possible path to creating \nmore good-paying jobs for our people in a modern and globally \ncompetitive economy.\n  The bottom line is that those trade policies in the 1990s did very \nlittle--really nothing--to ensure strong enforcement of our trade laws \nto protect the American worker from the misdeeds of trade cheats. This \nbill is designed to take on the universe of aggressive tactics that our \ncompetitors have used. It upgrades trade enforcement laws to meet \ntoday's challenges.\n  What we have seen in recent years is that there are some overseas who \nplay cat-and-mouse games with our Customs agents, using shell \ncompanies, fraudulent records, and sophisticated schemes. Then they \nbully--bully--American businesses into relocating factories and jobs or \nsurrendering valuable intellectual property. Too often our companies \nare spied on, and trade enforcers may, in effect, be victimized by \nthose who steal secrets and dodge accountability.\n  Our competitors often mask their activities by obscuring paper trails \nand perpetrating outright fraud. Now, our challenge--and I know my \ncolleague the Presiding Officer has seen this as a member of the \nFinance Committee--is to get out in front of these schemes that I have \njust described. The enforcement legislation before the Senate is about \nguaranteeing that the United States has a queen on the chess board, no \nmatter what competitive tactic it faces.\n  That starts with a proposal I first offered years ago called the \nENFORCE Act. Now, the North American Free Trade Agreement did nothing \nto stop foreign companies that cheat and evade duties by concealing \ntheir identities and shipping their products on untraceable routes.\n  That is the way it used to be. That is why this legislation is not \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement. The ENFORCE Act is going to \ngive our Customs agents more tools aimed at cracking down on the \nbehavior I have just outlined. Another major upgrade, something else \nthat did not exist during those NAFTA days, is what I call an unfair \ntrade alert. The new alert system would set off the warning bells long \nbefore the damage is done, when American jobs and exports come under \nthreat.\n  One of the big fears we hear today is that our enforcers are \nincapable of stopping the trade cheats before it is too late. By the \ntime somebody in Washington catches on to the newest unfair threat to \nundercut an American business, the plant has been shuttered, the \nfactory lights are out, and the workers' lives have been turned upside \ndown. In a lot of cases, if you are talking about the small towns that \ndot the landscape of Oregon and elsewhere, that abandoned facility \nmight have been the beating heart of an entire community.\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\n  The slow pace of action in Washington, DC, should never be the reason \nAmericans lose their jobs. The unfair trade alert--that was not part of \nthe 1990s; that was not part of NAFTA. It is going to be part of our \ncurrent policy today, helping our companies, helping our workers get \nthere before it is too late.\n  Next, the Congress is going to lay down clear priorities for our \ntrade enforcers, priorities that are centered on jobs and economic \ngrowth. There is going to be more accountability and follow-through \nbaked into our enforcement system. In years past, trade debate in the \nCongress used to come down to a simple transaction of trade promotion \nauthority for trade adjustment assistance.\n  What I said in developing this package of bills and what more than a \ndozen protrade Democrats said on Tuesday and Wednesday of this week was \nthat the Senate needed to aim higher. The status quo was not good \nenough. In particular, it was not good enough in terms of enforcing the \nlaws that are on the books. My guess is that in Pennsylvania and \neverywhere else--because I certainly hear it in Oregon--people say--\nparticularly those of us who are protrade and want to tap these global \nmarkets: I hear you are talking about new trade agreements. How about \nenforcing the laws that are on the books?\n  What I started this morning--and I will be back again and again \nbetween now and the end of this debate--is to talk about why this is a \nvery different approach than the approach taken in the 1990s. Tough, \nrobust, effective enforcement of our trade laws is right at the core of \na new and modern trade policy. It is a major part of what I call trade \ndone right. It is how you guarantee that trade gives everybody in \nAmerica a chance to get ahead.\n\n  Those are propositions, in my view, that deserve strong, bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis trade enforcement law package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Democratic side have \n20 minutes of the debate time remaining prior to noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be able to \nequally divide the time spent in quorum calls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Freedom for Austin Tice\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes this morning \ntalking about a young man who can be described in many ways and one who \nhas earned many accolades: decorated Marine Corps veteran, award-\nwinning journalist, Houston native, and seventh-generation Texan. But \nmost importantly, this young man, Austin Tice, is better known as a \nfriend, brother, and son to loving and caring parents.\n  Almost 3 years ago, Austin decided to pause his law school studies to \nspend the summer in Syria as a freelance journalist. He was frustrated \nby the lack of reporting on Syria's civil war, a war that has claimed \nthe lives of more than 300,000 people by some estimates--and that is \njust within the borders of Syria--and has displaced millions more who \nare living in refugee camps both in Syria and in surrounding countries. \nThis huge refugee crisis affects many neighboring countries, such as \nJordan, Turkey, and Lebanon, and has tremendous potential to \ndestabilize the entire region.\n  As a strong believer in freedom of the press, Austin wanted to let \nhis fellow countrymen know what was going on in that part of the world. \nAs a former Eagle Scout and Marine Corps captain, Austin's typical can-\ndo attitude led him to decide that he should go to Syria himself and \nreport on the civil war, and that is exactly what he did. Well, as with \nmost things he tried, Austin proved to be very successful. While he was \nreporting from Syria, his work was published in the Washington Post, \nMcClatchy news, and other outlets.\n  In August 2012, just days before he was planning to leave Syria, he \nwas kidnapped, and no one has heard from him since. We still don't know \nfor sure who his captors are. Sadly, we know very little. One thing we \ndo know is that his parents, Marc and Debra Tice, and his entire family \nhave worked tirelessly to locate him and to bring him home safely.\n  This week marks the 1,000th day of Austin's captivity. I really can't \nbegin to imagine the toll this ordeal has taken on Austin's family, but \nI have to say I so greatly admire the courage and conviction of his \nparents, who said earlier this week in a statement:\n\n       We have desperately missed Austin for over 1,440,000 \n     minutes--each new minute fuels our resolve to find him and \n     bring him safely home.\n\n  While we often mark the number of days someone has been missing, it \nis important to remember that to the family and friends of someone who \nhas been kidnapped, even the minutes that pass are almost unbearable. \nAustin's family is not just counting the days he has been gone and all \nthe milestones he has inevitably missed, they are counting the minutes \ntoo.\n  Austin Tice has a family who is waiting for him, missing him, and \nlaboring to find any piece of information that will lead to information \nabout his whereabouts, while longing for his freedom. I join the Tice \nfamily in encouraging the Federal Government to do everything we can to \npossibly secure Austin's safe return home.\n  I also say once again to his family: We haven't given up. We will \ncontinue to stand by you, and we will never give up until we find your \nson and bring him safely home.\n  This week, we pass another milestone, this time of 1,000 days that \nAustin has been separated from his family. I join the Tice family in \ntheir hope that someday soon we will be able to add another milestone \nto this story, one that marks the day of his safe return to so many who \nlove and miss him.\n  Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the Tice family, and I stand \nready and I daresay all of us stand ready to do whatever we can to \nencourage and facilitate the return of this Texan, veteran, brother, \nand son.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on two pieces of \nimportant trade legislation. Both of these bills have been in the works \nfor some time. They were among the four trade bills we reported out of \nthe Senate Committee on Finance last month, and as a principal coauthor \nof both bills, I am very glad we found a way to get them to this point.\n  The first bill we will be voting on is the Trade Preferences \nExtension Act of 2015. This bill will reauthorize and improve three of \nour trade preference programs: the generalized system of preferences, \nor GSP; the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA; and tariff \npreferences for Haiti. I want to take a few minutes to talk about each \nof these programs individually, starting with the GSP.\n  The GSP promotes trade with developing nations by providing for \nnonreciprocal duty-free tariff treatment of certain products \noriginating in those countries. The program helps beneficiary countries \nadvance their economic development and encourages them to move toward \nmore open economies and eliminate trade barriers to U.S. exports.\n  The GSP does more than provide assistance in the developing world; it \nalso assists hundreds of businesses here in the United States. Across \nour country, manufacturers and importers benefit by receiving inputs \nand raw materials at a lower cost. Approximately three-quarters of U.S. \nimports under GSP are raw materials--parts and components--or machinery \nand equipment used by U.S. companies to manufacture goods here at home.\n  Unfortunately, because the program expired in 2013, many U.S. \nbusinesses\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\nhave had to deal with high tariffs on these imports for the last 2 \nyears. As an example, last year alone, without the GSP program in \nplace, American companies paid over $600 million in tariffs. Businesses \nin every State have been affected by the expiration of GSP and have a \nvested interest in the renewal of the program. There are businesses in \nmy own home State of Utah and around the country that have been left \nwith difficult decisions about downsizing, hiring freezes, and employee \nlayoffs in the absence of GSP. Today, with the passage of this bill, we \nwill take a long-overdue step toward solving these problems.\n  Also included in the preferences bill are provisions for the long-\nterm renewal of the AGOA Program, which encourages African countries to \nfurther develop their economies by lowering U.S. tariffs on their \nexports. Since AGOA was enacted in the year 2000, trade with \nbeneficiary countries has more than tripled, with U.S. direct \ninvestment growing more than sixfold in that time.\n  This program has helped create more than a million jobs in Sub-\nSaharan Africa. I worked with my colleagues on the Committee on Finance \nto craft reauthorization language that will improve on AGOA's past \nsuccess, to remove obstacles to trade in Sub-Saharan Africa and allow \nboth that region and our job creators here at home to benefit from \nexpanded market access.\n  I share many of my colleagues' belief that benefits under AGOA should \ngo to countries making good-faith progress toward meeting the program's \neligibility criteria. For example, I am very concerned that officers in \nthe Republic of South Africa recently indicated they will attempt to \nrenegotiate commitments made under the General Agreement on Trade in \nServices to require foreign-owned companies to relinquish 51 percent \nownership and control to South Africans.\n  South Africa also developed a draft policy that proposed changes to \nintellectual property rights laws which contained significant \nshortcomings, including inadequate protections for patents, trademarks, \nand copyrights. These are three areas I take a tremendous interest in, \namong so many other things around here. I hope very much that as they \nredraft this policy, it will include recognition of how important \nprotection of intellectual property is to supporting economic growth.\n  But it is not just South Africa. For example, I understand other \nbeneficiaries under the program continue to impose barriers and \nlimitations to cross-border data flow or otherwise limit digital trade. \nBecause of these concerns, we thought it was important to create a \nmechanism under the AGOA Program which would allow for benefits to be \nscaled back if a country is found to not be making good-faith progress \non these and other issues. That new tool is included in the bill, and \nwe expect the administration to use this tool aggressively, \nparticularly in the case of South Africa.\n  The legislation also includes new consultation and notification \nrequirements, keeping Congress informed of beneficiaries' progress.\n  There are new mechanisms for stakeholders to petition the \nadministration to raise awareness about potential eligibility \nviolations. The bill will require these petitions to be taken into \naccount when determinations are made regarding a beneficiary's status \nand in regular reporting.\n  I know the AGOA Program has a lot of support here in Congress among \nMembers of both parties. I think we were able to craft a bill that not \nonly provides for the long-term extension of the program the \nadministration was seeking but also responds to some very serious \nbilateral trade challenges we are facing today. With these changes, we \nhave created a more flexible program we believe will spur greater \ndevelopment and economic integration and opportunity in the region, \nwhile better serving the needs of our job creators here at home. I \nbelieve it deserves strong support.\n  Finally, the preferences bill would also extend preferential access \nto the U.S. market for Haiti. Haiti is one of the poorest economies in \nthe Western Hemisphere. The Haiti preference program supports well-\npaying, stable jobs in a country saddled with poverty and unemployment. \nI hope this extension will encourage continued economic development and \nsupport democracy in Haiti.\n  This is a strong preferences bill. I expect a strong vote in favor of \npassing it later today.\n  Next, the Senate will vote on the Trade Facilitation and Trade \nEnforcement Act of 2015, which includes important provisions to \nreauthorize and modernize the operations of Customs and Border \nProtection, or CBP, and significantly improve intellectual property \nrights protection in the United States and around the world.\n  The Customs bill will facilitate the efficient movement of \nmerchandise destined for the United States by formalizing in statute \nprograms such as the Centers of Excellence and Expertise. It will also \nensure that U.S. customs and trade laws are uniformly implemented \nnationwide and help ensure that the private sector and CBP work \ntogether.\n  With this bill, we will also ensure that the automated commercial \nenvironment and the international data system are completed so that \ntrade documentation can finally be submitted electrically and importers \nwill no longer be required to submit the same information to numerous \ngovernment agencies.\n  In addition, the bill will modernize the drawback process by moving \nfrom a labor-intensive paper-based system to an electronic claims \nprocess that will significantly free up resources in the private and \nthe public sector, and it will increase the de minimis level from $200 \nto $800, reducing needless burdens on small businesses importing into \nthe United States.\n  Additionally, the bill strengthens our trade remedy laws and our \nability to respond to imports that pose a threat to the health or \nsafety of U.S. consumers.\n  When drafting this customs legislation, I was particularly interested \nin beefing up our enforcement of intellectual property rights. The bill \nincludes the strongest possible provisions with regard to intellectual \nproperty rights and intellectual property rights enforcement. For \nexample, our bill will establish in law the National Intellectual \nProperty Rights Coordination Center to coordinate Federal efforts to \nprevent intellectual property violations. It will also significantly \nexpand CBP's tools and authorities to protect intellectual property \nrights at the border by requiring CBP to share information about \nsuspected infringing merchandise with rights holders.\n  Our bill will provide CBP with explicit authority to seize and \nforfeit devices that violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act--an \nact I put through a number of years ago--and require CBP to share \ninformation with rights holders who are injured by these unlawful \ndevices.\n  The bill contains provisions to establish a process for CBP to \nenforce copyrights while registration with the copyright office is \npending and to significantly improve CBP's reporting requirements to \nhold the Agency more accountable for its enforcement efforts with \nregard to intellectual property.\n  The bill will strengthen CBP's targeting of goods that violate \nintellectual property rights, improve CBP's cooperation with the \nprivate sector and with foreign customs authorities on enforcement, and \nrequire an educational campaign at the border. I am particularly fond \nof that last part. At my insistence, the bill includes provisions that \nwill require all versions of the Customs Declaration Form that everyone \nfills out when they enter the United States to contain a warning that \nimportation of goods that infringe on intellectual property rights may \nviolate criminal and/or civil law and may pose serious risks to health \nand safety. I am not sure most Americans appreciate the danger that \ncounterfeit products can pose, as they often are not built to the same \nstandard of the protected product. So I hope making people more aware \nof these dangers will help us make sure we are doing all we can to keep \nAmericans safe.\n  In addition to enhancing protection at our borders, our Customs bill \nwill provide USTR with additional tools to improve the protection of \nintellectual property rights by our trading partners overseas in order \nto stop infringing goods at the source. For example, the bill will \nestablish a chief innovation and intellectual property negotiator, with \nthe rank of ambassador, to ensure\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nthat intellectual property rights protection is at the forefront of our \ntrade negotiation and enforcement efforts and to enhance USTR's \naccountability to Congress on these issues. On top of that, the bill \nwill give USTR more tools to increase enforcement for trade secrets and \nto ensure that countries that consistently fail to protect intellectual \nproperty meet specified benchmarks for improvement.\n  I am a big fan of this bill. It includes a number of my top trade \nenforcement priorities, and I am very glad we will get a chance to vote \non it today. Of course, it is not perfect. Some of the amendments that \nwere added in committee leave me with some reservations. Most notably, \nthe bill now contains provisions that purport to deal with currency \nmanipulation that are, in my view, very problematic. One provision sets \nup an avenue for a countervailing duty investigation or review to \ndetermine whether some measure of a currency manipulation is \neffectively a subsidy, either ``directly or indirectly'' to a country's \nexports. If the government finds that the manipulation is, once again, \neither ``directly or indirectly,'' an export subsidy, sanctions can \nfollow. This provision is problematic for a number of reasons.\n  First of all, it is likely not compliant with our existing \ninternational trade commitments. It would effectively require the \nimposition of trade sanctions that, under the language of the \nlegislation, could be based on presumptions without support. And it \nwill almost certainly invite retaliatory trade sanctions from our \ntrading partners, who will argue, and in fact have already argued, that \nactions taken by the Federal Reserve Board constitute currency \nmanipulation.\n  While the authors of the currency manipulation provision in the \nCustoms bill may believe that there is a clear delineation between \nmonetary policies used primarily for domestic economic stabilization \nand policies used to gain a trade advantage, there is not.\n  When Japan engages in quantitative easing to boost its economy and \ninflation expectations, sometimes at the very urging of U.S. officials, \nis that manipulation?\n  When the Federal Reserve engages in quantitative easing, with part of \nthe expected benefit being downward exchange rate pressure and boosted \nexports, is that manipulation, or just domestic stabilization?\n  Is Germany's persistent trade surplus somehow partially caused by \nongoing quantitative easing activities at the European Central Bank?\n  And, with respect to detection, despite the intent of the authors of \nthis provision, accuracy is evidently not a concern.\n  I am sure that everyone--or at least those who support this \nprovision--has looked at the recent exchange rate assessments for 2013 \nfrom the International Monetary Fund External Sector Report.\n  For Japan, one IMF method suggested 15-percent yen overvaluation, \nwhile another method suggested 15-percent undervaluation. Yet under the \ncurrency manipulation provision in this bill, IMF models and methods \nare what we are supposed to use to set trade sanctions.\n  For South Korea, the two IMF methodologies suggested undervaluation \nbetween around 7 percent and 20 percent. So when we want to set a \npunitive countervailing duty, what are our authorities supposed to do? \nShould they assume that South Korea benefited from currency \nundervaluation of 7 percent or 20 percent or some random number in \nbetween? Who knows.\n  This provision, unfortunately, simply won't work, since it assumes \nthe existence of accurate knowledge and abilities to determine some \nfundamental equilibrium exchange rates that the IMF and the economics \nprofession simply do not have.\n  Under the questionable provision of the bill that allows for \ninvestigation of currency undervaluation and potential ensuing trade \nactions, I believe the authors of the provision were overly heroic and \nmistaken in their belief about the precision of currency valuation \nmethodology. The provision would appeal to models and methodologies, as \ndescribed in IMF documents.\n  The problem is that even the IMF does not use those models and \nmethodologies to make definitive judgments about appropriate currency \nvalues, which are inherently some of the most difficult things for \neconomic models to identify. It would not be difficult for our trading \npartners to use precisely the same models and methodologies to make \ncountervailing cases against Federal Reserve monetary policy, resulting \nin retaliatory trade sanctions and perhaps defensive currency \ninterventions.\n  This is a clear road to trade wars and currency wars replete with \ncompetitive devaluations. Such a road is paved by the offending \nprovision in the Customs bill, which basically gives our trading \npartners a template for their own accusations about currency \nmanipulation and ensuing trade sanctions. This is problematic.\n  And while Senators in this Chamber would like to simply decree that \nour monetary policies are just domestic economic stabilization, while \nforeign monetary policies that may look similar are manipulation, such \nself-evaluations will not be acceptable in international trade and \nagreements.\n  I understand the desire among many of my colleagues to address \ncurrency manipulation, and I want to work with them on this issue. But \nI am convinced that the currency manipulation provision in the Customs \nbill simply will not work, and, when tried, it will simply give \nammunition to our trading partners to consider engagement in trade \nwars, currency wars, competitive devaluations, and beggar-thy-neighbor \nmonetary policies. This isn't what we should be shooting for with our \nNation's trade policy.\n  In addition to the currency language, there was another provision \nadded during the markup that would require employers to report \noccupational classification data to State agencies when filing their \nquarterly wage reports. This is an entirely new burden that would be \nplaced on employers throughout the country, added to all the other \nreporting burdens they already face, and would require brand new \nsystems for reporting and collecting information. And in the end, it is \nnot readily apparent just how valuable this new collected information \nwill be.\n  According to CBO, this new requirement would cost employers \nthroughout the country more than $200 million between 2016 and 2020. \nNow, that may not seem like much compared to the numbers that get \nthrown around here in the Senate. But when we are talking about small \nbusinesses who struggle from month to month to cover their payrolls, it \nis a burden that, at least to me, doesn't appear to be necessary.\n  So once again, I am concerned about this provision and the impact it \nmight have. However, despite the reservations I have about the flawed \ncurrency manipulation concepts and language and the unfunded mandate on \nemployers, I believe it is important that we vote to move the Customs \nbill forward. Overall, this is a very good bill. A lot of work has gone \ninto it, and I know that it reflects the priorities of a number of our \ncolleagues and Members here in the Senate, including myself. That being \nthe case, I plan to vote in favor of passing this legislation later on \ntoday, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Once again, I am very glad to see that we are making progress on \nmoving these bills through the Senate. I wish to thank all of my \ncolleagues--particularly those on the Finance Committee--who worked so \nhard on these bills to get them to this point.\n  These are important votes we are going to take today. I expect that \nboth of these bills will receive broad bipartisan support, and I hope \nthey will.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Remembering the Victims of the Amtrak Train Derailment\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before I address the matter at hand, I \nwant to say that our hearts go out to the families of the men and women \nwho lost their lives as a result of the Amtrak derailment last Tuesday. \nThere are many still fighting injuries, and our thoughts and prayers \nare with them and their loved ones.\n  This was a commuter train. I have ridden it personally hundreds of \ntimes,\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\nand it is one my colleagues have ridden.\n  It was a train full of people on their way home--to their families, \nto their loved ones, to the things they like to do. So our thoughts go \nout to all of them.\n  It will be our job as lawmakers to analyze why this happened, how we \ncould have prevented it, and how we can best move forward to ensure \nsuch a tragedy is not repeated. Some of this is already underway. But \nthe more pressing task in this moment of tragedy is for us to show \nsolidarity with the victims and their families, and recognize their \ncontributions--however large or small--to our national story.\n  New York lost a few native sons and daughters:\n  Abid Gilani, a senior vice president of Wells Fargo and a father of \ntwo.\n  Rachel Jacobs, an industry leader in her field, was heading home to \nher husband and 2-year-old son as CEO of a new job at an educational \nsoftware company.\n  Jim Gaines, a software architect for the Associated Press, a beloved \nmember of the staff, who was heading home to Plainsboro, NJ, to see his \nwife, 16-year-old son, and 11-year-old daughter.\n  We lost Dr. Derrick Griffith, a dean of student affairs at Medgar \nEvers College in Brooklyn, just a stone's throw away from where I live. \nHe spent his entire adult life working to improve urban education.\n  And we lost a young man named Justin Zemser, who lived in Rockaway, \nin my old congressional district, and was studying at the U.S. Naval \nAcademy. He was a tremendous young man--and I know that because I \nnominated him to the Naval Academy.\n  He was a valedictorian, an earnest big brother and mentor to two \nchildren with autism, as well as being captain of the varsity football \nteam. His family mourns his loss and so does America. He would have \ndone so much for our country.\n  Today, let us remember them. Tomorrow, let us work together so that \ntheir loss is not in vain.\n  Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the Customs \nbill before this body, particularly because of the strong language it \ncontains on the crackdown on currency manipulation.\n  I have spoken many times on this subject in the Finance Committee and \nhere on the floor because I am passionate about finally passing \nenforceable mechanisms for dealing with this malicious trade tactic. \nWhy? Because I am deeply concerned by the plight of the middle class in \ntoday's economy, where globalization and free-trade agreements have \naccelerated a downward pressure on middle-class wages and forced entire \nindustries to relocate to low-wage countries.\n  And I believe currency manipulation is one of the most significant \nemerging trade challenges this country faces, because it directly \nimpacts wages and it directly impacts jobs.\n  As this Congress is soon to reengage on a fast-track for a massive \nfree-trade agreement, now is the time to think deeply and \ncomprehensively about our country's trade policy and how it impacts the \nbroad middle of our economy.\n  To me and many of my colleagues, it does not make sense to move \nforward on the one hand with a blank check for free trade without \npassing strong worker protections on a parallel track. The global \neconomy is a rough sea. We should not pass a trade package that forces \nthe American worker to navigate those waters with a leaky boat and a \ndeflated lifejacket.\n  So to me and to many of my colleagues, this Customs bill and the \ncurrency manipulation issue is unquestionably germane to the larger \ndebate on trade. If the goal of TPP is to lure countries away from \nChina, it makes perfect sense that, as part of the overall effort with \nTPP, we also go after Chinese currency manipulation, as well.\n  But beyond the question of relevance to this debate--which I believe \nis dispatched easily--this bill is substantively good trade policy. It \ncontains several smart, balanced, effective measures to create a level \nplaying field with our international trading partners.\n\n  First and foremost, currency manipulation is finally attacked head-\non. Companies have asked me about this. CEOs of major companies have \nsaid to me: We cannot compete if we have one hand tied behind our back, \nwhich currency manipulation does.\n  Mr. President, may I ask my colleague a question, the ranking member?\n  How much time do you wish?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. I will be very brief.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How much time is left for the minority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Seven?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Would you please notify me when I have taken 3 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Big companies have been hurt. Small companies have been \nhurt. We have lost millions of jobs because of currency manipulation, \nwhich makes the exports from China and other countries about 33 percent \ncheaper and imports from America to China 33 percent more expensive.\n  I would say this: China seems to feel they can get away with any kind \nof trade misdeed, whether it is stealing intellectual property by cyber \nsecurity or any other means, whether it is keeping out the best of \nAmerican products, which they do until they can learn how to make them \nthemselves in their protected market and then fight us everywhere else.\n  This currency bill will finally be the first real shot across the bow \nto China that you cannot keep getting away from it. Their unfair trade \npractices hurt us in low-wage industries that were very important--\nshoes, clothing, toys, furniture. Those industries have already \nsuffered. But if we do nothing, it will be the cream of American \nindustry where our innovation and hard work is lost to China through \nunfair means, currency and other, whether it is tech or \npharmaceuticals. Talk to the CEOs of these companies, and they will \ntell you China does not play fair. Talk to them, and they will tell you \nthat the Chinese shrug their shoulders at what we have done up until \nnow. We must do something--if not in the TPA bill, alongside it--that \nshows China once and for all they cannot get away with it. I fear that \nif we do not, in 10 years we will be saying the same thing about the \nindustries that we say today. The customs measure, currency measure is \nbipartisan. The currency measure passed our committee with an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote, 18 to 8, and was supported by our ranking \nmember, which I most appreciate. It passed the Senate in 2011 with 63 \nvotes. It passed the House of Representatives with 348 votes. And a \nyear and a half ago, in 2013, 60 Senators sent a letter to the \nPresident imploring the inclusion of enforceable currency provisions.\n  In conclusion, we have to think about the big picture when it comes \nto trade policy. If we move the ledger on one side, opening up our \nmarkets in foreign markets, we better make sure we adequately move the \nledger on the other side to protect our workers, curb unfair deceptive \npractices, and give our small businesses the ability to compete in a \nglobal economy.\n  The fate of middle-class wages, middle-class jobs, and the very \neconomy of this country hang in the balance. I urge my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I wish \nto also note that Senator Schumer has provided leadership on another \nvery important enforcement issue. He introduced the committee to \nsomething a number of years ago known as honey laundering. What this \ninvolved was, in effect, we set up a sting operation. In particular, \nwith respect to Senator Schumer's constituents and his interest in \ntough enforcement of the trade laws, the Chinese, as my colleagues will \nrecall, were found guilty of unfair trading practices. In effect, they \nwould just ship honey through other countries, such as Indonesia.\n  I want my colleague to know I am going to continue to work with him \non a variety of issues.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. If I might, I thank the Senator for \nthe great job he has done under very difficult circumstances. I think \neveryone on both sides of the aisle appreciates Senator Wyden's \nintelligence, his bipartisanship, and his steadfastness.\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  I am going to wrap up as we move to this first vote in a few minutes \nand come back to what this debate is all about. We are starting, of \ncourse, with the issue of trade enforcement, but the big challenge is \nto show this country that we are putting in place a modern trade \npolicy, a trade policy that sets aside once and for all the NAFTA \nplaybook of the 1990s. This overall package will usher in a new and \nmodern American trade policy. It must start with a tough, robust, \neffective trade enforcement package, many of the details of which I \nhave outlined here this morning.\n  It is time also--and this will be part of our early work--to upgrade \nand renew our trade preference programs. The businesses and workers who \nrely on these programs are waiting for this Congress to act.\n  The first of these proposals enhances and extends the African Growth \nand Opportunity Act, referred to as AGOA. This has been the core of a \nclose economic partnership between our country and a host of African \nnations for more than a decade. The proposal before the Senate will \nupdate that partnership in a way that is positive for all involved.\n  Back in the 1990s--once again returning to this theme, the NAFTA \nera--the United States had no meaningful trade policies to help African \nnations facing profound economic hardship climb back from the brink. \nThis renewal of the AGOA law takes the program to the next level. AGOA \nwill be simpler for businesses to use. There will be less redtape to \nworry about. African countries will be encouraged to zero in on \nstrategies that can make the program more effective. It will be easier \nfor the United States to crack down on the bad actors and verify that \ncountries stay strictly in line with the criteria for eligibility. Most \nimportantly, the proposal gives all concerned--workers, businesses, \ncountries, and investors--a decade of certainty.\n  I am a real fan of this program. I believe it works for our country, \nfor Sub-Saharan Africa, and it ought to be a cornerstone of our \neconomic policy in the region.\n  The second part of this package of programs renews the program known \nas the generalized system of preferences. This is an economic win-win \nbecause it is a shot in the arm for developing countries, and it is a \nmajor boost for American manufacturers, including hundreds of them in \nmy home State. One of those businesses in Oregon is Stackhouse Athletic \nin Salem, which will not only be able to create new jobs, they will be \nable to offer health benefits to their workers.\n  The extension of GSP will save American businesses an estimated $2 \nmillion a day by reducing tariffs. The GSP program expired nearly 2 \nyears ago. As a result, businesses in my home State of Oregon paid an \nextra $4.9 million in tariffs. Renewing GSP would correct that issue \nand support as many as 80,000 jobs with manufacturers, ports, farmers, \nand retail stores. That program would be extended by this legislation \nthrough 2017.\n  Finally, the Senate has an opportunity with this legislation to \nreaffirm our economic commitment to Haiti, one of our closest and most \ndisadvantaged neighbors in the world. In my view, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida has done very important work in this area. He has been our \nleader on this issue, and there is bipartisan understanding that now is \nthe right time to extend the Haiti trade preferences to line them up \nwith AGOA. These Haiti preferences also did not exist in the NAFTA era. \nTogether, they support as many as 30,000 jobs in that country, and they \nhelp to drive investment and lift Haiti's economy in the long term.\n  I am confident the Senate will come together to extend this package \nof preference programs because they make economic sense for America, \nand they strengthen our ties with the developing countries around the \nworld.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation with our first vote.\n  I will close by saying that today we begin to turn the corner on a \nfresh, modern trade policy for the times, a policy very different from \nthe trade policy of the 1990s, the NAFTA era. Let's begin this effort--\nbegin this effort--for a new 21st-century trade policy by passing the \nlegislation we will be considering shortly, both parts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the vote on which cloture was not \ninvoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1314 is agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 2 p.m. will be equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, soon the Senate will vote once again on \nwhether to begin debate on legislation that will help shape the future \nof America's trade policy, and, in addition, our role in the global \neconomy. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when many of my \nDemocratic colleagues voted to block debate on these important issues \nearlier this week. I am hoping for a much different result this \nafternoon.\n  This vote will set the stage for an important debate, quite likely \nthe most significant debate that we will have in this Chamber all year. \nThis debate will determine whether our Nation is willing and able to \naccept the challenges of the world economy or whether we continue in \nretreat and yield to the siren song of isolationism and protectionism.\n  It will determine whether we, as a nation, are able and willing to \ntake the lead in setting the rules for the world economy or whether we \nwill sit on the sidelines and let other countries create the rules that \nwill govern trade in their regions for the foreseeable future. It \nshould be pretty clear where I stand in this debate.\n  I support free trade and open markets for U.S. exporters and job \ncreators. I support new opportunities for American farmers, ranchers, \nmanufacturers, service providers, and the workers that they all employ. \nI support expanding American influence in the most vibrant and \nstrategic regions in the world. The best way for Congress to help our \ncountry achieve these goals is to renew trade promotion authority, or \nTPA, as soon as possible.\n  That is what we will be debating, if this vote goes the way I hope it \nwill. TPA is the most effective tool in the Congress's trade arsenal. \nTPA ensures that Congress sets the objectives for our trade negotiators \nand that those negotiators will be able to reach the best deals \npossible. Without TPA we have no way of holding the administration \naccountable in trade negotiations and no way of making sure our country \ncan get a good deal.\n  Getting TPA renewed is currently President Obama's top legislative \npriority. He is right and we should support our President on this \nissue.\n  As chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade, it \nis a very high priority for me, as well. The TPA bill that will be \nbrought before the Senate represents a bipartisan, bicameral effort to \nadvance our Nation's trade interests.\n  The legislation we will be debating will also include provisions to \nreauthorize trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, which I know is a high \npriority for many of my colleagues. It has taken a long time, a lot of \nwork, and no small amount of compromise to get us to this point. People \nfrom both parties have put in enormous efforts just to get a chance to \nhave this debate here on the Senate floor.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their work thus far in this effort, \nbut also to remind them that we are not there yet. Now, I am well aware \nthat not all of my colleagues share my views on trade. I expect that \nthey will make those views abundantly clear in the coming days, as they \nshould. But to do that, we need to begin that debate. I am looking \nforward to it. The American people deserve a spirited debate on these \nissues.\n  Of course, they deserve an opportunity to see this Chamber function \nlike the great deliberative body that it once was and under the current \nleadership is becoming again. Put simply, the obstruction has gone on \nlong enough. It is time to get down to the serious business of \nlegislating. I hope we can begin or continue that process today by \nvoting in favor of the motion to proceed. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to do that so that we can get on this bill, debate it, have \na full-fledged debate, and let the chips fall where they may.\n  If we do, I think we will all feel a lot better about what goes on \naround this place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue.) The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me respectfully disagree with my \nfriend from Utah. Let me urge all Members to vote against what I \nbelieve to be a disastrous trade agreement, a trade agreement based on \nother trade agreements, which, in fact, have cost us millions of \ndecent-paying jobs and have led to a race to the bottom.\n  Let me just briefly give four reasons--and there are many more. But \nlet me just focus on four objective reasons why we should defeat this \nfast-track legislation and why we need to develop a whole new approach \nto trade that benefits American workers rather than just the CEOs of \nlarge multinational corporations.\n  Reason No. 1, this unfettered free-trade agreement with Vietnam, \nMalaysia, and 10 other countries follows in the footsteps of disastrous \ntrade agreements such as NAFTA, CAFTA, Permanent Normal Trade Relations \nwith China, and the South Korea Free Trade Agreement.\n  Any objective look at these trade agreements will tell us that they \nhave cost us millions of decent-paying jobs and have led us to a race \nto the bottom, where American workers are forced to compete against \nworkers in low-wage countries who are making pennies an hour.\n  Over and over again, supporters of these types of trade agreements \nhave told us about how many jobs they would create, how beneficial it \nwould be for the middle class and working class of this country. But \nover and over again, virtually everything they told us turned out to be \nwrong, and they are wrong again in terms of the TPP.\n  In 1993, President Bill Clinton promised that NAFTA would create 1 \nmillion American jobs in 5 years. Instead, NAFTA has led to the loss of \nalmost 700,000 jobs. In 1999, we were promised that Permanent Normal \nTrade Relations with China would open the Chinese economy to American-\nmade goods and services. Instead, as everybody who goes shopping \nknows--when you buy product after product made in China--that trade \nagreement has cost us some 2.7 million American jobs. I remember \nhearing all the accolades about free trade with China. They all turned \nout to be wrong.\n  In 2011, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told us that the South Korea \nFree Trade Agreement would create some 280,000 jobs. Well, wrong \nagain--instead, that agreement has led to the loss of some 75,000 jobs.\n  The reason for all of this is very simple. Why would an American \ncorporation invest in this country, pay American workers 15, 18, 20 \nbucks an hour, provide health care, have to obey environmental \nregulations, and deal with trade unions, when they can go abroad, pay \npeople pennies an hour, and not have to worry about the environment. \nThat is, of course, what has happened.\n  These trade agreements have failed. TPP is based on these principles. \nIt will be another failure. We should reject it for that reason.\n  Second point, in politics it is always interesting and important to \nknow whose side different groups are on. You can learn a lot by who is \nsupporting an agreement and by who is opposing the agreement.\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\n  Well, let's talk about who is supporting the TPP. It turns out that \nvirtually every major multinational corporation, including many that \nhave shut down plants in the United States and moved abroad--all of \nthese multinationals think the TPP is a great idea. I am sure I can \nunderstand why it will be a great program for them. It will only \naccelerate their ability to shut down plants in America and move to \nlow-wage countries abroad.\n  There is another group that is actively pushing for us to vote for \nthe TPP. That is the pharmaceutical industry. As I think every American \nknows, the drug companies in this country charge our people here the \nhighest prices in the world for prescription drugs, but they love this \nlegislation. They just love it because they think as a result of this \nlegislation, they will be able to charge people all over the world, \nincluding in very poor countries, higher prices for their products.\n  Wall Street--surprise of all surprises--Wall Street loves this \nagreement. As we all remember, not so many years ago, the greed, \nrecklessness, and illegal behavior of Wall Street caused the most \nsignificant economic recession since the Great Depression. But Wall \nStreet loves this legislation because it will make it easier for them \nto sell esoteric, complicated financial products all over the world.\n  So those are some of the groups that think this legislation is \nwonderful, that we should vote for it.\n  Which are the groups and the organizations that oppose this \nlegislation? Well, it turns out that every trade union in this country, \nunions representing over 20 million American workers, unions that are \nfighting every single day to get workers higher wages, better pay, \nbetter health care, are in strong opposition to this legislation.\n  This is what the trade union movement has to say about TPP:\n\n       Fast Track trade deals mean fewer jobs, lower wages, and a \n     declining middle class. Fast Track has been used since the \n     Nixon Administration to advance deals, like NAFTA, that are \n     sold to the American people as job creation measures. But \n     these deals, written largely by and for the world's largest \n     corporations, don't create jobs; their main purpose isn't \n     even related to trade, it's to enshrine rules that make it \n     easier for firms to invest offshore and increase corporate \n     influence over the global economy.\n\n  That is what the trade union movement in this country believes about \nthis agreement. But it is not only the trade union movement that has \nopposed the TPP. Virtually every major environmental and scientific \ngroup in this country, groups such as the League of Conservation \nVoters, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and \n350.org oppose this legislation. This is what the environmental \norganizations have written about this bill:\n\n       As leading U.S. environmental and science organizations, we \n     write to express our strong opposition to ``fast track'' \n     trade promotion authority and to urge you to oppose any \n     legislation that would limit the ability of Congress to \n     ensure that trade pacts deliver benefits for communities, \n     workers, public health, and the environment.\n\n  So we have trade union organizations representing some 20 million \nAmerican workers that say we should not go forward with this agreement. \nWe have organizations representing millions of people in the \nenvironmental community that say we should not go forward with this \nlegislation.\n  Then we have religious groups, such as the Presbyterian Church \n(U.S.A.), the United Methodist Church, and the Sisters of Mercy, that \nalso are opposing this legislation. This is what they have written:\n\n       As people of faith, we call on all nations and government \n     to uphold the dignity of all people. Yet modern trade \n     agreements have harmed people, especially the most vulnerable \n     in the United States and globally. . . . Trade, like the rest \n     of the economy, must be a means of lifting people out of \n     poverty and ensure a country's ability to protect the health, \n     safety and wellbeing of their citizens and the planet. In \n     recognition of your sacred task of stewardship over people \n     and policies, we ask you to oppose fast track trade promotion \n     authority for any trade agreement currently being negotiated.\n\n  So, on the one hand, you have all of the big-money organizations. You \nhave every major multinational corporation in America. You have Wall \nStreet, and you have the pharmaceutical industry. They say: Vote for \nthis legislation.\n  On the other side, you have unions representing millions of \nAmericans. You have environmental organizations representing millions \nmore Americans, and you have religious organizations who say: Wait a \nsecond. This fast-track trade agreement may not be a good idea. Vote \nno.\n  So on the one hand, you have groups whose motivation is greed and \nprofit, and on the other hand, you have organizations trying to protect \nworking people, trying to protect the environment, trying to uphold \nbasic religious values about human dignity saying no. Well, which side \nshould we be on? I say we stand with those who are concerned about \nworkers' rights, the environment, and moral values.\n  Let me give you another reason why we should oppose this trade \nagreement--and this is a provision that has gotten far too little \nattention--and that is the investor-state dispute settlement. That \nsounds like a highly technical term. What in God's Name does that mean? \nBut let me try to explain what it does mean. What it does mean in \nEnglish is that it would allow large multinational corporations to sue \nnational, State, and local governments--not only in the United States \nbut all over the world--if those governments pass legislation that \nhurts their expected future profits.\n  This, to me, is exactly about what this whole agreement stands for. \nIt is not for raising wages or creating jobs. It is to protect \ncorporate profits. And, unbelievably, what this legislation is prepared \nto do is to undermine basic democracy in terms of what local \ncommunities around the world, States in the United States, and national \ngovernments do--whether it is the United States or any other \ngovernment--if that undermines future profits of large multinational \ncorporations. That is really extraordinary.\n  I thought that our job, as Members of the Senate, and the job of \npeople in Australia who represent their government and people \ndemocratically elected all over the world--I had the idea that maybe \ntheir function was to represent, as best they could, the needs of the \npeople who voted for them. I guess that is a radical and crazy idea.\n  What this bill says is that if legislation is passed by people who \nare democratically elected, those decisions--that legislation--can be \nbrought to an independent tribunal, and those countries could have to \npay huge fines if the legislation, which might protect health care or \nmight protect the environment, undermines future profits of \nmultinational corporations.\n  What an attack--not only on health and the environment--but it is an \nattack on the fundamental tenets of democracy. Our job is not to worry \nabout future corporate profits. Our job is to worry about the needs of \nthe American people. That is what elected governments all over the \nworld are supposed to do.\n  Let me give you some examples--because we have not talked about \nthis--of what is already going on around the world based on similar \nlanguage to what will be in the TPP if we vote for it--similar \nlanguage.\n  This is maybe the most outrageous example that I can give you, but \nthere are many others. Philip Morris, one of the large tobacco \ncompanies in the world, is suing both Australia and Uruguay over \nlabeling requirements for cigarettes.\n  Uruguay is this little country, and what they have done is they have \nbeen very aggressive in trying to protect their children and their \npeople from the very harmful impacts of smoking.\n  Now, you know what. I happen to think that is a good thing. I think \nin America and all over the world we should do everything that we can \nto make sure that our kids are not hooked on nicotine and do not have \nto suffer heart disease, cancer, emphysema, and all of the other \ndiseases related to smoking. I think our government should be very \nvigorous. We have done some things in our country. I think we should do \nmore.\n  Uruguay, a little tiny country whose President turns out to be an \noncologist, a guy who is worried about cancer, was trying to do \neverything it could to try to keep the kids in Uruguay from getting \nhooked on cigarettes. And what happened to Uruguay? Well, they were \ntaken to this independent tribunal, composing, as I understand it, of \nthree corporate lawyers,\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nbecause Philip Morris said: Hey, Uruguay, you are impacting our future \nprofits. We want to get kids hooked onto nicotine. We want to sell our \nproducts to kids and to the people of Uruguay. By fighting us, passing \nlegislation, and doing things that will make it harder for kids to \nsmoke, you are ruining our profits.\n  This case is now resting in an independent tribunal. How insane is \nthat--that a country trying to protect its kids from getting cancer is \nbeing sued by Philip Morris because it might cost them profits? So this \nis not only a health issue--in this case of cancer prevention--but this \nis an issue of basic democracy.\n  Do the people of Uruguay, do the people of Australia, do the people \nof any country have a right to be very vigorous in protecting the \nhealth of their kids and their citizens without worrying about being \nsued by a cigarette manufacturer that is trying to poison these kids \nwith deadly products.\n  So this is not only a health issue, it is a basic democratic issue, \nand if Philip Morris wins this case, it will be sending a message to \nevery government in the world that they can't be aggressive in doing \nthings to protect their kids from cigarettes.\n  That is one example. Let me give another equally outrageous example. \nUnder this investor-state provision, a French waste management firm--\nVeolia--is suing for $110 million under the France-Egypt bilateral \ninvestment treaty over changes to Egypt's labor laws, including an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  Now, let me be honest. I know nothing about Egypt's minimum wage, but \nI do think Egypt and every other country on Earth has a right to raise \nits minimum wage, if they think it makes sense, without worrying about \nbeing sued by some company that will have to pay higher wages. How \ncrazy is that? So, again, not being terribly knowledgeable about \ndomestic policies in Egypt, the idea that they are being sued for the \ncrime of raising their minimum wage is, to me, beyond comprehension.\n  Again, this is just an example of what is happening now and what will \nonly happen in an accelerated manner if we pass this agreement, but let \nme give one last example.\n  A Swedish energy company called Vattenfall launched a $5 billion \nlawsuit over Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power. This \ninitiative was implemented in response to the Fukushima disaster. \nGermany, last I knew, was an independent country, with an elected \ngovernment, and they made a decision to phase out nuclear energy. Some \npeople think it is a good idea, some think it is a bad idea, but last I \nheard that should be a decision of the German Government and the people \nwho elected that government. The elected officials of Germany are not \ndummies. I presume they do what their people want them to do or they \npay the political consequence.\n  But that was the decision of the elected officials of Germany. They \nsaid: Let's phase out nuclear power. Yet now they are being sued by a \nSwedish energy company, Vattenfall, for some $5 billion because they \nmade that decision.\n  Now, that is just what is going on right now. Think about what that \nmeans into the future. It means any government around the world or in \nthis trade agreement, it means any State in the United States--if my \nState of Vermont, which is sensitive to the environment, decides to go \nforward on an environmental piece of legislation, some large \ncorporation can go to an independent tribunal and say: Look, we are \ngoing to sue Vermont for $1 billion because we wanted to do business \nthere and their environmental regulations are impacting our ability to \nmake a profit. That undermines what the State of Vermont or the State \nof Georgia or any other State chooses to do.\n  To me, it is just beyond comprehension that anybody would vote for \nthat type of legislation. We can disagree with what they do in Egypt or \ndisagree with what they do in Uruguay, we can disagree with what we do \nhere, but to say an independent tribunal can provide billions of \ndollars in damages to a corporation because of a democratically made \ndecision in the United States or any other country around the world is, \nto me, just incomprehensible.\n  The last point I would want to make deals with a health issue. \nClearly, one of the health crises we face not only in America but \naround the world is the high cost of prescription drugs. In our \ncountry, if my memory is correct, some 25 percent of Americans who \nreceive prescriptions from doctors are unable to afford to fill those \nprescriptions--someone goes to the doctor who diagnoses that individual \nand writes out a script, and the person says thank you very much but \ndoesn't have the money to fill that script. It is bad in this country, \nbut obviously it is much worse in very, very poor countries around the \nworld.\n  What this agreement will do, among other things, if it is passed, is \nallow pharmaceutical companies to fight back against their brand-name \nproducts being converted into generics at much lower prices, so poor \ncountries all over the world would have to struggle to come up with \nvery high prices for medicine for people who don't have a whole lot of \nmoney.\n  In fact, that is why Doctors Without Borders has said--and Doctors \nWithout Borders, as you may know, is a heroic group of doctors who, \nwhenever there is a health care crisis around the world--whether it is \nEbola in Africa or whatever--travel to those places and put their lives \non the line. Some have died to provide medical treatment in the most \ndifficult of circumstances to the poorest people around the world. They \nare really a heroic group of people. But Doctors Without Borders has \nsaid: ``The TPP agreement is on track to become the most harmful trade \npact ever for access to medicines in developing countries.''\n  So to my mind, the vote we are going to have in a short time is \nreally a no-brainer. Are we dumb enough to continue down the road of \nfailed trade policies? I would hope not. Do we think it is a good idea \nto be siding with corporate America, which has already used previous \ntrade agreements to outsource millions of our jobs and thinks this \nagreement is just wonderful? Are we going to stand with Wall Street, \nwhose greed has no limits? Are we going to stand with the \npharmaceutical industry, which wants to sell drugs to people all over \nthe world at a higher price or do we stand with unions, environmental \ngroups, religious groups? Do we get involved in a trade agreement which \nallows corporations to undermine the democratic rights of countries \nthat stand up for their environment, stand up for the health and well-\nbeing of their kids? Do we make it harder for poor people around the \nworld to get the medicines they need?\n  This is a no-brainer. I would hope Members of the Senate send a \nresounding note to the corporate world that says you can't have it all; \nthat we are going to pass trade agreements which protect working \nfamilies, which protect the middle class, and which protect struggling \npeople all over the world and we are going to vote no on fast-track and \nno on the TPP.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, the negotiating process has finally \nworked. Indeed, the spirit of four bills that passed the Finance \nCommittee last week on this issue of trade--the spirit of that \noverwhelming bipartisan vote in the Finance Committee has now been \ncarried out on the floor of the Senate and, in fact, is being carried \nout and will be so as we invoke the motion for cloture to go to the \nbill in the next vote that will occur in 30 minutes.\n  Certainly, trade preferences with regard to African countries, plus \nthe trade preferences with regard to the poorest nation in the Western \nHemisphere, Haiti, were not controversial at all. We passed that.\n  Certainly, the intent was that the safeguards we put in with regard \nto considering trade legislation put them on a Customs bill. That was \nintended to go along with the trade legislation, and now that has \npassed. Remember, all of this was bollixed up 2 or 3 days ago and we \nweren't going anywhere, but cooler minds prevailed and brought \neverybody together.\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\n  Now we go to the main event.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the minority has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. I am very grateful to my colleague from Alabama for \nallowing me to do that.\n  Mr. President, the main event is the combined two bills of trade \nadjustment assistance, which is, if there is a disruption in a local \neconomy or in a particular trade as a result of new international trade \narrangements, there will be extra training for those workers to be \ntrained into another job so they have a livelihood--that is common \nsense. That is combined with the other main event, which is a procedure \nto fast-track, ultimately, the two trade bills that are being \nnegotiated by the United States, one in the Pacific area, the other one \nwith Europe.\n  Fast-track means that when those trade bills come to the Congress for \napproval or disapproval, it will be done with an up-or-down vote. In \nother words, they can't be pecked to death with hundreds of amendments. \nThat is why it is called fast-track. We are getting to the point where \nwe are going to pass this as we get into the consideration of this \nlegislation and amendments that will be coming to it.\n  At the end of the day, this Senator is quite confident we will be \nable to pass the fast-track, and it will have this Senator's support. \nWhy? Simply because this Senator believes these trade agreements are in \nthe interest of the United States.\n  I would conclude by saying that if we take, for example, the \npotential Pacific agreement, our military commanders have told us that, \nin fact, it is one of the best things we could do to get this trade \nagreement so China can't get in the economic door before the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nnotified after 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think that as we consider these trade \nagreements, it is appropriate that we recognize the importance of free \ntrade, how it helps the world and helps the economy, and it is \nsomething I certainly support and have supported on a number of \noccasions in the past, including the last big trade bill, the Korean \ntrade bill. I generally support--I actually do support the idea of \ncomparative advantage, the gist of which is that if a nation can \nproduce a product and sell it cheaper in another country, people over \ntime will benefit from allowing that country's product to enter the \ncountry and being able to buy it at a lower price. That is comparative \nadvantage, and I think it is sound in principle and generally sound in \npractice.\n  But the American workers are not doing well now. Wages have not \nincreased since 2000--15 years. We have been down $3,000 in median \nfamily income since 2009 and still down $3,000. We have the lowest \npercentage of Americans in working years actually working today since \nthe 1970s. So this is not a healthy environment for Americans. The \nmarket has done pretty well. Revenues and profits are holding pretty \nwell, but the average American working person is not doing so well.\n  So what has happened? Is there a problem with currency manipulation, \nstate-owned enterprises, subsidized foreign industries, people who dump \nproducts here below market cost or right at market cost being \nsubsidized and supported by foreign countries? Do those alter the \nsituation? Do they make it impossible for American businesses to \ncompete, and if they go out of business, will our government bail them \nout in any way? We had one bailout after the financial collapse, but \nbusinesses are closing every day and they are not being bailed out \ntoday. We have seen substantial reductions in manufacturing around the \ncountry.\n  The Wall Street Journal just this week published an article, ``The \nCase of the Vanishing Worker.'' That was in Monday's Wall Street \nJournal. It talked about the city of Decatur, IL, and detailed how \ntheir unemployment rate had gotten as high as 14 percent and it had \ndropped to almost half of that. It dropped down to almost half of that, \nso that looked pretty good, but when they looked at the numbers, they \nweren't so good.\n  What did they find? Even though the unemployment rate had fallen to \nalmost half, how many people were actually working? Well, the answer \nwas 8 percent fewer. So how can the unemployment rate fall and the \nnumber of people actually working fall at the same time? The answer is, \nas the article said, that people are moving away; they are dropping out \nof the workforce entirely; they are taking early retirement. That is \nwhat is happening too often in America.\n  So I think it is important for us to ask, how are these trade \nagreements benefiting the nation? How are they impacting American \npeople? Let's ask some questions about it.\n  I asked the President questions on that. I sent him a letter, and I \nasked him a series of questions relating to wages. Will this trade \nagreement improve job prospects? Will it improve or make worse our \ntrade deficits? Well, he hasn't answered those questions.\n  So I ask my colleagues: Has anybody demanded the Commerce Department, \nthe Treasury Department, the administration to produce data to show \nthat if we enter into another agreement involving 40 percent of the \nworld's economy, involving some of our most capable and rigorous and \ntoughest mercantilist competitors, what will it do to the American \nworkers' prospects? Is that a fair question to ask? We haven't seen any \ndiscussion of it, so far as I can tell. And let me tell you what the \nreason is.\n  Well, first, I will say this: I believe unfair trade competition is \nreal. We talk to people out there every day, and they tell us about it. \nDan DiMicco, former CEO of Nucor Steel, has one of his plants in \nAlabama. They have plants all over the country. He said that these \ntrade agreements are in effect unilateral American trade disarmament \nand they enable foreign mercantilism. In other words, what he is saying \nis that we have acquiesced to the mercantilist nationalism emphasis of \nour trading partners. And why is that? Well, I figured it out. It has \ntaken me a while to understand exactly what the theory is behind these \ntrade agreements, and I don't believe I am in error when I discuss \nthis.\n  Ross Kaminsky, writing in the American Spectator--a fine magazine--\nwrote a fine piece arguing for this TPA and the trade agreement. He was \noverwhelmingly saying it must be passed virtually regardless of what is \nin it.\n  I have to say his position is consistent with the position of the \neditorial page of the Wall Street Journal and many other economists, \nand we have to understand what it is. And I am losing confidence in \nthis position. I am not sure it is a good position. As a matter of \nfact, I don't think it is. Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think it is.\n  This is what he says on trade:\n\n       It bears repeating--and repeating and repeating and \n     repeating--that the benefit to American consumers of free \n     trade is so large that it must trump any parochial interest \n     of a particular industry or labor union or politician.\n       Because they lower the prices of imports, and even \n     understanding that there will be a few losers, free trade \n     agreements are almost always worth supporting regardless of \n     what is offered to American exporters by the foreign trade \n     partner.\n\n  Let me repeat that. He said they are almost always worthy of being \nentered into regardless of what is offered to the American exporters by \nthe foreign trade partner.\n  I remember, as a skilled businessman, when I first came to the \nSenate, and Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, was before \nme. I was kind of nervous about it--a big maestro of the economy.\n  I asked him a simple question: Mr. Greenspan, what if a country wants \nto trade with us, wants to sell products to us but will buy zero \nproducts from us? They just want to sell to us but will buy nothing in \nreturn. Should we enter into a trade agreement with them?\n  What do you think he answered? I used to ask people in townhalls \nabout this on occasion, and they would say he said no. But, but he said \nyes.\n  I am telling you, this is the movement--the mentality of the current \ntrade agreement supporters, at least in the intellectual, corporate \nworld and\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\nthe newspaper world and many within universities, certainly not all.\n  So is this a valid position? Are we subjecting our American people \nunfairly to competition that could cost jobs and so forth?\n  Well, I am losing confidence in those views. That is all I am saying, \ncolleagues. And I think it is time for us to analyze what it means.\n  I would say that the steel industry of the United States is not a \nlittle bitty matter. Right now, U.S. Steel closed a big plant I think \nin Indiana or Ohio. They just laid off a thousand or so workers in \nAlabama. SSAB Steel in Alabama says they are facing ferocious dumping, \nit is threatening their market share and their ability to make the most \nmodern plant in the world competitive, and they don't think it is fair.\n  How long do you have to sustain this to have dealt substantial damage \nto the American steel industry? Don't we need a steel industry? Where \nwould steelworkers get jobs? They say: Well, they can take service \njobs. Well, maybe so. Maybe they can work at the plumbing company. \nMaybe they can work at a hospital. Maybe they can work in a nursing \nhome. Maybe there is other work that can be found. But at some point, \ndo we not need a manufacturing capability that provides a lot more than \na service job--manufacturing capabilities, for example, that provide \ndemand for products, demand for supplies, demand for workers who supply \nthose plants and have ripple effects much larger than a person just \nrepairing faucets. I think we have to ask that question in a very \nserious way.\n\n  I said earlier I voted for the Korean trade pact. I did not have a \nlot of trouble voting for that at the time. I thought it was going to \nbe fine. Maybe it is OK. Maybe the pact is going to be, sometime in the \nfuture, positive for the United States.\n  The Koreans, like the Japanese, are good trading people. They are \nallies around the world on security agreements. I am not putting the \nKoreans down. The Koreans are tough trade negotiators. They have a \nmercantilist philosophy.\n  What happened before that agreement was passed? President Obama \npromised that the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement would increase U.S. \ngoods exports to Korea by $10 billion to $11 billion. However, since \nthe deal was ratified in 2012, I believe it was, our exports rose only \n$0.8 billion--less than $1 billion, not $10 billion. Does that make any \ndifference?\n  We just bring in from abroad and our trading partners don't allow \nexports abroad? What about the Korean imports to the United States? \nThey rose more than $12 billion, widening our trade gap, almost \ndoubling our trade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe I had up to 15 to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time until 2. We are just \nnotifying you of the 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I see my colleague from Louisiana. If he is ready to \nspeak, I will wrap up.\n  Mr. VITTER. I do not desire to speak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will wrap up, Mr. President.\n  What about the Census Department's report on the U.S. trade deficit \nof South Korea? They found it has almost doubled since the passage of \nthe agreement. In 2011, the United States had a $13.2 billion trade \ndeficit with South Korea--not a healthy relationship there--but in \n2014, it was $25 billion.\n  Furthermore, the deficit is currently 66 percent higher so far this \nyear than it was at the same point last year. March was the largest \ntrade deficit we have had in a very long time. The first quarter, we \nhad a huge deficit. I believe the March trade deficit was the largest \nworldwide that we have had in over 6 years. It was almost the highest \never.\n  I am going to support moving forward to discuss this trade bill. \nThere will be some amendments that I would seek to offer. If that is \nthe will of the Congress, those will pass; if not, they will not pass. \nBut fundamentally I do believe it is time for the American people to \nexpect their political leaders to give them some real analysis about \nwhat the results of these trade agreements are going to be. Will it \nhelp raise wages? Will it create increasing job prospects? Would it \nincrease or reduce our trade deficit? Trade deficits represent a drain \nand a negative pull on the American economy. Some say they do not make \nmuch difference, but they do. It does impact adversely GDP. With regard \nto those questions, I think we need some answers. I will be asking \nthose as we go forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few more thoughts with \nmy colleagues.\n  In 2014, net exports--net exports subtracted 1.5 percent from fourth-\nquarter GDP. That is a lot. GDP growth in the fourth quarter was \nsubtracted by--excuse me, 1.15 percent. That is more than $500 billion. \nThat is enough to fund a highway reauthorization program for a long \ntime.\n  The problem is that in the short run, Americans tend to be losing \njobs as a result of trade agreements; whereas, long-term unemployed \npeople have a difficult time finding work. I would say I believe in \ntrade, but it is not a religion with me. I believe it is a religion \nwhen somebody says that you should enter into a trade agreement with \nanybody, opening your markets totally without demanding anything in \nreturn for that.\n  I have to tell you, as I just read from others--it is clearly the \npolicy of the Wall Street Journal--that is good policy, that you should \nenter into a trade agreement whether or not your partner will allow you \nto sell anything at all to them. I say good negotiations in a contract \nare, which a trade negotiation is, if we open our markets, our \ncompetitors ought to open theirs sufficiently. Too often we have the \nproblems that arise from nontariff barriers that are impacting the \nability of American businesses to sell products in their country. So \neven if they reduce their tariff, their ability to sell products is \nblocked by other nontariff matters, all of which I think we can discuss \nin the weeks to come.\n  Let's be sure we understand where this trade agreement is taking us, \nwhat the philosophy and approach behind it is, and let's be sure it \nserves the interests of the American people first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we start \nthe vote now, 5 minutes earlier than we planned.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the motion to reconsider the vote on which \ncloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 1314 is agreed \nto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2912-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2912-S2913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 606) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I am very honored to be here today with my \ncolleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen. We worked together on \nthis important bill that has just passed the Senate and had previously \npassed the House of Representatives.\n  This week is National Police Week. We were honored to receive law \nenforcement officers representing more than 20 agencies in New \nHampshire, including the Brentwood police chief and many members of his \ndepartment. They are here joining thousands of officers and families of \nlaw enforcement to remember and honor those who have given the ultimate \nsacrifice in the line of duty to keep the rest of us safe.\n  Last night during a candlelight vigil, 273 fallen officers from \nacross the Nation whose names were added this week to the national \nmemorial were honored, including Officer Stephen Arkell from New \nHampshire, from the Brentwood Police Department, who lost his life in \nthe line of duty a year ago Tuesday. Our thoughts and prayers continue \nto be with Officer Arkell's family and with the Brentwood Police \nDepartment.\n  Unfortunately, more than a year after his death, his family is still \nwaiting for their survivor benefits. We are here today to discuss the \nbill that was just passed by the Senate--H.R. 606, the Don't Tax Our \nFallen Public Safety Heroes Act--which Senator Shaheen and I worked on \ntogether.\n  Recently, Senator Shaheen and I had the opportunity to sit down and \nhave a roundtable with many law enforcement officers, fire chiefs and \nfirefighters from our State. We heard many of the challenges that the \nfamilies of those law enforcement officers and firefighters who lost \ntheir lives in the line of duty face to get the survivor benefits that \nthey should receive.\n  One of those challenges is the fact that while survivor benefits for \nthe families of our fallen firefighters and law enforcement officers \nare tax free, unfortunately, ambiguity in the tax has forced families \nto apply for private letter rulings from the IRS to have that \nclarified. Our bill will ensure that they no longer have to go through \nthis bureaucratic step when it comes to their survivors' benefits.\n  It ensures that the benefits their survivors receive for the \nsacrifice they have made are not taxed under the Internal Revenue Code. \nThese benefits are intended to help those families and make sure that \nwhen they go through this incredibly tragic loss, they are able to \ncontinue with their lives.\n  I thank Congressman Erik Paulsen from Minnesota for working with us \nto get this bill passed through the House of Representatives.\n  I also thank Senators Toomey and Cardin for their work in the Senate \nFinance Committee to pass this legislation and Senate Finance Committee \nChairman Hatch and Ranking Member Wyden for their work to help get this \nimportant legislation passed.\n  I most of all thank my colleague Senator Shaheen because this issue \nis so important to law enforcement officers and firefighters in New \nHampshire. Our public safety officers who go out every single day on \nour behalf--every hour, every holiday, every weekend--to make sure we \nare safe. When, unfortunately, we lose one of them in the line of duty, \nas we experienced in New Hampshire too recently, we want to make sure \nthose families are taken care of. That is what this bill does--it makes \nsure that those families do not have to wait to receive benefits they \nshould receive and that they do not have to go through a rigamarole \nwith the IRS to make sure these benefits are not taxed.\n  I also want to mention that, in New Hampshire, not only did we \nunfortunately lose Patrolman Stephen Arkell a year ago, but in 2012 we \nalso lost Greenland Chief of Police Mike Maloney, who was about to \nretire. Both of those families have been down here for National Police \nWeek. Our prayers continue to be with their families and the families \nof every single law enforcement officer and firefighter who makes sure \nwe are safe every single day.\n  I am so glad this legislation passed during National Police Week. We \nare going to continue to work together to make sure that the families \nof public safety officers that lose their lives in the line of duty do \nnot have to go through any bureaucratic red tape to get their survivor \nbenefits.\n  I want to thank Senator Shaheen for her work on this issue.\n  I yield to Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Capito). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am very pleased to be here to join \nmy colleague Senator Ayotte in applauding the passage in both the House \nand the Senate--today in the Senate--of H.R. 606, the Don't Tax Our \nFallen Public Safety Heroes Act.\n  As Senator Ayotte said so eloquently, this is legislation we have \nworked on for over a year. It was first introduced in the last \nCongress. Now, it is finally on its way to the President's desk to \nbecome law, and it couldn't be happening at a more important time.\n  This is National Police Week, but maybe more important for New \nHampshire, this week we celebrate the memory of Officer Stephen Arkell \nof Brentwood. He was killed in the line of duty just a year ago this \nweek. Last night, Officer Arkell's name was added to the Roll of Honor \nof police officers killed in the line of duty at the National Law \nEnforcement Memorial in Washington, DC.\n  Officer Arkell was not only a terrific police officer, he was a very \ngood and decent man. As I read in one newspaper, he was the kind of \npolice officer who would rather write a warning than\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\na ticket, and he aimed to end fights with words instead of handcuffs.\n  Well, it has been a full year since we lost Officer Arkell. We don't \nforget, and we will never forget his example of courageous public \nservice. Day in and day out, our public safety officers, our police, \nour firefighters, and their families make enormous sacrifices.\n  Now, family members fully understand the dangers of their spouses' \njobs. They live with that constant worry. But when the worst happens in \nthe line of duty to a loved one, the last thing a surviving family \nshould have to worry about is navigating the Federal Tax Code. For too \nlong, families of police officers and firefighters killed in the line \nof duty have had to wrangle with the IRS to exempt death benefits from \ntaxation. They have had to hire lawyers and wait years for a ruling \nfrom the IRS and, in the meantime, their urgently needed benefits are \nheld up.\n  This is just unacceptable, and today it ends. Thankfully, the House \nand Senate have passed a bill to exempt these death benefits from \ntaxation, ending any ambiguity that may have existed. So this is \nlegislation that should not just help the Arkell family, but it should \nhelp families across this country.\n  I applaud the work of my colleague Senator Ayotte on this bill, all \nof our colleagues in the Senate who have helped to make this happen and \nalso those in the House who understood the need to help support our \nfallen public safety heroes. When the President signs this bill into \nlaw, this problem will finally be cleared up once and for all.\n  Again, I thank my colleague Senator Ayotte for all of her work on \nthis issue. I am delighted it is finally done and look forward to \nmaking sure it gets implemented in a way that continues to support the \nsurviving families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before I speak on the trade legislation--\nand the distinguished chairman of the committee is on the floor as \nwell--I wish to note that the Finance Committee, under the leadership \nof Chairman Hatch, has already passed a version of this important \nlegislation.\n  Now we have taken up the House bill--our companion legislation. I \ncongratulate both of my colleagues. Senator Shaheen has talked to me \nabout this a number of times. I know Senator Ayotte is very interested \nin it as well. I congratulate both of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2914-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2914-S2926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ENSURING TAX EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ACT--MOTION TO \n                            PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, if I could make my remarks about trade, \nChairman Hatch has graciously allowed me to make a few comments at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, with the votes that have been cast today \nin the Senate, the Senate has begun to develop a powerful and \nbipartisan message that the trade policy of the 1990s will be \nunacceptable in 2015.\n  The Customs and Enforcement package passed this morning goes a long \nway toward breaking new ground. We will be talking about the final two \nelements of the overall trade package, trade promotion authority, and \ntrade adjustment assistance. But until we are done with this debate, I \nwill be referring to the chart next to me because what we will be \noutlining are all of the specific areas that demonstrate that this \nlegislation is going to finally put the 1990s and NAFTA in the rearview \nmirror and fix many of its flaws.\n  For example, in the NAFTA era, American priorities, like rights for \nworking families and environmental protection, were an afterthought, \nand they were stuck in unenforceable side agreements. With this \nlegislation, they will be bedrock elements of future trade agreements. \nBack in those NAFTA days, the United States pretty much just asked our \ntrading partners to enforce their own labor and environmental laws, and \nthen we sort of hoped for the best.\n  The trade promotion act says that if a trading partner's laws fall \nshort, they are going to be required to pass new laws to fix the \nproblem, and for the first time, these labor and environmental \nprotections will be fully enforceable, enforceable because they are \nbacked by the threat of trade sanctions.\n  So the NAFTA-era policies, colleagues, had no teeth. In effect, this \nlegislation raises the global bar on labor rights and environmental \nprotection.\n  We are going to hear a lot about how somehow this is just more of the \nsame, and it is going to promote a race to the bottom. What we intend \nto spell out in the days ahead is how this creates new momentum to push \nour standards up, rather than promote a race to the bottom.\n  For the first time, I wish to note--with the support of our \ncolleagues, the outstanding work done by our colleague from Maryland, \nBen Cardin--now human rights will be a negotiating objective for our \nfuture trade agreements.\n  Back in the NAFTA era, the United States fought for intellectual \nproperty protection for drugmakers, but nobody was trying to do much of \nanything to look for people stuck in hardship around the world who \nneeded access to affordable medicine. That also will change with this \nlegislation.\n  The old NAFTA playbook was written in a time when cell phones were \nabout as big as bricks and Internet commerce was still a dream. Today, \nit is right at the heart of our economy.\n  So our new approach to trade is going to help cement American \nleadership in the digital economy. Even now, in 2015, you have \nrepressive governments in China, Russia, and elsewhere building digital \nwalls that block the free flow of information and commerce online. If \nthat trend continues, it would chop the Internet up into small, \ncountry-sized pieces. In my view, the Internet is the shipping lane of \nthe 21st century, and products sent around the world in bits and bytes \nare just as important as products packaged into shipping containers and \nsent across the oceans. I strongly believe this is the best chance to \nfix what NAFTA got wrong and introduce a new day in American trade \npolicy.\n  The only way for our country to defend an open Internet, promote \naccess to affordable medicine, protect our values on labor standards, \nenvironmental protections, and human rights is to fight for them as \npart of our trade negotiations. Certainly nobody else is going to pick \nup the American banner and fight for those kinds of progressive \nAmerican values in the way we can. In fact, it is my view that if our \ncountry fails to lead the way, it will be China that steps in to write \nrules, rules that very likely could hurt American workers and our \nexporters. So we have to engage with modern, progressive trade policies \nand with a higher bar for trade agreements.\n  I recognize there are skeptics with doubts about trade deals and the \nprocess of moving them through Congress. I think we can still take \nsteps to try to reach out to those who have been critical about past \ntrade policy, find common ground, and lock those new policies into the \nfuture way in which we make a trade law.\n  I have indicated for many months that I think those who are skeptical \nabout our trade policies have a valid point when they talk about the \nexcessive secrecy that has so often accompanied much of the trade \ndiscussion. My view has been, if you believe strongly in the benefits \nof trade--and particularly those high-skilled, high-wage export jobs, \nand you want more of them--why in the world would you want to have all \nof this secrecy that just makes Americans so aware of the fact that \nsomething isn't coming to light? They are wondering whether there is a \nreason something has been hidden.\n  Now, it has been too common that Oregonians and other Americans have \nno way of knowing what is on the table in trade talks or how they would \nbe affected. That was a problem with NAFTA, and it has been a problem \nthat has continued over the years.\n  There is no question about the need for protecting some of the \ndetails in our trade negotiations. I often say at a townhall meeting \nthat nobody is talking about giving out the secret sauce in some \nparticular product. But today Americans have reasonable expectations to \nbe able to fire up their computer, click open their browser, and\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nlearn about the public policies that affect them and their families.\n  It is time to close the book on those days when Americans were kept \nin the dark on trade. The reality is, under the old playbook, that \nNAFTA playbook, the President could be handed an agreement for \nsignature and put pen to paper right away.\n  So nothing illustrates better than the changes that Chairman Hatch, \nI, and Chairman Ryan have worked on to put in place a fresh set of \npolicies to ensure that the American people are no longer in the dark \nwith respect to trade.\n  Under this legislation, the President, by law, will have to make the \nfull text of trade deals public for 60 days before a President can sign \nthem. When you factor in the Congress, agreements would be public for \nas many as 100 days before they are voted on and often more.\n  So what that means is, if you live in West Virginia, Utah, Oregon or \nAlaska, you will be able to come to one of our community meetings and \nhave in your hands the trade agreement, starting with the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, for more than 3 months before your Senator or your Member \nof the House has cast a vote on them. For more than 3 months, the \nAmerican people will have the actual text, starting with the Trans-\nPacific Partnership agreement. I think that is a long overdue change. I \nwill say, that is a very dramatic change. That is part of the reason \nwhy I note that this TPA is certainly not one that resembles the NAFTA \nera on transparency.\n  Finally, on the transparency front, long before the deals are \nfinalized, our trade officials would be required to give detailed and \npublic updates on what is at stake in the negotiations. Every Member of \nCongress will have access to the full text, from beginning to end, and \nthe doors will be open for Members to attend negotiating sessions and \nbriefings.\n  Perhaps the most important new tool in this legislation is a new \nprocedure for hitting the brakes on bad trade deals before they reach \nthe Senate or House floor. If a trade deal doesn't meet the high bar \nthe Congress sets under this progressive, modern approach, it will be a \nwhole lot easier to shut it down. It is my view that protecting that \nability makes the process more democratic, and all of those upgrades \nwill close the door on the 1990s and NAFTA once and for all.\n  The second matter at hand now is the support system for American \nworkers known as trade adjustment assistance, and paired with that \nprogram is the health coverage tax credit.\n  When times are tough for workers and industries affected by trade, \nthe health coverage credit guarantees that those persons and their \nfamilies will still be able to see their doctors. And trade adjustment \nassistance is there to help with job training and financial support. It \nis a lifeline for more than 100,000 Americans today, including 3,000 in \nOregon, and it helps to guarantee that those workers and their families \nhave a springboard to a new set of opportunities where they can have \nfor themselves and their families a new opportunity for good-paying \njobs and a chance to get ahead.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program has spent the last few years \nworking at reduced capacity. That would change with this legislation. \nTrade adjustment assistance would be back at full strength in the year \n2021 with a level of funding the administration says will cover \neverybody who qualifies. Once again the program would bring service \nworkers into the mix because it is not just manufacturing employees who \nface competition from abroad. Trade adjustment assistance takes into \naccount competition that comes from anywhere, including China and \nIndia, instead of just a select list of countries.\n  I want to be clear that the Senate is not voting today to give the \ngreen light to the Trans-Pacific Partnership or any other trade \nagreement. As I see it, this is legislation which raises the bar for \ntrade deals and challenges our negotiators to meet it. It will go \nfurther than ever before in stripping the secrecy out of trade policy \nand will provide new accountability by protecting our ability to slam \nthe brakes on trade deals that don't work for our hard-working middle \nclass.\n  When you put these vast improvements together with a next-level \nenforcement system, it is my view that you have a long-overdue \nprogressive, modern approach that sets aside the NAFTA playbook. This \nis a plan which will help get trade done right so that it works better \nfor all Americans, whether they are a service professional, a business \nowner, or a worker who punches the time clock at the end of the day.\n  I will close with just a short statement about why this is especially \ntimely right now. All the evidence suggests that in 2025 there are \ngoing to be 1 billion middle-class workers in the developing world. \nThese are going to be workers with money to spend. They are going to \nbuy computers and helicopters and bicycles, their companies will buy \nplanes, and the list goes on and on. It is my hope and I think the hope \nof every Member of the Senate that we have a trade policy that ensures \nour workers can have the opportunity to export what we make here and \nwhat we grow here--the products of the United States--to this 1-\nbillion-person middle-class market.\n  Let's take this opportunity--a bipartisan opportunity--to have a \nfresh new trade policy that increases the prospect of having American \nworkers, who are the best and most competitive workers on the planet, \nsell the goods and services they make and deliver them to that enormous \nmarket that wants to buy American, wants to buy Oregon. It just seems \nto me to be obvious that we should take the opportunity to tap the \npotential of that market.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, while my colleague from Oregon is \nstill on the floor, I want to thank him for his leadership through \nthese discussions over these past several days on the floor and longer \nprior to that. He has been a leader in trying to thread the needle, and \nit has been a little bit harder, but I appreciate the fact that we are \nhere today and hopefully moving forward to that agreement that will \nallow us as a nation to be the best we can and to engage in a level of \ntrade that is fair, free, and really of great benefit to us as a \nnation. I thank him for that.\n\n\n                          National Police Week\n\n  Madam President, I too want to speak about the trade promotion \nauthority and some of the issues associated with it, but I first want \nto speak briefly and acknowledge the comments made by my colleagues \nfrom New Hampshire when they spoke about National Police Week and \nhonoring those brave men and women who serve us day in and day out, \nthose who go where many of us would choose not to, whose families worry \nabout them, and those who have fallen in the line of their service.\n  This is National Police Week in the Nation's Capital and across \nAmerica. Each year during National Police Week I honor the men and \nwomen of law enforcement who have given their lives in the line of \nduty. In previous Police Week speeches I have taken note of the sad \ncoincidence that a spate of line-of-duty casualties seems to happen in \nthe days and weeks leading up to National Police Week.\n  This year, unfortunately, is no exception. Last weekend the Nation \nwas shocked by the shooting of two members of the Hattiesburg, MS \nPolice Department. A week ago two communities lost law enforcement \nofficers bearing the last name of Moore--Detective Brian Moore of the \nNew York Police Department and Sergeant Greg Moore of Coeur d'Alene, \nID. They are among 45 law enforcement heroes who have died in the line \nof duty this year alone. I extend my condolences to their families and \nto their communities on these tragic losses. And I extend my support to \nmy colleagues from the States of Idaho, Mississippi and New York who \nshare in the grief of their communities. In the U.S. Senate we take the \nloss of a first responder personally for we regard these public \nservants as members of our own extended families.\n  During National Police Week we honor and remember the 117 law \nenforcement officers lost in 2014. Their names were read at a \ncandlelight vigil on Judiciary Square Wednesday evening and their \nmemories will be\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nhonored at the Peace Officers Memorial Service on the Capitol grounds \non Friday. This week the families and colleagues of these 117 officers \nare gathered in Alexandria at the Police Survivors Seminar sponsored by \nConcerns of Police Survivors, where they will gain comfort from a \ncommunity of survivors who have walked in their steps. This week's \nevents are very important steps in the lengthy journey our families \nface to heal their losses. But it is a vital step.\n  I have attended the Police Survivors Seminar and cannot say enough \ngood things about Concerns of Police Survivors and Suzie Sawyer, its \nfounding executive director, who set the standard for caring and \nhealing. Although Suzie claims to have retired, when we face a law \nenforcement tragedy in the State of Alaska I am comforted by the fact \nthat her phone number is still in my speed dial. Sadly I had an \nopportunity to use it in 2014.\n  Last evening I attended the candlelight vigil as I have in past years \nto honor fallen officers from the State of Alaska. Joined on the dais \nby the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary of \nHomeland Security I was honored to read the names of two Alaska State \nTroopers who gave their lives while protecting the Native Village of \nTanana in 2014. Trooper Sergeant P. Scott Johnson and Trooper Gabriel \nLenox Rich at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  I have spoken before about the unique dangers that are presented when \nlaw enforcement officers perform their duties in Alaska Native \nvillages. No roads connected most of these villages to the nearest \ntrooper post which can be hundreds of miles away, accessible only by \nair or boat and only then when the weather cooperates. And that was the \ncase when Sergeant Johnson and Trooper Rich were ambushed in the \nvillage as they sought to apprehend an individual who was driving while \nintoxicated in the village and brandished a weapon at the unarmed \nvillage public safety officer.\n  There is no consoling those who remember the lives and passions of \nScott and Gabe. But it matters that their life stories were not \nforgotten. Fallen law enforcement officers are heroes for the way they \nlive their lives. And at last night's observance the stories of Scott \nand Gabe were an integral part of the event. Attorney General Loretta \nLynch spoke to their heroism as did the event organizers. For the first \ntime I can remember you could see the distinctive tunics worn by our \nAlaska State Troopers among the crowd of 10,000, and as the event ended \nmy staff encountered two members of the Fairbanks Police Department in \nuniform on the streets of downtown Washington. They traveled at their \nown expense to pay their respects to two individuals from Interior \nAlaska who were widely respected by area wide law enforcement. Sergeant \nJohnson was well known as a ``cop's cop''. He was well known as both a \ndrug expert and a tactical expert.\n  The Fairbanks officers mentioned that Scott was gracious with his \ntime and his expertise--providing training to the Fairbanks Police \nDepartment that otherwise would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. \nGabe Rich was a young guy and mentored by the finest of Alaska's \nfinest--Sergeant Johnson--and he demonstrated great potential. Both \nlived their lives as model Alaska State Troopers.\n  Service as an Alaska State Trooper is regarded as a huge deal in our \nState. I am reminded that there are 700,000 law enforcement officers \nacross the country but only 400 have what it takes to be Alaska State \nTroopers. Guardians of the last frontier.\n  In May I came to the floor to discuss the lives of Scott and Gabe and \nthe families they left behind. Today I would like to pay homage to the \norganization they were a valuable part of and devoted their lives to. \nAnd I pay homage to the creed they willfully and enthusiastically chose \nto live their lives by.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Creed of the Alaska State Trooper be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                  THE CREED OF AN ALASKA STATE TROOPER\n\n       From the beginning, society has needed a special few \n     willing to face evil and run toward harm for the sake of \n     others. I am one of those few. I am an Alaska State Trooper. \n     My environment is harsh, vast and unforgiving. I thrive in \n     it. My state is beautiful, majestic and the last of its kind. \n     I will protect it. My integrity is absolute. My loyalty is to \n     what is ethical, right and true. My courage will not falter. \n     Fear does not control me. I am the master of my actions and \n     emotions, regardless of circumstance. When action is needed, \n     I will act. If I fall, I will get back up. If I fail, I will \n     try again. I will either find a way or make one I will never \n     give up. I will be physically superior, mentally tougher and \n     more tenacious than those determined to bring harm to others. \n     I will enhance my knowledge and proficiency every day. My \n     training will never cease. I am a quiet professional. I do \n     not seek recognition for my actions. I accept and will \n     overcome the mental and physical hazards of my profession. I \n     will do what is necessary to place the needs of others before \n     my own. Because I endure this, others won't have to. Titles \n     will not define me. No man will determine my worth. I will \n     live my life according to the creed I have written on my \n     heart, regardless of my position, rank or title. I will stand \n     on the shoulders of those who have gone before me. I am honor \n     bound to maintain the proud traditions of Alaska's finest. \n     The fallen are honored by my actions and I commit myself \n     daily to the mighty cause of preserving this honor. I am an \n     Alaska State Trooper.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I will close with these words which appear at the \ngates to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. The words of \nPresident George H.W. Bush: ``Carved on these walls is the story of \nAmerica, of a continuing quest to preserve both democracy and decency, \nand to protect a national treasure that we call the American dream.'' \nLast evening the names of Patrick Scott Johnson and Gabriel Lenox Rich \nwere carved into those walls. A reminder, once again, that in valor \nthere is hope.\n  Madam President, returning to the issue of trade in my State of \nAlaska, we are here to debate trade promotion authority. We have had an \nopportunity to proceed to this measure. I was pleased to be able to \nvote to advance it earlier this week and again today, and I will \ncontinue to support free trade.\n  In my State, which is separated from the contiguous 48 States, our \ntrade is based primarily with those to the west in Asia. Most of our \ntrade does not go to the lower 48 States. So when we think about our \ntrading partners, for Alaskans, it is international trade. \nInternational trade in our State supports about 1 in 5 jobs--over \n90,000 Alaskan jobs. Of those who are exporters, about 70 percent are \nsmall- and medium-sized companies. These are men and women who are \nengaged in a very sophisticated level of trade overseas, but many of \nthem are relatively small. We are very vigorous in our trade with \nJapan, South Korea, and China, but we also have good relationships, of \ncourse, with our friends in Europe and elsewhere around the globe.\n  In 2013, the countries that are negotiating the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership--the TPP--and the TTIP agreements comprised about 54 \npercent of Alaska's exported goods. This is a significant part of what \nwe look to for our exports. As we look to the TPP and the benefits that \nit will accrue, I think our State is looking to clearly strengthen \nthese relationships as well as open new markets for Alaska's exports.\n  About 34,000 Alaska jobs are supported by trade with TPP countries. \nThirty-six percent of Alaska's goods are exported to TPP countries, and \nmore than 50 TPP companies have investments within the State of Alaska.\n  One of our longest and more established trading partners--Japan--is \nobviously not a current U.S. FTA partner, but the TPP negotiations will \nprovide an avenue for removing some of the trade barriers we see with \nJapan and will allow us additional economic opportunities within the \nState of Alaska, specifically as it relates to our fish, our fisheries, \nand our frozen fish. Current tariff rates to export frozen fish and \nprepared crabs to Japan are about 10 percent, so a free-trade agreement \nwill lower these tariffs and increase access to Japan's seafood market. \nThis is something we care a great deal about, and it has been a very \nlongstanding partnership and relationship.\n  Today, I want to move from some of the issues relating to my State \nand what opportunities there will be for us with the prospect of trade \npromotion authority moving forward and I want to draw attention to a \nrelated issue. This is an issue that is outdated when\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\nit comes to exports and, very specifically, a ban on exports. What I am \nreferring to is the current ban, the prohibition on crude oil exports. \nThis absolutely runs counter to the principle of free trade as well as \nthe notion that we should stand ready to help our allies, to help our \nfriends for the sake of global security.\n  We talk a lot about national security. We talk a lot about what more \nwe can do to provide for national security and the geopolitics and how \nwe can be of help to our friends and allies. Well, one way we can \ndemonstrate our willingness to help is by lifting this decades-old ban, \nthis prohibition on our crude oil and allow for exports.\n  I want to share with my colleagues five quick facts they may or may \nnot know about our Nation's history of oil exports, because while we \nhave this ban in place--and it has been in place since the mid-1970s--\nthere is a history that I think is important.\n  The first fact goes back to World War II. The United States exported \ntens of millions of barrels of crude oil to our allies in World War II, \nand I am talking about Canada, the United Kingdom, India, and \nAustralia. We were engaged in a very robust level of exports to our \nfriends during World War II.\n  Second fact: When Egypt seized control of the Suez Canal, President \nEisenhower moved quickly, and he ordered American oil to relieve what \nwas called Europe's oil famine. That was pretty immediate, that was \npretty direct, and it was targeted to help our allies and friends at \nthat time.\n  Third fact: When Rhodesia cut off the flow of oil to Zambia in 1965, \nAmerica stood with Britain to provide assistance. We delivered \npetroleum products in the Zambian airlift. So we were there in 1965 \nwhen Zambia needed that assistance.\n  Then, in the 1970s, facing a threat from multiple regimes, Israel \nsecured an agreement from the United States to supply it with oil in \nthe event of a national emergency. So this agreement was made back in \n1975. This was under the administration of President Ford, and that \nagreement was that the United States would stand with our friend and \nally and provide oil in the event that their sources were threatened, \nthat Israel was threatened.\n  That agreement stood through President Ford's administration, \nPresident Carter's, President Bill Clinton's, President George Bush's, \nand with President Obama's administration. So it is an agreement that \nhas endured--that we will stand by our friend Israel in providing it \nwith a source of oil in the event of a national emergency. This is \nsomething where we just got the administration to sign off on this just \nliterally a month or so ago, to re-affirm that agreement.\n  Then, the fifth fact here is that former Ambassador Carlos Pascual \nand others have testified before our energy committee that the \nsanctions against Iran--which brought Iran to the table--worked. They \nworked because of rising U.S. oil production. He went further to say \nthat we were hamstrung by our inability to export it.\n  We have heard this consistently in the energy committee. We heard \nthis discussed on the floor of the Senate the past couple of weeks when \nwe were talking about the Iran deal. Today, we are in a position where \nour friends, our trading partners, and our allies are again asking for \nour assistance. We have the resource.\n  Some would say we are awash in oil right now. The production we have \nseen has been nothing short of phenomenal. But we are tied. We are \nlimited in our ability to move it beyond our shores. Our allies are \nlooking at us, and they are in the grips of tension.\n  Look at our friends and allies in Poland. Poland is 96-percent \ndependent on Russia for their oil. Don't we think that Poland would \nrather receive their oil from their friend the United States? Poland \nhas been there with us when it comes to national missile defense. With \njust about every engagement we have had, Poland has been there for us. \nWouldn't it be nice for us to be there for our friend Poland?\n  Just a couple weeks ago, we had the Prime Minister of Japan here, Mr. \nAbe. Iran is still supplying oil to Japan, despite those sanctions. \nJapan needs a source of oil. Don't we think that Japan would much \nrather receive oil from the United States--more crude from the United \nStates?\n  I think we recognize the world has changed out there. There are new \nalliances, there are new threats, there are new hopes, and there are \nnew fears. It remains my hope that, while the world may change, our \nrole as a global leader has not eroded. And one way--one clear, sure \nway--we can ensure that it hasn't eroded is to help our friends and to \nuse our resource as a national strategic asset to help our friends and \nallies.\n  The whole idea that oil exports are still prohibited is just mind-\nboggling. I have been working on this now for over a year. We have been \nencouraging different reports so people really understand this issue \nand wrap their minds around it, because to change a policy that has \nbeen in place for decades takes understanding and education. I am \nwilling to give that time, but I also appreciate that the policy that \nis in place right now just doesn't make sense.\n  The Commerce Department retains a list of commodities that are \ndefined in short simply, and they call this the Short Supply Controls. \nHistorically, these controls were generally not blanket prohibitions. \nThey were on things such as aluminum, copper, iron, steel scrap, \nnickel, selenium, and the polio vaccine.\n  But it is interesting--we look at that Short Supply Controls list \nright now, and there are three items on that list. The first, \nobviously, is crude oil; the second is western red cedar; and the third \nis horses for export by sea intended for slaughter.\n  Now, there is a small caveat, because there is a prohibition of \nexports of petroleum products that would come from the Naval Petroleum \nReserve, but it is very small. So really what we are talking about and \nthe three items that are on this Short Supply Controls list--in other \nwords, prohibited--are oil, cedar, and horses. Go figure.\n  Now, we do have embargoes on North Korea, for example, and we control \nthe export of other things such as sensitive technology. But crude \noil's presence on the Short Supply Controls, I think, is particularly \nconspicuous, since we export our petroleum products--our refined \nproducts--at record levels. I think it is important for people to make \nthat distinction because sometimes there is a little bit of confusion.\n  We export our refined products at record levels. What we don't export \nis the crude. Some people say: Well, I am afraid that if we lift the \noil export ban and we allow for crude export, the price of oil or the \nprice at the pump is going to go up, and I am worried about that. I \nthink we would all be worried about that. We don't want to see the \nprice of gasoline at the pump go up. The fact remains that what we put \nin our vehicle, what we pump at the filling station is a refined \nproduct that we already export. So we don't see that price spike; we \ndon't see that increase. What we don't refine is the crude product.\n  We have engaged in study after study after study. There have been \nabout eight different, very reputable studies out there, and each and \nevery one of them has come to the same conclusion--that allowing for \nthe lifting of the export ban will not increase the price of gas to the \nconsumer. I think it is important to reaffirm that.\n  I urge my colleagues who are ready to vote for trade promotion \nauthority to consider joining my effort. My colleague Senator Heitkamp \nfrom North Dakota is working with me on the other side to lift this \nban, to extend the principle of free trade to crude oil exports.\n  We export natural gas. We export diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, natural \ngasoline, propane, coal--so many other petroleum products.\n  I should end by reminding people that the ban that we have in place \ndoes allow for certain limited amounts of export. Today, we export to \nCanada about 4,000 barrels a day. I think that is about average right \nnow. With Alaska, there is an exception that allowed for export of \nAlaska crude back in the mid 1990s. I just asked for confirmation on \nwhat we have been exporting. Last year, in September of 2014, we \nexported about 800,000 barrels to South Korea, and I am told that just \nthis month, in May, there were 975,000 barrels that went over to South \nKorea.\n  So we in Alaska are trying to do our little bit to help. We need to \nget our oil pipeline filled up so that we can do more to export more to \nthose who are\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\nour friends, partners, and allies. But this is something for which, \nagain, the time is now. The subject is ripe as we are talking about \nallowing for greater opportunities for export. But when we look to \nthose policies that hold us back--hold us back from good jobs, from \nproducing our resources to our benefit and our economy's benefit and to \nthe benefit of our friends and allies--it is time that we lift the ban \non crude oil. Doing so will create jobs, strengthen our security, lower \nour trade deficit, and, again, as study after study has shown, not \nraise our gasoline prices.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time on the floor this \nafternoon, and look forward to working with my colleagues on these \nissues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer for \nletting me talk about the trade agenda this afternoon. And I appreciate \nthe words of my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, regarding the \nliquefied natural gas exports and oil exports.\n  This is a discussion about how we ensure that we are accessing the 95 \npercent of consumers who live outside of our borders. For the workers \nand farmers I represent in Ohio, that is really important. This is how \nwe are going to be able to get this economy back on track. In part, it \nis to provide more markets--more customers.\n  Already in my State of Ohio, we depend heavily on exports. One out of \nevery three acres that is planted in Ohio--we are one of the top farm \nStates in the country. We are proud of that. It is the No. 1 industry. \nOne out of every three acres that is planted is exported. Of our \nsoybean crop, which is typically our biggest crop in Ohio, 60 percent \ngets exported. So for farmers, in order to keep their prices up, these \nforeign markets are absolutely critical.\n  But it is also really important for our manufacturing sector in Ohio. \nAbout 25 percent of our manufacturing jobs are export jobs. And, \nfrankly, what has happened over the last 7 years, while America has not \nbeen in the business of opening up these markets, is that they are \nbeginning to lose their market share.\n  So it is good for us to expand exports. We have to do that because \nthat creates not only more jobs in my State and in our country, but it \nalso creates better jobs. These are higher-paying jobs with better \nbenefits.\n  Those 95 percent of consumers outside of the United States border \ndeserve to get some products stamped ``Made in America'' because they \nare great products. They are great agricultural products, great \nmanufacturing products, great services. We should be aggressively \nexpanding our exports.\n  But while we do that, we have to be sure it is fair, too. We have to \nbe sure that these other countries are not sending us imports that are \ntraded at below their cost--that is called dumping--that they aren't \nillegally subsidizing their exports, which happens. That is when you \nput duties in place to make sure they are not doing things to make the \nplaying field unlevel, and so that our workers who are doing all the \nright things--playing by the rules, becoming more competitive, and \nmaking concessions to be competitive--are not left holding the bag and \ndon't get the short end of the stick. Instead, they get the ability to \ncompete on a level playing field. If they can do that, they will be \njust fine. We will be able to expand exports, and therefore, create \nthese better-paying jobs we talked about.\n  That is what this debate should be all about. It is about a balance. \nIt is about expanding exports, at the same time making sure that the \nrules of the road work for all of us, including our workers and our \nfarmers, our service providers in my State of Ohio and all around our \ngreat country.\n  I am delighted to see that we are moving forward with this debate \nbecause it is an honest debate we have to have.\n  And for those who just say that we can expand exports but we can't do \nanything about this unfair trade, I think that is not the right \nbalance. For those who say we shouldn't be doing these exports because \nsomehow that doesn't help our workers because there is so much unfair \ntrade out there, that doesn't work, either. There is a balance in \nbetween here.\n  One of the issues I have spent a lot of time working on over the \nyears and looking at is this trade distortion called currency \nmanipulation. Look, I understand it is a complicated area, and some \npeople think we just shouldn't touch it or maybe it is something that \nonly the Department of Treasury can deal with because it is currency. \nIt is not technically products and goods. But I would say that there is \nnot a Member in this body who doesn't believe that when another country \nmanipulates its currency to expand its exports, that that affects \ntrade. It is just obvious.\n  If you are trying in a deliberate way to lower the cost of your \nexports by lowering the value of your currency vis-a-vis another \ncountry, such as us, that is going to help you in trade.\n  I had the fasteners in here this week. These are the people who make \nnuts and bolts and screws, and they are big in Ohio. We are happy to \nhave a good fastener industry in Ohio. But they will tell you that \ntheir margins are pretty tight.\n  Chairman Volcker, who was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, made \nan interesting statement. He said that, in 1 week, through currency \nmanipulation, we can do away with all the benefits of years of trade \nnegotiations. Sadly, I think that is true.\n  So while we are promoting exports, we should also make it clear that \nwe do not believe we should distort trade. And for our Republican \ncolleagues, those of us who believe in markets, we should be against \ndistortions--and this is a market distortion. We should speak up about \nit and not be shy about it and not suggest that somehow, because it is \nsomething that traditionally has been handled by the Treasury \nDepartment and by the International Monetary Fund and as a currency \nissue, it doesn't affect trade. It does affect trade.\n  Now, if they were making great progress on it at the International \nMonetary Fund, I might feel differently about it. But why not include \nit as a trade negotiating objective? I think it makes all the sense in \nthe world. We are going to have an amendment to do just that, and it \nwill be on the floor next week as we take up the trade promotion \nauthority.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at it, objectively. It is very \ntargeted. It does not deal with a country being able to adjust its \nmonetary policy. It explicitly says it does not relate to monetary \npolicy, macroeconomic policy. It has to do with deliberate intervention \nin currency markets to have this benefit in exports we talked about, \nagain, to distort the free market in order for other countries to be \nable to sell their products to us at a lower value than they should be \nand in turn, for our exports to them to be at a higher value, which \nmakes it harder for us to keep jobs here in America.\n\n  People say this is all about the auto industry. Yes, the autoworkers \ncare about it, and they should--so do the auto companies, so do the \nfastener companies, so do the steel companies, so does anybody or any \ngroup in Ohio that is concerned about ensuring that they get a level \nplaying field for their exports, because currency manipulation does not \nhelp anybody. People say: Well, why are you doing this now, because \nthese countries, such as Japan, are not currently manipulating their \ncurrency? I agree. Since probably the end of 2011, 2012, Japan stopped \nmanipulation of their currency. They would not fall under these \ncriteria we played out. But they have done it over 300 times in the \npast.\n  All we are saying is this: Is it not right that when we are \nnegotiating an agreement, we put in place some kind of discipline to \nsay we do not want you to do this in the future because it is not fair \nfor you and for us? Trade ought to be about balance--not just a balance \nof expanding exports but also having enforcement measures in place to \nlevel that playing field I talked about, and balance in the sense that \nwe sell something to you, we get some money from doing that, and we use \nthat money to buy something from the other place. So you have a balance \nin terms of trade. You do not have these huge surpluses you see in \ncountries such as China, for instance, where they have manipulated \ntheir currency.\n  I hope this issue will be one that we can address in an objective \nmanner.\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nTake the politics out of it. Let's decide what is best for the workers \nand farmers we represent and for the overall health of our economy. If \nwe are going to get back into the business of trade--which I think we \nshould--I think we should be expanding trade by doing good agreements \nthat knock down the barriers to us so that it is fair. If we do that, \nlet's be sure that we can build a consensus for that among the American \npeople, who get it. They understand that we need to have exports. But \nthey also understand that we need to have more fairness.\n  There are other issues as well that we are going to address in the \nSenate in the trade promotion authority vote next week. I hope some of \nthem will be issues that we actually voted on today in the Customs \nbill. Some of you followed this closely, but in the Customs bill there \nwere a number of enforcement measures, not just on currency but also on \nthis issue of how do you show when you are injured, as an American \ncompany, if there is unfair trade. If another country sells something \nover here below its cost--meaning they dumped it here--or if they \nsubsidized something illegally, how do you show as an American company \nthat you have been injured by it in order to get the relief that you \nand the workers you represent deserve?\n  Right now, it is very difficult sometimes to show injury, to the \npoint that some companies tell me: Rob, by the time we were able to go \nthrough this process and show that we were injured, it was too late. We \nhad lost too much market share. We were not able to get back on our \nfeet.\n  There is a very simple provision. It is a Brown-Portman amendment \nthat was included in the Customs bill. We voted on it today. I would \nurge my colleagues to help us get that provision into the TPA bill as \nwell because we know that the Customs bill may or may not make it \nthrough the process. We believe that the trade promotion authority bill \nis much more likely to make it through the process and to the \nPresident's desk for signature.\n  I hope we have that provision in there. I asked my own leadership to \ninclude it in the substitute that was filed apparently today. I do not \nknow if it is in there. I am told it is probably not. I am sorry to \nhear that because it was one that we seem to have a bipartisan \nconsensus on in committee. I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden \nbecause they included it in the committee markup on the Customs bill. \nWe did not have a vote as an amendment because they included it in the \nmarkup because they thought it was good policy.\n  Yet, somehow in the substitute, I understand it may not be in there. \nI hope it is. But if it is not, we intend to offer an amendment to have \nit included. I hope my colleagues will support that, because, again, if \nyou are talking about trade in a State such as Ohio where we have a lot \nof manufacturing, you have to be sure to be able to look workers in the \neye and say: This is going to be fair for you. Get in this business of \ntrade because we want to access the 95 percent of consumers outside of \nour borders, but we are going to help you. If somebody unfairly \ncompetes with you by dumping their product or illegally subsidizing \ntheir product, you know what, we will be there for you. We are going to \nbe able to level that playing field by adding tariffs to their products \nbecause it is illegal what they are doing.\n  I have been active on this issue back home, not just on the material \ninjury standard, which is what this is about when you get injured in \ntrade, but also on this issue of being sure that we are opening up more \nmarkets for all of our Ohio products.\n  Ohio manufacturers right now in rebar, hot-rolled steel, tires, and \nuncoated paper are all involved in trade cases such as this--all of \nthem. They all want to know that this is going to be fair.\n  Wheatland Tube is one of the Nation's largest producers of steel pipe \nand tube products. They have four facilities in Ohio: one in Warren, \none in Niles, one in Cambridge, and one in Brookfield. They make \nproducts ranging from steel products for the energy industry, pipe for \nhydraulic tracking, and so on--construction industry. They have been \nparticularly impacted by a number of these trade enforcement cases, \nincluding several crucial cases we won last year on pipe and tube from \nChina. We have had some nice victories for them. In fact, given the \nimport concerns they have, I understand the plant in Warren, OH, which \nhas 178 workers, probably would not be in existence today if we had not \nwon these trade enforcement measures. Here is a plant with 178 people \nin Warren, OH, who would not have a job today if not for our standing \nup for them and saying we are going to help you when there is an unfair \nimport coming into this country.\n  The workers there understand this issue. They get it because they \nknow it has a direct impact on their jobs. Let me read an email I \nreceived this week from Mike Mack. Mike is a maintenance foreman at \nWheatland Tube in Warren, OH. This is what he said:\n\n       As an individual employed in manufacturing, I understand \n     better than most that trade is a key component for economic \n     growth. However, it's important for U.S. manufacturers (i.e. \n     steel pipe and tube producers) to have the tools to challenge \n     unfair trade. . . . I support the adoption of enforcement \n     provisions . . . that will close loop holes in the trade laws \n     to ensure that companies can access these laws to challenge \n     trade distorting practices.\n\n  I continue with his quote.\n\n       I also support language in the TPA that prevents currency \n     manipulation and the ``dumping'' of foreign products in the \n     U.S.\n       It's essential that provisions to close loop holes in trade \n     laws are included in a final trade bill. After all, there's a \n     huge difference between FAIR trade and FREE trade.\n\n  He says his company ``relies on these laws, and has utilized them in \nrecent years to challenge trade distorting practices that have injured \nour industry and our employees.''\n  He says:\n\n       Without laws to regulate unfair trade, I know my job--and \n     the jobs of thousands of other manufacturing workers--is at \n     risk.\n\n  I think that email says it well. He did not say he is against trade. \nHe did not say he is against exports. In fact, he said that ``trade is \na key component for economic growth.'' He supports it. He just wants to \nknow there is going to be a balance.\n  If there is a balance, Mike will stand up and support trade. But if \nthere is not, he, understandably, is worried about his job and the jobs \nof his colleagues at that company and the companies all over my State.\n  I really hope that as we promote trade--and we should--we do so in a \nmore balanced way. If we do that, I think we are going to build a \nbroader consensus for doing exactly what we should be doing--reengaging \nin the world, expanding markets, and knocking down barriers to trade--\ntariff barriers and nontariff barriers alike.\n  As some of you know, I was the U.S. Trade Representative for a while. \nI had that great honor to be able to travel all around the world \nrepresenting our great country. Other countries are looking to us to \nable to knock down these barriers to trade because they are unfair, \nbecause they know that it helps the economies in their countries \ndevelop.\n  Developing countries know in their hearts that higher tariffs and \nnontariff barriers between countries make it harder to grow a middle \nclass, to be able to bring people out of poverty, and they depend us \nfor that. They also depend on us to ensure that the rules of the road \nare fair. It affects us. It affects this plant in Warner, OH, and it \nalso affects them.\n  They suffer from currency manipulation, too. They suffer from \nunfairly traded imports, too. Frankly, they are not always strong \nenough or big enough countries to be able to stand up to it. America's \nrole in the world is truly exceptional. It is truly essential that we \nare out there. It is true on a whole broad range of issues--from human \nrights, to fighting terrorism, to keeping open the Strait of Hormuz, \nthe South China Sea, and so on.\n  It is also important on trade. This is an opportunity for us to stand \nup here in this Chamber and say we are going to get back into the \nbusiness of expanding trade. We are going to do it in a balanced way.\n  Finally, let me mention a specific issue that is part of the trade \nlegislation coming to the floor. This is about something beyond \nexporting American products. It is about exporting American values and \nthe rule of law. As I said, countries are looking for us, in part, to \nlet people know what the rules of the road ought to be. One of those\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nrules of the road ought to be that we believe that human trafficking \nought to be stopped, whether it is in our country or on other shores.\n  Addressing human trafficking has been a really bipartisan issue here \nin this body. I serve as cochair of the Senate Caucus to End Human \nTrafficking. I started it a few years ago with Senator Blumenthal. \nSince we founded the caucus in 2012, we have made real progress, \npassing a number of bills to end trafficking in Government contracting, \nfor instance, reauthorizing the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. A \nfew weeks ago we passed a big bill called the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act. We passed it 99 to 0. Three bills that I had proposed \nwere part of that package. It is good legislation.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I was happy to support a \nbipartisan amendment to the trade promotion authority that was offered \nby Senator Menendez. It puts additional teeth into our trafficking \nenforcement so that countries that are dealing with us in a trade \nagreement know that we are serious, if year after year they turn a \nblind eye to the horrible reality of human trafficking in their labor \nmarkets and in their countries.\n  The question before us is this: Do we keep that in this legislation \nor not? I think we should not water down trafficking protections that \nhave already been adopted by a bipartisan majority of the Finance \nCommittee by a vote of 16-10. I think we should take into account the \nhorrendous human trafficking record of some of the world's worst \noffenders.\n  If we do--if we do that--we are going to be able to help stop human \ntrafficking globally. If we do not do that, if we water it down, I fear \nwe are giving some of these countries an easy way out, promoting \ntrafficking by letting countries get around the rules.\n  Every year, the State Department issues the ``Trafficking in Persons \nReport,'' or TIP--``Trafficking in Persons Report.'' The report ranks \ncountries. They have different tiers. Tier 1 means the country is \nresponsive and proactive to combating human trafficking. Tier 3 means \nthe country has failed to take steps to prevent trafficking, and the \nlaws and policies of the country actually promote a market that \nencourages human trafficking, so that is the State Department.\n  I understand this report--the TIP Report--will be released in June. \nIt has already been substantially drafted. I understand that one of the \nTPP countries may fall in category 3, tier 3. This government continues \nto detain trafficking victims for periods of time, treating them as \ncriminals for months or years, we are told. This country does not \nsupport the NGOs, the nongovernmental groups in the region that provide \ncounseling or rehabilitation for victims. This is from the State \nDepartment.\n  The most egregious trend highlighted by the State Department is that \nthis government is now identifying fewer victims and conducting fewer \ninvestigations than in recent years.\n  Should we be concerned about that? Yes, we should. I think there is \nnothing wrong with us including that, to provide that incentive and to \nprovide that leverage in this TPA bill that we are going to vote on \nearly next week.\n  The trafficking in persons office is independent. They are not swayed \nby political considerations. That is my sense of it. It is a good \noffice. I will have enormous respect for their TIP analysis. I will be \ndisappointed if that language is not included in the trade agreement.\n  Again, the Finance Committee--with the support of five Republicans, \nincluding me--passed this amendment, and I think Senator Menendez's \nattention to this issue is appropriate. I hope it will stand up, as we \ndid with the 99-to-0 vote with regard to the broader legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for giving me the ability to talk about \nthese issues today. I think it is incredibly important that we move \nforward with expanding trade. I think trade promotion authority is \nneeded to do that. But as we do it, let's be sure that we are able to \nlook those workers and those farmers in the eye back home and say: You \nknow what. This is going to work for you, too. It is going to work for \nall of us. This is going to work because we are giving you access to \nmarkets you would not otherwise have. That creates more and better-\npaying jobs. But we are also going to be sure that it is a more level \nplaying field, that you are able to compete effectively and win because \nthe rules won't be rigged against you. The rules are going to be fair \nfor everybody.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate the excellent remarks that \nwere made by the distinguished Senator from Ohio and other Senators on \nthe floor this day. There is no question that the Senator from Ohio is \na very strong leader when it comes to international trade, having \nserved as the Nation's Trade Representative and having served very \nwell.\n  Not only was he a great Trade Representative, but he is a great \nSenator. I have a very high regard for him. I understand why he--just \nas I am--is working to push this bill through Congress.\n  We have enough Democrats who are pro-free trade and understand what \nthis bill will do for them, and I think we have enough Republicans. \nLet's just hope that we can put this through.\n  Having said all of that, I wish to praise the President. I have had \nmany differences with the President over the years. We have always been \ncordial. There is no question that I care for him, and I hope he cares \nfor me. But the fact is that on this issue, our President happens to be \nright, and that is why I was pretty upset the other day when cloture \nwas not invoked. I am glad we were able to work together to overcome \nthat logjam and have the bill on the floor now, and hopefully we will \novercome any desire to filibuster this bill in any way, shape, or form.\n  There have been many heroic Democrats who have worked on this bill, \nand I want to pay homage to all of them, from Senator Wyden right on \nthrough. They all deserve a lot of credit. There are not enough, but \nnevertheless a good number, and those folks deserve a lot of credit for \nstanding up for this bill the way they have.\n  Think about it. The Senator from Ohio, Mr. Portman, said that 95 to \n96 percent of all of the world's consumers live outside of the United \nStates of America. That ought to tell anybody--even an idiot--that this \nbill is important and that international trade is important. We have \nall kinds of small and large businesses that are doing trade overseas \nbut are severely limited because of the lack of a free-trade agreements \nwith a wide variety of countries.\n  The advantage of this particular agreement--and people are starting \nto realize that it is a very advantageous agreement--is that this will \nprovide great trade relations.\n  This bill will provide a means whereby 11 countries in the Asian-\nPacific--through the Trans-Pacific Partnership--will have great trading \nrights with us, and us with them.\n  Additionally, should this bill pass, there are 28 nations in Europe \nthat are party to the TTIP negotiations, and this will be one of the \nmost important things we can do to keep trade alive and interchange \nwith these countries in ways that will benefit not only them but us.\n  The fact is that we know that trade generally helps us to have better \njobs in this country, and the proven fact is that when we negotiate \nfree trade agreements, wages go up. So it is good for our workers, it \nis good for our consumers because we will be able to purchase products \nat better prices than we have in the past, and it is good for our \ncountry because we will lead the world in trade. Although we are far \naway from that right now because there are 400 trade agreements in the \nworld and we are only signed on to 20 of them. It shows how lacking we \nare in negotiating the free-trade agreements that we really ought to.\n  This bill will push us forward, and it will enable us to create free \ntrade agreements with countries that compose 40 to 60 percent of \nworldwide trade. That should say to anybody that this is a good thing \nto do. It creates jobs, it creates opportunities, and it also creates \nbetter relationships between our Nation and the almost 40 nations \ncurrently in negotiations with us under TPP and TTIP.\n  Having said that, there are those who do not like this bill. The \nlabor unions, in particular, don't like this bill. I\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nthink some of the union members do, because it means a level \ninternational playing field for their jobs, higher pay, more \nopportunity, their States can get well and strong, that their \nagriculture is going to improve, their industry is going to improve, \nand their manufacturers are going to improve. I could go on and on. It \ncreates more jobs, more opportunities, and higher paying jobs.\n  It is pretty hard for anybody to really cite any reason why they \nshould vote against this agreement. A lot of people have misconstrued--\nsome of the most brilliant people in the Senate--that it as though this \nis the final trade agreement, that is TPP, with 11 nations.\n  This is TPP. This is the procedural agreement that makes it possible \nfor those nations to sign treaties with us knowing that when the TPP or \nthe TTIP agreements are brought to the Senate and the House, we will \nsimply have a right to a vote those agreements up or down.\n  After having a complete look at them, there will be lots of \ntransparency. People have been raising the issue that this is not \ntransparent. Well, this is not the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement; \nthis is the mechanism through which we can arrive at a Trans-Pacific \nPartnership Agreement. This bill provides more transparency than any \nother TPA agreement in the past.\n  This opens up the world for trade and says to the other countries \nthat we are willing to comply with certain rules and regulations if \nthey will. And in the process, we know that we are not going to be able \nto conclude most of these individual trade agreements with individual \nnations unless we have trade promotion authority in law because these \ncountries don't want to enter into a very difficult, intensively \ncomplex set of negotiations if their only hope is that the negotiations \nin the trade agreement that they signed would be brought back to the \ntwo Houses of Congress that could do whatever they want to with it and \nopen it up to any kinds of amendments. They are not going to sign on to \nthese trade agreements.\n  We have had some representatives of some of these 11 countries in the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership negotiations saying that unless we pass trade \npromotion authority, they will not sign on to any agreement, and I can \nhardly blame them because you never know what Congress is going to do \nonce these agreements come back.\n  We do have a right to know what they are. We do have a right to look \nat them thoroughly. We do have a right to debate them on the floor. We \ndo have a right to vote up or down for or against these treaties, and \nthat is a right this particular bill enshrines. That is an important \nright. On the other hand, we need to have TPA in order to attract other \ncountries to negotiate and conclude agreements with our country, which \nis what this agreement is all about.\n  So those who are saying ``Well, this is not transparent'' or ``We \ndon't know what is in the TPP'' and so forth, of course they don't. It \nis not concluded yet. But this gives us the right to know, this gives \nus the right to debate, this gives us the right to vote, and this gives \nus the right to be part of that system.\n  The administration has made it very clear that they will work in a \nway that every Senator in the Senate and every Member of the House of \nRepresentatives will have a right, if they want to, to participate in \nthe process under certain terms that are really outlined by this \nparticular bill.\n  What we are talking about here today is future trillions of dollars \nin trade--not just billions, trillions. We are talking about the United \nStates being a leader of the free world. We are talking about leading \nother nations to come and work with us for freedom in this world.\n  Think about it. If we get those mainly Asian-Pacific countries in the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement to agree to this agreement and \nagree to work with us on trade that will send a message to everybody in \nthat area that they better work with the United States as well. It \nsends a message to every country in the world, really, that if they are \nwilling to work in a fair way with the United States of America then we \nare willing to work with them.\n  If we don't pass this legislation, can you imagine what it will do to \nour relationships with many of these countries that are absolutely \ncritical to our foreign influence? I would say all 11 of the Asian-\nPacific and 28 of the European countries are. These are important \ncountries to us. Just the massive percentage of trade in the world that \nis done by these almost 40 countries says to anybody--any thinking \nperson--you would be crazy not to enter into agreements that outline \nhow we can do things, do them right, protect intellectual property, and \ndo a lot of other things that good trading relationships can grow from.\n  This will enable us to at least work with the United States Trade \nRepresentative, the Ambassador Michael Froman, and conclude these \nagreements so that everybody in our country will benefit from them. It \njust makes sense.\n  Not only that, can you imagine, if we fail to pass TPA--trade \npromotion authority--the message it will send to almost 40 countries, \nincluding ours? Can you imagine what message that would be? Not only \nthat, but it would interfere with foreign policy objectives for our \ncountry in many years to come in drastically bad ways.\n  So the frightened people who don't like this approach, of giving the \nadministration the tools it needs to be able to properly negotiate \nfree-trade agreements with other countries need to understand that this \nis the best tool Congress has to give the American people the level \nplaying field and competitive edge they have worked so hard for. It \nalso lets other countries know they are going to have to comply with \nimportant and relevant terms--and it says to the people in all of those \ncountries that the United States is a dependable partner to deal with.\n  This is an important debate, and that is why it has come so far. I \nwish to personally applaud the heroic Democrats who are willing to \nstand up for this, as well as Republicans. We can always find something \nwrong with every piece of legislation that comes through this place. I \ndon't know of many that have been perfect, although I am sure there \nhave been a few. Nothing seems to be perfect, but what we try to do \nhere is do the absolute best we can to get as close to perfection as we \ncan. Yes, this is not a perfect bill, but, by gosh, it takes us a long \nway toward resolving all kinds of disputes and relationships throughout \nthe world.\n  This is an important bill, and we will begin the real work by holding \nvotes on the bill on Monday. Hopefully, our colleagues will pay \nattention to what is in this bill and what it really means; that it is \nnot the Trans-Pacific Partnership but that it is a means by which \nCongress has a say in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and TTIP, the \nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, and it gives us some \nauthority over these matters. Plus, it helps us to comply, cooperate \nwith, and work with the President of the United States and the people \nhe has designated to negotiate these agreements. It is just the right \nthing to do.\n\n  I have to say this would be a crown for the Obama administration \nshould we pass this through. It would be a crown to every Senator and \nevery House Member who votes for it. It is going to be a crown that a \nlot of people will be able to wear for years to come--at least 6 \nyears--and it will be helpful to future administrations as well.\n  So I hope our colleagues will help us to pass this bill. I hope they \nwill help us to keep amendments that shouldn't be on and that really \naren't helpful off this bill. I hope they will help us to keep the \npoison pills that sometimes come up around here off, so this bill can \npass through and become law. Then, it will enable whatever \nadministration it is--this administration for the next year and a half, \napproximately--to be able to complete some of these agreements with \nother countries that are important to our well-being as well as their \nwell-being, that may be as important to our relationship with them as \nit is to their relationships with us, and to our region as well as \ntheir region. To have the United States of America working with them \nand have them working with us sends a message to a lot of enemies \naround this world that we are making headway. We are doing things the \nway they ought to be done, that the United States is a good trading \npartner, and that as tough as it sometimes is to get these types of \nlandmark pieces of legislation through\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\nboth Houses of Congress, this one is worthwhile to put through.\n  I hope we will conclude this in a way that will help the \nadministration do a really good job and will help us to move forward as \na nation and will help our economy and help their economies and create \ngreater foreign policy presence for our great country around the world, \nespecially for the countries involved in these agreements.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, this is a very important debate. I was \nhere earlier this week and I look forward to more debate next week. I \nlook forward to a vote on the Portman-Stabenow amendment addressing \ncurrency manipulation.\n  At this point in time, I wish to speak as in morning business, and I \nask unanimous consent to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Remembering Rachel Jacobs\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate in memory of a young woman whose life was extraordinary and \nmeaningful and whose passing has left so many of us so profoundly sad.\n  On Tuesday night, Rachel Jacobs left work and boarded a train to go \nhome to her husband Todd and her 2-year-old son Jacob. Rachel's life, \nso filled with passion and purpose, was lost that night, along with at \nleast seven others, when her train--and we all know now about the \ntrain--derailed just outside of Philadelphia.\n  Rachel touched so many lives all across the country. Today, all of \nthose hearts are broken. The loss is so profound. Her family has lost a \nwonderful wife and mother and daughter and sister, and all of us have \nlost someone who had accomplished so much already in her young life and \nwould have done so much more to make the world a better place if only \nshe had been given the time.\n  I want my colleagues in the Senate to know Rachel. I want them to \nknow the life she lived. She grew up in the Detroit area, where she was \na smart, engaged young woman who was active in her community and always \nlooked for ways to make a difference. She was an exceptionally talented \nand bright young woman. She went to college at Swarthmore and then to \nColumbia for her MBA.\n  Two months ago, she became the CEO of ApprenNet, an online workforce \ntraining startup. She had a vision to use technology to help people get \nthe right skills to be successful in the fastest growing sectors of our \neconomy, such as health care.\n  She was also the cofounder and chair of Detroit Nation, which brought \ntogether native Detroiters around the country to stay engaged and \nconnected to their hometown in an effort to create jobs and economic \ngrowth.\n  Rachel did so much for others--something I know she learned from her \nparents, Gilda and John Jacobs. Gilda is a dear friend of mine and \nsomeone who has devoted her own life to public service. I cannot \nimagine the sadness of her family today. It is small comfort that \nRachel's dedication to her family and community is a testament to the \nwonderful person she was. She was an inspiration to so many and that \ninspiration will endure.\n  Rachel's life was not the only one lost on Tuesday night. A Navy \nmidshipman from New York, a college dean, an award-winning Associated \nPress technology staffer, and five other Americans with families and \nfriends and with so much going for them, and we are finding more who \nhave lost their lives--so many lives cut short in their prime, so many \npeople who were doing so much good in the world.\n  There are many questions as the investigation into this crash gets \nunderway. Federal authorities are doing their work right now, and the \nfamilies of those killed or injured deserve answers.\n  So I was truly stunned yesterday when the House of Representatives \nvoted in committee to slash funding for our infrastructure, including \nAmtrak. I could not believe that happened. There is something deeply \nwrong when an unthinkable tragedy such as this occurs--that should \nserve as a wakeup call to all of us to work together--and not even 24 \nhours later, Republican Members of Congress act as if nothing had \nhappened.\n  Our roads and bridges and railroads carry people. They carry young \nmothers such as Rachel who want to get home to hold their babies. They \ncarry young men such as Justin Zemser, the 20-year-old midshipman at \nthe Naval Academy--a patriot whose contributions to his country could \nhave been incredible. I know, from speaking to Senator Schumer who \nnominated him, he was an incredible young man.\n  We have a responsibility to the people of this country, to the people \nwho sent us here to represent them, to make sure our infrastructure is \nsecure. Yet we see on the horizon the very real possibility that our \nhighway trust fund will soon be empty. We see the events of yesterday, \nwith a vote in the House Appropriations Committee to slash funding for \ntrains and roads and bridges. It is personally very alarming to me.\n  As we engage in these discussions over the next few weeks about how \nto fund transportation in this country, I hope my colleagues will not \nforget the people who use our transportation system--people like Rachel \nJacobs.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             NIH-Supported Research and Alzheimer's Disease\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I wish to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues the idea that biomedical research must be a national \npriority.\n  The Presiding Officer and myself, as members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, are in the process of crafting our appropriations bills for \nfiscal year 2016, and we face a tremendous task in trying to balance \neffective, efficient government operations with the necessity of \nrighting our Nation's fiscal course during very difficult and \nchallenging times. Therefore, what I take from that--the circumstance \nwe are in--is it is extremely important that we prioritize initiatives \nthat are effective in their service to the American people and \ndemonstrate a significant and sufficient return on investment. Congress \nshould set spending priorities and focus our resources on initiatives \nwith proven outcomes. No initiative meets these criteria better than \nbiomedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health.\n  NIH-supported research has raised life expectancy, improved the \nquality of life, lowered overall health care costs, and is an economic \nengine that strengthens American global competitiveness.\n  The benefits of NIH are widely acknowledged on a bipartisan basis. \nDuring the recent negotiations on the fiscal year 2016 budget \nagreement, 34 of my Senate colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, \ncosponsored an amendment I offered affirming NIH biomedical research as \na national priority. I was pleased this amendment was included in the \nfinal budget agreement passed by Congress.\n  Furthermore, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, and the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, have recently agreed to form a \nSenate NIH--National Institutes of Health--Caucus. I am happy to be a \nfounding member of this caucus, which will offer an opportunity for \nSenators to visit about the importance of NIH and to seek bipartisan \nstrategies to provide steady, predictable growth for biomedical \nresearch.\n  If the United States is to continue its leadership in providing \nmedical breakthroughs to develop cures and treat diseases, we must be \ncommitted to supporting this research.\n  If researchers cannot rely on consistent support from Congress, we \nwill jeopardize our current programs, we will reduce our progress, \nstunt our Nation's competitiveness, and lose a generation of young \nresearchers to other careers or other countries.\n  New scientific findings help us confront the staggering challenges of \ndisease and illness. One such challenge I wish to focus on in my \nremarks is Alzheimer's. It is a devastating and irreversible brain \ndisease that slowly destroys an individual's cognitive functioning, \nincluding memory and thought. Today, more than 5.3 million\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nAmericans are living with this terrible disease. Every minute, someone \nin our country develops Alzheimer's. It is the sixth leading cause of \ndeath in the United States, and it is the only cause of death among the \ntop 10 in the United States that cannot be prevented, cured or even \nslowed.\n  Within these grim statistics are immeasurable suffering and stress \nthis disease places on individuals, on their families, on their \nfriends. This reality hits home in the stories I hear from Kansans.\n  The Alzheimer's Association's Heart of America Chapter in Prairie \nVillage, KS, tells me about Ricky from Topeka:\n  Ricky has early onset Alzheimer's disease. He is 60 years old. Due to \nAlzheimer's disease, Ricky had to retire from a good-paying job because \nhe no longer was able to do the work. He and his family expected him to \nwork at least another 5 years or more, and they had plans that were \ninterrupted that caused them to have to adjust from a two-income family \nto a single-income family.\n  Ricky is frustrated at times and tries to maintain a positive \nattitude with his family and his peers. He and all members of his early \nstage support group are very scared about their future and they are \ndesperate for a cure. They are worried about the burden they might \nplace upon their families.\n  Ricky and so many of his peers are continually looking for ways to \nslow down the progression of this disease. This includes testing \nhimself daily with the use of an iPad, trying new foods, and joining in \na research study at the University of Kansas Medical Center. \nFortunately, Ricky is still able to ride his Harley Davidson, but he \nknows the day is coming when the thing he enjoys so much will not be \nable to occur again.\n  I am also aware of Katrina from Shawnee, KS. She is an Alzheimer's \nAssociation ambassador and she shared her story:\n\n       As personal and health care advocates, my brother and I \n     used more than 7 weeks of personal vacation time--some \n     unpaid--during our mother's final year of care. During the \n     year, she was transitioned through 10 different care \n     facilities, we worked with more than two dozen health care \n     professionals at these locations and some were not [even] \n     notified of her basic needs such as her iodine allergy or \n     insurance--information she was unable to share during her \n     moves. This would be a significant life change for anyone--\n     but especially for our mother, a 67 year old, physically \n     strong woman but cognitively impaired due to early onset \n     dementia diagnosed at [age] 59.\n\n  Katrina said they reflect upon her passing, which is now 3 months \nago, and the emotional and financial toll of the last 27 months \ncouldn't be quantified--long-term savings and time off from work for \nvacations were limited, and the time spent at work was interrupted with \ncalls, doctors appointments, and meetings to communicate with care \nproviders ``regarding our mother's ongoing care needs, including \nbehavioral challenges.''\n\n       My brother and I are 40 and 37--we have children ages 4 to \n     15--we worked full time [during this period of time] while \n     doing everything we could to advocate for our mother's care. \n     We are fortunate to have devoted spouses, family, and friends \n     and understanding employers that worked through these \n     difficult times with us.\n\n  All of us in the Senate, every American knows someone who has been \naffected, someone whose family member has been affected by the terrible \ndisease Alzheimer's. It is a tremendous personal tragedy, this disease, \nbut it is also a very expensive disease, and we have a lot to gain both \nin the care for people and the quality of their lives that we want to \nmaintain.\n  We also have the opportunity to invest in Alzheimer's research that \nwill reduce the cost of Alzheimer's to us as taxpayers, to health care, \nto those of us who pay insurance premiums. This is a way we also can \nsave money because, on average, per-person Medicare spending for \nindividuals with Alzheimer's and other dementias is three times higher \nthan Medicare spending across the board for all other seniors. So for \nAlzheimer's patients, Medicare has per-person expenditures three times \nthe amount of other seniors on Medicare.\n  This year, the direct cost to America for caring for those with \nAlzheimer's is estimated at $226 billion--$226 billion. Half of these \nannual costs--more than $100 billion--will be borne by Medicare. These \nnumbers mean that nearly one in five Medicare dollars is spent on \nindividuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.\n  In 2050, which isn't that far away, this amount will be one in every \nthree Medicare dollars will be spent on Alzheimer's and dementia \ndiseases. Unless something is done, in 2050, Alzheimer's will cost our \ncountry over $1 trillion in 2015 dollars. Taking into account \ninflation, it will be $1 trillion, and costs to Medicare will increase \nmore than 400 percent to nearly $590 billion.\n  We must commit to a national strategy for speeding the development of \neffective interventions for Alzheimer's disease. As the baby boomer \ngeneration ages, Alzheimer's has unfortunately become a disease to \ndefine a generation, but it doesn't have to be an inevitable part of \nthe aging process. America can tackle Alzheimer's by prioritization of \nour biomedical research capabilities.\n  In a recent New York Times editorial, former Speaker Newt Gingrich \npraised the considerable benefits of NIH and specifically a research \nbreakthrough relating to Alzheimer's. He noted that a breakthrough that \ncould delay the onset of the disease by just 5 years, slow the onset by \n5 years, would reduce the number of Americans with Alzheimer's in 2050 \nby 42 percent and cut costs by a third.\n  These encouraging statistics--the idea that we can have hope and that \nthere is a better day--these encouraging statistics would also \nrepresent increased health and quality of life for both patients and \ntheir loved ones. Current research advances give us that reason for \nhope. Dr. Francis Collins, the Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth, recently stated, ``Alzheimer's research is entering a new era \nin which creative approaches for detecting, measuring and analyzing a \nwide range of biomedical data sets are leading to new insights about \nthe causes and course of the disease.''\n  Dr. Collins calls on our Nation's medical researchers to work \nsmarter, faster, and more collaboratively to determine the best path \nfor progress in Alzheimer's disease research. As an example, NIH is \nimplementing a new initiative called the Accelerating Medicines \nPartnership, working together with pharmaceutical companies to develop \nthe next generation of drug targets for Alzheimer's disease, as well as \nrheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and lupus.\n  NIH is also leading the Brain Research through Advancing Intuitive \nNeurotechnologies Initiative, or BRAIN Initiative, which is a \nmultiagency effort to revolutionize our understanding of the human \nbrain. The objective of the BRAIN Initiative is to enable the \ndevelopment and use of innovative technologies to produce a clear \nunderstanding of how individual cells and neurocircuits interact. By \nbetter understanding how the brain works, technologies developed under \nthis initiative could help reveal the underlying cause of a wide array \nof brain disorders. Understanding these causes will provide new avenues \nto treat, cure, and prevent neurological and psychiatric conditions \nsuch as Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, autism, \nschizophrenia, and epilepsy.\n  Groundbreaking research is taking place, and Congress must do its \npart to prioritize the important work supported by the NIH. As a member \nof the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that is responsible for the \nfunding of NIH, I am committed to working with my colleagues to see \nthat prioritization of NIH occurs and that within NIH there is strong \nsupport for Alzheimer's research.\n  In 2011, Congress passed the National Alzheimer's Plan that \nspecifically lays out a series of scientific milestones that \nresearchers think need to be met in order to make meaningful impact on \nthe trajectory of Alzheimer's by 2025--what is the plan to get us where \nwe need to be by that point in time?\n  Over the last two years, Congress has provided NIH with approximately \n$125 million in increased funding to support good science that \naddresses Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Additionally, we \nhave worked to include language in the fiscal year 2015 omnibus that \nrequires NIH to submit a yearly budget request for Alzheimer's research \nbased on what is required to fund the necessary science. This \nparticular effort is to make certain we have a specific, accountable \nresearch plan to ensure that our resources are effectively targeted to \nmeet these\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nmilestones the scientific community has established.\n  Alzheimer's disease is a defining challenge for our generation. The \nhealth and financial future of our Nation are at stake, and the United \nStates simply must not continue to ignore such a threat. This is a \nmoral and financial issue. It is one that should be easy for us to come \ntogether on. If you are the person or the Senator who cares the most \nabout people, who cares in compassionate ways, you should be for \nmedical research. If you are the Senator who cares about the fiscal \ncondition of our country and getting our financial house in order, you \nshould be for biomedical research.\n  This commitment by all of us will significantly lower costs and \nimprove health care outcomes for people living with the disease today \nand those who may encounter it in the future. Together, we can. This is \nwhat we are all here for. Together, we can make a difference, and we \ncan do that by making a sustained commitment to Alzheimer's research \nthat will benefit our Nation and bring hope and healing to Americans \ntoday and tomorrow.\n  The challenge is ours, and the moment to act on this disease is \ntoday. It is important for our moms, our dads, our grandparents, our \nfamily members, our friends. For the fiscal health of our Nation, the \ntime to act is now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Honoring Vietnam Veterans and North Dakota's Soldiers Who Lost Their \n                            Lives in Vietnam\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, I rise to continue an effort to honor \nthe 198 North Dakotans--soldiers, sailors, and airmen--who gave their \nlives while serving in Vietnam.\n  Together with the Bismarck High School history and English classes, \nwe are reaching out to families and friends of these fallen \nservicemembers and sharing a bit about each one on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Today, I begin by talking about a large family, the Gietzens, who \nlost one of their own in Vietnam but continue to serve our country and \nour State. Bill and Mary raised 15 children on a farm outside Glen \nUllin. It was on their farm that their children learned the importance \nof hard work, dedication, and bravery.\n  After serving in the Army in World War II, Bill married his \nsweetheart Mary, and they had 15 children.\n\n\n                              Gene Gietzen\n\n  Gene Gietzen served in Vietnam in the Marine Corps' Alpha Company, \nlst Battalion, 7th Marines. Gene was born March 19, 1950. On May 21, \n1969, he died as a result of wounds received on a company operation. He \nwas 19 years old.\n  Gene's twin brother Glenn and older brother, Russell, were also \nstationed in Vietnam for a time while Gene was there. Once, when \nRussell and Glenn's battalion passed through Gene's camp, they had an \nopportunity to spend a night together. That night, the young men \nlearned of the birth of their youngest brother Fred.\n  While the brothers said goodbye, Gene told them he would never get to \nsee baby Fred. Glenn and Russell told him they would see him soon and \nthat he needed to stop being so pessimistic. A few weeks later, they \nlearned of Gene's death. Glenn escorted his twin brother's body home.\n  Russell, the oldest child, served three tours of duty in Vietnam with \nthe Army as an interpreter and participated in several covert missions. \nRussell has two sons who served our State and country in the North \nDakota National Guard.\n  Glenn also served in the Army in Vietnam. Glenn started the Injured \nMilitary Wildlife Project of North Dakota, which gives wounded veterans \nnationwide opportunities to hunt and fish in North Dakota.\n  Mark, their other brother, joined the Marine Corps and served all \naround the world on embassy duty.\n  Greg served with U.S. Special Forces for 37 years. Jim joined the \nArmy and was stationed in Germany for 2 years.\n  Aaron served 22 years with Army Special Operations as a combat medic. \nHe now trains a new generation of Army medics at the U.S. Army Special \nOperations Command in Fort Bragg, NC.\n  The rest of the Gietzen children have served as nurses, missionaries \nor have kept up the tradition of family farming.\n  North Dakota is proud to be home to this inspiring family.\n  Now, I will talk about more North Dakotans who, like Gene Gietzen, \ngave the ultimate sacrifice while serving their country during Vietnam.\n\n\n                        Gerald ``Jerry'' Decker\n\n  Gerald ``Jerry'' Decker was from Sentinel Butte and was born June 17, \n1948. He served in the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Jerry died on \nApril 10, 1969. He was 20 years old.\n  Jerry was one of seven children and the youngest of three boys. Jerry \nand his brother, Ron, were both stationed overseas at the same time, \nRon running supplies from Thailand and Jerry as a cook in Vietnam.\n  Jerry chose to enlist so he could serve his country and return to the \nfamily farm and ranch as soon as possible. Jerry intended to eventually \ntake over the farm. His sister, Rose, recalls how much Jerry loved \nfarming, loved the animals, and loved training his dogs to hunt.\n  After his death, Jerry's brother, Ron, escorted his body home. The \nday after Jerry's funeral, their brother, Tom, had to appear before the \ndraft board, but he was excused from service.\n  Rose remembers Jerry as the kind of guy everyone loved, even though \nhe had a very dry sense of humor. She says that during Jerry's funeral, \ntheir church was overflowing with people mourning Jerry's death.\n\n\n                             Norman Emineth\n\n  Norman Emineth was from Baldwin and was born June 13, 1949. He served \nin the Army's 25th Infantry Division. Norman was 20 years old when he \ndied on May 22, 1970.\n  Norman and his four siblings grew up on a farm outside of Baldwin. He \nspent his childhood working on the farm, picking rock, and milking \ncows. In his free time, Norman enjoyed hunting, fishing, and spending \ntime with their neighbors.\n  In 1961, the singer Sue Thompson recorded a song called ``Norman.'' \nHis friends poked fun at Norman, but despite the teasing, Norman loved \nthe song. He bought the record and listened to the song over and over \nuntil he had memorized all of the lyrics. To this day, his sister, \nElaine, can still hear the song in her head.\n  Elaine cherishes the time she spent with Norman when he was home on \nleave from Vietnam. She said that during this time, she felt like the \nkids had finally become adult friends instead of bickering children. \nThe siblings all wished they could have spent time in their adult years \nwith their brother, Norman.\n\n\n                          Lawrence Esser, Jr.\n\n  Lawrence Esser, Jr., was from Minot. He was born February 21, 1948. \nHe served in the Army's Ninth Infantry Division. He was 21 years old \nwhen he died on March 12, 1969.\n  Lawrence was the fourth of eight children, and his family and friends \ncalled him Junior.\n  His sister, Darlene, has fond memories of playing together outside \nmaking mud pies. She says that from the time Lawrence was a child, he \nloved to build things and work with his hands. He attended a trade \nschool and worked for his brother-in-law in a construction firm.\n  Lawrence's family remembers him as a humble and quiet person. His \nmother, who died when she was 98 years old, still had a hard time \nspeaking about Lawrence until her own death.\n\n\n                         Joseph ``Joe'' Fischer\n\n  Joseph ``Joe'' Fischer was from Zeeland and was born September 11, \n1948. He served in the Army on the USS King as a boiler technician. Joe \ndied on May 23, 1969. He was 20 years old.\n  When Joe was very young, his mother passed away. During middle \nschool, he began living with Ben and Laura Jund of Zeeland. Joe and the \nJunds, his foster family, grew very close.\n  Joe's high school friend, Anne Welder, remembers that Joe was kind of \na class clown and participated in baseball, basketball, football, \ndrama, and\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\npep club. Anne and Joe's foster family believe that everyone who knew \nJoe loved being around him.\n  After his high school graduation, Joe enlisted in the Navy. He \nenjoyed his Navy service very much.\n  The day after Joe's foster family learned that Joe had died, they \nreceived a note in the mail sent to them, stating: ``I just thought I \nwould let you know that I am still alive.''\n\n\n                             Wendell Keller\n\n  Wendell Keller was from Fargo and was born May 19, 1934. He served in \nthe Air Force 433rd Tactical Fighter Squadron. Wendell was 34 years old \nwhen he went missing in action on March 1, 1969.\n  Wendell's parents were Raymond and Leona Keller, and his siblings are \nVirginia Post, Ray Keller, and David Keller. In addition to his \nsiblings, Wendell is survived by his wife Jacqueline, son Gregory and \nhis wife Patty, stepson Andy, and son Michael and his wife Janie and \ntheir daughter Lydia.\n  While at North Dakota State University, Wendell majored in electrical \nengineering and graduated with an Air Force ROTC commission.\n  Wendell was an accomplished pilot. In 1959, he was selected to fly \nover the first U.S. Air Force Academy graduation ceremony. In 1968, \nWendell volunteered for an assignment in Southeast Asia rather than \naccepting the recommendation to become a Thunderbird pilot.\n  On March 1, 1969, Wendell, an Air Force major at the time, was the \nflight commander of a night strike over Laos. It was his 80th mission, \nand he made multiple passes before his plane was struck by anti-\naircraft fire and crashed in the rugged terrain. Search-and-rescue \nefforts to locate him were unsuccessful. He was declared missing in \naction and was promoted to lieutenant colonel.\n  Fifteen years later, the crash site was discovered, and after several \nground searches and excavations, in 2012, his remains were identified \nand he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  The Air Force issued Lieutenant Colonel Keller medals to honor his \nextraordinary service, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, the \nAir Medal with Four Oak Leaf Clusters, and the Purple Heart.\n\n\n                             Stanley Ottmar\n\n  Stanley Ottmar was from Mott and was born October 26, 1949. He served \nin the Army's 1st Cavalry Division. Stan died April 10, 1969. He was 19 \nyears old.\n  His family called him Stan, and he was the third of seven children. \nHis sister, Mavis Jarnagin, or Mavis Ottmar, was my college roommate \nwhen we were at UND and remains a good friend of mine today.\n  Their father served in World War II in the Army. After high school \ngraduation, Stan followed in his father's footsteps and enlisted in the \nArmy, where he joined a parachute training program.\n  Stan was a friendly and social person who had a love and talent for \nmusic. His sister, Sharon, has fond memories of Stan at home standing \nin front of the mirror watching himself play guitar and sing. The \nfamily cherishes the recordings they have of him singing and playing \nthe guitar.\n  Stan died with just 2 weeks left in his tour, and he was already \nmaking plans at the time to buy a new car.\n\n\n                              John Renner\n\n  John Renner was from Mandan and he was born June 24, 1949. He served \nin the Marine Corps' Hotel Company, 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. He was \n20 years old when he died July 28, 1969.\n  John was one of three kids. His sister Mary lives in Mandan, and his \nbrother Tim lives in Arizona.\n  Mary remembers John as a happy, nice person who was always smiling. \nHe was never unkind to a soul.\n  John was killed just 2 months after beginning his tour of duty in \nVietnam.\n  After John died, his brother Tim joined the Marine Corps. Tim was not \nsent to Vietnam but felt he owed it to his brother to join the \nmilitary.\n  John's fellow soldiers remember him as a brave and good friend. He is \ndeeply missed by all who knew him.\n\n\n                             Virgil Greany\n\n  Virgil Greany was from Rugby and he was born November 26, 1930. He \nserved as a major in the Army. He was 33 years old when he died \nSeptember 25, 1964.\n  Virgil served our country for over 12 years prior to his death, \nincluding service in Korea and Ethiopia before he volunteered to go to \nVietnam as an adviser. Virgil had made the military a career, but he \nhad a passion for mathematics. Virgil's dream was to become a math \nteacher after he retired from the Army.\n  The day Virgil died, a Vietnamese soldier threw four grenades into \nhis vehicle. The third grenade exploded inside of the truck, killing \nVirgil.\n  Virgil left behind his young wife, stepchildren, and a daughter.\n\n\n                          Robert ``Bob'' Sime\n\n  Robert ``Bob'' Sime grew up in Velva and Tolna and was born on \nDecember 10, 1939. He served in the Army's 1st Cavalry Division, in \nwhat was called the ``Garry Owen'' regiment. Bob was 27 years old when \nhe died on October 23, 1967.\n  His siblings are John, Richard, and Marilyn. His parents both worked \nin education.\n  Bob grew up in Velva. His senior year of high school the Sime family \nmoved from Velva to Tolna, where his father became the superintendent \nof schools. Bob was tall and was talked into joining the basketball \nteam at Tolna, where he played just for the fun of it.\n  Bob's cousin, Jean, remembers that Bob liked 1950s rock-and-roll \nmusic and that he always combed his hair like Elvis Presley. After \ngraduating from Tolna High School, Bob enlisted in the Army.\n  In the Army, Bob met Lieutenant Bob Trimble, who became his company's \nexecutive officer. The two men had confidence in each other on missions \nand also enjoyed spending their free time together. Lieutenant Trimble \nremembers Bob's great sense of humor, even when times were tough. He \nwas with Bob when Bob was killed and says that day will always haunt \nhim.\n\n\n                         Thomas ``Tom'' Spitzer\n\n  Thomas ``Tom'' Spitzer grew up on a farm south of Wilton and was born \nJune 17, 1941. He served as a Navy pilot on the USS Oriskany. Tom was \n25 years old when he died on October 26, 1966.\n  Tom is survived by his siblings, wife, and his son Tom, who was born \nthe month after his father was killed.\n  In high school, Tom and a friend began flying. He then attended North \nDakota State University, where he participated in ROTC and received a \ndegree in business administration.\n  During his Navy training, Tom was designated a Top Gun graduate. His \nbrother Jeff says it was the proudest moment of Tom's life.\n  The Navy intended for Tom to stay in the United States to train other \npilots, but Tom volunteered to go to Vietnam to serve his country. As a \nNavy pilot in Vietnam, Tom flew over 100 missions. One of those \nmissions involved him flying over his wing commander, who had been shot \ndown, to draw fire away while they waited for help to arrive. The Navy \nawarded Tom with distinguished medals in recognition of his heroism.\n\n\n                        Donald ``Donny'' Vollmer\n\n  Donald ``Donny'' Vollmer was from Bismark. He was born August 2, \n1950. He served in the Army's 1st Aviation Brigade. Donny died on \nNovember 2, 1969. He was 19 years old.\n  Donny had three brothers and one sister. He enjoyed hunting and \nfishing in his free time. Donny decided to join the Army because his \nolder brother Jim was enlisting and he wanted to go too. At the time, \nDonny was 17 years old, so his parents had to give permission, and \nDonny had to finish his GED while at basic training.\n  Donny and Jim served in the same unit, and Donny was a helicopter \ncrew chief. A few weeks before Donny was killed, he and Jim came home \non emergency leave because their mother had a heart attack. Donny spent \nhis time at home telling his friends how much he loved serving his \ncountry. Jim's tour was almost over, so he was allowed to stay home, \nbut Donny returned to Vietnam alone.\n  Jim believes that if Donny had not been killed in the war, he would \nhave made the Army his career.\n\n\n                             Robert Brothen\n\n  Robert Brothen was from Mohall and was born February 14, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 1st Infantry Division. Robert died on February 27, \n1969. He had just turned 22 years old.\n  His two sisters were Beverly and Audrey, and his brother's name was \nBernard. Even though he was Robert's\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\nyounger brother, Bernard joined the Army during the war just to help \nprotect Robert.\n  At one point during their service, Robert and Bernard were both \nhospitalized in Washington State, being treated for foot rot, but \ndidn't learn they were in the same place until the day after they left.\n  Robert's father Alvin died of cancer the same year Robert died. Their \nsister Beverly is the last living member of the family. Their mother \nPearl passed away in 2004 but witnessed the deaths of three of her \nchildren and two husbands during her lifetime.\n  These are the stories of just a few North Dakotans and actually just \na few of those brave soldiers killed in action in Vietnam. As we \ncontinue to participate in the commemoration of the Vietnam war, I \nbelieve it is critically important that we continue to honor and \nappreciate their sacrifice and to help educate the younger generation, \nlike the Bismark High School students who are helping me with this \nproject, on the importance of sacrifice and commitment to our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, if the chairman of the Committee on \nFinance and Senator Wyden will indulge me, I would like 2 or 3 minutes \nto explain the amendment and the importance of it.\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\n  One of the most important reasons for the vote on Tuesday, I believe, \nis that a significant number of Members of this body and I think the \npublic--those who support fast-track and those who oppose it--all \nbelieve that enforcement is important and assisting workers is \nimportant. So it would be a tragedy to send TPA to the desk of the \nPresident for him to sign, leading the way to at least two other trade \nagreements--the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the United States-\nEuropean Union agreement, the so-called TTIP trade agreement--without \nenforcement and without assistance for workers.\n  We make decisions in this body, those who support this fast-track and \nthe trade agreements, and we know--even the most enthusiastic \nsupporters and cheerleaders for free trade acknowledge there are \nwinners and losers when it comes to trade agreements. Some people, \nbecause of dislocation due to these trade agreements, dislocation in \nthe economy, lose their jobs in places such as Wheeling, WV, and \nBellaire, OH, right across the Ohio River. So it is important that we \ntake care of those workers who lose their jobs because of our actions. \nThat is why the TAA--trade adjustment assistance--provides help for \nworkers to get new training and find new jobs when they are laid off \nfrom the chemical or steel industry along the Ohio River or elsewhere. \nThe opportunity to be retrained is so important.\n  I meet people frequently who were laid off because of NAFTA or \nbecause of CAFTA and now they are back in school. A man the other day I \nmet is becoming a nurse, a woman might become a physical therapist, a \nman might be trained in information technology or some other kind of \nwork after they have lost their job. So that is the importance of trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  The President's budget called for a significantly higher number of \ndollars for trade adjustment assistance than the bill coming out of the \nFinance Committee. That is why I am offering my amendment, to get those \ndollars commensurate with the need, because every President in both \nparties--President Bush I on NAFTA, President Clinton on NAFTA and \nPNTR, President Bush on fast-track and CAFTA, President Obama on South \nKorea Free Trade Agreement and now on TPP--make big promises about \ntrade numbers and increased jobs, big promises about higher wages. \nUnfortunately, those big promises end up with bad results.\n  We know it from South Korea most recently; we have seen it throughout \nthe last 20 years of trade. That is why the number of dollars \nauthorized and appropriated for the trade adjustment assistance needs \nto be increased, so it will take care of those people who lose their \njobs because of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and because of TTIP, \nwhich this Congress could very well agree to in the next year or so.\n  So I ask for support of Brown amendment No. 1242. My understanding is \nthat vote will come on Monday night. I appreciate the support of all \nthe Members of this body.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Madam President, this week we welcome thousands of law \nenforcement officers for National Police Week 2015. It is a time to pay \ntribute to all the men and women who serve in Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement all across America. It is a good time for those of us \nwho benefit from the shield of protection they provide--and actually, \nthat is all of us--to express our gratitude.\n  Police officers are here to rededicate themselves to the pursuit of \njustice and to honor fallen officers. We are proud to have them all \nhere in Washington.\n  I want to recognize especially the many men and women who protect and \nserve as peace officers in Kentucky. Today, I had the pleasure of \nmeeting with some of Kentucky's finest. I want to thank them personally \nfor courageously risking their lives in the service of people across \nthe Commonwealth.\n\n\n               honoring deputy sheriff ernest t. franklin\n\n  Sadly, the occasion of National Police Week is also the time when we \npay tribute to the brave and honorable peace officers who have fallen \nin the line of duty over the last year. So I want to remember and say a \nfew words about Kentucky's own Deputy Sheriff Ernest T. Franklin, of \nthe Barren County Sheriff's Office, who died on April 2, 2014.\n  Deputy Sheriff Franklin was killed in an automobile crash on Kentucky \nRoute 90, just west of Glasgow. He was 58 years old and had served with \nthe sheriff's office for 7 years.\n  Friends and coworkers recall him as a friendly man who always had a \nkind word for everyone. He worshipped at Hopewell Baptist Church, \nvolunteered at the local community center and soup kitchen, and was, by \nall accounts, an excellent chef.\n  Deputy Sheriff Franklin put his life on the line every day to protect \nhis fellow Kentuckians. I want to extend my deepest condolences to his \nfamily and to all of those who knew and loved him.\n  As Deputy Sheriff Ernest T. Franklin is mourned in Barren County, in \nFrankfort, the Kentucky State Police have created their own unique way \nto memorialize their fallen fellow officers. This week they unveiled a \nnew statue called The Trooper, a figure of a Kentucky State Trooper \ncast in bronze and 10 feet tall, at the Kentucky State Police Academy.\n  The statue is a tribute to members of the Kentucky State Police who \nhave given their lives in the line of duty. That is 27 troopers and \nofficers. It is quite an inspirational sight--a lone figure in uniform \nstriding forward, ready to defend the property, dignity, and lives of \nhis fellow Kentuckians.\n  I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in holding the deepest \nadmiration and respect for the many brave law enforcement officers \nacross Kentucky and across the Nation. Theirs is both an honorable \nprofession and a dangerous one. It is also a necessary one because the \npeace and order of a civil society that we all take for granted would \nnot exist without them. Kentucky is grateful for our law enforcement \nofficers' service, and we are grateful for the service of Deputy \nSheriff Ernest T. Franklin.\n\n\n                        National Blue Alert Act\n\n  On a related note, I was proud to cosponsor and see to Senate passage \nthis year of the National Blue Alert Act. The bill will establish a \nnational Blue Alert system within the U.S. Department of Justice to \nhelp catch those criminals who kill, harm, or threaten law enforcement \nofficers. The Blue Alert system will be similar to what the AMBER Alert \nsystem does for abducted children.\n  Should law enforcement officers be killed, seriously injured, \nthreatened or go missing while in the line of duty, this system would \nbe utilized to widely disseminate information to help identify and \napprehend potential suspects.\n  Blue Alert will help bring to justice those who harm our police \nofficers and hopefully help deter future violence. I was pleased to see \nthat the House passed the bill earlier this week. With this bill, we \nwill help protect those who put their lives on the line to protect us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2927-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2927-S2928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAIR AND EQUAL WAGES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last Sunday, I joined millions of people\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\nacross the country to celebrate the mothers in our lives--in mine, my \nwife Marcelle, my daughter, friends, and other family members. Mother's \nDay is an important reminder of just how essential these inspirational \nwomen are to their families, their friends, and their communities.\n  Mothers--and all women--are also essential to the fabric of our \neconomy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, just four decades \nago, fewer than half of mothers were in the American work force. Today, \n70 percent of mothers are working outside the home, and one-third of \nworking mothers are the sole wage earners in their households. More \nthan 30 percent of Vermont families rely on working moms as the \nexclusive wage earners in their homes.\n  The numbers are staggering. Yet working moms still fall behind in \nequal and fair pay. The Joint Economic Committee of Congress recently \nreleased a report showing that working mothers earn 3 percent less than \nwomen without children, while fathers earn 15 percent more than men \nwithout children. Working moms also face the potential of missing \nscheduled wage increases or bonuses, if they take time away from the \nworkforce to care for a child.\n  Vermont has been a national leader in leveling the playing field for \nworking moms. In 2002 the Green Mountain State enacted its own Equal \nPay Act, making it illegal for employers to offer anything less than \nequal pay for equal work. The Federal Government has fallen behind, and \nit is far past time for Congress to approve the Paycheck Fairness Act. \nThis legislation, authored by one of the trailblazers in the Senate, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), builds on efforts that date back more \nthan 50 years to ensure a balanced and equal playing field in the \nworkplace for women.\n  Of course, equal wages are not fair wages if they are not livable \nwages. According to the Joint Economic Committee, working mothers in \nfamilies in the bottom 20 percent of households contribute an \nastounding 86 percent to their families' income. In an overwhelming \nmajority of cases, these families are supported solely by a mother. \nThat is just one of the many reasons we need to ensure that wages are \nnot just equal and fair, but also livable. Two weeks ago I joined with \nSenator Patty Murray (D-WA) and 31 other Democratic Senators to propose \nlegislation to raise the minimum wage. The Raise the Wage Act will \nprovide a staggered increase in the Federal minimum wage, from $7.25 to \n$12.00 by the year 2020. It is the right thing to do, and it is the \nfair thing to do, for working mothers, for our families, and for our \nNation's economy as a whole.\n  Mother's Day is always an opportunity to show the moms in our lives \njust how valued they are. It is past time for Congress to do the same, \nand to act on commonsense bills like the Paycheck Fairness Act and the \nRaise the Wage Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2928-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DONALD A. RITCHIE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this week, the Senate will say goodbye to \nthe Chamber's current Historian, and welcome him to the ranks of \nHistorian Emeritus. Donald Ritchie has observed, studied, and \ndocumented the workings of the U.S. Senate for almost four decades. \nOnly the second person to serve as the Historian of the Senate, Don has \nbeen with the Senate Historical Office since shortly after its \ncreation.\n  Beginning in 1976, Don spearheaded the Senate Oral History Program, \nfor which he interviewed dozens of former senators and their staff. He \ndocumented firsthand recollections of those individuals' time with the \nSenate, major events and debates, and how the institution evolved \nduring their tenure. In the 1990s, the Senate Historical Office began \nmaking transcripts of the interviews available at various libraries and \narchives, including the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress \nand the Senate Library. These accounts are fascinating, and remind us \nof the intricacies--both in public and behind the scenes--of \nlegislating in the U.S. Senate. The Oral History Program was a colossal \nundertaking, and one congressional scholars will study for many years \nto come. Don's work on this program was exceptional.\n  In addition the Senate Oral History Program, Don and the Senate \nHistorical Office maintain and make available historical documents, \nstatistics, and provide historical background and how it may pertain to \ncurrent events. In addition to his enormous undertaking, for years, Don \nhas provided enlightening--sometimes humorous, always informative--\nvignettes to Members and staffers of moments in history, from now \nfamous--or infamous--committee proceedings, to turning points in \nhistorical Senate debates, to the personal interactions and \nrelationships among Senators that often don't make the history books.\n  My wife Marcelle tells me that Don is always welcomed at the Senate \nspouses' luncheon because of his valuable insights.\n  Don often reminds us of our roots--how our many traditions began--and \nhow the Senate, as a continuing body, has evolved, decade to decade, \ngeneration to generation. He reminds us that for all our political \ndisagreements, progress in the Senate requires some measure of consent. \nThe history of the Senate is clearer because of the talents of Don \nRitchie. The time has come to thank him for his decades of service and \nto wish him well as he assumes a new title of Historian Emeritus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2928-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DONALD FRANCIS ``PAT'' PATIERNO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to one of the \nfoundational figures of the U.S. global demining effort, Mr. Donald \nFrancis ``Pat'' Patierno.\n  Pat is retiring after more than 20 years of global demining \nleadership both at the State Department's Office of Humanitarian \nDemining and subsequently as a member of the board of directors and \nfour-term president of the 501(c)3 Mine Advisory Group, MAG, America.\n  Pat was the first Director of the Office of Humanitarian Demining \nwhere he organized and led the U.S. Government worldwide demining \nprogram for nearly 10 years. Under his determined and capable \nleadership in those formative years, U.S. participation expanded its \nefforts to remove the scourge of landmines, unexploded bombs and shells \nleft behind in former areas of conflict. From its modest beginnings \nthat program today is working around the world to save civilians from \nbecoming limbless victims of past wars.\n  Before his retirement from the State Department in 2006, Mr. Patierno \noversaw a $60 million program that supported humanitarian mine action \nassistance to over 40 countries. Subsequent to his retirement, he \njoined the board of directors of MAG America to carry on his \nhumanitarian work in the area of demining and unexploded ordnance. At \nthe same time Mr. Patierno served as the U.S. advocate for the \nSlovenian-based International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims \nAssistance. Mr. Patierno became president of the MAG America board in \nJanuary 2011. So strong and dedicated was his leadership that at the \nrequest of the board, he served four 1-year terms as president.\n  Many Senators know of my long interest in stopping the death and \nmaiming of civilians from landmines and other unexploded ordnance left \nbehind when conflicts end. The carnage does not stop when the soldiers \ncease combat: civilians continue dying and suffering long after the \nfighting stops, and they continue to do so today. That is why I, as \nformer chairman and now ranking member of the Department of State and \nForeign Operations subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee have so \nstrongly supported the dedicated work of Pat Patierno and his \ncolleagues.\n  I close by expressing my admiration of and appreciation for Pat \nPatierno's selfless service, outstanding leadership, commitment, \ndetermination, and tenacity in this most noble and worthy cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2928-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2928-S2929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               JOINT COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS ON THE LIBRARY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

Madam President, today I wish to congratulate Lt. Gen. \nCharles ``Chick'' Cleveland of Montgomery, AL, for receiving the \nCongressional Gold Medal as one of the American Fighter Aces.\n  Lt. Gen. ``Chick'' Cleveland's distinguished Air Force career spanned \nnearly four decades, and more than 4,300 flight hours. His military \ndecorations and awards include the Distinguished Service Medal (Air \nForce), Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf \ncluster, Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, Air Medal \nwith three oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal, Army \nCommendation Medal and Republic of Korea Order of Military Merit, Chung \nMu.\n  Less than 3 years after graduating from the U.S. Military Academy at \nWest Point, and within months of joining the 334th Fighter-Interceptor \nSquadron at Kimpo Air Base, South Korea, he scored four confirmed MiG-\n15 kills. On September 21, 1952, Lieutenant Cleveland's squadron fought \nanother flight of MiGs. Cleveland engaged one of the enemy aircraft and \nfired, scoring hits in the tail pipe, engine, and right wing. Within \nseconds, there was an explosion, and the MiG fell out of the sky. \nHowever, instead of watching the MiG to claim credit for the kill, \nLieutenant Cleveland broke off the engagement to assist his squadron. \nHe left Korea with those four confirmed kills--one confirmed victory \nshort of becoming an ace.\n  After the war, he was stationed with the 27th Fighter-Bomber Wing at \nBergstrom Air Force Base in Texas, where he led the transition team to \nthe Air Force's new aircraft, the F-101 Voodoo. On August 10, 1962, \nCleveland became the first pilot to achieve the 1000-flighthour mark in \nthe Voodoo.\n  Lieutenant General Cleveland also served with distinction in Vietnam \nas the executive assistant to Gen. William Westmoreland, commander, \nMilitary Assistance Command, Vietnam.\n  In 2008, 55 years after his aerial victories in Korea, he finally \ngained official recognition by the U.S. Air Force\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\nas a fighter ace. With the de-classification of Soviet records in 2003, \nhis friend and fellow Korean war ace, Dolph Overton discovered the \nSoviets' account of the events on September 21, 1952. With those \nrecords, as well as the testimonies of Cleveland's wingman that day, \nDon Pascoe, and his former operations officer, Frederick ``Boots'' \nBlesse, the Air Force awarded Lieutenant General Cleveland credit for \none of his two probable victories in Korea and officially recognized \nhim as an Air Force Ace.\n  Lieutenant General Cleveland retired from the Air Force in 1984 and \nsettled in Montgomery, AL, close to where he once had command of the \nAir University at Maxwell Air Force Base. He continues to involve \nhimself in his community. I am proud to call Lieutenant General Charles \n``Chick'' Cleveland a fellow Alabamian and to acknowledge and celebrate \nhis receipt of the Congressional Gold Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2931-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 RECOGNIZING SUN RIVER WATERSHED GROUP\n\n Mr. DAINES.

The award is meant \nto honor projects that have demonstrated excellence and diversity in \nriver restoration.\n  The Sun River Watershed Group was formed in 1994 and has since \nprioritized the management and restoration of the river. Nineteen years \nlater, the project is still succeeding. The group has formed a \ncollaborative effort to discuss and solve natural resource issues and \nhas acted as a seamless liaison between management agencies and the \npublic.\n  Although the Sun River Watershed Group was not awarded the top prize, \ntheir tireless work makes all of Montana exceedingly proud. They should \nbe commended for their dedication to restoring river flows to the Sun \nRiver as well as improving efficiency of water allocation for \nirrigation. To Montana, you are our winner for making our State a \nbetter place to live, work, and enjoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2931-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CELEBRATING SIDNEY HUNTINGTON AND REMEMBERING DAN CUDDY\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, this is a bittersweet week in \nmy home State of Alaska. On Saturday, the celebrated Athabascan Elder, \nSidney Huntington, turned 100. That is indeed a cause for celebration. \nSidney Huntington's life is the stuff of which legends are made. His \nbook, ``Shadows on the Koyukuk'' published in 1993, details his \nremarkable life. Sidney's inspiring ways are the subject of a stage \nplay, ``The Winter Bear.'' The Winter Bear is a play that tells the \nstory of an abused, neglected Alaska Native teenager. He decides \nsuicide is his best option until Athabascan elder Sidney Huntington \nshows him how to use traditional culture to work through his despair \nand find his true voice\n  Last evening as I approached the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial to honor the memories of Alaska State Troopers Patrick Scott \nJohnson and Gabriel Lenox Rich, I learned of the death of Dan Cuddy of \nAnchorage. Dan was president of First National Bank Alaska for some six \ndecades. Dan was age 94. He leaves a remarkable legacy which is carried \non today by his daughter Betsy Lawer and a large family of achievers. I \nwill have more to say about the exemplary life of Dan Cuddy next week.\n  Dennis McMillan, the recently retired CEO of the Foraker Group spoke \nto KTVA last evening about Dan's passing. Dennis said, ``We're losing \nhistory, especially as we are losing these 90 plus citizens, but such a \ngreat legacy because they were still engaged with the community and \ntotally involved in all sorts of things, and great role models.''\n  Dennis's words seem especially appropriate this week as we celebrate \nDan's legacy while at the same time wishing Sidney another 100 years of \ninspiration to our Alaska community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2931-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JON GEDNALSKE\n\n Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, small businesses have the unique \nopportunity to train skilled workers and create\n\n[[Page S2932]]\n\nwell-paying jobs for members of their communities, while also providing \nnecessary services with quality customer service. These apprenticeship \nprograms are becoming increasingly useful to add highly-skilled workers \nto the general workforce. In recognition of their contribution, this \nweek's Small Business of the Week is Central Plumbing Co. of Baton \nRouge, La.\n  Founded in 1974 by the Payne family, Central Plumbing began serving \nthe Baton Rouge area with one truck and a commitment to quality \nplumbing service. In the more than 40 years since, the Payne family has \ngrown their business into a 40-employee operation, operating 20 trucks \nacross the Southern Louisiana region. Today, fourth generation Master \nPlumber Jay Payne oversees operations of the business, continuing their \ncommitment to providing the highest level service in residential and \ncommercial plumbing.\n  Central Plumbing's commitment to service does not stop with their \ncustomers. With generations of Paynes joining the family business, the \ncompany realized the need for an organized program to train the next \ngeneration of Master Plumbers. Central Plumbing apprenticeship program \noffers the opportunity to learn the trade through paid, hands-on \ntraining and support. Programs like this can often serve as an \nalternative for individuals who do not pursue higher education. \nApprenticeship programs are beneficial opportunities to pave the way \nfor folks to become experts in a highly specialized field and get paid \naccordingly, and also provide a certain amount of security for \nsustained future of the industry and the small businesses who \nadminister them.\n  Congratulations again to Small Business of the Week--Central Plumbing \nCo. Thank you for your decades of service and ongoing commitment to \ncreate good quality, high-paying jobs and to train the next generation \nof Louisianians to be Master Plumbers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2932-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2932-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/14/senate-section/article/S2932-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Hatch) reported that he had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills, which were previously signed by the Speaker \nof the House:\n\n       H.R. 651.

A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 with respect to high priority corridors on the \nNational Highway System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am introducing the Route to Opportunity \nand Development Act of 2015, which would amend the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, of 1991 to begin the process \ntoward eventually making the Raleigh to Norfolk Corridor in North \nCarolina and Virginia part of the Interstate system, and to help fully \nupgrade the corridor to interstate standards. My colleagues, Senator \nRichard Burr, Senator Tim Kaine, and Senator Mark Warner have agreed to \ncosponsor the bill. In addition, Congressman G.K. Butterfield has \nintroduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives.\n  The Route to Opportunity and Development Act of 2015 would designate \nthe following as high priority: the Raleigh-Norfolk Corridor from \nRaleigh, NC, through Rocky Mount, Williamston, and Elizabeth City, NC, \nto Norfolk, VA.\n  If the Raleigh-Norfolk corridor becomes part of the Interstate \nsystem, it would connect vital centers of commerce in the Raleigh and \nNorfolk/Hampton Roads region. Raleigh and Hampton Roads are two of the \nlargest east coast metropolitan regions served by a single primary \ninterstate route and this act proposes a second primary interstate \nroute for the two areas.\n  This act helps advance the North Carolina Department of \nTransportation's Strategic Transportation Corridors Vision, which aims \nto provide North Carolina with a network of high priority corridors to \npromote economic development and enhance interstate commerce. It is \nalso an important part of the future vision for transportation in the \nCommonwealth of Virginia. Federal High Priority Corridors are eligible \nfor Federal funds to assist states in the coordination, planning, \ndesign and construction of nationally significant transportation \ncorridors for the purposes of economic growth and international and \ninterregional growth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1357.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to inter in national cemeteries \nindividuals who supported the United States in Laos during the Vietnam \nWar era; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing a piece of \nlegislation which I strongly believe in and know that it is long \noverdue. The Hmong Veterans' Service Recognition Act is a bill to \nauthorize the interment in national cemeteries of Hmong veterans who \nserved in support of U.S. forces during the Vietnam War. I, along with \na bipartisan group of colleagues, Senators Klobuchar, Sullivan, \nFranken, and Whitehouse believe this is an appropriate honor.\n  Public Law 106-207, The Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act of 2000 \nalready acknowledges Hmong Special Guerilla Unit's contributions during \nVietnam and recognizes the service of Hmong Special Guerilla Unit \nveterans for the purpose of naturalization. Today we try to write the \nnext chapter for these brave veterans and grant them the one right they \nare requesting, to be buried in our U.S. national cemeteries.\n  The Hmong were ideal candidates for America's secret war--they were \nfighters known for their bravery and warrior traditions who knew the \nrocky mountain terrain of Northern Laos very well. The U.S. Central \nIntelligence Agency conducted covert operations in Laos which employed \nsome 60,000 Hmong volunteers in Special Guerilla Units. The Hmong \nFighters interrupted operations on the Ho Chi Minh trail and assisted \nin downed aircraft recovery operations of American Airmen. In Laos, \nthey valiantly fought the Vietnamese and Laotian Communists for over a \ndecade and were critical to America's war efforts in Vietnam.\n  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. \nMore than 35,000 Hmong lost their lives and many more were injured and \ndisabled. I would like to recognize several Hmong Combat Veterans who \nlive in Alaska. Lieutenant Pasert Lee from Mountain View in Achorage, \nAK, was injured in 1972 when his bunker was bombed while providing \nradio support for American jets in Laos. He recovered after several \ndays, made his way to a refugee camp and many years later he was able \nto come to America. Lieutenant Wilson Chong Neng Vang, Sergeant Tong \nPao Less and Sergeant Xia Ger Vang reside in Anchorage, AK, and are \nrecognized for their selfless service in the U.S. Secret Army, Kingdom \nof Laos.\n  There are currently over 260,000 Hmong people in America and \naccording to the 2010 Census, the heaviest concentrations are in \nCalifornia, Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Michigan, Colorado, \nGeorgia, Oklahoma, Oregon, and my home state of Alaska. Of the Hmong \nwho became U.S. citizens, approximately 6,000 veterans are still with \nus today, and they deserve the choice to be buried in national \ncemeteries.\n  This concept is not without precedent. Currently, burial benefits are \navailable for Philippine Armed Forces veterans who answered the call to \nserve during World War II, just like the Hmong. This legislation would \nnot grant the small group of Hmong veterans full veteran benefits, but \nwould simply authorize their interment in national cemeteries across \nthe Nation. A small, but deserved token of appreciation and an \nappropriate honor for their sacrifices towards a common goal of \ndemocracy and freedom in the world.\n  I believe it is time to recognize the Hmong-American's bravery, \nsacrifice and loyalty to the United States. We would like to honor the \nHmong Special Guerilla Unit Veterans' service and sacrifices by \nallowing them to be buried alongside their brothers in arms in our \nnational cemeteries. Again, I appreciate the support of my colleagues \nwho have joined me to introduce this legislation and look forward to \nworking with them and others in the Senate to finally getting this \napproved into law.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today marks the 40th anniversary of the \nbeginning of the forced exit of many members of the Hmong community \nfrom Laos following the U.S. withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. Tens of \nthousands of the Hmong came to my State of Minnesota, and today in \nMinnesota, we are honoring this anniversary with Hmong American Day. I \nam proud to join my State in recognizing the remarkable service of \nthose who fought on our behalf, and in celebrating the contributions of \nHmong Americans to our shared community over the last 40 years.\n  The way I like to explain to people why there are so many Hmong \nAmericans in Minnesota is by telling them that there are many fewer \nAmerican names on the Vietnam War Memorial because of what the Hmong \ndid for us during the ``secret war.'' Many people in America still do \nnot realize that. But as the permanent memorial at Arlington says about \nthe Hmong fighters and their American advisors: ``Their patriotic valor \nand loyalty in the defense of liberty and democracy will never be \nforgotten.'' In Minnesota, we recognize the remarkable service the \nHmong fighters performed for our country, and we will never forget.\n  The Senate resolution I am proud to join Senator Hirono and many of \nour colleagues in introducing in recognition of May as Asian/Pacific \nAmerican Heritage Month states, ``the actions of the Hmong in Laos in \nsupport of the United States during the Vietnam War saves the lives of \ncountless people of the United States.'' The Hmong fought on our behalf \nand saved American lives. But as the new communist regime took control \nin Laos, the Hmong were forced to begin their journey as refugees. For \nmany, this journey would eventually end in Minnesota. Today, the \nvibrant Hmong American community in the Twin Cities--the largest urban \nHmong community in the country--and throughout Minnesota is tens of \nthousands strong and is woven into the fabric of our society.\n  You can see their tremendous contribution to American life every day \nin the many small businesses started by Hmong Americans on University \nAvenue, or at Hmong Village. You can see it in all the ways that Hmong \nAmericans have brought their culture to the United States and helped to \nshape the culture of today's Minnesota. I also remain incredibly proud \nthat Minnesota can boast that we had the Nation's very first Hmong \nAmerican State legislator with my good friend Mee Moua, who has become \na national leader on Asian American issues. I am glad others have \nfollowed in her wake.\n  Representing the Hmong American community in the Senate is an \nimportant part of my job. That is why I am a cosponsor of a bill being \nreintroduced by Senator Murkowski of Alaska along with my fellow \nMinnesota Senator, Senator Klobuchar, to make sure that Hmong fighters \nin the ``secret war'' can be honored with burial in our national \ncemeteries. The Hmong Americans who fought for us deserve nothing less. \nIt is also why I traveled to Laos several years ago to engage the Lao \nGovernment directly on protecting the Hmong people, including refugees \nwho had been forcibly repatriated to Laos from Thailand.\n  And it is why I fight for the Hmong Americans of Minnesota every day \nin the Senate. Hmong Americans want the same things that all Americans \nwant--good-paying jobs, a bright future for their children, excellent \nhealth care. It is my job to help make sure those things are within \neveryone's reach.\n  The Hmong American community has come through so much adversity as \nthey left Laos and as they resettled in America, and they faced that \nadversity with resilience and courage. They serve as an inspiration to \nus all.\n  We are so proud that the Hmong American community is part of the \nMinnesota--and the American--community. I am very pleased to join \nMinnesota in celebrating Hmong American\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\nDay--to celebrate the community's achievements and to commemorate the \nsacrifices of their loved ones in support of American troops so many \nyears ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1358\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
