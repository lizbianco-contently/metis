Mr. President, the American people have two principal \nconcerns: our Nation's security and the economy. The legislation we \nwill soon consider will help address both. It would enact permanent tax \nrelief for American families and small businesses. That will lead to \nmore jobs, more opportunity, and more economic growth here in \nAmerica.NOTICE\n\nIf the 114th Congress, 1st Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nDecember 24, 2015, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 114th Congress, 1st Session, will be published on Thursday, \nDecember 31, 2015, to permit Members to insert statements.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-59 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nWednesday, December 30. The final issue will be dated Thursday, \nDecember 31, 2015, and will be delivered on Monday, January 4, \n2016.\nNone of the material printed in the final issue of the \nCongressional Record may contain subject matter, or relate to any \nevent, that occurred after the sine die date.\nSenators' statements should also be formatted according to the \ninstructions at http://webster.senate.gov/secretary/Departments/\nReporters_Debates/resources/cong_record.pdf, and submitted \nelectronically, either on a disk to accompany the signed statement, \nor by e-mail to the Official Reporters of Debates at \n``Record@Sec.Senate.gov''.\nMembers of the House of Representatives' statements may also be \nsubmitted electronically by e-mail, to accompany the signed \nstatement, and formatted according to the instructions for the \nExtensions of Remarks template at\nhttps://housenet.house.gov/legislative/research-and-reference/\ntranscripts-and-records/electronic-congressional-record-inserts. \nThe Official Reporters will transmit to GPO the template formatted \nelectronic file only after receipt of, and authentication with, the \nhard copy, and signed manuscript. Deliver statements to the \nOfficial Reporters in Room HT-59.\nMembers of Congress desiring to purchase reprints of material \nsubmitted for inclusion in the Congressional Record may do so by \ncontacting the Office of Congressional Publishing Services, at the \nGovernment Publishing Office, on 512-0224, between the hours of \n8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. daily.\nBy order of the Joint Committee on Printing.\n                                                                \nGREGG HARPER, Chairman.\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\n  Another way this legislation will support jobs and grow the economy \nis by permanently eliminating a relic from the 1970s. This 40-year \nenergy ban has cost our economy jobs, and it strengthens oil exporters \nsuch as Iran and Russia. It is no secret that Russia views its energy \nresources as a foreign policy tool. It is no secret that Iran views its \nenergy resources as a component of national power, nor is it a secret \nthat President Obama recently granted the Iranian regime permission to \nexport those resources. Many think it is time the American people were \ntreated at least as fairly as Iran.\n  This critical energy reform would help strengthen America's jobs and \nAmerica's safety, but it is only a small part of how the overall bill \nwould support our national security. For instance, we know that \npreventing another crisis in military readiness will require \nsignificant investments over the medium term and over the long term. We \nknow there is much to be done, but we also know this legislation \nrepresents a critical step forward. It would finally ensure our \nmilitary has the funding it needs to train, equip, and confront the \nthreats we face from terrorist groups like ISIL and countries like \nIran.\n  We know that preventing another crisis in military readiness will \nrequire significant investments over the near, medium, and the long \nterm. For instance, our air campaign over Syria and Iraq has our Navy, \nMarine Corps, and Air Force flying sorties that will further stress the \nreadiness of the force, and those planes need to be maintained, \nrepaired, and ultimately replaced. We know there is much to be done, \nbut we also know this legislation represents a critical step forward. \nIt would finally ensure our military has more of the funding it needs \nto train, equip, and confront the threats we face from terrorist groups \nlike ISIL and countries like Iran.\n  We know this legislation would honor our veterans by funding the \nhealth care and benefits they rely on. We know it would enact critical \nreforms to help address the crises we have seen at the VA.\n  We know this legislation would, at a time of new and evolving terror \nthreats, bring badly needed reform to the Visa Waiver Program. We know \nit would bolster the FBI's ability to confront terror within our \nborders.\n  We know this legislation would prevent--I repeat, prevent--the \ntransfer of dangerous terrorists from Guantanamo's secure detention \ncenter into our communities.\n  We also know this legislation would enact an important cyber security \ninformation sharing measure. It is clear that countries such as Russia, \nChina, and Iran are determined to continue launching cyber attacks \nagainst us. We know that the administration already succumbed to a \ndevastating cyber attack just recently. It is time to provide the \nAmerican people with some long-overdue protection.\n  The legislation before us would go a long way toward strengthening \nour national security in a dangerous world. Its provisions will help \nadvance other important conservative priorities, too, like \nstrengthening the First Amendment and helping protect families from a \nhealth care law that attacks the middle class.\n  This legislation would, in the wake of the Obama administration's \nconservative speech-suppression scandal, enact important reforms at the \nIRS and force it to root out waste. These reforms will help prevent \nanother Lois Lerner, and they would help ensure that IRS employees who \ntarget Americans for their political beliefs are actually fired.\n  This legislation would strip out more pieces of a partisan law that \nhurts the middle class. One newspaper said the measure before us would \n``take an ax'' to a ``key pillar'' of ObamaCare. It would prevent a \ntaxpayer bailout of ObamaCare as well. The administration pushed hard \nto reverse that last provision but did not succeed.\n  The legislation before us would root out waste, fraud, and abuse. It \nwould consolidate or terminate dozens--literally dozens--of programs. \nIt would make long-overdue reforms to our Tax Code and contains pro-\nlife and pro-Second Amendment protections as well.\n  So, in my view, here is the bottom line: This legislation is worth \nsupporting. It doesn't mean this is the legislation I would have \nwritten on my own. It doesn't mean this is the legislation Speaker Ryan \nwould have written on his own either. It is not perfect, and we \ncertainly didn't get everything we wanted. But it made strides in it \ndefending our Nation at a time of global unrest. It advances \nconservative priorities in several areas and enacts significant reform \nin several areas on everything from tax relief to energy policy to \ncyber security.\n  I plan to vote for it. I hope colleagues will choose to do the same.\n  Before I leave the floor, I wish to acknowledge the impressive work \nof the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, on the \ntax side of this issue. Permanent reform was never going to be easy to \ncome by, but this thoughtful legislator, Senator Hatch, never gave up, \nand he and his staff continued to work on this issue for a very long \ntime. The result is a significant accomplishment for American families \nand the American economy, and I can't thank Senator Hatch enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8734-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before the Republican leader leaves the \nfloor, I wish to say a few things.\n  In the years I have served in public office, I brush aside most press \nand don't let it bother me, but once in a while something comes along \nthat does. There was an article in one of the Hill newspapers this day \nthat really troubled me: ``Bad blood: Reid-McConnell relationship hits \nnew low.''\n  I have a difficult job, and so does he. We both have done our \nrespective jobs. We started out in leadership positions here doing \ndifferent things, but where we first started working closely together \nwas when we were both whips.\n  No one knows our personal relationship except him and me. There are \nthings he does that disappoint me; there are things I do that \ndisappoint him. Our caucuses have different views on a lot of things.\n  I just want the record to be spread that the Reid-McConnell \nrelationship hasn't hit a new low. We have a personal relationship. \nNobody knows how many times we visit with each other on the telephone \nand personally.\n  I will always remember him and his wonderful wife. Within the last \nfew years my wife was involved in a terrible automobile accident. The \nfirst people to step up and ask if there was anything they could do \nwere Mitch and his wife. Shortly thereafter, my wife had a bruising \nbattle with breast cancer. There is no one who can comfort a wife more \nthan another wife. On January 1 of this year, I blinded myself in an \nexercise accident, and Mitch McConnell was there. His wife was there.\n  So I want the record to reflect--people might write all these things \nthey want to write, but Mitch McConnell and I are friends. People may \nthink that is difficult with all the things we do here opposing each \nother, but that is the job we have.\n  I want the record--I repeat--to be totally reflective of the fact \nthat I have admiration for Mitch McConnell and the work that he has to \ndo. Do I always agree with what he does? Of course not. I am sure the \nsame applies to his feelings about me. But no one can judge what our \npersonal relationship is except McConnell and Reid.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will my friend yield for a comment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am always frustrated, as I think the Democratic \nleader is, with the tendency to personalize political differences. \nObviously we have differences on issues, but I want to second what my \nfriend the Democratic leader said: There is nothing wrong with our \npersonal relationship, whether it is watching Nats baseball or a lot of \nother things that we have discussed both personally and otherwise for \nliterally years.\n  I share the Senator's frustration, I would say to my friend, over an \narticle like that. I think there is a tendency to think you can't have \npolitical arguments without developing personal animosity, and I don't \nhave any toward my friend, and I know he doesn't have any toward me.\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\n  I really appreciate the opportunity that he has given for both of us \nto kind of clear the air about the perceptions that could have been \ndrawn by reading such an article.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8735-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 18,000 Puerto Ricans served in the Armed \nForces in World War I; 65,000 in the Second World War; 61,000 during \nthe Korean war; 48,000 in the Vietnam war. Since 1917, more than \n200,000 American citizens from Puerto Rico have served in the U.S. \nArmed Forces, serving in every conflict since World War I.\n  A previous leader of the Senate asked me to represent the Senate in a \nceremony in Puerto Rico a number of years ago as they were dedicating \nthe monument to fallen soldiers of Puerto Rico in conflicts involving \nthe United States and other countries. I have never forgotten that. I \nhave a warm spot in my heart for Puerto Rico, a wonderful part of our \ncountry and a territory of the United States with a beautiful rain \nforest. I have been there. I have fond memories. I have been there a \nfew times, but I really like Puerto Rico.\n  Today, as they have helped us in these battles, Puerto Ricans who \nlive in Puerto Rico need our help. Right now, the people of Puerto Rico \nare drowning in over $72 billion in debt. It is a sparsely populated \nterritory with, I think, about 3.5 million people. They have more debt \nper capita than any U.S. State, of course. The territory is facing a \nsevere economic and fiscal crisis, and it is becoming a humanitarian \ncrisis.\n\n  Leader Pelosi and I fought to include meaningful provisions in an \nomnibus spending package to assist Puerto Rico, including empowering \nPuerto Rico to readjust a significant portion of its debt.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans refused to work with us to address Puerto \nRico's massive debt in a meaningful way. Instead of seizing the last \nchance Congress has this year to do the right thing for Puerto Ricans, \nthey turned their backs on 3.5 million citizens of the United States \nwho are Puerto Ricans and live in Puerto Rico.\n  To be clear, helping Puerto Rico doesn't mean bailing the island out \nof its massive debt. They don't need that. They don't need a massive \ncheck from the taxpayers. This is about giving Puerto Rico and their \nleaders the same tools that every State has--the same tools that are \ncurrently available in every State. Puerto Rico is part of the United \nStates, and the people of Puerto Rico are looking to Members of \nCongress to step in as partners. That is our job.\n  The territory is facing a massive $900 million payment in bond \npayments on January 1 to its bond holders. Puerto Rico's Governor said \nyesterday that the island will default in January or May. We can't \nwait.\n  Next year--likely the first half of 2016, the same period in which \nPuerto Rico is expected to default on its debt--Congress will present a \nCongressional Gold Medal in honor of the 65th Infantry Regiment, which \nsuffered such massive casualties over time. This infantry regiment was \na U.S. Army unit consisting mostly of Puerto Rican soldiers that \ndistinguished itself for its remarkable service during the Korean war. \nIt is shameful to think that Congress can at once recognize the \nextraordinary contributions of Puerto Ricans, who have made the \nultimate sacrifice for their country, and then do nothing to protect \nPuerto Ricans when they turn to us for help in a time of crisis.\n  Inaction is not an option. Puerto Rico needs to do its part, and so \nmust Congress. As Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner has said: ``This \nis not just a Puerto Rican problem; this is an American problem, \nrequiring an American solution.''\n  We can do something to help, and we must do something to help. We can \nwork together to pass legislation that allows Puerto Rico to \nrestructure a significant part of its debt without costing U.S. \ntaxpayers a penny.\n  These bonds are not bonds of the U.S. Government. People have made \ninvestments. Like every other investment, sometimes they go bad. Theirs \nwent bad as a result of the crash we had here 9 years ago or so on Wall \nStreet.\n  The Obama administration and congressional Democrats want to do \nsomething to help. We have asked Republicans to join us in this effort, \nbut so far they have only stood in the way. All we want is to simply \nsay that a territory of the United States--and we will limit it, of \ncourse, to Puerto Rico--has the ability, like every other State, to \nfile for bankruptcy protection.\n  Just last week, the senior Senator from New York asked for unanimous \nconsent to adopt the Puerto Rico Chapter 9 Uniformity Act--a bill that \nwould extend chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code to Puerto Rico and allow \nit to restructure its municipal debt in the same way other States can.\n  But instead of giving Puerto Rico the same rights as Kentucky, \nNevada, Illinois or Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee, from \nUtah, blocked this critical legislation.\n  I understand there are important issues that must be discussed, such \nas the nature and scope of this authority, but to deny Puerto Rico any \nrestructuring authority, as the Republicans have done, is negligent.\n  I hope that recent comments by Republican leaders, including Speaker \nRyan, will translate into meaningful action.\n  Senate Democrats are ready to work across the aisle on a real \nsolution for Puerto Rico, with the understanding that any viable plan \nmoving forward will be a Federal process that allows Puerto Rico to \nadjust its debt.\n  To deny Puerto Rico any restructuring authority is not just bad for \nPuerto Rico, it is bad for the creditors as well.\n  So I say to my Republican colleagues: Let's work together to extend a \nhelping hand to our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico. It should be in \nthis bill that we are going to vote on tomorrow. Giving the people of \nPuerto Rico the tools necessary to resolve this fiscal crisis is the \nright thing to do. It is the moral thing to do.\n  Mr. President, would you announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8735-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is amazing some of the people we get to \nmeet in our lives as Senators. There is a medical doctor in Chicago who \nI didn't know several years ago, but he and his wife have become dear \nfriends in a short period of time. His name is Dr. Zaher Sahloul. He \nasked for an appointment in my office in Chicago a few years back, and \nI agreed to it. He came in to tell me a story and to show me some \npictures. He is originally from Syria, and he is head of the Syrian-\nAmerican Medical Society in the Chicagoland area. Because of the \ntragedy of the civil war in his home country of Syria, he has felt a \nspecial obligation to help.\n  What he has done on many occasions now was to get as close to the \naction as he could in Syria to provide medical assistance to the \nvictims. Many times he risked his life to do it. And other doctors--\nsome Syrian-American and some not--have joined him in that effort. He \nwould bring me back photographs of what casualties of war look like in \nSyria. They were heartbreaking--pictures of children who had been \nmaimed and seriously injured by the barrel bombs of President Assad in \nSyria and stories about parents killed in the bombings that continue \nday after weary day.\n  Dr. Sahloul would ask me: What can you do, Senator? Can't you help \nus? Can't you stop this?\n  Of course, that civil war in Syria, which has gone on for 4 years, is \nalmost intractable, almost impossible to define. There are so many \nforces fighting one another that at any given moment, your ally today \nmay be your enemy tomorrow.\n  I tried, since meeting Dr. Sahloul, to do some things: to come out \nfor a safe\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nzone, a humanitarian zone in Syria, where medical treatment and food \nand a safe shelter could be found for families who are facing these \nattacks. We have had some limited--and I underline ``limited''--success \nin providing these safe zones, but it is a fact that the tragedy of \nSyria continues even to this minute. If anything, today it is worse \nbecause of the bombing by the Russians, which I am told has gone into \nareas that previously had been protected because of the citizen and \ncivilian populations.\n  The result is obvious. Millions--literally millions of people in \nSyria over the last 4 years--have fled. They are running for their \nlives, and they are running from war, and they are running from \nterrorism.\n  Dr. Sahloul recently wrote an article about his trip to the United \nStates. He arrived in 1989. He tells the story of coming to Chicago and \nfeeling very much alone. He graduated from medical school in Damascus. \nHe had a chance to practice medicine in Chicago, but he wasn't sure \nthat he could ever really fit in.\n  He tells the story of his first Thanksgiving in Chicago in 1989, when \na fellow doctor invited him to join her and her family for Thanksgiving \ndinner. It was a gracious gesture--a gesture of hospitality. Dr. \nSahloul has not forgotten it to this day. This article, which I will \nask to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my comments, \ngoes into some detail.\n  Dr. Sahloul really wrote this article not to just tell his story but \nto tell two other stories--the story of immigration, which is literally \nthe story of America, and the story of Syrian refugees.\n  His most recent trip to the region was to the island of Lesbos, which \nis part of Greece. I went there a few weeks ago with several of my \nSenate colleagues. Thousands--hundreds of thousands of refugees--are \nflowing into Lesbos from Turkey. They have left Syria and Afghanistan, \nand they are working their way into Greece on their way, they hope, to \nrefuge and shelter in Europe.\n  It is impossible to describe, if we have not seen it ourselves, what \nis going on here. But imagine for a moment that you were so frightened \nof the prospect of your child or your wife dying in war that you said: \nTomorrow, pick up whatever you can carry. We are leaving. We cannot \nstay here.\n  And if you look at these refugees as they travel--mothers and fathers \ncarrying babies, with toddlers and small children walking alongside of \nthem--you realize how desperate they must be to leave everything behind \nand to head out on this journey of danger. One of the most dangerous \nparts of it is that trip across the Aegean Sea between Turkey and \nGreece. They have to pay smugglers 1,000 euros, which is over $1,000 \nfor each adult, and 500 euros for each child. They put them in these \nplastic boats. Some of them are given lifejackets. The infants, too \nsmall for a lifejacket, are literally given plastic water wings that we \ngive to our infant children to play in the wading pools near our homes. \nThat is all they have. They cram them into these boats. They strap on a \nChinese motor. They put just enough gasoline in that engine that they \nthink will make it across--but not more--and try to find someone in the \nboat who will steer it. They point to their destination, and they \nleave. Sometimes these boats have 50 or 60 people in them when they are \nonly supposed to have 20 to travel safely.\n  They are warned that as they come up to the shore in Lesbos, Greece, \nor other islands, they should immediately run into the rocks and \nscuttle the boat so that it sinks. Otherwise, they are told they will \nbe turned around and pushed back to Turkey, and they may not have \nenough gas to make it. And that is what happens.\n  Dr. Sahloul tells the story of what happens when these boats are \nscuttled as they arrive in Greece. He tells of the drowning of little \nchildren who don't make it off the boat onto dry land but literally \ndrown right there. We saw one of those photos just a few months ago of \na tiny 3-year-old boy who drowned just as he was about to make it into \nGreece.\n  Dr. Sahloul tells that story so that some of us--all of us--will \nunderstand the desperation of these refugees.\n  It is now very popular among politicians to blame the Syrian refugees \nfor terrorism in America. We have not accepted that many refugees in \nour country. The numbers are about 2,000. At this point, not a single \nperson among those refugees has been arrested and charged with \nterrorism. Yet one would think that these Syrian refugees are the \ngreatest threat there is to America.\n  I will include the article I referred to in the Record so that those \nwho follow this debate and follow the proceedings on the floor can read \nfirsthand and for themselves Dr. Sahloul's story and the story of these \nSyrian refugees. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Lobelog, Dec. 14, 2015]\n\n             Today's Syrian Refugees Are Yesterday's Irish\n\n                           (By Zaher Sahloul)\n\n       Immigrants have built the United States--and that includes \n     Syrians.\n       Four months after I arrived to Chicago in 1989, my \n     colleague at the hospital, Dr. Nancy Nora, invited me to her \n     family's Thanksgiving dinner. I was homesick in a new country \n     after graduating from medical school in Damascus. Nancy Nora \n     was an Irish American from a large Catholic family. Her \n     father was a respected local physician.\n       Nancy told me that it was a tradition in her family to \n     invite a newcomer to the city. After all, Thanksgiving, I \n     learned, celebrated Native Americans welcoming European \n     refugees who fled their homelands due to religious and \n     political persecution. I came to Chicago from the ancient \n     Syrian city of Homs to pursue advanced medical training. \n     Syrians look to the U.S. as the best place to pursue this \n     training. In fact, almost half of one percent of American \n     doctors are of Syrian origin. There are also famous Syrian \n     actors, playwrights, rappers, chess players, entrepreneurs, \n     scientists, businessmen, and even Republican governors. Every \n     Syrian American is proud that Steve Jobs is the son of a \n     Syrian immigrant. Syrian immigrant Ernest Hamwi invented the \n     ice cream cone during the St. Louis World Fair in 1904.\n       ``Everyone who enjoys ice cream and an iPhone should feel \n     indebted to Syrian immigrants,'' I remind my children. All \n     three have been born in Chicago. The eldest, Adham, ran his \n     first marathon this year--to raise awareness about domestic \n     violence--and aspires to a career in politics. Mahdi is \n     involved in his university's Students Organizing for Syria \n     (SOS) chapter as well as the Black Lives Matter campaign. \n     Marwa, a high school freshman, is a budding pianist and ran \n     for her school's cross-country team. They all volunteer in \n     local charity events and for Syria. My wife, Suzanne, the \n     daughter of a Syrian civil engineer and Canadian mother with \n     Irish-Scottish roots, founded the Syrian Community Network \n     (SCN) to help support newly resettled Syrian refugee families \n     in the Chicago area.\n\n\n                           Darkness in Syria\n\n       To many Syrians, America symbolizes the values that we lack \n     at home: freedom, rule of law, and the respect for human \n     rights. In Syria, my generation knew only one president, \n     Hafez al-Assad, who ruled for 30 years with ``iron and \n     fire,'' as they say in Arabic. He detained and tortured \n     thousands of people who dared to speak out against his rule. \n     He committed massacres, the worst of which in the city of \n     Hama the same year I graduated from high school.\n       I still remember the atmosphere of fear in Syria. We dared \n     not speak. We were told that the ``walls have ears.'' My \n     family even prevented me from going to the mosque to pray. \n     Many of my high school friends and relatives disappeared into \n     the dark cells of the infamous Palmyra prison, the site of \n     another infamous massacre by Assad's ruthless security men.\n       When Hafez died in 2000, his son Bashar, a classmate of \n     mine from medical school, was appointed to the presidency by \n     a token parliament. People expected change. After all, Syria \n     had a well-educated middle class, a diverse economy, and a \n     reasonably vibrant nonprofit sector. It also had a tradition \n     of democracy, which had its ups and downs between 1920 and \n     1970. Bashar, inexperienced but equally ruthless, \n     disappointed us all. When hundreds of thousands of young \n     Syrians demonstrated peacefully in 2011, thinking naively \n     that the Arab Spring had turned at last to Syria, Assad and \n     his cronies responded with what they knew best: brutality and \n     oppression. More than 250,000 people have been killed. Tens \n     of thousands have disappeared into the prisons. Half of the \n     population has been displaced. And barrel bombs, cluster \n     bombs, and all kinds of weaponry have leveled entire cities \n     and neighborhoods.\n       Besides meager humanitarian assistance and empty rhetoric, \n     the international community has stood by mostly idle, \n     watching darkness descend on Syria. It has become one of the \n     worst humanitarian crises in our lifetime. In the ensuing \n     chaos, extremist groups like the Islamic State (ISIS or IS) \n     and Hezbollah filled the vacuum. But the snowballing refugee \n     crisis only captured the world's attention when it reached \n     the shores of Europe. With the drowning of the Syrian toddler \n     Aylan Kurdi, who tried to flee with\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\n     his family to Greece from Turkey across the Aegean Sea, \n     suddenly Syrian lives mattered.\n\n\n                           With the Refugees\n\n       I just returned from my last medical mission with my \n     organization, the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), to \n     the Greek island of Lesbos. Tens of thousands of Syrian \n     refugees are making the desperate boat trip from Turkey to \n     Lesbos and other Greek islands. The unfortunate ones are \n     drowning, while the lucky ones must carry on through another \n     1,200 miles of borders, humiliation, and misery to reach \n     whoever opens the door to them. Germany and Sweden have been \n     the most hospitable, while others are building walls and \n     barbed wire fences along their borders. The Syrian refugees I \n     met were fleeing the recent Russian bombings and Assad's \n     barrel bombs, while some are fleeing the brutality of the \n     Islamic State. I saw several women, some with toddlers \n     Aylan's age, who lost their husbands to the war. One woman \n     was crying as she described a public execution by IS that she \n     was forced to witness with her five-year-old son. He has had \n     nightmares since then.\n       I heard from a Syrian volunteer doctor about a boat with a \n     capacity of 30 people that was stuffed with more than 80 \n     refugees. Each refugee had to pay the smugglers 1,000 to \n     2,000 euros. It was a cold night when the boat crashed onto \n     the rocky shores and split in half. Children got stuck \n     underneath the boat. Many simply drowned. The Syrian doctor, \n     himself a victim of Assad's torture and now a refugee in \n     France, described to me how he performed CPR on two small \n     children. One was dead, and one died later. The U.S. \n     presidential candidates and governors who slammed the door in \n     the faces of helpless Syrian refugees should hear these \n     stories. These refugees deserve our sympathy and hospitality.\n       Since 1975, Americans have welcomed over 3 million refugees \n     from all over the world. Refugees have built new lives, \n     homes, and communities in towns and cities in all 50 states. \n     Since the war began, however, only 2,034 Syrian refugees have \n     been resettled in the entire United States. This is a \n     shameful number, considering that there are 4.2 million \n     Syrian refugees. The House of Representatives has passed a \n     bill that would impose additional security measures on \n     refugees from Syria, making it nearly impossible to accept \n     more refugees from Iraq and Syria. A similar bill is awaiting \n     a Senate vote.\n       Nancy Nora's father, surrounded by his large extended \n     family at the dinner table on that Thanksgiving many years \n     ago, explained to me how Irish Americans were demonized when \n     they first arrived to the United States as refugees. They \n     were maligned by politicians and by the public, and were \n     perceived as a threat. During dark times in our history, the \n     United States has treated newly arriving Jews, Italians, \n     Japanese, and Latinos as a threat.\n       As I was leaving the Nora household after that memorable \n     evening, her family wished me good luck with my studies and \n     my new life in America. Suddenly, the cold Chicago night felt \n     very warm. I felt at home.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4188, the Coast Guard \nreauthorization, which was received from the House; I further ask that \nthe Thune substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, \nbe read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, if I might, let me briefly explain the \nbasis for my objection. I have had the opportunity to discuss this \nmatter with my colleague from the State of Alaska.\n  The cruise industry foreign-flags its vessels and thus pays no U.S. \nincome tax, yet it has asked for protections in this bill from remedies \nsought by seamen for failing to pay wage and overtime, for remedies for \nmaintenance and cure, one of the oldest, internationally recognized \nremedies for seafarers. These two remedies would keep the U.S. Merchant \nMarine competitive. U.S.-flagged vessels are required to hire U.S. \nseamen, and only by ensuring that workers on U.S. vessels and foreign-\nflagged vessels, which sail in and out of U.S. ports carrying U.S. \npassengers, have the same remedies can U.S. jobs be protected.\n  I have had the opportunity to discuss this issue with the Senator \nfrom Alaska, and it is my hope that we can work diligently together to \naddress and clear issues of concern to myself and a number of my \ncolleagues. But until we have that opportunity to review the text and \nto appropriately resolve concerns that arise from the Jones Act and the \nlongstanding workers compensation-type benefit I described called \nmaintenance and cure, my objection will continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I want to talk about the broader issue \nhere. I appreciate the willingness of my colleague from Delaware to \nwork on this important issue. The Coast Guard reauthorization bill \npassed out of the commerce committee unanimously in April.\n  We talk a lot about national security here on the Senate floor. We \ntalk about our men and women in uniform and how they are protecting us. \nBut I have always liked to mention the men and women in the Coast \nGuard. Prior to 9/11, you can make a very strong argument that the \nCoast Guard was probably the only uniformed service whose members were \nrisking their lives for Americans day in and day out every single day. \nI think a lot of their heroism goes unnoticed. Trust me, in Alaska we \nsee it daily.\n  The Coast Guard admirably performs a variety of missions on a daily \nbasis throughout our great Nation with a team of fewer than 90,000 \nmembers comprised of Active-Duty, Reserve, civilian, and Volunteer \nforces and an annual budget of less than $10 billion, with, let's face \nit, a fleet of aging vessels and aircraft.\n  The ranking member of the commerce committee, Senator Nelson from \nFlorida, and I talk a lot about how heroic these men and women are and \nhow they deserve our attention, just like other members of the \nmilitary.\n  Last year the Coast Guard executed more than 17,500 search and rescue \nmissions--these are incredibly dangerous, by the way--in rough waters \noff the coast of Alaska and Florida and Delaware and saved over 3,400 \nlives. Think about that--3,400 lives in 1 year. In addition, last year \nthe Coast Guard law enforcement crews interdicted over 140 metric tons \nof narcotics, detained over 300 smugglers, and interdicted more than \n3,500 migrants.\n  What we are talking about here is bipartisan legislation that needs \nto be passed that will do one very important thing for our country and \nthe Coast Guard: It is going to improve the mission readiness and \nperformance of the Coast Guard. It demonstrates that the Congress of \nthe United States is paying attention to these brave young men and \nwomen.\n  I am disappointed because we have worked hard to move this \nlegislation since April. We have worked hard. We stripped out \nprovisions that the other side had problems with. Section 605 is gone \nnow, to move this forward. So we have been working hard. I thought we \nwere going to pass this legislation this morning.\n  The provision my colleague from Delaware was talking about is section \n606 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act, and it is simply looking to \ncreate consistency and reduce forum shopping in lawsuits involving \nmariners.\n  While I understand that some special interests--trial lawyers in \nparticular--are not always interested in judicial consistency or \nefficiency because it is not in the interest of their bottom line, I \nwish to remind this body that the provision we are talking about passed \noverwhelmingly in the House of Representatives in a bipartisan manner--\nnot once, not twice, but three times in the past 2 years. Three times. \nIt is not a controversial provision.\n  Section 606 is about forum shopping for foreign mariners. In fact, \nsection 606 is not even about Americans; it is about forum shopping for \nforeign mariners in foreign waters on foreign-flagged ships. That is \nthe issue which is holding up the reauthorization of the Coast Guard \nbill for our brave men and women who serve in the Coast Guard. Why that \nprovision should be holding us up is beyond me.\n  But I did have a good discussion with my colleague from Delaware. We \nare more than willing to continue to work with our colleagues to reach \nconsensus.\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nBut I certainly hope we can get there today and not let one small \nprovision that is very focused on one special interest group hold up a \nbipartisan bill which everybody on the commerce committee voted for and \nwhich is going to do something very important: recognize the men and \nwomen in the Coast Guard who risk their lives--just like everybody else \nin the military--on a daily basis to protect Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this week in Washington, President Barack \nObama's favorite pickup basketball pal from Chicago is leaving town. He \nis heading back home to Chicago. His name is Arne Duncan. He is \nSecretary of Education. He was one of the first choices of this \nPresident to serve in his Cabinet. He was an obvious choice.\n  Arne Duncan has given his life to teaching and education. It starts \nwith his parents--his father, who was a professor at the University of \nChicago, and his mother, who ran a mentoring and tutoring center in the \nHyde Park area of Chicago. As a young boy in school, Arne used to come \nout of class and go to his mother's mentoring center to help other \nyoung kids learn to read and do their homework. It was built into him. \nHis dedication to teaching, to schools, and to improving the lives of \nstudents across America has been well documented.\n  As Arne grew up, he grew tall. As he grew tall, he played basketball, \nand he was very good at it. He ended up going to Harvard University and \nplaying on their varsity basketball team. He then went on to play in \nthe professional ranks in Australia. It was there that he met his wife. \nThey have two children together. She is waiting for him in Chicago, and \nhe is anxious, I am sure, to return and live full time in that city \nwith his family.\n  When he came back from his stint in basketball, he went back to \nmentoring kids in the Hyde Park section and other parts of Chicago. He \nwas chosen to head up the Chicago public schools by former mayor \nRichard Daley. He was the right choice. Arne Duncan truly had the \ninterest of those public school students at heart, and it showed. That \nis when I met him for the first time and came to know him. He was an \nextraordinary and dedicated person, trying to manage one of the most \nchallenging school districts in America.\n  Two things come to mind immediately. They used to have weekends where \npeople would volunteer to go work at schools. My wife and I volunteered \nseveral weekends, and we would always run into Arne and his wife and \nfamily, who were giving their Saturdays building playgrounds, painting \nthe interiors of schools, doing the basic things but doing things that \nmany people in his lofty status of superintendent might not have \nconsidered.\n  I used to visit--still do--a lot of Chicago's public schools, drawing \nmy own impressions. I remember visiting a school once and coming out of \nit and saying to my staff: That school is out of control. It was so \nloud in the corridors--not between classes but during classes--I \ncouldn't imagine students were learning. It didn't appear there was any \nsupervision.\n  I called Arne and I said: You know, I have never called you about a \nschool, but please take a look at this school. Something is wrong \nthere. It doesn't feel right.\n  He said: I will do it.\n  He called me back 2 weeks later, and he said: You were right. That \nprincipal was an experiment to see if he could do it. He can't. We \nreplaced him.\n  That is how Arne reacted. It wasn't a matter of sending it to a \ncommittee and waiting for months and evaluating at the end of the \nschool year; he made the decision--he is decisive--because he knew it \nwas in the best interest of the students.\n  Arne Duncan inherited a Department of Education that was in \ncontroversy when President Obama took the office of Presidency. It was \nin controversy because there was a Federal law--No Child Left Behind--\npromulgated by a previous Republican President, George W. Bush, and \nsupported on a bipartisan basis by Congress, that was extremely \ncontroversial. Teachers were unhappy with it. Many administrators were \nunhappy with it. Governors were unhappy with it. There was too much \ntesting, too many strict rules, and too much pronouncement of failure \nwhen it wasn't really warranted. That is what he inherited.\n  Over the years, Arne has made a significant impact when it comes to \neducation in America. U.S. graduation rates are at an alltime high, \nwith the biggest improvements from minorities and the poor. Under \nArne's leadership, dropout rates are at an alltime low. Test scores are \nslightly up, with some of the biggest gains in States that embrace the \nadministration's approach to reform.\n  We had a stimulus package, which the President supported when he was \nfirst elected, to try to help our country out of a recession, and Arne \nDuncan spoke up to the President and said that we ought to include in \nthere some provisions to help school districts, provisions for money if \nthey will compete for it. They instituted a program known as Race to \nthe Top. They invited States, if they wished, to apply for these \nFederal funds. Over 20 States applied. They weren't required to. The \n$10 billion tied to reform was held out--it included $4.35 billion, I \nshould say, for Race to the Top; $10 billion overall--it was held out \nto the States, and within a year 40 States not only competed but \nchanged their laws to improve their prospects to win money from Race to \nthe Top. Forty-five States embraced college and career-ready standards \nlike common core.\n  It is interesting to note that one of the States that was successful \nwas Tennessee, which is, of course, the home State of Senator Lamar \nAlexander, the chairman of our committee in the Senate that is drafting \neducation legislation. Tennessee impressed Arne Duncan and the \nDepartment of Education and became one of the recipients, and Tennessee \nmade some honest declarations about the state of education in their \nState when they made this application. It was a State that took \nseriously making dramatic change, and a relationship was struck between \nArne Duncan and Lamar Alexander and many other Members of Congress.\n  Time has passed. During the last several years, there has been a \nchange of thinking in Congress, in the country, and in the Department \nof Education about the course to follow.\n  A week or two ago in the White House, President Obama signed the new \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, which was promulgated on a \nbipartisan basis and had the active support of not only Republican \nSenator Lamar Alexander but his Democratic counterpart, Senator Patty \nMurray of the State of Washington. This bipartisan legislation received \nI think over 80 votes on the floor of the Senate. Arne Duncan was there \nat the signing. He had worked with the leadership to arrive at this new \nstage in the evolution of the relationship of the Federal Government to \nthe States and to the local school districts.\n  I could go through a long list of things Arne Duncan worked on, \nincluding his concern about student debt, but I want to close by \npointing to one that has a personal interest to me, and that is for-\nprofit colleges and universities. I have given so many speeches on the \nfloor about this industry--the most heavily subsidized private business \nin America today, for-profit colleges and universities. I have \nrecounted the miserable statistics about this sector of the economy. \nWith 10 percent of high school graduate students, they receive 20 \npercent of the Federal aid to education. They account for more than 40 \npercent of all student loan defaults.\n  I appealed to Arne Duncan and the Department of Education to do their \nbest to make sure the worst for-profit colleges and universities were \nheld accountable. Arne Duncan showed real leadership. It wasn't easy. \nHe ran into political resistance on Capitol Hill from both political \nparties. And while I was probably pushing harder than I should have, he \nstepped forward and started demanding accountability. The net result \nwas that one of the largest for-profit colleges and universities, \nCorinthian Schools, went out of business. It turns out they had been \ndefrauding the Federal Government for years when it came to the results \nof job-seeking by their students.\n\n  Arne Duncan showed extraordinary public service and political \nleadership\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nin tackling this controversial part of the educational establishment of \nAmerica. It is no surprise for those of us who know Arne Duncan and \nwhat he is made of. Back in the day, when his mother was running a \nmentoring center in Hyde Park, the local criminal gangs told her to \nclose it down or they were going to firebomb it. Well, Arne and his mom \nshowed up at the center the next day. They weren't frightened and they \ndidn't run away. He has never run away from his commitment to young \npeople. He has never run away from his commitment to public service. I \ndon't know what the next chapter of Arne Duncan's life will be, but \nthis chapter--his service as Secretary of Education for the United \nStates of America--was an extraordinary display of commitment to the \nstudents, teachers, parents, administrators, and taxpayers of America.\n  I wish to join in, along with so many other people, by expressing my \ngratitude to Arne Duncan for his service to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8739-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8739-S8742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 OMNIBUS AND TAX EXTENDERS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise to applaud my colleagues for being \nin the Christmas spirit. I have never seen so many gifts and presents \ngiven out in one bill.\n  Let's be clear, we aren't voting on just a $1.1 trillion spending \nbill called the omnibus, we are not voting on just that bill. That \nbill, by itself, could have been acceptable because it helps veterans, \nmiddle-class families, our Defense Department, our border security, and \na host of other valuable Federal programs, but we aren't voting on just \nthe omnibus bill. We are forced to vote on both the omnibus and the tax \nextender package that adds an additional unpaid-for $680 billion of \ngifts for special interest groups.\n  We are giving out $680 billion in irresponsible tax breaks, Christmas \ngifts to every special interest and corporation that asked for one. We \ngave Christmas presents to millionaire race car drivers and motorcycle \nriders, film, television, and theater producers, and even racehorse \nowners. Don't get me wrong. I like going to the movies, I like riding \nmy motorcycle, and even going horseback riding from time to time, but I \ndon't think many middle-class Americans will be happy to know we gave \naway billions of dollars in tax gifts to millionaires and billionaires \nat their expense. They should be especially upset that we did it by \nmortgaging the futures of their children and grandchildren. I have \nalways said we are writing checks that our kids can't cash.\n  I think a lot of Americans would want to know how we got here. How \ndid we get to the point where we force ourselves to vote on a 2,000-\npage, trillion-dollar spending bill at the end of the year just so we \ncan all rush home for the holidays? How did we add a $700 billion tax \nextender package that gives the wealthiest among us the gifts they \nwant? The truth is that we stopped following regular order. A lot of us \nonly heard about regular order. We have never actually governed by it. \nI only know about regular order because before I joined the Senate and \nbefore he passed away, Senator Robert C. Byrd told me how this place \nused to work. We used to talk about how things would happen. He would \nbe disappointed in all of us on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, \nthat we have run the body he loved so much the way we have.\n  This is what regular order is supposed to look like. After receiving \nthe President's budget--which we do, starting our new Congress--\nCongress is supposed to respond with our view of what the budget should \nlook like. Then we work through 12 appropriations committees and their \nsubcommittees to develop 12 separate appropriations bills. The entire \nbody should then consider each individual bill and make sure they meet \nthe demands of our constituents while staying within the means of our \nset budget. We need to do that 12 separate times so we can honestly \ntell the American public that we were responsible with their money and \nwe can answer to that.\n  Instead, we are jammed at the last minute with a $1.1 trillion \nspending bill that is over 2,000 pages long and considers the \npriorities of those 12 committees all at one time, without talking \nabout them and debating them individually. Not only that, as if that is \nnot enough, this year we have a special treat of adding on a $700 \nbillion tax gift Christmas tree package instead of actually doing the \ntax reform all of us talk about but never actually get around to. At \nsome point, we are going to have to start setting our priorities based \non our values, budgeting based on our priorities, and being responsible \nstewards of the taxpayers' money. It will happen sooner or later.\n  Instead of working throughout the year in a bipartisan way, we \ncontinue to govern by crisis, one after another. We kick the can down \nthe road all year and then add in more than half a trillion dollars in \ngifts to our special interest friends.\n  Both parties are to blame. This is not just a bipartisan issue, both \nparties are at fault. The Christmas gift will add $2 trillion to our \ndebt over the next two decades. My grandfather Papa Joe always taught \nme to base our priorities on our values and then budget based on our \npriorities.\n  Well, we have sure shown the American people what our values are with \nthis bill. We pay a lot of lip service on this floor, on cable news, \nand on campaign trails about our priorities, but when it comes down to \nit and time to govern based on the priorities, all we get is lip \nservice.\n  We had choices to make in this bill. We could have helped middle-\nclass families or could have given tax breaks to multinational \ncompanies--notably the major banks--parking their money abroad. We \ncould choose to make college debt free or we could choose to help the \nfilm, television, and theater producers deduct the cost of their \nmovies, shows, and plays. We could choose to double our border security \nor we could allow racehorses to be depreciable. We could choose to give \nevery American family $5,600 in tax relief or we could have chosen to \ngive favorable tax treatment to racing complexes. We could have chosen \nto keep the promise that President Truman made to our patriotic coal \nminers in 1946 and protect their pension and health care guarantees or \nwe could choose to give $680 billion in tax breaks to special interest \ngroups, millionaires, and billionaires.\n  We chose poorly. We truly chose poorly. Democrats and Republicans \nboth say we need to help our hard-working American families, but we \nhave completely ignored the most hard-working people out there I know, \nour coal miners, and we should be ashamed of ourselves.\n  I know some of my colleagues don't like coal. They think they don't \nneed it and want to get rid of it, but this isn't about coal. It is \nabout the brave men and women who gave and who have gone into those \nmines every day for over a century to power our economy, produce the \nweapons to fight our wars, and provide the energy we all depend on \ntoday. It made us the greatest country on Earth, a superpower. \nBasically, with this God-given resource that we had, these brave men \nand women worked and worked hard, very patriotically, to make sure this \ncountry had the energy it needed to defend itself and to build the \nindustrial might that we have to be the superpower of the world.\n  They were guaranteed affordable health care and dignity in retirement \nin return for the blood, sweat, and tears they shed for our country. \nThat was a guarantee, a written guarantee, in 1946. They were \nguaranteed affordable health care and retirement. I want you to know \nthat by not being able to have that in this bill--as laden as it is \nwith all of these giveaways, freebies, picking who is getting what, and \nall the millionaires and billionaires--we went back on our promise. We \ndecided to help race car owners, film producers, horseracing \nprofessionals, foreign entities, and a host of other special interest \ngroups, but we didn't help our own miners. We did not help our own \npeople.\n  Today we said that despite finding a fiscally responsible way to meet \nthese\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nobligations, our priorities were not in valuing their service. I cannot \nstand on the floor and vote for a bill that tells middle-class \nAmericans, students and veterans, doctors and nurses, mothers and \nfathers, and our seniors that these are our values. They simply are not \nwho we are and what we are about. They are not the values that the good \npeople of West Virginia, Wisconsin or all the other 50 States that we \nhave in this great Union basically value, and they are not the values \nthe ``greatest generation'' and our miners fought for.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to vote no and show the American people \nonce and for all what our values should be and that our priorities are \nabout them and not about special interest people and special people who \ndon't need the help. They have already done very well in life. I would \nhope we would all think twice before voting on this absolutely \nirresponsible piece of legislation that adds another $700 billion of \ndebt. It is uncalled for.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to enter into a \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have two of my colleagues with me; the \nthree of us were former Governors. My good friend Senator King was the \nGovernor of Maine, my good friend Senator Mark Warner was the Governor \nof Virginia, and I was previously the Governor of West Virginia. So we \nmaybe think a little differently about how things should work in a \nbudget.\n  Unfortunately, we don't aim for the bipartisan success we had in \n1997. In 1997, President Clinton, a Democrat, under his \nadministration--at that time we had Governor Kasich, who was then a \nCongressman, a Republican, and they worked together to get a budget. \nAnd, I might say, it was the last time a balanced budget was \nnegotiated. The government suffered budget deficits every year from \n1970 through 1997, when a balanced budget was finally negotiated.\n  In 1998, the President, along with a Republican-controlled Congress--\nas we have today--recorded a surplus of $69 billion and continued to \ndeliver surpluses. In 1999 it was $126 billion; in 2000 it was $236 \nbillion; in 2001 it was $128 billion. The Congressional Budget Office \nin January of 2001 stated in their budget outlook that the Federal \nbudget over the next decade continued to be bright and would build on a \nperiod of historic surpluses. Historic surpluses are what they \npredicted. That was in 2001.\n  However, just a year later, CBO--the same people--changed their tone, \nprojecting that long-term pressures on increased spending and \ndecreasing revenues due to tax cuts would set the country on a path \ntoward deficits. CBO even went so far as to warn President Bush and \nCongress, stating: Taking action sooner rather than later to address \nlong-term budgetary pressures can make a significant difference. In \nparticular, policies that encourage economic growth, such as running \nbudget surpluses to boost national savings and investment, enacting tax \nand regulatory policies that encourage work and saving, and focusing \nmore government spending on investment rather than on current \nconsumption can help by increasing the total amount of resources \navailable for all uses.\n  But Washington ignored the warnings, and the budget deficits \nreturned, along with the bipartisan blame that plagues the Nation's \nCapital today.\n  Since 2002, the Nation has routinely suffered from irresponsible \nbudgets, resulting in a growing national debt. Between 2008 and 2012, \nthe deficits totaled $5.6 trillion, and in 4 of the 5 years, they were \nlarger relative to the size of the economy than they had been in any \nyear since 1946. In 2014, our spending was $3.5 trillion and our \nrevenues were only $3 trillion--a deficit of $485 billion. In 2015, CBO \nprojects our spending will be $3.67 trillion and our revenues will be \nonly $3.2 trillion--a deficit of $426 billion. Our deficit is projected \nto decrease slightly in 2016, with spending at $3.9 trillion and \nrevenues at $3.5, for a deficit of only $414 billion. However, \nbeginning in 2017, they begin to rise again. With spending at over $4 \ntrillion and revenues at $3.6 trillion, we are still adding $416 \nbillion and climbing.\n  The three of us have a hard time understanding that. Basically, we \nall had balanced budget amendments in our constitutions. Every Governor \nsits down at least once a week with the revenue, and the revenue people \ncome in with all the tax people. Every Governor sits down, and they \ntell us where we are. They tell us where we are on projected revenues \nand if we can continue spending what we projected to spend or if we \nhave to start cutting. As Governor, you have to start making those \ndecisions on a weekly basis, sometimes on a daily basis. But that was \nour responsibility.\n  On our current trajectory, we will be returning to trillion-dollar \nlevels by 2025, with spending of $6 trillion and revenues of only $5 \ntrillion. Our Federal debt now exceeds $18.7 trillion, equivalent to \nroughly 100 percent of GDP, and CBO projects budget deficits will rise \nsteadily. By 2040, our Federal debt will reach a percentage of GDP seen \nat only one previous time in the history of this great country, and \nthat was the final year of World War II.\n  If we think back to World War II, our parents and grandparents were \nwondering: How do we survive? How does the world survive? We didn't \nworry about what we had spent and what revenue we had. We did whatever \nit took.\n  This is all self-inflicted. This is truly self-inflicted, and it is \nnot one party spending more than the other party or one party being \nmore irresponsible. It is all of us not doing our job--just doing what \nwe are doing today, voting on a combined omnibus with an extender bill \nwrapped into one, and saying: There is a lot of good, and we need to do \nit. If you don't do it, you are going to shut down the government.\n  That is not the case. Somebody sooner or later has to say enough is \nenough. How can we go home and explain this to the people? I can't. We \nare leaving people behind and not doing the job we should be doing.\n  That is why I am so pleased to be here with my dear friends. Senator \nAngus King from Maine--the job he did I think was exceptional. I yield \nto Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know my friend from West Virginia and I \ncompliment the Senator from Maine.\n  Before these two great former Governors came to this body, there were \nmany times I would stand up and rail on these issues. It is great to \nhave other folks who balanced budgets and made hard choices in their \ncareers. I welcome the opportunity to share a couple of my thoughts.\n  I will not repeat all of the comments Senator Manchin made. I concur \nwith the vast majority of them. The data is overwhelming. I know the \nPresiding Officer has also taken on this issue. There are some good \nthings, so let me start with some of the good.\n  As someone who feared that at some point this tax extender package \nmight exceed $800 billion or get close to $900 billion, I think it is \nan interesting place when folks are celebrating the fact that it is \nonly $680 billion of unpaid-fors. In many ways, there is a lot to \ncommend in the policy choices made by both sides. On the Democratic \nside, making permanent the earned-income tax credit is, frankly, a \npolicy that was initiated by a Republican President and called the best \nanti-poverty program around. Expanding and making that permanent is a \nstep in the right direction. The child tax credit is a policy raised by \nboth sides, and making that permanent and expanding it makes an \nenormous amount of sense.\n  I know, as well, that from a business standpoint, one of the \nchallenges businesses face in an ever more competitive world is lack of \npredictability. So for certain areas, such as the R tax credit and \n179 expensing, it is appropriate and timely that we make those \nprovisions permanent.\n  I know there may be differences, particularly even on my side. The \nbonus depreciation provisions are nice to have, but I am not sure I \nknow any business that makes that decision on capital investment based \nupon bonus depreciation, and the fact that it is\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\nwinding down over 5 years is a great step in the right direction.\n  I have some concerns about some of the international tax provisions, \nnot because of the merits of the system but as someone who believes \nstrongly that to keep America competitive, we need international tax \nreform. If we take things off the table now, the ability to bring those \nback to get the kind of comprehensive tax reform we need in the long \nhaul makes those challenges more difficult.\n  Let me again build on Senator Manchin's comments. I want to be \nrespectful of my colleagues' time and make this brief. As Senator \nManchin said, anybody in this body that tries to say this is all the \nRepublicans' fault or it is all the Democrats' fault doesn't know their \nhistory. There are no clean hands.\n  As Senator Manchin mentioned, the good news is we are actually at a \nrelatively low rate of annual deficit. The challenge is that, because \nof unthoughtful behavior by those of us in this Chamber and many that \npreceded us, now the aggregate debt our Nation faces is $18.5 trillion, \nand it will go up.\n  I talked to a group of high school students this morning and said: \nThe biggest challenge you are going to inherit is this massive amount \nof debt. If we are not careful, within a few years the Federal \nGovernment of the United States will be a social insurance party and an \narmy and nothing else.\n  Yesterday Senator Cantwell spoke to this. I know the Federal Reserve \nappropriately started to inch up interest rates. With this aggregate \ndebt--by the way, we just added $680 billion more to this debt over the \nnext 10 years through these unpaid-for tax extenders--interest rates go \nup one percentage point. At 100 basis points, that is more than $140 \nbillion. We can have $140, $150, $180, depending on how they collect \nit. But let's take the conservative, $140 billion a year of additional \nspending off the top before we spend on any other priority. That is \nmore than this government spends on the Department of Homeland Security \nand on the Department of Education combined.\n  So at some point we do have to say ``no mas.'' At some point--and I \nhope it will be starting next year--we will step back and look at this \nholistically. Even though there are good policies in this extender \npackage, the overall aggregate is a challenge.\n  Two last points. We worked on a transportation bill in this body. \nWhile I supported the policy goals when it was here on the stand-alone, \nI voted against it because the pay-fors were a hodgepodge that \nbasically had nothing to do with transportation. It is remarkable to me \nas a businessman--not as a Senator, but as a business guy. You look at \nyour balance sheet on your expenditure side and your revenue side. They \nare both spending. Purely from a government standpoint, you are \nspending on the Tax Code or you are spending programmatically. When we \nspend on investments like transportation, we have to pay for them. When \nwe spend in the Tax Code, suddenly there is a free pass that these \nitems never have to be paid for. Yet going forward, when we look at our \nbudget next year, we will have less ability because the revenues have \nbeen decreased over a 10-year period of $680 billion. I know my \ncolleagues will speak to these issues.\n  I want to make a final point. I am not sure of my colleagues' stand \non this, but it is of grave concern to me. I supported the Affordable \nCare Act. I think there are good things in it; I think there are \nproblems that need to be fixed. But one of the components of the \nAffordable Care Act that even its greatest critics point out is that it \nactually was paid for. Some of those pay-fors, we are paying for. They \nwere policy choices; one in particular was the so-called Cadillac tax. \nThe remarkable thing about the Cadillac tax was that was the one point \nof agreement--whether you are an economist on the left or the right--\nthat not only would it generate revenues for the so-called ACA, but it \nwould also be one of the most powerful reform packages to hold the \noverall cost of health care down. Perhaps due to an election year rush \nand because the pressure is on both sides, Congress is taking its \nproverbial punt. Rather than fixing the Cadillac tax or rather than \nfixing the medical device tax, we are delaying the implementation of \nboth of these revenue sources.\n\n  I will make a wager now with any Senator in this body that while the \npromise of this delay is only for 2 years, 2 years from now there will \nbe another reason to delay additionally. In doing so, what we do is \nundermine the financial legs as well as some of the policy legs of the \nACA, and in a State such as mine where we have not expanded Medicaid, \nwe provide fodder to those who want to delay the expansion of Medicaid \nbecause they are afraid that the Federal Government will not honor its \ncommitments. By delaying the implementation of these pay-fors, \nunfortunately, I think we strengthen their argument.\n  I thank both of my colleagues. They are both dear friends--the \nSenator from West Virginia and the Senator from Maine. We have \nsometimes been lonely voices in our caucuses on these issues.\n  With that, I want to turn this over to my friend, the Senator from \nMaine--who, like the Senator from West Virginia, has balanced budgets, \nhas made tough choices--to speak on the issue of the tax extenders and \nthe omnibus, Mr. King.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I believe the Senator from Wisconsin wants \nto make a comment before I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I was sitting in the chair and I was \nlistening to----\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is going on here?\n  Mr. KING. A quick colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was consent granted for a colloquy.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Very briefly, I was sitting in the chair and I was \nlistening to the Senators from West Virginia and Virginia, and I am \nsure the Senator from Maine will also be talking about an area of \nagreement. The Senator from West Virginia talked about our mortgaging \nour children's future. That is the truth.\n  I want to commend the Senators for highlighting this mortgaging of \nour children's future and the facts. I know a couple of Senators \nsupported my amendment to the budget process, laying out the \ninformation. The only thing I want to chime in on is to lay out the \ntruth of how severe this mortgaging of our children's future is. One of \nthe things I did in the budget process was to lay out a 30-year deficit \nprojection by CBO, putting it in dollar format.\n  The fact of the matter is, according to CBO, over the next 30 years \nthe projection deficit is $103 trillion--about $10 trillion over the \nnext decade, $28 trillion in the second decade, and $65 trillion in the \nthird decade. We got that in the budget process to lay it out over 30 \nyears. In the budget process, we also asked CBO to put this in as a 1-\npage income statement, to lay out where that $103 trillion comes from. \nWe have this 1-page income statement that lays out revenue and deficit. \nThe first two lines are Social Security and Medicare. Over the next 30 \nyears, there will be $14 trillion more in benefits paid out than is \nbrought in by the payroll tax into Social Security. It is a $34 \ntrillion deficit in Medicare. The remainder of that $103 trillion \ndeficit is interest on the debt.\n  I want to commend the Democratic colleagues here who are so concerned \nabout the mortgage of our children's future and these added deficits \nfrom this tax extender package. It is a real concern. We have been \ntrying to find the areas of agreement that unify us. This is certainly \none of those things. We have to stop this process.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to join my colleagues, including \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, to discuss what we are going to be voting \non tomorrow.\n  First, I should say I have no major problem with the budget deal, \nwith the omnibus. The process isn't exactly what it should have been. \nWe didn't consider our 12 appropriations bills on the floor. However, \nthe appropriations process did go through the committee process, and it \nwas a result of bicameral and bipartisan negotiations.\n  My problem is with the tax extenders part of the package. First, it \nis a double standard. For all of this year--and we struggled in the \nArmed Services Committee and through the appropriations process--\neverything that had to\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\nbe increased in spending for whatever purpose had to be paid for. That \nwas the standard. Everything has to be paid for. We had to find \noffsets. Then all of a sudden, we are considering a $680 billion hole \nin the deficit that doesn't have to be paid for. It is like we are all \nconcerned about the debt, except when we aren't. Frankly, as someone \nwho has been here for a fairly short time, I find this puzzling. The \nrule ought to apply both ways, because tax expenditures, by the way, \nare what they are. Republican and Democratic economists concede that \nthe deductions, loopholes, and changes in the Tax Code are called tax \nexpenditures. That is what they are, because otherwise they would be \nrevenues to the government.\n  These are real dollars, and this is what has happened since the Tax \nReform Act of 1986, when tax expenditures represented about 5 percent \nof GDP. Here we are today, and then the package we are talking about. \nWe are going up into this area. This is almost 8 percent of GDP. This \nis a huge outlay that is like new mandatory spending. It happens \nautomatically. It doesn't have to be reviewed every year. There is no \nassessment of whether these expenditures are effective or not, and some \nof them obviously are.\n  I have no problem with many of the items that are in here--mortgage \ninterest deduction, health care interest deduction. But some of them \ndeserve consideration, just as our budgets deserve consideration. This \nis on automatic pilot. This is a kind of new mandatory spending. The \nother piece is that we are deepening the debt hole. This is the percent \nof GDP of spending, and these are revenues. This is the deficit. This \nis the debt. That is what is killing us in the long run.\n  There is a tremendous interest rate risk here--as the Senator from \nVirginia pointed out. We are now at historically low interest levels. \nIn living memory, I don't know a time when interest rates have been as \nlow as they are. For every point that interest rates go up with an $18 \ntrillion debt, the cost to the Treasury is $180 billion. The math isn't \nthat complicated. If interest rates go up to 5 percent, just interest \npayments on this $18 trillion debt will be $900 billion a year. So 90 \npercent of our current total discretionary budget would go to interest \npayments. It would swamp the defense budget. It would swamp the \ndiscretionary budget. Yet we are tiptoeing along the edge of this \nprecipice.\n  If interest rates go up with an $18 trillion debt, we are in real \nfinancial trouble. The second problem with this huge debt is it gives \nus no room for slack. It gives us no room for an emergency, for a \nrecession, for hostilities, for a major terrorist attack and its effect \non our economy. We have no cushion because we have used the cushion up. \nWe continue to use it up, even when the economy improves. This $18 \ntrillion some day is going to have to be paid back.\n  Finally, these aren't really tax cuts. Tax cuts are when you lower \ntaxes and lower expenditures or raise other taxes so it is revenue \nneutral. If you cut taxes in a time of deficit, which means you have to \nsimply borrow the difference of what the revenues would have been, that \nis not a tax cut. That is a tax shift.\n  We are simply shifting the taxes from ourselves to our children. This \nbill should be called the ``tax your grandchildren act'' because we are \ncutting our own taxes, but we are borrowing the money that otherwise \nwould be collected and our kids are going to have to pay it back at \nsome point with interest.\n  That is unethical. That isn't right. If 5-year-olds knew what was \ngoing on and could vote, we would be dead ducks, because that is who is \nbearing the burden of these policies.\n  What do we have to do to solve this? In some ways, it is simple and \nin other ways it is hard. Conceptually it is simple. We have to bring \nexpenditures and revenues into balance. That means looking at the whole \ncourse of Federal revenues and also Federal investments, and we also \nhave to make investments to make our economy grow.\n  The best solution to this deficit problem is a growing economy. But \nultimately for me, this is an issue of ethical stewardship. Tom Brokaw \nwrote the famous book ``The Greatest Generation.'' They fought World \nWar II, sacrificed, built the Interstate Highway System, and built the \neconomy that we are running on today--the greatest generation.\n  I shudder to think what would be the case if Tom Brokaw wrote a book \nabout our generation, which is borrowing and is not keeping our \ninfrastructure up, is not adequately providing for the common defense, \nand is shifting the cost from us to our children. That is not \nstewardship; that is intergenerational theft. That is what we are \nengaged in here.\n  We are going to have one vote tomorrow. I intend to vote for the bill \nbecause I believe in the budget section, but I am very uncomfortable \nwith the tax extender section. I don't have policy problems with many \nof those tax extenders. I do have a fundamental problem if they are not \npaid for. I don't think it is honest for us to go home and say that we \ncut your taxes when our grandchildren are going to have to pay those \nbills with interest.\n  That is the point that I think needs to be made about this, not that \nwe are going to be able to stop this train that is going to be coming \nthrough here in the next 24 hours, but that we really need to talk next \nyear about serious tax reform, about trying to balance revenues and \nexpenditures and putting this country on a financial path, on a fiscal \npath that is sustainable and responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, my colleague and dear friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, has worked extensively on trying to reform \nour Tax Code. We had something called the Simpson-Bowles Commission, \nwhich I think he took the lead on and was very much instrumental. What \ndoes this do to give you the chance to basically fix the problems we \nhave with the Tax Code?\n  Mr. WARNER. It decreases our revenue line going forward. It does take \nsome of the things, particularly in international tax reform, off the \ntable. There are arguments that some of these being made permanent may \nmake it easier. I will give you an example. The R tax credit is \nsomething that most of us on both sides of the aisle support. Here is \nthe kind of only-in-Washington math that takes place. We are making \npermanent the R tax credit and not paying for it. Yet, if next year \nwe decided to cut back on the R tax credit, that would be viewed as \nadditional revenue to the bottom line, even though the cost of it has \nnever been built in. Again, people who maybe are watching might say: I \ndon't understand that accounting.\n  Let me assure you: If you questioning that accounting, then welcome \nto Washington, DC, and Federal Government accounting and budget lines.\n  I think this will make it more challenging. There are some benefits, \nas I said earlier--predictability to our business community. I would \necho what the Senator from Maine has said. At the end of the day, we \nare simply transferring the obligations from our responsibility to that \nof our kids and grandkids. Long term, that is not going to give them \nthe same kind of country that we all inherited.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. As we finish up on the colloquy here, the House is going \nto vote twice. They are going to vote on the extenders bill and the \nomnibus bill. For the second time, we are going to roll them into one \nin the Senate. We will not have the opportunity to vote twice. The \nomnibus bill is something that I could have supported. The extenders \nbill is absolutely something I cannot support, for the future of our \ncountry and our children. It is a shame that we don't have a separate \nvote.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Maine and the Senator from \nVirginia for this colloquy.\n  With that, we yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate in morning business and take as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8742-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8742-S8747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRESIDENTIAL STRATEGY TO DEFEAT ISIL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, 70 years ago, a group of American \nleaders forged the rules-based international\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\norder out of the ashes of World War II. Those who were there recall \nthat they were ``present at the creation.'' We may well look back at \n2015 and realize we were present at the unravelling. We were present at \nthe unravelling.\n  At the beginning of this year, President Obama was still committed to \ndegrading and ultimately destroying ISIL. He had warned: If left \nunchecked, ISIL could pose a growing threat beyond the Middle East, \nincluding to the United States. In 2015, that is exactly what happened \nin Paris and San Bernardino, and it will not be the last. I promise my \ncolleagues that under this administration, with the present policy and \nlack of strategy, there will be other attacks on the United States of \nAmerica. I deeply regret having to say that, but I owe it to my \nconstituents and Americans whom I know and respect to tell them the \ntruth.\n\n  More than 1 year into the campaign against ISIL, it is impossible to \nassert that ISIL is losing and that we are winning. And if you are not \nwinning in this kind of warfare, you are losing. Stalemate is not \nsuccess.\n  We asked the witnesses before the Senate Armed Services Committee the \nfollowing question: Is ISIS contained? It is not. ISIS is not \ncontained, contrary to the statements--bizarrely--made by the President \nof the United States literally hours before the attack on San \nBernardino.\n  This year our Senate Armed Services Committee held several hearings \nspecifically focused on the threat of ISIL, including three hearings \nspecifically with Secretary of Defense Ash Carter. We heard about nine \nlines of effort. We heard about three ``arrrghs.'' We never heard a \nplausible theory of success, nor a strategy to achieve success. What do \nI mean by that? There is no time line on when Mosul, the second largest \ncity in Iraq, will be taken. There is no strategy to take Raqqa. Raqqa \nis the base of the caliphate. Raqqa is the place where the attacks are \nbeing planned and orchestrated. We have news reports that they are \ndeveloping chemical weapons in Raqqa. This is the first time that a \nterrorist organization has had a base, a caliphate, from which to \noperate. What has happened? They are expanding globally.\n  By the way, they have lost some of their territory on the margin. \nHopefully, one of these days, Ramadi will fall to our forces, even \nthough there have only been a few hundred ISIL there for the last few \nweeks.\n  The fact is that ISIL has expanded its control in Syria; it continues \nto dominate Sunni Arab areas in both Iraq and Syria; it maintains \ncontrol of key cities such as Mosul, Fallujah, and Ramadi; and efforts \nto retake these territories have stalled, at least to some degree.\n  Meanwhile, ISIL is expanding globally. On Tuesday, GEN John Campbell, \ncommander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, told the Associated \nPress that ISIL is seeking to establish a regional base in eastern \nAfghanistan as it attracts more followers and foreign fighters.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article detailing \nthe AP interview titled ``U.S. general says the number of Afghan IS \nloyalists growing,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From The Associated Press, Dec. 15, 2015]\n\n      U.S. General Says the Number of Afghan IS Loyalists Growing\n\n                          (By Lynne O'Donnell)\n\n       Kabul, Afghanistan.--Supporters of the Islamic State group \n     in Afghanistan are attempting to establish a regional base in \n     the eastern city of Jalalabad, the commander of U.S. and NATO \n     forces in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, said on \n     Tuesday.\n       In an interview with The Associated Press, Campbell said \n     that ``foreign fighters'' from Syria and Iraq had joined \n     Afghans who had declared loyalty to the group in the eastern \n     province of Nangarhar, bordering Pakistan.\n       He said there were also ``indications'' that the IS \n     supporters in Nangarhar were trying to consolidate links with \n     the group's leadership in Syria and Iraq.\n       The Islamic State group controls about a third of Iraq and \n     Syria. Fighters loyal to the group in Afghanistan include \n     disaffected Afghan and Pakistani Taliban who have fought \n     fierce battles with the Taliban in recent months.\n       Afghan officials have said that IS supporters control a \n     number of border districts in Nangarhar and have a presence \n     in some other southern provinces, including Zabul and Ghazni.\n       Until now, however, it was unclear whether loyalists in \n     Afghanistan had institutional links to the group's \n     leadership.\n       Many of those who had declared allegiance to IS were \n     ``disenfranchised Taliban'' from both sides of the border, \n     Campbell said. But, he added, ``they've been reaching out. \n     I'm sure there are folks who have come from Syria and Iraq--I \n     couldn't tell you how many but there are indications of some \n     foreign fighters coming in there.\n       ``But they don't have the capability right now to attack \n     Europe, or attack the homeland, the United States. But that's \n     what they want to do, they've said that's what they want to \n     do,'' he said.\n       During the summer months, Taliban and IS loyalists fought \n     fierce battles in the far eastern districts of Nangarhar, \n     with residents reporting a range of atrocities, including \n     arbitrary imprisonment, forced marriages for young women, and \n     beheadings.\n       The IS loyalists have said they want to absorb Afghanistan \n     into a larger province of its ``caliphate'' called Khorasan. \n     Campbell said the group wants to establish a base in \n     Nangarhar's provincial capital, Jalalabad ``as the base of \n     the Khorasan province'' and ``work their way up into Kunar'' \n     province immediately north.\n       The first credible reports of an IS presence in Afghanistan \n     emerged earlier this year in northern Helmand, though \n     recruiters believed to have had links to the leadership in \n     Syria were killed by U.S. drone strikes in February.\n       The presence in Nangarhar became clear in the summer, when \n     IS loyalists launched battles against the Taliban in the \n     border regions. For months, the Afghan forces--occupied with \n     fighting elsewhere--had let the two groups fight each other, \n     Campbell said. ``If the Taliban and ISIL want to kill each \n     other, let them do it,'' he said, using an alternative \n     acronym for the Islamic State group.\n       He said that control of the four districts--Achin, Nazyan, \n     Bati Kot and Spin Gar--had seesawed between the two groups.\n       The revelation in July that the Taliban's founder and \n     leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar had been dead for more than two \n     years has led to deep fissures in the leadership, and \n     infighting between rival Taliban factions that Campbell said \n     had left hundreds dead.\n       Campbell, who took control of U.S. and NATO forces in \n     Afghanistan in mid-2014, said splits among the Taliban, who \n     have been trying to overthrow the Afghan government since \n     their regime was driven from power in 2001 by the U.S. \n     invasion, could make the fight even harder in 2016.\n       ``The prize really is Kandahar, that's their strategic \n     goal,'' he said, referring to the southern province from \n     where the Taliban emerged after Afghanistan's vicious civil \n     war ended in 1996.\n       Neighboring Helmand province, where most of the world's \n     opium is produced, is currently the scene of fierce battles \n     for control of strategically important districts, including \n     Marjah.\n       Taliban fighters took control of the northern city of \n     Kunduz in September, for just three days before the Afghan \n     military, backed by U.S. forces, pushed them out.\n       Campbell said he did not believe the Taliban had planned to \n     hold or govern Kunduz, but the psychological impact of the \n     city's fall had been enormous. Jalalabad, he said, ``is not \n     going to fall.''\n       Afghan forces, ``challenged in many areas, understand the \n     impact of Kunduz,'' he said. ``I think they will make the \n     right adjustments so that it (Jalalabad) doesn't become \n     another Kunduz.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. It says: ``Supporters of the Islamic State group in \nAfghanistan are attempting to establish a regional base in the eastern \ncity of Jalalabad, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces in \nAfghanistan, General John Campbell, said on Tuesday.''\n  The Wall Street Journal reports that ISIL has expanded in Libya and \nestablished a new base close to Europe, where it can generate oil \nrevenues and plot terror attacks.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle entitled ``Islamic State Tightens Grip on Libyan Stronghold of \nSirte''--the hometown, by the way of Muammar Qadhafi--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 29, 2015]\n\n       Islamic State Tightens Grip on Libyan Stronghold of Sirte\n\n               (By Tamer El-Ghobashy and Hassan Morajea)\n\n       Misrata, Libya.--Even as foreign powers step up pressure \n     against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, the militant group \n     has expanded in Libya and established a new base close to \n     Europe where it can generate oil revenue and plot terror \n     attacks.\n       Since announcing its presence in February in Sirte, the \n     city on Libya's Mediterranean coast has become the first that \n     the militant group governs outside of Syria and Iraq. Its \n     presence there has grown over the past year from 200 eager \n     fighters to a roughly 5,000-strong contingent which includes \n     administrators and financiers, according to estimates by \n     Libyan intelligence officials, residents and activists in the \n     area.\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\n       The group has exploited the deep divisions in Libya, which \n     has two rival governments, to create this new stronghold of \n     violent religious extremism just across the Mediterranean Sea \n     from Italy. Along the way, they scored a string of \n     victories--defeating one of the strongest fighting forces in \n     the country and swiftly crushing a local popular revolt.\n       Libya's neighbors have become increasingly alarmed.\n       Tunisia closed its border with Libya for 15 days on \n     Wednesday, the day after Islamic State claimed responsibility \n     for a suicide bombing on a bus in the capital Tunis that \n     killed 12 presidential guards.\n       Tunisia is also building a security wall along a third of \n     that border to stem the flow of extremists between the \n     countries. Two previous attacks in Tunisia this year that \n     killed dozens of tourists were carried out by gunmen the \n     government said were trained by Islamic State in Libya, which \n     has recruited hundreds of Tunisians to its ranks.\n       This burgeoning operation in Libya shows how Islamic State \n     is able to grow and adapt even as it is targeted by Russian, \n     French and U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria as well as Kurdish \n     and Iraqi ground assaults in Iraq.\n       On Thursday, nearly two weeks after Islamic State's attacks \n     on Paris, French President Francois Hollande and Italian \n     Prime Minister Matteo Renzi met in the French capital where \n     both said Europe must turn its attention to the militants' \n     rise in Libya. Mr. Renzi said Libya risks becoming the ``next \n     emergency'' if it is not given priority.\n       In Libya, Islamic State has fended off challenges from \n     government-aligned militias and called for recruits who have \n     the technical know-how to put nearby oil facilities into \n     operation. Libyan officials said they are worried it is only \n     a matter of time before the radical fighters attempt to take \n     over more oil fields and refineries near Sirte to boost their \n     revenues--money that could fund attacks in the Middle East \n     and Europe.\n       Sirte is a gateway to several major oil fields and \n     refineries farther east on the same coast and Islamic State \n     has targeted those installations in the past year.\n       ``They have made their intentions clear,'' said Ismail \n     Shoukry, head of military intelligence for the region that \n     includes Sirte. ``They want to take their fight to Rome.''\n       Islamic State is benefiting from a conflict that has \n     further weakened government control in Libya. For nearly a \n     year, the U.S. and European powers have pointed to the \n     Islamic State threat to press the rival governments to come \n     to a power-sharing agreement. Despite a United Nations-\n     brokered draft agreement for peace announced in October, \n     neither side has taken steps to implement it.\n       A new U.N. envoy, Martin Kobler, was appointed this month \n     to break the stalemate, part of efforts to find a political \n     solution to counter the extremists' expansion.\n       ``We don't have a real state. We have a fragmented \n     government,'' said Fathi Ali Bashaagha, a politician from the \n     city of Misrata who participated in the U.N.-led \n     negotiations. ``Every day we delay on a political deal, it is \n     a golden opportunity for Islamic State to grow.''\n       Since early 2014, two rival factions have ruled Libya, \n     effectively dividing the country. In the east, an \n     internationally recognized government based in the town of \n     Tobruk has won the backing of regional powers Egypt and the \n     United Arab Emirates. In the west, an Islamist-leaning \n     government based in Tripoli has relied on Misrata fighting \n     forces for political legitimacy.\n       Islamic State militants have successfully taken on and \n     defeated myriad Libyan armed factions, including the powerful \n     militias from Misrata which were the driving force behind the \n     revolt that unseated longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in \n     2011. Misrata, 150 miles west of Sirte, has recently come \n     under sporadic Islamic State attacks.\n       Members of Misrata's militias, who are loosely under the \n     control of the western government in Tripoli, say they lack \n     the support to mount an offensive against Islamic State. \n     Earlier this month, the Tripoli government forced the Misrata \n     militias into a humiliating prisoner swap with Islamic State.\n       ``There will be no meaningful action without a political \n     agreement,'' said Abdullah al-Najjar, a field commander with \n     the Brigade 166, an elite Misrata militia that engaged in a \n     protracted fight with Islamic State on the outskirts of Sirte \n     earlier this year. ``You have to know you're going to war \n     with a government that is going to back you.''\n       This month, the U.S. launched an airstrike against Islamic \n     State in Libya, its first against the group outside of Syria \n     and Iraq. Officials said they believe the strike killed one \n     of the top deputies of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-\n     Baghdadi. The deputy, Abu Nabil al-Anbari, had been sent to \n     Libya last year to establish the group's presence there.\n       In recent weeks, a flood of foreign recruits and their \n     families have arrived in Sirte--another indication the group \n     is becoming increasingly comfortable in its North African \n     base, according to residents and activists from Sirte and \n     Libyan military officials.\n       Islamic State has called on recruits to travel to Libya \n     instead of trying to enter Syria, while commanders have \n     repatriated Libyan fighters from Syria and Iraq, Libyan \n     intelligence officials said.\n       ``Sirte will be no less than Raqqa,'' is a mantra often \n     repeated by Islamic State leaders in the Libyan city during \n     sermons and radio broadcasts, several residents and an \n     activist from the city said. Raqqa is the group's self-\n     declared capital in Syria.\n       Like its mother organization in Syria, Islamic State has \n     appointed foreign ``emirs'' in Sirte to administer its brutal \n     brand of social control. Music, smoking and cellphone \n     networks have been banned while women are only allowed to \n     walk the streets in full cover. Morality police patrol in \n     vehicles marked with Islamic State's logo and courts \n     administering Islamic law, or Shariah, as well as prisons \n     have been set up.\n       With a population of about 700,000, Sirte was long known \n     for being Gadhafi's hometown and a stronghold of his \n     supporters.\n       Soon after Libya's uprising ended more than four decades of \n     Gadhafi's rule, he was killed in Sirte by fighters from \n     Misrata.\n       Earlier this month, Islamic State reopened schools in the \n     city, segregating students by gender and strictly enforcing \n     an Islamic State approved curriculum. On Fridays, the \n     traditional day of communal prayer, the group organizes \n     public lectures and residents are often herded into public \n     squares to witness executions and lashings of those who run \n     afoul of the strict rules.\n       The seeds of Islamic State's growth in Libya were planted \n     after Gadhafi's ouster. In the almost exclusively Sunni \n     Muslim Libya, the Sunni extremist group exploited tribal and \n     political rifts that lingered after the strongman's death, \n     particularly around Sirte.\n       Islamic State lured extremists from other groups under the \n     Islamic State umbrella.\n       By June, Brigade 166, one of western Libya's strongest \n     armed brigades, abandoned a months long battle with the \n     militants on Sirte's outskirts. In August, Islamic State \n     cemented their grip on the city, bringing the last holdout \n     district under their control, officials and residents said.\n       Islamic State crushed an armed uprising in August in three \n     days. It was sparked by local residents angered over the \n     group's killing of a young cleric who opposed the radicals. \n     Militants publicly crucified several people who participated \n     in the revolt and confiscated homes.\n       The brutality moved the internationally recognized \n     government in eastern Libya to plead for military \n     intervention by Arab nations and a lifting of a U.N. arms \n     embargo on Libya in effect since 2011. But the support never \n     came.\n       Unlike in Syria, the group has struggled to provide basic \n     services. Gas stations are dry and residents are expected to \n     smuggle in their own fuel--as long as it is not confiscated \n     by Islamic State.\n       Hospitals have been abandoned after Islamic State ordered \n     male and female staffers be segregated. The ill must travel \n     miles to other cities for treatment, a trip that is often \n     accompanied by difficult questioning and searches at Islamic \n     State checkpoints.\n       ``No services, just punishment,'' said Omar, a 33-year-old \n     civil engineer who fled Sirte after taking part in the failed \n     uprising against Islamic State. ``Sirte has gone dark.''\n       Despite the challenges, Islamic State has big plans for \n     Sirte. A recent edition of their propaganda magazine, Dabiq, \n     featured an interview with Abu Mughirah al-Qahtani, who was \n     described as ``the delegated leader'' for Islamic State in \n     Libya. He vowed to use Libya's geographic position--and its \n     oil reserves--to disrupt Europe's security and economy.\n       About 85% of Libya's crude oil production in 2014 went to \n     Europe, with Italy being the largest recipient. About half \n     its natural gas production is exported to Italy.\n       ``The control of Islamic State over this region will lead \n     to economic breakdowns,'' the leader of the Libyan operation \n     said, ``especially for Italy and the rest of the European \n     states.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. It states: ``Even as foreign powers step up pressure \nagainst Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, the militant group has \nexpanded in Libya and established a new base close to Europe where it \ncan generate oil revenue and plot terror attacks.''\n  Libya is an oil-rich country--a very oil-rich country. If you let \nISIS get control of Libya, my friends, they will have unlimited sources \nof revenue.\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``Its presence there has grown over the past \nyear from 200 eager fighters to a roughly 5,000-strong contingent which \nincludes administrators and financiers, according to estimates by \nLibyan intelligence officials, residents and activists in the area.''\n  By the way, during these debates, I will comment a little bit on it--\nthat those who are against any intervention cite Libya as the case for \nnot going in. Facts are a stubborn thing. The fact is, Muammer Qadhafi \nwas at the gates of Benghazi and was going to slaughter thousands of \npeople. We brought about his downfall and walked away. If we had walked \naway from Japan and Germany after World War II, it would have \ncollapsed. If we had walked away from Korea, where we still have 38,000 \ntroops, it would have collapsed. If we had walked away from Bosnia, it \nwould have collapsed.\n  I am telling you, my colleagues, we walked away. This President and \nthis administration did not do the things necessary after the fall of \nQadhafi to\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\nbuild a democracy, and the people of Libya wanted it, and I can tell \nyou that for sure because I was there. One of the great tragedies of \nthe 21st century is our failure to act in a way to help the Libyan \npeople transition from all of those years of being under a brutal \nleader.\n  By the way, he was also responsible for the deaths of Americans in a \nbar in Berlin and an airliner being shot down. Yet we should have left \nhim in power? Sure we should have.\n  ISIL is operating in Lebanon, Yemen, and Egypt, and other radical \nIslamic groups, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria and al-Shabaab in \nSomolia, have pledged allegiance to ISIL. This appearance of success \nonly enhances ISIL's ability to radicalize, recruit, and grow.\n  There has been some progress. I was recently in Iraq, and the \noperation to retake Sinjar was important. Iraqi forces, as I mentioned, \nhave closed in on Ramadi for weeks. They haven't finished the job. Our \ncounterterrorism operations are taking a lot of ISIL fighters off the \nbattlefield in Iraq and Syria. All of this represents tactical \nprogress, and it is a testament to our civilian and military leaders, \nwho are outstanding, as well as thousands of U.S. troops helping to \ntake the fight to ISIL every day. I would like to point out that \nsignificant challenges remain.\n  As a direct result of President Obama's decision to withdraw all U.S. \nforces from Iraq and squander hard-won American influence, the Iraqi \nGovernment is weak and beholden to Iran. I tell my colleagues, have no \ndoubt what the dominant influence in Iraq is today: It is the Iranians. \nThere was no more vivid example of this than when it was reported that \nIraqi Prime Minister al-Abadi turned down Secretary of Defense Ash \nCarter's offer of new military assistance, including the use of Apache \nhelicopters and Special Operations forces to help recapture Ramadi.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article titled \n``Iraq Declines Offer of U.S. Helicopters for Fight Against ISIS, \nPentagon Chief Says'' from the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 16, 2015]\n\n       Iraq Declines Offer of U.S. Helicopters for Fight Against \n     ISIS, Pentagon Chief Says\n\n                         (By Michael R. Gordon)\n\n       Baghdad.--Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq declined \n     to take up the Pentagon on its recent offer to speed up the \n     fight against Islamic State fighters in Ramadi with the help \n     of American attack helicopters, officials said on Wednesday.\n       ``The prime minister did not make any specific requests in \n     connection with helicopters,'' Defense Secretary Ashton B. \n     Carter told reporters after he met with the Iraqi leader \n     here.\n       Mr. Carter made it clear that Mr. Abadi had not ruled out \n     the use of the Apache helicopters in future operations, which \n     are expected to be especially challenging as Iraqi forces \n     look toward the battle for Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, \n     which was captured in June 2014 by the Islamic State, also \n     known as ISIS or ISIL.\n       Mr. Carter also insisted that neither Lt. Gen. Sean B. \n     MacFarland, the American military commander who is leading \n     the campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, nor \n     the Iraqi prime minister believed that the Apaches were \n     needed ``right now'' to win back Ramadi, the capital of \n     Iraq's Anbar Province, which is the site of protracted \n     fighting between Islamic State militants and Iraqi ground \n     troops.\n       But Mr. Carter told Congress just a week ago that the \n     United States had offered to have American-piloted Apaches \n     fight with Iraqi forces as the Iraqi Army sought to complete \n     its capture of the city. The United States, he noted, has \n     also offered to deploy American advisers with Iraqi brigades \n     on the battlefield instead of restricting them to bases \n     inside Iraq, another proposal the Iraqis have yet to accept.\n       ``The United States is prepared to assist the Iraqi Army \n     with additional unique capabilities to help them finish the \n     job, including attack helicopters and accompanying advisers, \n     if circumstances dictate and if requested by Prime Minister \n     Abadi,'' Mr. Carter told the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n       The meeting between the American defense secretary and the \n     Iraqi prime minister underscored two factors shaping the \n     American-led campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq: the \n     Obama administration's reluctance to significantly expand the \n     role of American troops in Iraq, and the reluctance of Iraq's \n     Shiite-dominated government to accept highly visible forms of \n     American military support in the face of pressure from hard-\n     line Shiite politicians and the Iranians.\n       It also raised questions about the Obama administration's \n     plans to intensify its campaign against the Islamic State \n     militants. In recent weeks, the Pentagon has spoken of the \n     ``accelerants'' it is planning to introduce to hasten the \n     demise of the Islamic State. The Iraqi government, however, \n     has yet to embrace two of the important ``accelerants''--the \n     Apaches and the deployment of American advisers in the field.\n       Mr. Carter disclosed the Apache offer to American lawmakers \n     after it had been conveyed privately to Mr. Abadi. Iraqi \n     officials said the public nature of Mr. Carter's statements, \n     which appear intended to reassure Congress that the Obama \n     administration was stepping up its efforts against the \n     Islamic State, put the prime minister, who has already been \n     weakened by a series of bruising struggles with his political \n     rivals, in a difficult spot.\n       ``This is a very complex environment,'' General MacFarland \n     said, somewhat philosophically. ``It is kind of hard to \n     inflict support on somebody.''\n       According to United States officials, the Pentagon's offer \n     to support Iraqi forces with American Apaches was more \n     qualified than it first appeared. Military commanders would \n     have the authority to use the attack helicopters if Mr. Abadi \n     agreed to their use and the risks of using them were judged \n     to be acceptable.\n       The deployment of Apaches in riskier situations would \n     require further White House review, even if Mr. Abadi \n     approved, United States officials added.\n       American officials also said it would take weeks to deploy \n     the advisers who would accompany Iraqi brigades on the \n     battlefield even if Mr. Abadi were to agree to their \n     presence.\n       One important measure has been accepted in principle by Mr. \n     Abadi: a new American special operations task force, which is \n     to number fewer than 100. Seeking to reassure the prime \n     minister, Mr. Carter said the task force's operations would \n     require the approval of the Iraqi authorities. He suggested \n     that some of its missions would take place near the Iraqi \n     border with Syria, where they would receive less attention \n     than those carried out near the Iraqi capital.\n       ``Everything we do, of course, is subject to the approval \n     of the sovereign Iraqi government,'' Mr. Carter said at the \n     start of his meeting with Mr. Abadi, which also included \n     Khaled al-Obeidi, Iraq's defense minister, and Lt. Gen. Taleb \n     Shegati al-Kenani, who heads Iraq's counterterrorism service.\n       ``Our progress in Ramadi is a huge progress and added to it \n     the progress in Baiji,'' Mr. Abadi said in English, referring \n     to a town that is the site of a strategic oil refinery in \n     northern Iraq.\n       American military officials have painted a generally \n     positive picture of the Iraqi military's push to take Ramadi, \n     but Iraqi troops were involved in pitched fighting on Tuesday \n     as Islamic fighters counterattacked.\n       The city, which is believed to be occupied by several \n     hundred militants, has been surrounded by about 10,000 Iraqi \n     troops. Tens of thousands of civilians are believed to be \n     trapped in the town, and Islamic fighters have shot at some \n     who have tried to flee, according to American officials.\n       In their Tuesday counterattack, Islamic State militants \n     took a bridge northwest of the city that spans the Euphrates, \n     which the Iraqi Army had previously occupied. At the same \n     time, militants sent several car bombs and a small group of \n     fighters to attack the Anbar Operations Center, the Iraqi \n     command that is overseeing the Ramadi campaign from north of \n     the city.\n       Both attacks were beaten back as American airstrikes \n     enabled the Iraqi military to retake the bridge. Two Iraqi \n     soldiers were killed as were several dozen Islamic State \n     fighters, American officials said. By the end of Tuesday, \n     both sides were back where they had started. It was unclear \n     when Iraqi troops might break through the Islamic State's \n     belts of improvised explosive devices and other defenses and \n     push into the heart of the city.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I met with Prime Minister al-Abadi in Iraq. He is a good \nman. He knows he needs this help, but because of the dominating \ninfluence of Iran and Shia militias in Iraq, he turned it down anyway.\n  General McFarland, one of the greatest generals I have met--he is up \nthere in the category of David Petraeus--is leading the fight against \nISIL. He reacted with a very interesting comment. He said: ``This is a \nvery complex environment. It is kind of hard to inflict support on \nsomebody.'' What General McFarland is saying is that because of the \nIranian dominant influence, the Iraqis, as a body, are reluctant to \naccept the help they need to retake the second largest city in Iraq. \nThe second largest city in Iraq, Mosul, is under ISIS control, and he \nknows full well that Apache helicopters and Special Operations forces \ncould help him do that. But who is telling him not to? The Iranians.\n  When I was there, we met with the Prime Minister of Iraq, Mr. al-\nAbadi, and he said: If you Americans come and you lose one pilot or one \nplane, you will leave. That was the opinion of the Prime Minister of \nIraq, and one of the\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nreasons--along with the Iranian influence--is because there is no trust \nor confidence of the United States in Iraq or in the region.\n  It comes as no surprise that the training of Iraqi security forces \nhas been slow. The building of support for the Sunni tribal forces has \nbeen even slower. ISIL captured Mosul in June of 2014, and at the end \nof 2015, ISIL still controls the second largest city in Iraq. How do \nyou think the families of those brave Americans who have sacrificed \nthemselves and those individuals who are still at Walter Reed feel \nafter the sacrifices they made and the victories they won? Now, of \ncourse, we see all of that is gone--just a glimmering--thanks to the \nPresident of the United States withdrawing all of our troops in the \nmistaken belief that if you pull out of wars, wars end. They don't end. \nIt is hard to talk to the Gold Star Mothers.\n  Meanwhile, the Financial Times reports that ISIL is still making $1.5 \nmillion a day in oil sales. Worse, Reuters reports that ISIL has made \nmore than $500 million trading oil, with significant volumes sold to--\nguess who. Guess who ISIL is selling oil to. The government of Syrian \nPresident Bashar al-Assad. It is hard to make some of this stuff up, \nand it gets a little complicated.\n  We are now making nice--and I will talk a little bit more about it \nlater--with Bashar al-Assad and their stewards, the Russians and the \nIranians. Meanwhile, Bashar al-Assad is buying oil from--at least $1.5 \nmillion a day--from ISIL.\n  Even as an Oval Office speech and a Pentagon photo op failed to \nreassure the American people, this administration has doubled down on \nits indecisive approach to ISIL, using limited means and indirect ways \nto achieve aspirational ends on a nonexistent timeline. The \nadministration now admits we are at war with ISIL--wonderful--but \nproceeds at every turn to minimize any American role in fighting and \nwinning that war. America has never waged anything we have called to \nwar and then so profoundly limited our role in the hope that some other \nforce will emerge to win it for us. The administration says we cannot \n``Americanize'' the conflict.\n  I also want to point out that the President has a unique and really \ndishonest approach to those of us who have said for a long time that we \nhave to have more involvement and predicted what would happen. \nUnfortunately, we have been wrong by saying, yes, the ``popoffs''--as \nhe called us in a speech from the Philippines--want to send hundreds of \nthousands of troops. That is a total falsehood. I will repeat again \nwhat we have been asking for for years, and that is another 5,000 or so \nAmericans on the ground in Iraq and a multinational force led by the \nSunni Arab countries with European participation--I would hope that \npeople like the French would join in a--about 10,000 of 100,000-person \nforce to go to Raqqa and take them out. As long as Raqqa exists, they \nwill be able to export this evil throughout the world, including to the \nUnited States of America. There is no plan by this administration to \nretake Raqqa. There is no strategy, and that is, indeed, shameful.\n  The war against ISIL was Americanized when ISIL inspired terrorists \nwho murdered 14 Americans on our own soil in San Bernardino. This \nattack should be a wake-up call and we need a strategy, as I mentioned. \nIn Syria, there is no plausible strategy to achieve this goal on \nanywhere near an acceptable time line. We were briefed that it would be \na year before they retake Mosul. There is no time limit on how they \ncould even approach regaining Raqqa. There is no ground force that is \nboth willing and able to retake Raqqa, nor is there a realistic \nprospect of one emerging anytime soon. The Syrian Kurds could take \nRaqqa but won't, and the Syrian Sunni Arabs want to but can't, partly \ndue to our failure to support them.\n  Meanwhile, the administration has continued its inaction and \nindifference and has allowed Bashar al-Assad to slaughter a quarter of \na million people. Have no doubt who is responsible for these millions \nof refugees; his name is Bashar al-Assad, the godfather of ISIS. He is \nthe one who has barrel-bombed thousands and thousands of his people. \nBashar al-Assad used poison gas and crossed the redline, we might \nrecall. It is Bashar al-Assad who continues the butcher of his own \npeople.\n  I will get to what Secretary Kerry has had to say in a minute.\n  The administration continues its policy of inaction and indifference. \nIt has allowed Vladimir Putin to intervene militarily and protect this \nmurderous regime.\n  My friends, the last time the Russians had influence in the region \nwas when Anwar Sadat threw them out in 1973. Now they are back. Now \nthey are major players in the Middle East. This is the headline from \nthe Associated Press yesterday: ``Russian Airstrikes Restore Syrian \nMilitary Balance of Power.'' The airstrikes of the Russians have taken \nout significant capabilities of the moderate resistance--not ISIS but \nthe moderates whom we had trained and equipped and we refused to \nprotect.\n  I quote from the Associated Press story, ``Russian Air Strikes \nRestore Syrian Military Balance of Power.''\n\n       Weeks of Russian airstrikes in Syria appear to have \n     restored enough momentum to the government side to convince \n     President Bashar Assad's foes and the world community that \n     even if he doesn't win the war he cannot quickly be removed \n     by force. That realization combined with the growing sense \n     that the world's No. 1 priority is the destruction of the \n     Islamic State group, has led many to acknowledge that however \n     unpalatable his conduct of the war, Assad will have to be \n     tolerated for at least sometime further.\n\n  Let's get this straight. Assad will be tolerated to continue to \nbarrel bomb and slaughter innocent people. ``However unpalatable his \nconduct of the war. . . . '' This kind of Orwellian understatement not \nonly obscures the truth, but it cripples the conscience. My friends, it \ncripples the conscience.\n  Bashar Assad's conduct of the war, the barrel bombs, chemical \nweapons, slaughtering women and children, not only killed one-quarter \nof a million people, it is what gave rise to ISIL to start with, and it \nis what fuels them still.\n  Secretary Kerry seems not to understand that fact. While in Moscow \nsearching for ``common ground'' with Russia on Syria and Ukraine, \nSecretary Kerry said--and I am not making this up; I am telling my \ncolleagues, I am not making this up--``Russia has been a significant \ncontributor to the progress'' the world has made on Syria.\n  Was Russia making progress when it bombed U.S.-backed Syrian forces \nfighting the Assad regime or was that when it took a brief pause from \nbombing Syrian moderates to indiscriminately drop dumb bombs in ISIL's \nterritory in eastern Syria, killing untold numbers of civilians? Is \nthat the Russian ``significant'' contributions?\n  Secretary Kerry then said: ``The United States and our partners are \nnot seeking so-called regime change.'' The focus now is ``not on our \ndifferences about what can or cannot be done immediately about \nAssad''--i.e., Dear Mr. Assad, here is a blank check. Here is your \ncard. Do whatever you want to. Do whatever you want to. Continue your \nbarrel bombing, continue your torture, and continue the war crimes that \nyou have committed. You have only killed 250,000 of your own people. \nDrive some more into exile and murder more.\n  At the beginning of this year, this administration still believed \nthat Assad must go, but now, as one official said, ``the meaning of \n`Assad has to go' has evolved.''\n  I repeat, the administration official said ``the meaning of `Assad \nhas to go' has evolved.'' This kind of Orwellian double-speak has \nbecome all too common in the administration and is exactly why our \nallies and partners around the world are losing confidence in American \nleadership.\n  A very seminal event happened the day before yesterday, my friends, \nthat will be the best indicator of what I am saying. Thirty-four Muslim \nnations formed an alliance to fight terrorism; i.e., ISIL, and the \nUnited States of America didn't even know about it. They didn't even \ntell the United States of America that they were forming their own \norganization with their own strategy, their own tactics, to fight \nagainst ISIS? My friends, that is an incredible statement about the \ntotal loss of American influence and prestige in the region.\n  I have had more than one leader in the Middle East tell me: \n``Sometimes we think that it is better to be America's enemy than its \nfriend.''\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\n  So why has the meaning of ``Assad has to go'' evolved? Because this \nadministration was overpowered, outplayed, and outmatched. This \nadministration consoled themselves with the mantra of ``there is no \nmilitary solution'' rather than facing the reality that there is a \nclear military dimension to a political solution in Syria. That is what \nRussia and Iran have demonstrated. They have changed the military \nfaction on the ground and created the terms for a political settlement \nmuch more favorable to their interests. I believe as a result the \nconflict will grind on, ISIS will grow stronger, and the refugees will \nkeep coming.\n  Unfortunately, America's troubles in 2015 were not contained in Iraq \nand Syria. Despite conditions on the ground, President Obama elected to \nwithdraw roughly half of the U.S. forces from Afghanistan by the end of \nnext year.\n  Do you know the President of the United States, even when he \nannounces a buildup, announces a withdrawal. So he sends the message to \nany potential enemy or any enemy we are engaged with: We are going to \nbuild up now, but don't worry, we are going to pull out. We will \nwithdraw.\n  So what happens? Here we are. The Pentagon says violence is on the \nrise in Afghanistan. The AP report says ``Violence in Afghanistan is on \nthe rise, according to a new Pentagon report to Congress that says the \nTaliban was emboldened by the reduced U.S. military role and can be \nexpected to build momentum from their 2015 attack strategy.''\n  It is inevitable, I say to my colleagues, there will be greater \nviolence in Afghanistan, an increase in Taliban activity, and--I am \nsorry to say--ISIS, who is already establishing a foothold there, will \nincrease their presence. Meanwhile, the Iranians, in their attempt at \nhegemony, will provide weapons to the Taliban.\n  This Senator will save the rest of my comments about what is going on \nwith the Iran nuclear deal, about what the Iranians have already \nviolated, and what continues with the Russian occupation of Ukraine.\n  Our much respected leader in Europe, General Breedlove, has said that \nhe expects increased military activity by Vladimir Putin in eastern \nUkraine. He still has the ambition of establishing a land bridge all \nthe way across eastern Ukraine to Crimea so he doesn't have to continue \nto supply by air and sea. We seem to have forgotten that over 8,000 \npeople have died since Russia's invasion, including 298 innocent people \naboard Malaysia's Flight 17, murdered by Vladimir Putin's loyal \nsupporters with weapons that were sent to Ukraine by Putin--not to \nmention the murder of Boris Nemtsov, one of the great leaders of the \nopposition, in the shadow of the Kremlin. The destabilization \ncontinues, even in countries as far away as Sweden. I will not go into \nthat because the Defense authorization bill calls for the provision of \ndefensive weapons to Ukraine.\n  One of the more shameful chapters--although they have written more \nshameful chapters--but one that is really shameful is our failure to \nprovide defensive weapons to Ukraine. There are Russian-supplied tanks \nin eastern Ukraine. All of us have seen the pictures of them. They have \nslaughtered many Ukrainians, and we refuse to give the Javelin, the \nmost effective anti-tank weapon we have, to Ukrainians. It is beyond \nshameful.\n  So I will not talk about China, which has reclaimed 400 acres earlier \nand now has reclaimed more than 3,000 acres in the South China Sea, and \nour one foray within the 12-mile limit, the Secretary of Defense failed \nto acknowledge before the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  So, my colleagues, we depart on this holiday season, hopefully sooner \nrather than later, with a world in turmoil, with a world that because \nof a failure of American leadership now poses direct threats, as we \njust found in San Bernardino, to the United States of America.\n  We saw too many dark days in 2015. It didn't have to be this way. It \nis still within our power to choose better courses. We must never be \ndisheartened or resigned to a world where suffering and evil are always \non the ascent. On the contrary, it is in our character as Americans to \nface adversity with hope and optimism. We must see plainly and fully \nthe threats to our values in order to defeat them.\n  As Churchill said, we recover our ``moral health and martial vigor, \nwe rise again and take our stand for freedom.''\n  I have no doubt America can succeed and will succeed.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8747-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8747-S8750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELEASE OF ALAN GROSS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today is an important day for two \nreasons. One, it is a sad day because it was just a few years ago today \nwhen a dear friend, Senator Dan Inouye, died--one of my closest friends \nand former President pro tempore and senior Member of this body.\n  It is also a good day because it marks one year since the release of \nAlan Gross from a Cuban prison where he had spent 5 years. During that \ntime he lost more than 100 pounds, he lost five teeth, his mother died, \nhis mother-in-law died, his brother-in-law died, and he missed his \ndaughter's wedding.\n  I worked for years to help obtain Alan Gross's release and the return \nof the remaining members of the so-called Cuban Five, who had served \nmore than 15 years in U.S. prisons. Scott Gilbert, Alan Gross's lawyer, \ndid an outstanding job, traveling countless times to Cuba. He \nskillfully advocated on Alan's behalf with Cuban and U.S. officials. My \nforeign policy adviser, Tim Rieser, went down several times to boost \nAlan Gross's morale, visiting him in prison and bringing him messages.\n  My larger purpose, like my good friend from Arizona Senator Flake, \nwho has been a real partner in this, was to finally put the Cold War \nbehind us and to start looking forward to a new era.\n  Like Senator Flake and many others, I was convinced that such a step \nwould be widely embraced by the U.S. business community, by religious \ngroups, by academia, the scientific community, the media, and Americans \nacross the political spectrum. I also knew it would be welcomed around \nthe world, including in countries where people believe in democracy and \nhuman rights as strongly as we do.\n  I remember when an ambassador from a South American country came up \nto my wife Marcelle, saying: We have always respected the United States \nbut also we respected Cuba, and your relationship with Cuba was like a \nstone in our shoe. Now, by restoring relations with Cuba, you have \nremoved the stone from our shoe.\n  He, like so many others, recognized that Alan Gross's release ushered \nin a new day in United States-Cuba relations. I will never forget on \nAugust 14, standing there when our flag was raised at the U.S. Embassy \nin Havana, listening to our national anthem played, and I heard Cubans \nstanding just outside the gates of the Embassy cheering when the \nAmerican flag went up. It was a deeply moving experience to be there on \na swelteringly hot day.\n  We had 54 years of a failed, punitive policy that achieved none of \nits objectives. President Obama and President Raul Castro wisely \ndecided it was time to chart a new path.\n  The reaction of the people of the United States and Cuba has been \noverwhelmingly positive. Even some of Cuba's most vocal critics of the \nCastro government have welcomed this new opening.\n  Which brings me back to Alan Gross. He had every reason to be a \nbitter defender of U.S. sanctions, but instead he strongly supported \nthe new policy of engagement. He has never expressed anything but \nwarmth and admiration for the Cuban people.\n  Contrast that with the small handful of Members of Congress who \ncontinue to defend a discredited policy of isolation that has been \nrepudiated by large majorities of their own constituents, denounced by \nevery other government in the hemisphere, and which even they \nacknowledge it has not succeeded. Their answer is to keep it in place, \neven opposing efforts by the State Department to improve security and \nstaffing at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, to which the Cuban Government \nhas agreed.\n\n  I ask that you to look at this photograph of Alan Gross and his wife. \nI took this just minutes after he was told he\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nwas going home. Senator Flake, Congressman Van Hollen, and I were there \nto pick him up. This is not the face of a bitter man. When I took this \npicture, I thought as I pressed the shutter that this is the face of a \nman who knows we can have different days.\n  I am not so naive to think that reestablishing diplomatic relations \nwith Cuba is going to result in the rapid transformation of Cuba into a \ndemocracy. Cuba's leaders are steadfast believers in a repressive \npolitical system that has enabled them to hold power unchallenged for \nmore than half a century. Their economic policies have been a disaster, \nresulting in daily hardships for the Cuban people. You can see it \nwhenever you travel to Cuba. While the Cuban Government blames its \neconomic problems on the U.S. embargo, no one seriously believes that, \nalthough it is undeniable that the embargo has exacerbated the \nhardships.\n  It is also undeniable that support for the embargo in the United \nStates, from the business community to the human rights community, has \nevaporated. I wonder how many Members of Congress know that in the past \n5 years the Government of Cuba, while blaming us for the embargo, has \nimported more than $1 billion in U.S. agriculture and medical products. \nAmerican exports mean American jobs.\n  There would be a lot more exports if we got rid of the embargo. Right \nnow it is punishing American workers, as well as Cubans.\n  Why are we also punishing half a million Cuban entrepreneurs who \nalready work in the private sector and are no longer dependent on the \ngovernment? Why not support the private sector in Cuba as we do \neverywhere else in the world? Why not open the United States to the \nemerging Cuban market?\n  I think it is past time to replace vindictiveness and personal family \ngrievances with what is best for the American people.\n  I have condemned the Cuban Government's arrest and imprisonment, \nafter unfair trials, of individuals that have done nothing more than \npeacefully protest against the government's repressive policies. At \nleast two of them were among the 53 who were released as part of our \nagreement a year ago. Eleven others released earlier still cannot \ntravel freely.\n  But Cuba's leaders cannot stop the tide of history any more than any \nof us can. The majority of Cubans were not even born at the time of the \n1959 revolution. They have very different priorities and aspirations \nthan those who overthrew Batista's corrupt, abusive regime. Cuba is \nchanging in ways that will mean more freedom and more engagement in the \nworld, and more economic opportunities.\n  During the past 12 months, the Obama administration has taken \nhistoric steps to implement the new policy. After so many decades, when \nU.S.-Cuba relations were frozen, the progress in the last year has been \nbreathtaking. Talks are underway between both governments on a wide \nrange of issues, including one wrapping up last night on resuming \ndirect mail and air service, but also on law enforcement cooperation \nand property claims.\n  Senator Flake, who has been such a leader on this--he and I have \nintroduced legislation, cosponsored by 45 other Democrats and \nRepublicans, to end restrictions on travel by Americans to Cuba. Those \nrestrictions don't exist for travel to any other country, including \nNorth Korea and Iran. If our bill were called up for a vote, and if we \nlistened to the American people, it would pass easily.\n  This year the Senate Appropriations Committee passed, with bipartisan \nmajorities, a similar travel amendment by Senator Moran and me and two \nother amendments to facilitate U.S. agriculture exports and shipping to \nand from Cuba.\n  In contrast, the House of Representatives adopted half a dozen \nprovisions offered by just one Member that would turn back the clock.\n  I have no doubt that the path begun by President Obama and President \nRaul Castro is the right one for the people of both countries, and that \nthe dwindling few who continue to try to stand in its way will fail.\n  History is not on their side. Rather than continue to cling to a \npolicy that was misguided from its inception and that did nothing to \nhelp the Cuban people, they should respect the will of their \nconstituents and the Cubans on whose behalf they erroneously claim to \nspeak.\n  It was only 12 months ago that Senator Flake and I walked up the \ngangplank onto the President's plane with Alan and Judy Gross. I took \nmany photographs that day, and our son-in-law, Lawrence Jackson, one of \nthe President's photographers, was also there recording it for \nposterity.\n  Look at how much has been accomplished in those 12 months for the \nbenefit of the people of Cuba and the United States. It has done more \nfor the reputation of the United States and its influence in this \nhemisphere than has been done in the past half century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a chronology of those accomplishments \nprepared by the Engage Cuba coalition be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  I hope that before another year passes the Congress will finally \nrecognize that it too has a responsibility to respect the will of the \npeople, to end the embargo and to stop interfering with the right of \nAmericans to travel. And that exposing the Cuban people to our ideas, \nour principles, and our products is the best policy for the future.\n  I see my dear friend, the Senator from Arizona, on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      A Look Back at the First Year of the U.S.-Cuba Relationship\n\n                       December 17, 2014-Present\n\n\n                    Key Actions and Accomplishments\n\n       December 17, 2014: President Obama moves to normalize \n     relations with Cuba.\n       Decision follows 18 months of secret negotiations between \n     U.S. and Cuba and the release of American aid contractor Alan \n     Gross.\n       Announcement of plans over the coming months to ease travel \n     and financial restrictions on Cuba.\n       Paves the way for U.S.-Cuba to restore diplomatic ties, \n     reopen embassies, and potentially lift the embargo.\n       January 16, 2015: Departments of Commerce and Treasury \n     announce regulatory changes to Cuba sanctions.\n       The amendments implement the changes President Obama \n     announced on December 17, 2014.\n       March 31, 2015: U.S. and Cuba hold first formal talks on \n     human rights.\n       April 8, 2015: A public opinion poll of Cubans on the \n     island is released; shows that an overwhelming majority of \n     Cubans support an end to the embargo.\n       Nearly all Cubans (97 percent of those polled) believe \n     normalization of the relationship between Cuba and the United \n     States is good for Cuba.\n       April 11, 2015: Presidents Obama and Castro meet at the \n     Summit of the Americas in Panama.\n       Marks the first time the two nations' top leaders have sat \n     down for substantive talks in more than 50 years.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I want to first pay tribute to Senator \nLeahy for the long path to getting here with Cuba, for all of the work \nthat he has done, and to his capable staff, including Tim Rieser and \npeople on my staff, including Chandler Morse and others, who have \nworked on this issue for so long. I have appreciated working with \nSenator Leahy on this issue.\n  It was 1 year ago today, as Senator Leahy mentioned, that we had \nreceived a call just a few days prior, asking if we would participate \nin a quick mission down to Cuba, but we had to keep quiet about it for \na few days, which was a bit difficult. One year ago today, we got on \nthe President's plane, as Senator Leahy mentioned, and went down and \npicked up Alan Gross. It was wonderful to have Alan's wife Judy on the \nplane with us. What a joyous occasion that was to see that reunion \nthere in Cuba and then to climb on the plane.\n  As we climbed away from Cuba, I will never forget that about 20 \nminutes into the flight, the pilot came on and said that we had now \nentered U.S. airspace. Alan Gross stood up, threw his arms in the air, \nand then breathed deeply. Then he said, ``Now I finally know I am \nfree.''\n  Then we watched on the news on the plane as the announcement came \nthat we would be changing our policy, that we would be seeking full \ndiplomatic relations, and that many of the policies of the past would \ngo away.\n  It has been a wonderful year to see some of that happen. One of my \nbest moments--favorite moments--in Congress was going down with Senator \nLeahy again and watching the American flag being raised over the U.S. \nEmbassy in Havana after 54 long years, to have those marines there, the \nsame three marines who had lowered the flag in 1961 and who returned to \nCuba to help raise the flag back up. What a wonderful symbol. What a \nwonderful thing about a new policy and a new way forward with Cuba.\n  It is significant to note, as Senator Leahy mentioned, that after \nspending 5 years in prison in Cuba, Alan Gross came out of prison \nwithout bitterness. From that time forward, he has promoted meeting \nwith colleagues of ours\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\nand telling anybody who will listen that this way forward is the right \nway forward on Cuba; that we should change our policies; that we ought \nto have closer cooperation and diplomatic relations; and that the \nproblems that Cuba has are the problems of the Cuban Government, not \nthe Cuban people.\n  I want to pay tribute to Alan Gross for that. He continues to work \ntill this day for better relations between Cuba and the United States. \nThat is a significant thing. When Senator Tom Udall and I visited Alan \nGross in prison in November of last year, just 1 month prior to his \nrelease, he was in a bad way. He had lost a lot of weight. He had lost \nsome of his teeth. It was a tough time to be in prison. Being there for \n5 years, he missed many events at home with his family.\n  I cannot imagine coming out of that experience and still feeling the \ncompassion that he has for the Cuban people. Just last night it was \nannounced that the U.S. and Cuba have agreed to enter into a bilateral \nagreement on flights to allow airlines from America, U.S. carriers to \nfly to Cuba. Instead of just charter flights, we will now have directly \nscheduled flights. That will allow Americans to travel to Cuba easier \nand more inexpensively.\n  I would encourage all Americans who can find themselves in 1 of the \n12 categories for travel to do so. There are a group of Cubans who came \nto the United States a while ago. They were asked: What can America do \nfor you? These were Cuban entrepreneurs who are looking to change the \nsystem in Cuba.\n  They said: Visit Cuba. Come see us. Come to our private restaurants. \nStay in our homes. Spend money in Cuba that we have access to. I should \nnote that those who oppose a new policy--the new policy that we have \nwith Cuba--often say that if you travel to Cuba, every dime that you \nspend goes right to the Cuban Government. That is not the case.\n  In Cuba right now, you can stay at a bed and breakfast. In fact, \nAirbnb has 2,500 listings in Cuba. You can stay at an Airbnb. The bulk \nof that money, most of that goes to those Cubans who are hosting you, \nnot the Cuban Government. You can eat at a private restaurant where \nthose who prepare the meal, serve the meal, and cook the meals will see \nthe bulk of that money to them.\n  In fact, about 20 percent of the Cuban workforce is now outside of \nthe Cuban Government. So, when Americans travel to Cuba, Cubans \nbenefit. So I would encourage my colleagues and others to take the \nopportunity to go down to Cuba and travel. The policy that we had for \n54 years in Cuba failed to produce the results that we want to see. We \nwant to see a democratic Cuba that respects human rights.\n  The Cuban Government still has a long way to go, but I truly believe \nthat the best way forward, the best way to make progress on those areas \nthat we still need to make progress on, is with full diplomatic \nrelations. Hopefully, we soon will have an Ambassador in Cuba who is \nthe Ambassador. Our diplomatic team, led by Jeff DeLaurentis, does a \ngreat job in Cuba, but we ought to have a U.S. Ambassador there.\n  Americans traveling to Cuba doing legal business in Cuba ought to \nhave the same protections they have anywhere else in the world. We need \ngood representation, full representation, in countries that are not \nfriendly to us more than we need it in countries that are friendly to \nus. So I would encourage the Obama administration to move forward on \nthose and other areas as well.\n  There are still some measures the Obama administration can take that \nwill improve the lives of Cubans and make it more likely that we can \nmake progress in these other areas. Having said that, let me just say--\nyou often don't hear it from this side of the aisle--but I want to \npraise and applaud this President, President Obama, for taking the \nmeasures that he has taken on Cuba. It took guts to do so.\n  There is still opposition to the positions that he has taken, but he \nhas taken a position that helps the Cuban people, and it helps \nAmericans. It is good for our national interests. It is good for our \nsecurity interests.\n  With that, I want to thank again the Senator from Vermont for the \nwork that he has done on this issue. It has been a pleasure working \nwith him. This past year has been a great year in terms of U.S.-Cuba \nrelations. Here is to an even better year ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on the \nProtecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which will provide \nneeded tax certainty and predictability for our Nation's small \nbusinesses, enabling them to create more jobs and boost our economy.\n  Several months ago, on April 30, I was joined by my friend and \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, in introducing the Small \nBusiness Tax Certainty and Growth Act of 2015. Our bill aimed to help \nsmall businesses invest, grow, and create jobs by providing needed tax \nrelief and certainty. Senator Casey has been a true partner in \nadvancing this bill, and we are so pleased that the Protecting \nAmericans from Tax Hikes Act takes three key provisions from our \nbipartisan bill. These provisions include, first, the permanent \nextension of section 179 expensing, indexed for inflation, which will \nallow small businesses to write off up to $500,000 of the cost of \ncertain equipment. I would note that this provision is so important to \nour smaller businesses that it is the No. 1 tax priority of our \nNation's largest small business advocacy group, the National Federation \nof Independent Business. Second, the bill includes the permanent \nextension of the 15-year deduction period for restaurants and retailers \nto improve their space and to buy new equipment. This is so important \nbecause otherwise the Tax Code reverts to a 39-year depreciation \nschedule. That is totally unrealistic. No restaurant could wait 39 \nyears before investing in new flooring, new equipment, and other kinds \nof renovations and expect that customers will still come flocking to \ntheir doors. The third provision of our bill would be an extension of \nso-called bonus depreciation to allow companies to deduct the cost of \ncertain equipment and software.\n  These three provisions will give our small businesses the \npredictability they require to plan for capital investments that are \nvital to expansion and job creation.\n  I know I don't have to tell the Presiding Officer that small \nbusinesses create the majority of new jobs in this country. According \nto the Bureau of Labor Statistics, small businesses generated 63 \npercent of net new jobs that were created between 1993 and 2013. Even \nthe smallest firms had a notable effect on our economy. The Small \nBusiness Administration data indicate that businesses with fewer than \n20 employees accounted for 18 percent of all private sector jobs in \n2013.\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\n  Recent studies by the National Federation of Independent Business \nindicate that taxes are the No. 1 concern of small business owners and \nthat the constant change in our Tax Code is among their chief concerns. \nI know this to be true from the many conversations I have had with \nsmall business men and women throughout the State of Maine. It is so \nfrustrating to them because they don't know what the Tax Code is going \nto provide from year to year, making it nearly impossible to plan. This \nhas the effect of freezing their investment decisions, and that in turn \naffects their ability to hire more workers.\n  The long-term solutions provided in this bill will provide the \ncertainty small businesses need to create and implement long-term \ncapital investment plans that are vital to growth and job creation. For \nexample, section 179 of the Tax Code allows small businesses to deduct \nthe cost of acquired assets more rapidly. The amount of the maximum \nallowable deduction, however, has changed three times in the past 8 \nyears and has often been addressed as a year-end ``extender,'' making \nthis tax benefit unpredictable from year to year and therefore \ndifficult for small businesses to take full advantage of in their long-\nrange planning.\n  Let me give a concrete example. Earlier this year I spoke to Patrick \nSchrader from Arundel Machine, a precision machining business in \nSouthern Maine. He told me that the uncertainty surrounding section 179 \nhas hindered his ability to make business decisions. The high-tech \nequipment he needs requires months of lead time. For a small business \nlike Patrick's, it is very risky to increase spending to expand and \ncreate new jobs when the deductibility of those investments remains \nunknown until the very end of the year. For business planning, this is \ninformation that is vital to have at the beginning of the year, not at \nthe end. This uncertainty has a direct impact on hiring decisions.\n  I wish to give another example of what the small business expensing \nprovisions can mean. Maine has become well known for its high-quality \ncraft beers. Dan Kleban founded the Maine Beer Company with his brother \nin 2009. In 6 short years his business has added more than 20 good-\npaying jobs with generous health and retirement benefits, and they want \nto add even more. Dan noted that his company's business decisions have \nbeen directly affected by the availability of section 179 expensing. \nThis provision fueled their expansion by allowing them to reinvest \ntheir capital into new equipment to produce more great beer and hire \nmore great Maine workers. In the last 3 years, they have taken the \nmaximum deduction allowed under section 179 to acquire the equipment \nneeded to expand their business. This year they hope to use the \nprovision to finance the cost of a solar project that will offset \nnearly 50 percent of their energy consumption. If the business had been \nforced to spread these deductions over many years, its owners simply \nwould not have been able to create the new jobs as they have.\n  This economic benefit is multiplied when you consider the effect of \nthe investment by Maine Beer Company and Maine's many other small \nbrewers and other kinds of small businesses on equipment manufacturers, \non the transportation companies needed to haul that new equipment, and, \nin the case of craft beers, on the suppliers, the supply chain, \nincluding farmers who are providing the materials needed to brew these \noutstanding beers.\n  In February, NFIB released new research that backs up this claim with \nhard numbers. NFIB found that simply extending section 179 permanently \nat the 2014 level could increase employment by as many as 197,000 jobs \nduring the 10-year window following implementation. U.S. real output \ncould also increase by as much as $18.6 billion over the same period. I \nmention those numbers because it shows how beneficial this provision of \nour Tax Code can be when it is made permanent, when the uncertainty \nabout whether it is going to be available and at what level goes away.\n  In light of the positive effects these provisions would have on small \nbusinesses, on jobs, and on our economy, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the tax relief package.\n  I am pleased to yield to my cosponsor and colleague Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I commend and salute the work done by \nSenator Collins. I am grateful to have this opportunity to reiterate \nsome of the great features of this legislation as it relates to these \ntax provisions. If I had to summarize it in a couple of words, it would \nprobably be the following: certainty for small businesses--maybe just \nthose four words.\n  Senator Collins, when we talk about reaching across the aisle, I am \none desk in from the aisle and you are almost on the aisle. It is \nalmost literally reaching, you are so close. But I am so grateful for \nyour work on this issue for several years now. And with all the \ndifficulties in Washington where often folks don't come together on \nthese and other issues, we can show that we can work together and we \ncan make progress on something, giving certainty to small businesses. \nThat is a pretty big deal. In our State we have something on the order \nof 2.5 million people working in small businesses, so this is the core \nof our country in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry.\n  I would reiterate and maybe even incorporate by reference Senator \nCollins' review of the provisions. I would highlight two of them. The \n15-year depreciation schedule for restaurants and other leaseholds and \nother businesses--if you have a restaurant and you can get the benefit \nof depreciation--figuratively speaking, a slice or a piece of \ndepreciation year after year--it is a lot better if you can get the \nbenefit of those slices or pieces over 15 years--one per year, or one \nbenefit of depreciation--rather than having to wait 39 years for little \ntiny pieces over those 39 years. That is a simplistic way of explaining \nit, but it is a vital injection of support for small businesses.\n  On section 179, I think what Senator Collins said makes a lot of \nsense because a lot of these businesses would see, well, in this \nparticular year, the value of that maximum allowable deduction is at a \ncertain number, a couple hundred thousand dollars. In the next couple \nof years it could change. Having that certainty of knowing what that \nbenefit will be over time is of enormous significance. The same is true \nof the benefits that come from bonus depreciation.\n\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise today to discuss some critical tax \nprovisions which Senator Collins and I worked to include in the end of \nyear tax package soon to be considered by the House and the Senate.\n  This is a day we fought long and hard for--a day to bring our small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs the certainty they need to invest in their \ncompanies, grow and create the jobs our economy needs.\n  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I understand that one of \nthe best policy tools we have at our disposal to support small \nbusinesses is the tax code, which directly affects businesses' bottom \nlines.\n  Business owners need certainty about tax policy. That is why I am \nproud to have worked with Senator Susan Collins to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation that would allow small businesses to plan for capital \ninvestments that are vital for job creation, and am thrilled to see \nprovisions from this commonsense proposal included in the end of year \ntax package. Their inclusion will increase certainty for businesses, \nincrease economic activity and increase the pace of job creation.\n  Small businesses are vital to our economy. In Pennsylvania small \nfirms comprise more than 98 percent of all employers, nearly 2.5 \nmillion Pennsylvanians work for small businesses. Across the country, \nsmall firms employ just over half of the private-sector workforce, \naccording to the Small Business Administration.\n  In the past, many of the tax provisions affecting small businesses \nhave been enacted on an unpredictable and temporary basis; that changes \nwith this bill. That uncertainty directly hindered economic growth and \njob creation. When businesses don't know how their investments will be \ntaxed, they cannot make long-term planning decisions with confidence. \nThis bill, with the policies I championed with Senator Collins, will \nchange that.\n  This end-of-year package includes several provisions which, through \ntheir\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nbeing made permanent, will immediately reduce uncertainty about the Tax \nCode and encourage businesses to grow, invest and hire.\n  A key provision of our bill would make permanent the maximum \nallowable deduction under section 179 expensing rules. Section 179 \nallows taxpayers to fully deduct certain capital asset purchases in the \nyear they make the purchase. This type of expensing provides an \nimportant incentive for businesses to make capital investments. Without \nit, taxpayers would have to depreciate those asset purchases over \nmultiple years. By making the maximum allowable deduction permanent and \nindexing it to inflation, our bill would provide the kind of certainty \nthat businesses need to take full advantage of section 179.\n  A second provision--bonus depreciation--will help businesses in much \nthe same way that the expensing rules do. Bonus depreciation allows \ncompanies to expense half the cost of qualifying assets that they buy \nand put into service in the same year.\n  The bonus depreciation provisions will provide 5 years of certainty \nto our businesses, creating an added incentive that makes a real \ndifference in small business investment. A 2013 U.S. Treasury report \nconcluded that 50-percent bonus depreciation lowers the cost of capital \nby 44.1 percent. These figures illustrate the tremendous benefit these \npolicies can bring to our job creators.\n  One additional measure, which I would like to touch on for a moment, \nis the provision to make 15-year straight-line depreciation schedule \nfor restaurants, leaseholds, and retail improvements permanent.\n  This February, Senator Cornyn and I introduced legislation to make \nthe 15-year cost recovery provision permanent. I am glad to see its \ninclusion in the end of year tax package.\n  These provisions together will encourage business owners to make key \ncapital investments, and allow for faster cost recovery that goes \ndirectly to a company's bottom line, thus freeing up cash that can be \nused to expand operations and hire more workers.\n  Making these measures either permanent or long-term creates the kind \nof tax certainty that is critical for all our businesses, but is \nespecially important for small businesses.\n  These are commonsense provisions that both parties can support. They \nwill improve our business environment and ease the tax burden on small \nbusinesses. Most importantly, they will directly encourage the \ninvestment and job creation that our economy needs.\n  I wish to commend and salute the work Senator Collins did. We are \nglad there is some certainty as a result of these business tax \nprovisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8752-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8752-S8755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              EB-5 PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday morning, an \nomnibus appropriations bill was filed to keep government operating for \nthe remainder of this fiscal year. This bill, which will be voted on by \nthe House on Friday, includes a straight and clean extension of a \nprogram called the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program. This program has \nbeen plagued with fraud and abuse, but more importantly it poses \nsignificant national security risks. Allegations suggesting the EB-5 \nprogram may be facilitating terrorist travel, economic espionage, money \nlaundering, and investment fraud are warnings against this bill too \nserious to ignore. Yet they are being ignored. The omnibus bill fails \nto include much needed reforms.\n  The spending bill being considered by the House and Senate is a major \ndisappointment. I am frustrated that despite the alarm bells and \nwhistleblowers, warning us in Congress about the EB-5 program, \nRepublican and Democratic leadership in the House and Senate decided to \nsimply extend the program without any changes. This was a missed \nopportunity to protect America.\n  What makes this especially frustrating is that the chairs and ranking \nmembers of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees--both Republican \nand Democratic--agreed on a bill. We had consensus. I appreciate the \nsupport of Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the committee. I also \ncommend Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, Congressmen Issa \nand Lofgren. In a bipartisan way, we worked this bill out. We agreed on \nevery aspect--maybe naively but believing in our hearts that we were \ndoing the right thing. We found common ground on national security \nreforms. We made sure rural and distressed urban areas benefited from \nthe program, as was intended when it was first written. We instituted \ncompliance measures, background checks, and transparency provisions. \nAll of those things were meant to protect our national security and \nweed out waste, fraud, and abuse. Through months of hard work, we put \ntogether a great deal, but despite this broad, bipartisan support, and \nthe work of the committees of jurisdiction, not a single one of our \nrecommendations will be implemented. Instead of reforming the program, \nsome Members of leadership have chosen the status quo. This failure to \nheed calls for reform proves that some would rather side with special \ninterest groups, land developers, and those with deep pockets.\n  It is widely acknowledged that the EB-5 program is riddled with flaws \nand corruption. Maybe it is only on Capitol Hill--an island surrounded \nby reality--that we can choose to plug our ears and then refuse to \nlisten to commonly accepted facts. The Government Accountability \nOffice, our free media, industry experts, Members of Congress, and even \nFederal agency officials have concurred that the program is a serious \nproblem with serious vulnerabilities.\n  Why did congressional leaders ignore the chairmen and ranking members \nof both the House and Senate committees who were spearheading EB-5 \nreform? Why, at the same time--and maybe more importantly because they \naren't colleagues--did they ignore the Government Accountability Office \nor ignore the FBI or ignore the Secretary of Homeland Security?\n  Allow me to remind my colleagues why the EB-5 Regional Center is in \nneed of reform. For several years I have kept close tabs on this \nprogram, thanks in part to the reports of wrongdoing brought forth by \nwhistleblowers. The fact is that other Federal agencies, including the \nFBI, have raised national security concerns. Whistleblowers say that \nrequests from politically influential people were being expedited. Last \nJune, Congress heard from a whistleblower who was harassed for speaking \nout against the problem--in reference to the countries of China, \nRussia, Pakistan, and Malaysia, countries not known to be friends of \nthe United States.\n  This whistleblower said:\n\n       EB-5 applicants from China, Russia, Pakistan and Malaysia \n     had been approved in as little as 16 days and in less than a \n     month in most. The files lacked the basic and necessary law \n     enforcement queries . . . I could not identify how USCIS \n     [Customs Immigration Service] was holding each regional \n     center accountable. I was also unable to verify how an \n     applicant was tracked once he or she entered the country. In \n     addition, a complete and detailed account of the funds that \n     went into the EB-5 project was never completed or produced \n     after several requests. During the course of my investigation \n     it became very clear that the EB-5 program has serious \n     security challenges.\n\n  There are also classified reports that detail these problems, much as \nthe whistleblower said. Our committee has received numerous briefings \nand classified documents to show this side of the story. Our own \nexecutive branch agencies have communicated to us their concerns about \nthe program. Just listen to these people concerned about it. Officials \nwithin the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI, and Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement expressed concerns about the program and how \nprone it is to fraud. We ought to be concerned about waste, fraud, and \nmismanagement. We ought to be concerned about national security. The \nway this bill is ending up, with just a 10-month extension, nobody is \ntaking that into consideration.\n  An internal national security report stated the following:\n\n       As in any instance where significant investment funds are \n     raised . . . the regional center model is vulnerable to \n     abuse. The capital raising activities inherent in the \n     regional center model raise concerns about investor fraud and \n     other conduct that may violate US security laws. Third Party \n     promoters engaged by regional centers to recruit potential \n     investors overseas fall outside of the U.S. Citizenship and \n     Immigration Services' regulatory authority and may make false \n     claims or promises about investment opportunities. \n     Unregistered broker-dealers may operate outside of U.S. \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services' statutory\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n     oversight to match prospective investors with project \n     developers. Moreover, the statute and regulations do not \n     expressly prohibit persons with criminal records from owning, \n     managing, or recruiting for regional centers.\n\n  Just think of that, ``Statute and regulations do not expressly \nprohibit persons with criminal records from owning, managing, or \nrecruiting for regional centers.'' Don't we think that is a threat we \nought to be considering? How many more intelligence reports are needed \nfor my colleagues to understand this problem? How many more headlines \nare needed before we have the will to deal with this problem? How many \nmore whistleblowers are going to be demoted for telling us about these \nproblems, merely committing the one crime that whistleblowers commit--\ntelling the truth.\n  The Secretary of Homeland Security sent a letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee and requested more authority to deny, terminate or revoke a \nregional center's designation. They wanted more authority to root out \nthe bad apples. They have been requesting this since 2012. Considering \nthat the Secretary of Homeland Security would say that--and he has to \ncarry out this legislation and can't prevent some of the bad things \nthat are happening from happening under existing law--that ought to be \nenough to guarantee Congress would pay heed to these problems and do \nsomething about it. As I indicated, our bill would have done just that. \nBut the fact that our bipartisan bill was dismissed by congressional \nleadership means bad actors and bad regional centers will continue to \noperate.\n  The EB-5 program also encourages a whole host of financial fraud and \ncorruption. The program's abundant loopholes and lack of regulation \nhave created a virtual playing field for unethical gamesmanship and con \nartists. Fortune Magazine reported how one man cheated potential \nimmigrants out of $147 million for a make-believe building project he \nnever intended to finish. The article explained how the trickster \nclaimed the project would create over 8,000 jobs. In reality, some 290 \nforeigners were tricked out of their cash. This is not the only example \nof how regional centers can be used to defraud people out of millions \nof dollars for nonexistent projects.\n  Another government agency we ought to pay some attention to, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, encountered another fake project in \nwhich two men in Kansas purported to build an ethanol plant in that \nState. The Commission stated in a litigation release that ``the plant \nwas never built and the promised jobs never created, yet the [two men] \ncontinued to misrepresent to investors that the project was ongoing.'' \nThat same report goes on to say that millions of dollars of investor \nmoney was used for other purposes--can you believe this?--even going to \nanother completely unrelated project in the Philippines.\n  Just last month, the National Law Review reported another case in \nwhich Security and Exchange Commissioner filed suit against the owner \nof a regional center who allegedly stole $8.5 million in EB-5 funds. \nThe owner claimed that all the money provided from the foreign \ninvestors would be held in escrow until the approval of their green \ncards. Instead, the article reports that the owner of the regional \ncenter blew the money on two different personal homes, a luxury \nMercedes, a BMW, and a private yacht. All the while, clueless investors \nwere exploited by loopholes in the EB-5 program.\n\n  For example, the article states that both the investors and the \nowners of the regional center were represented by the same attorney. \nBut for many potential EB-5 immigrants, a safe investment is not the \nmain concern because it is simple. You can buy your way into the United \nStates. Paying $500,000 is simply the price of admission that they are \nable and willing to pay. For these wealthy elites, a profitable \ninvestment is just icing on the cake of buying green cards.\n  I hope some of my colleagues will talk to Senator Feinstein about why \nshe thinks this program should be wiped out. Even considering our \nreforms, she still takes that view. She feels it is just plain wrong to \nsell access to the United States through buying a green card.\n  A lot of the debate in the past 2 months has been on targeted \nemployment area reforms. The targeted employment areas created by \nCongress to steer foreign investment to rural and distressed areas have \nbeen greatly abused. The designations have been gerrymandered--\ngerrymandered just like congressional districts--to include the most \nlavish developments in the richest neighborhoods, where this law of 20 \nyears was never expected to be used because these are not distressed \nareas as were anticipated by the original law.\n  The Hudson Yards project has generated millions of dollars for a \nluxury apartment complex in Midtown Manhattan. Manhattan was in here \ncomplaining about needing investment, when every day you read in the \nnewspaper that Chinese entrepreneurs are investing in New York all the \ntime. Not far away, another flagrant example of gerrymandering is the \nBattery Maritime Building, right next to Wall Street, in Lower \nManhattan. The New York Times described it by saying it ``snakes up \nthrough the Lower East Side, skirting the wealthy enclaves of Battery \nPark City and Tribeca, and then jumps across the East River to annex \nthe Farragut Houses project in Brooklyn.''\n  That is the gerrymandering that goes on here to get a project in a \nvery wealthy part of New York to qualify.\n  I have to ask my fellow Senators: How many more media reports will it \ntake to understand the extent of EB-5 gerrymandering? Have the Senators \nwho helped table our reforms ever read those reports in the Wall Street \nJournal? I can say with certainty that the status quo will not benefit \nmiddle America. It benefits New York City and other affluent areas at \nthe expense of areas in Iowa, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Vermont. Another \nway to put it is that it is not going to benefit those who were the \noriginal intent of the legislation when passed two decades ago. It was \nsupposed to deal with rural areas and with high-unemployment areas.\n  Some may say that there wasn't enough debate or public input on EB-5 \nreforms. Well, I would like to walk through how much debate we have had \non this issue, besides what is very obvious from the newspaper reports \nor from what whistleblowers say or what the FBI says or what the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission says or even what the Secretary of \nHomeland Security says.\n  In the history of our leading up to this legislation, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on the program in late 2011 and at every \nhearing since in which Secretary Johnson has testified, the issue of \nEB-5 has come up. The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, as well as House committees, have had hearings on this \nprogram.\n  In 2013 the Senate debated an immigration bill that was over 1,000 \npages long. In a few short months, we voted that bill out of this body. \nParts of the bill that we were working on to be included in this \nomnibus appropriations bill included EB-5 reforms that we talked about \nin that immigration bill of 2 years ago.\n  Then in 2014, the House Judiciary Committee voted out a bill that \nincluded some changes in the program. The bill would have raised the \ninvestment level to $1.6 million. This year in June, Senator Leahy and \nI introduced S. 1501. We called it the American Job Creation and \nInvestment Promotion Reform Act. It was a tough, serious bill to \noverhaul the program.\n  Since June, we have listened to other Members of Congress. We have \nheard input from their constituents and regional centers in their \nStates. We listened to stakeholders. We met with lawyers, lobbyists, \nand regional center operators. We listened to groups that represented \ntrade and labor union groups. We met with the agency at the Department \nof Homeland Security that runs the program. We worked with them and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission on language. We consulted other \ncongressional committees.\n  We took this input from a wide range of sources and made changes to \nour bill. On November 7, we circulated a new draft with Chairman \nGoodlatte, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Ranking Member \nConyers of that committee joined our conversations, as well, and I want \nto tell you that Ranking Member Conyers has had invaluable input into \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\n  Again, I want to emphasize--because that is what the leadership of \nthis body is always talking about: Do things in a bipartisan way. \nAgain, we had a bipartisan, bicameral agreement with the four leaders \nof the committees of jurisdiction. The leaderships of both bodies said \nthat committees would do their job and be relevant to the legislative \nprocess again, except for the EB-5 program, evidently.\n  We weren't the only ones who wanted action. We had colleagues such as \nChairman Corker and Chairman Johnson, who on November 6 joined me in \nsending a letter to Leaders McConnell and Reid, urging them to include \ncritical provisions that would better guard against fraud and abuse and \ngive the Department of Homeland Security the ability to terminate \ncenters that Secretary Johnson didn't feel he had the authority to \nterminate and where there was obvious fraud.\n  As I said about Senator Feinstein when I referred to her position on \nthis issue, she would prefer to see the program end. In early November \nshe wrote:\n\n       We have seen in recent years that the program is \n     particularly vulnerable to securities fraud. According to \n     legal complaints, applicants for some projects were swindled \n     out of their investment, and jobs were never created. . . . \n     When the program comes up for renewal in December, Congress \n     should allow the program to die.\n\n  She is a respected Member of this body and very involved in national \nsecurity and intelligence issues. When she sees something wrong with a \nprogram such as this, we ought to give it proper attention.\n  Two weeks ago the Judiciary staff was asked, after all these changes \nwere made in the bill, to come in and talk to Democratic and Republican \nleadership. Staff was asked to hear out the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nthe Real Estate Roundtable, and other industry representatives. I don't \nthink there is anything wrong with listening to anybody's view about \nany legislation we have--whether it is an individual or an organization \nrepresenting individuals. But to have them right there in the room \nwriting legislation, I think, goes a little bit too far.\n  On that first day of December negotiations, there was a lot of \ndiscussion about how New York wouldn't be able to compete with rural \nAmerica if our reforms were enacted. They thought the bill was unfair \nto urban areas, and they wanted every project in the country to qualify \nfor the special targeted employment area designation. The solution was \nto provide a set-aside of visas at the higher levels to ensure they \ncould use the program. It was apparent that an agreement was in the \nworks. But, when you have these greedy people coming to talk to you, \nthere is no end to what they are going to ask for.\n  When the group returned the next day for discussion, the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce and the Real Estate Roundtable, along with a small group of \ndevelopers represented by law firms in town, came with yet another new \nlist of demands. They had half a dozen major issues, not to mention \ntheir so called technical changes.\n  After nearly 12 hours in the room with EB-5 protectionists, Judiciary \nCommittee staff conceded and tried to find common ground, because we \nwanted to at least take care of these national security issues and get \nsome of the fraud out of the program. The group I am talking about left \nwith an agreement in concept. But again, you think you are satisfied, \nand you have something to go on, and then all of a sudden you find out \nthe next day, when staff was called in to finalize the language, that \nthe industry said they wanted more.\n  This is a very common theme. The industry wants more, and they wanted \nmore, and they wanted more. It made one really wonder if they actually \nwanted a bill with reforms.\n  This was an effort to hoodwink people into what we thought were good-\nfaith negotiations, and it turned out it wasn't in good faith. Then, \nafter all the concessions made to the industries, some Members in the \nSenate came to us and wanted to make even more concessions. Despite all \nthese challenges, the four corners of the Judiciary Committees \ncompromised more. We gave in on many areas for the sake of national \nsecurity and, hopefully, taking fraud out. We tried to strike an \nagreement, as much as it made the bill weaker, because the security \nreforms are also desperately needed. But after all of that, our House \nand Senate leadership failed us. They extended the program without any \nchanges whatsoever for 10 months in the appropriations bill that we \nwill vote on tomorrow. No reforms. No plugs for national security. No \nsafeguards against fraud and abuse--it will go on for at least another \n10 months.\n\n  The bill we presented to the Republican and Democratic leadership \ntook into consideration edits from the industry, immigration attorneys, \nand several congressional offices.\n  I am very disappointed that the leadership simply extended a very \nflawed program. But I also know the product we provided them on Monday \nnight did not accomplish much that we were hoping to do. It was a very \nflawed, compromised bill. It was too watered down. It was a giveaway to \nNew York City, Texas, and rich developers who simply wanted to protect \ntheir projects. It was a giveaway to affluent urban areas and a failure \nfor rural America.\n  This morning we had the benefit of some enlightenment as to how this \nhappened. I have an ABC News report stating that more than $30 million \nwas spent this year alone in a lobbying effort against the reforms--$30 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ABC News article \nentitled ``Lobbyists Declare Victory After Visa Reform Measure Dies \nQuietly'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From ABC News, Dec. 17, 2015]\n\n    Lobbyists Declare Victory After Visa Reform Measure Dies Quietly\n\n                           (By Matthew Mosk)\n\n       After a multi-million dollar lobbying effort, congressional \n     leaders Tuesday night quietly scuttled a bi-partisan attempt \n     to reform a little-known immigration program that offers \n     wealthy foreigners access to visas and U.S. Green Cards but \n     has been beset by allegations of fraud and abuse.\n       The EB-5 program, called so due to its visa designation, \n     allows rich foreign nationals a shortcut to a Green Card as \n     long as they invest $500,000 in a designated job-creating \n     project in the U.S. Designed to spur the American economy, \n     the program is also feared to have been exploited by spies, \n     money launderers and other criminals, as revealed in an ABC \n     News investigation earlier this year.\n       ``There are well-documented national security concerns and \n     abuse of the program, and a bipartisan, bicameral agreement \n     on reform,'' Sen. Chuck Grassley told ABC News in a written \n     statement. ``It should have been a no-brainer, but now it's a \n     missed opportunity.''\n       But there were opponents to reform with money to spend--\n     private groups that paid out more than $30 million in a \n     lobbying effort to protect the EB-5 program this year alone, \n     including more than $23 million from the National Association \n     of Realtors, according to an analysis of lobbying \n     registration reports for ABC News by the Center for \n     Responsive Politics.\n       At the Capitol, the legislation was defeated by a group of \n     lawmakers led by New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, who argued \n     that security improvements were a good idea, but the way the \n     reform was written would unfairly hurt investments in his \n     home state.\n       Regardless of how it died, lobbying groups cheered the \n     reforms' downfall Tuesday night. A lobbyist for one group, \n     called the ``EB-5 Investment Coalition.'' posted a message on \n     Twitter declaring victory.\n       ``So proud of our EB-5 Investment Coalition . . . TY [Thank \n     You] Schumer, Cornyn and Flake,'' it read, referring to other \n     opposition lawmakers Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Jeff \n     Flake, R-Ariz.\n\n\n                        `In Dire Need of Reform'\n\n       Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, who worked with Grassley on \n     the program's overhaul, said the EB-5 program has ``long been \n     abused and is in dire need of reform.''\n       ``We pushed aggressively for its inclusion in the omnibus \n     appropriations bill but congressional leadership inexcusably \n     rejected this much-needed reform,'' he said.\n       Brokers who advertise overseas as agents who can help \n     procure visas for wealthy investors have repeatedly been \n     accused of defrauding those foreigners who put up $500,000 in \n     the hopes of obtaining a Green Card. The EB-5 program was \n     being abused so frequently this way that the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission took the unusual step of posting a public \n     warning to potential investors to be wary of such offers.\n       ABC News reported on an EB-5 program that promised to use \n     foreign investment to rebuild New Orleans in the aftermath of \n     hurricane Katrina. Investors sued, alleging the money had \n     been squandered or stolen, and said they were unable to get \n     Green Cards because no jobs were created.\n       The program was also criticized for how it was used \n     legally.\n       Critics say that while it is intended to funnel EB-5 \n     foreign investment to business\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\n     projects in poor regions around the country and in turn \n     promote job growth, a majority of the funds are actually \n     supporting high-end real estate projects in wealthy areas.\n       ``This program was established to help areas with high \n     unemployment, but it's been hijacked by investors with \n     $500,000 putting their money in Chelsea, not the Bronx,'' \n     said Nancy Zirkin, executive vice president of The Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which supported the \n     reform bill. ``Our communities, in Baltimore and Ferguson and \n     other places, need the infrastructure and just aren't getting \n     it.''\n       Outside opposition to the reform proposal was led largely \n     by real estate developers who have increasingly come to rely \n     on the money from foreign investors, mainly from China.\n       To add to the pressure from Leahy and Grassley to impose \n     new restrictions on foreign investment visas, there was also \n     pressure for Congress to act because the entire EB-5 program \n     was set to expire this month.\n\n\n                     Unexpected Defeat in Congress\n\n       Leahy and Grassley, both senior members of their parties in \n     high ranking positions, said they thought they had the \n     support needed to push through the reform measure. But during \n     weeks of discussions behind closed doors, Sen. Chuck Schumer \n     (D-N.Y.) emerged as a staunch opponent, arguing that the \n     changes to the program would unfairly limit the amount of EB-\n     5 money that could be used on projects in New York City. \n     That's because of a provision in the reform proposal intended \n     to more narrowly direct the investment money to projects in \n     low income areas.\n       At present, close to 20 percent of the investment funds \n     raised by foreign investors seeking visas winds up backing a \n     New York City development. Many of those projects include \n     glitzy high rise buildings in wealthier parts of New York. \n     But even those projects, Schumer argued, were able to create \n     large numbers of jobs in neighboring, low income parts of the \n     city.\n       A spokesperson for the senator told ABC News that Schumer \n     did not oppose efforts to eliminate national security and \n     fraud risks associated with the program.\n       ``Sen. Schumer supports reforms that will bring \n     transparency and accountability to the EB-5 program, but \n     strongly believes that the EB-5 program should continue to \n     act as a catalyst for thousands upon thousands of jobs \n     throughout New York,'' said Matt House, a Schumer spokesman. \n     ``The proposed reforms would have crippled the program and \n     would have held back job growth in urban and low-income areas \n     in cities across the country.''\n       Negotiators said Schumer attracted support from Republican \n     Sens. Cornyn and Flake. Instead of passing the reform \n     measures, they agreed, they would extend the program for \n     another 10 months without making any changes.\n       Grassley expressed deep disappointment in the outcome.\n       ``Leadership allowed the negotiations to be hijacked by a \n     small number of special interest groups who wanted the \n     status-quo and the necessary reforms were shoved aside,'' he \n     told ABC News.\n       A Washington, D.C. group called IIUSA, formed to advocate \n     for EB-5 investment, posted a statement online expressing \n     gratitude for the decision by Congress to keep the EB-5 \n     program running.\n       ``IIUSA will continue to advocate for a long term \n     reauthorization with reasonable reforms that succeed in \n     enhancing Program integrity and effectiveness,'' the \n     statement said.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. So this is where the years of work to reform EB-5 have \ncome. So this is how several years of work ended--a reform blocked by \nselfish interest.\n  I have to be an optimist around here, and I believe that, eventually, \nright wins out. It is time for things to change. I was for reform. I \nwanted to make it better. But now, I am not so sure reforms are \npossible. It may be time to do away with EB-5 completely. Maybe we \nshould spend our time, resources, and efforts on other programs that \nbenefit the American people. Maybe it is time that this program goes \naway.\n  The next 10 months will be spent exposing the realities and \nvulnerabilities of this program. As chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I will exercise oversight of this program even more than I \nhave in the past. I will ask tough questions and make more \nrecommendations. My quest to either have EB-5 reformed or to end the \nprogram has just begun. This is not the end, this is just the \nbeginning.\n  I yield the floor, and if I have any time, I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor my commerce committee \nstaff director, Dave Schwietert, who is leaving the Hill after almost \n16 years of service here in the Senate.\n  Earlier in Dave's career, he worked for the late Senator Craig \nThomas, and for the past 11 years, Dave has worked on my staff, serving \nhis home State of South Dakota. He started with me as a staffer on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee when I first arrived in the \nSenate. After leaving the Environment and Public Works Committee, I was \nlucky enough to have Dave serve as my legislative director for 6 years. \nWhen I became ranking member of the commerce committee, Dave came over \nas minority staff director, a position in which he served 2 years \nbefore becoming majority staff director this year.\n  Dave is the kind of staffer you always hope to get as a Member. He \nhas a brilliant mind. His memory for the most arcane details of any \npolicy is almost legendary. In fact, if you look up ``policy wonk'' in \nthe dictionary, you probably would find a picture of Dave Schwietert--\nand I say that with the greatest amount of affection. He has a deep \ndedication to his work. Over the years, I have relied on his intellect \nand dedication more times than I can count.\n  Those aren't the only things that distinguish Dave as a staff \ndirector. One of the things I appreciate the most about Dave is his \ncommitment to helping younger staff members develop their abilities. \nThat is a great quality around here where oftentimes people have a hard \ntime learning how to delegate and learning how to bring younger staff \nmembers along. His patience and his teaching ability are well known, \nand staffers who work under Dave come away with sophisticated \nanalytical skills and a deep understanding of the issues.\n  The commerce committee has had a lot of successes this year, most \nnotably passage of two major pieces of legislation--the Surface \nTransportation Board reauthorization bill and the first long-term \nhighway bill in a decade. Dave Schwietert was a key figure in each of \nthose accomplishments.\n  We have known for a long time that the Surface Transportation Board \nneeded to work better, and Dave really has been working on this \nreauthorization since I first became a member of the commerce \ncommittee. This year we were finally able to get it done. Dave can \nleave the Senate with the knowledge that legislation he helped enact \nwill permanently improve things for all those American farmers and \nbusinesses that rely on our Nation's rail system to get their goods to \nthe marketplace.\n  This year's landmark Transportation bill, which will strengthen our \nNation's infrastructure and boost our economy for years to come, was a \nproduct of a tremendous amount of work on multiple committees. In the \ncommerce committee, we developed the bill's extensive safety title, and \nDave was once again a key figure in that process. I am particularly \nproud of the fact that we managed to move from a party-line vote on the \ncommerce title to strong bipartisan support when we were done. In fact, \nwhen it cleared the Senate, it was with 83 votes. Dave deserves \ntremendous amounts of credit for that. His ability to build consensus \namong Members and staff of both parties is a huge reason we were able \nto pass a long-term transportation bill this year.\n  Another thing I always appreciated about Dave is his commitment to \nSouth Dakota. Like me, Dave is a proud South Dakota native. In fact, he \ncomes from western South Dakota, Rapid City. I am a western South \nDakota product. In fact, in South Dakota you are either East River or \nWest River, and we both come from West River.\n  Throughout his time on the commerce committee, he has never forgotten \nabout the needs of South Dakota families, farmers, and businesses. It \nhas always been forefront in his mind. I am grateful for that. I know \nthere are a lot of South Dakotans who are grateful for the bills he \nhelped pass. Dave's work will have a tremendously positive impact on \nSouth Dakota for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, while it is difficult to overstate how much Dave will \nbe\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\nmissed around here, I am happy he has found an exciting new \nopportunity. It has been said that lightning never strikes twice, but \nas in so many other things, Dave breaks the mold on this one as well. \nIn fact, he was struck by lightning not once, not twice, but three \ntimes while on a rock climbing trip, but that hasn't discouraged him, \nand I, for one, am grateful for that commitment and tenacity.\n  My thanks also goes out to his wife Sandra, his son Evan, and his \ndaughter Lauren for allowing me to keep their husband and father here \nmany times late into the evening.\n  I know I speak for a lot of people when I say that Dave will be \ndeeply missed, but he should know he goes forward with respect and the \ngratitude of many and the warmest wishes for all his future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven).

Mr. President, we rise today to talk about an issue we \nstarted talking about a year ago; that is, the oil export ban. What we \nwere going to do is not only educate the public about this 40-year-old \nban but also educate those colleagues in our caucus who do not have the \nlevel of experience that we have with the oil industry. I can tell you \nthat it has been a journey.\n  I want to make this point because I always make this point when I \ntalk about it: Fundamentally ignore all the other policy arguments. \nThere is absolutely no reason in the world to restrict the export of a \ncommodity that we produce in this country. Commodities traditionally \ntrade on a global market. If we are not going to distort the market, \nthey need to find their market. This is a 40-year-old ban that didn't \nmake sense when they did it, and it made even less sense in an \nenvironment where States such as North Dakota were on the path to \nproduce over 2 million barrels a day of light sweet crude from our \nshale formations.\n  At the end of the day, when we look at the effort and we look at the \nanalysis, occasionally a good argument wins the day. I think that is \nwhat we are seeing as we are on the verge of this Congress--signed by \nthe President--lifting a 40-year-old ban on the exportation of crude \noil that is produced in this country.\n  I wish to make a couple of quick points about it on a policy matter.\n  First, many people say: Well, wouldn't that jeopardize our energy \nindependence?\n  Closing off the market and making sure our commodities can't find a \nmarket encourages investment in other places than the United States of \nAmerica, so it is counterintuitive.\n  They say: Wouldn't this actually raise our gasoline prices?\n  We had study after study that concluded one simple thing: Either it \nwould have no effect or it would have a downward effect since gasoline \nprices were measured against Brent, which is the international pricing \nbenchmark. When we look at what is good for consumers, what is good for \njobs in States such as North Dakota and New Mexico, what is good for \nnational security, and what is good for our allies--I spent a lot of \ntime last year talking to people from the EU and talking to people in \nEastern Europe about the significance of energy security and knowing \nthat even though they didn't have a source of energy, they could buy \nenergy from a country such as the United States of America.\n  I frequently referred to our oil as ``democracy oil.'' It is not oil \nproduced by countries that we are at odds with, that we disagree with; \nthis is oil that is absolutely an opportunity to use that soft power, \nto use that ability to export. That idea was shared not only by foreign \npolicy experts from conservative think tanks but many well-recognized \nDemocratic foreign policy experts. We are at the point of actually \ngetting this done, and that is the good news.\n  We also know that frequently in the Congress a good idea doesn't \nhappen in isolation; it happens when we are willing to sit down and go \nto negotiations. That is where my great friend from New Mexico came in, \ntaking a look at whether there was an opportunity to actually get a \ndeal done and what we could do to make this actually happen. So we \npartnered up pretty early in making the pitch together.\n  I wish to ask my friend Senator Heinrich, would you please talk about \nthe piece of this deal that supports the development of renewables and \nwhat that means for your State, which is also an oil-producing State, \nand what that means for jobs not only in a State such as mine, which \nhas a large manufacturing facility that manufactures blades--plus, we \nthink we are the Saudi Arabia of wind. I know there are probably 20 \nStates that say that. In North Dakota, it is true. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer would agree that we are, in fact, the Saudi Arabia of \nwind.\n  I ask Senator Heinrich, what does this mean for you in terms of \nrenewables?\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank Senator Heitkamp for her leadership on this \nissue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his contributions to allow us to \nreach what has been an incredible example of a bipartisan, balanced \nenergy package, something we haven't seen for quite a while.\n  I wish to recognize the many hours that Senator Heitkamp spent in \nmeetings of every complexion under the sun, educating our colleagues \nwho don't have oil- and gas-producing basins, as we do, on the \nintricacies of what does this mean for price pressures, what does this \nmean for consumers, are the things that you intuitively might think \nactually not what you would see in the actual marketplace. There was \nmeeting after meeting with the renewable energy associations, in the \nsolar field, in the wind field, and with colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. There were people such as the Presiding Officer or the \nenergy committee chairperson, Senator Murkowski of Alaska.\n  I thank the Senator for that work, and it has really been a pleasure \nto work with her in that effort.\n  This is a very big step for New Mexico. Obviously, at any time when \noil is trading under $50 a barrel in a State where we have two big \nbasins--the Permian Basin in the Southeast and the San Juan Basin in \nthe Northwest, not to mention production in the Raton Basin that is \ncoming on--it is a very big hit, not only to our job situation and to \nthe families who rely on those jobs, but also to our public schools in \nthe State of New Mexico. This opportunity to relax the oil export ban \nmeans something concrete for that industry and for those jobs in New \nMexico. It also means something very concrete for the future of jobs in \nNew Mexico as well.\n  The incremental work on the renewable side is one of the single \nbiggest pieces of policy on clean energy that I have seen in my adult \nlifetime.\n  We are looking at two markets that have grown rapidly and that have \nproduced, in solar's case, 200,000 jobs in the last few years. That \nwould have taken an enormous hit if we would have allowed those \nincentives to go away. As a result of this package, we are likely going \nto see another 140,000 jobs in solar alone.\n  The incremental impact on the carbon front--the extension will offset \n100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. That is like 26 \ncoal-fired powerplants.\n  These things impact small businesses across my State as well as \nacross the country. But if you look at a small State such as New Mexico \nwith 2 million people, we have close to 100 solar companies employing \n1,600 people in these new fields, and it is growing rapidly. We have \nseen 358 megawatts of solar energy installed. We have 812 megawatts of \nwind energy currently installed and another 300 in the pipeline right \nnow, with another 300,000 to 500,000 jobs associated with that in 2014 \nalone.\n  This is the single biggest piece of predictability within renewable \nenergy\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nthat we have seen in a very long time. We have learned the reality that \none-plus-one-plus-one does not equal three. When you add a tax \nincentive one year, you take it away, and you add it back, the sum of \nthose is not nearly as robust as when you have predictability over a \nperiod of time. That is what this does for our energy industries across \nthe board.\n  I thank the Senator for all of her work on it. I wish to ask the \nSenator a question, in particular. This agreement obviously didn't \nhappen overnight. I know we have been meeting for well over a year, and \nyou have been thinking about it even longer than that.\n  I ask Senator Heitkamp, would you talk a little bit about why you are \nso passionate about this issue and what specifically it means for the \npeople of North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Well, it wasn't that long ago that North Dakota became \nthe second largest oil-producing State in the country. We are \nchallenged in North Dakota because we don't have the mature \ninfrastructure of Texas and the basin. We are challenged with \ntransportation. But the amazing thing is, we produce the best crude in \nthe world, light sweet crude. The problem with light sweet crude over \nthe years is it wasn't the dominant crude that was produced in the \nUnited States. As a result, the refineries are basically geared up to \nrefine heavy crudes. They are geared up to basically import crude from \nplaces such as Venezuela and some of the heavier crudes. That is what \nthe refiners can do. And a lot of refineries that can handle light \nsweet crude are not on a pipeline system. So on top of producing this \ngreat-quality crude, we have additional transportation costs and we \nwere seeing deductions.\n  When you add to that the challenge of producing something that could \nbe so important for energy security in our country but also national \nsecurity and helping our allies with their energy security in Europe--\nwhen you add the challenge of that product not being able to find a \nmarket, what that means is that this energy renaissance for the country \nthat we are so proud that we participated in begins to basically dim. \nThis idea that we can be energy independent starts dimming, and we \nstart seeing people cut back on investment, and we start seeing people \nreduce their plans to invest in this country when they know they can go \noffshore and actually market their product.\n  So the bottom line is that this isn't going to raise oil prices \novernight. Those folks who may have a prediction that this is going to \nresult in a dramatic increase--I don't think they really understand the \noil markets and what is happening right now. But what it does do is it \ntakes a commodity that should always have had the opportunity to find \nits market and it applies free enterprise system principles and it \napplies capitalistic principles. When you produce something in this \ncountry, you ought to be able to find your market.\n  People say: It is remarkable you have been able to get this far. It \ntells the American public that the Congress can function if people come \nwilling to make a deal.\n  I see my friend from New Jersey, who a lot of people would not have \nsuspected played such an important role in our discussions and had such \na willingness to learn. He impressed a lot of our friends in the oil \nindustry with his rapid understanding of economics. I tried to tell \nthem he was smart. They occasionally get fooled by press releases as \nopposed to actually meeting folks.\n  I think another great thing that has come as a result of this is \ncertainly a willingness of the Democratic caucus to listen to this \nargument. There has been a building of relationships that I hope will \nallow us to have a reasoned debate about oil energy development in this \ncountry going into the future.\n  I say to Senator Heinrich, I am going to ask you to close with an \nexplanation of, when you look into the future, how critical this is to \nyour school system and what you see in terms of the future of the \nindustry as a result of this change in your State.\n  Mr. HEINRICH. I thank again Senator Heitkamp. I just wish to say how \nimportant this is for the State of New Mexico, in part from the \nperspective that our economy has been incredibly challenged in the last \nfew years. Coming out of the recessions, we have not seen the growth \nthat many of our neighbors have seen.\n  One of the places where we have seen growth has been the solar \nindustry. For the people working in the solar industry today, those are \nnew jobs. Having certainty for our energy sector, which runs the gamut \nfrom the oil and gas basins that I talked about, to the incredible \ngrowth in solar energy, to the fact that we have a very strong wind \ncomponent in the State--basically, the eastern side of our State is \nvery much in the same wind-mapping zone as the Panhandle of Texas. This \nmeans predictability. It means jobs. It is one of the single biggest \neconomic things that we could have done for the State of New Mexico \nsince I have been in the Senate.\n  I think we have a lot to be proud of. We were also able to extend the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, something that has been working for \nthis Nation, across the country, for 50 years. That is very much tied \nto our leasing of oil and gas offshore.\n  Certainly, my colleague Senator Udall knows that program inside and \nout. He has been an incredible champion for it. His father made it \nhappen when he was Secretary of the Interior.\n  I conclude my remarks and thank you again for allowing me to engage \nin this colloquy. I thank our colleagues for being able to work on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I know that we are up against the clock, \nand I promised my friend from the South that I would, in fact, \nconclude, but I saw someone I worked very closely with on this issue \ncome onto the floor. I extend my great appreciation for the hours we \nspent together talking about this issue and the hours we spent with the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, basically educating as the first step and \nthen finally delivering a product that we can all be proud of. I extend \nmy congratulations and my appreciation to the chairwoman of the energy \ncommittee for the work that she did and for her belief, along with my \nbelief, that we could in fact get this across the finish line. I don't \nthink anyone at any point, other than her and me, actually believed we \ncould get it done this year. It is pretty remarkable that we did.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank not only the Senator from North \nDakota but many others for the effort that has been made to get us to \nthis point where we will soon have the opportunity to vote to lift a \n40-year-old ban on export.\n  We are the only Nation in the world that produces oil that limits our \nability to export that. It is a policy that 40 years ago may have made \nsense at that time, but it is so outdated. It is so past time that we \nrecognize we are that energy superpower, and, as that energy \nsuperpower, act like one.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned there were very few people \ninitially who thought this could be done. In January of 2014, I gave a \nspeech to the Brookings Institute, and I called for repeal of the ban. \nAt that time, I was the first policymaker who really got out front and \nsaid what a lot were thinking but were thinking maybe this was way too \nsoon.\n  A couple months later, I had the opportunity to lay out a framework \nor a pathway forward--a pathway that said we are not going to lay down \nlegislation right now; we are going to build the case, and 2014 is \ngoing to be the year of the report. There were some dozen reports--very \nconsidered, substantive reports--that came out and said: This isn't \ngoing to increase the price of oil. This is going to be good for jobs \nand our economy. This is going to be great, important, and vital for \nour role around the world to help our allies and to help others who \nwould like to rely on our energy resources rather than on Russia or \nIran.\n  So that path was set. I think it set the table for where we are now, \nin 2015. We were able to introduce legislation, to have it heard by our \ncommittee, to move the bill out of committee, to see the House do the \nsame and move it across the floor, and to get us then to the point \nwhere we could consider it in various legislative vehicles. It didn't \nquite work with NDAA. It didn't quite work with the Iran deal. It \ndidn't quite work with the transportation bill. But now we are here \nwith this omnibus package.\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\n  Again, recognizing that this is so substantive from a domestic policy \nperspective is something that I think the occupant of the Chair, as \nwell as Senator Heitkamp, as well as Senator Heinrich from New Mexico--\nall producing States--can recognize the enormous gains. But I think we \nalso need to consider the very real, very substantive difference that \nwe will make when as an energy superpower are able to share our \nresources--whether it is oil, whether it is natural gas--to help \nwhether it is our friends in Europe, whether it is Poland, which is 95-\npercent reliant on Russia for its oil, whether it is South Korea or \nJapan.\n  Alaska has been able to export its oil since 1996, when we received \nbasically a waiver. We have seen the benefits that oil exports bring. \nOur State has had the ability to do so. Why should the rest of the \ncountry not see that benefit?\n  Again, since 1996, with our oil, we have exported our natural gas \nfrom Cook Inlet, and it has actually been the longest term export \ncontract that this country has seen as far as natural gas. We have seen \nthe benefit. We know that when we are the export trading partner, we as \na nation benefit from it. Whether it is jobs, revenues, growth or \nprosperity, this is good, this is a win, and it is very important. \nAgain, I appreciate the efforts of so many that have brought us to the \nplace that we are today.\n  I think we acknowledge that, yes, there are heavy legislative lifts \naround here. But I think we work constructively to build the case, to \ntry to depoliticize to the extent possible, to avoid the partisanship \nthat can come into specific issues, by saying: Let's examine this from \na policy perspective. Does it make sense to lift sanctions on Iran for \ntheir oil and keep in place a ban on our U.S. oil producers, \neffectively sanctioning U.S. oil producers? I think we got a lot of \ncolleagues when we raised that question to them: Think about it from a \npolicy perspective and whether it is good or outdated. This one is \noutdated, and it was time to go.\n  So I thank Senator Heitkamp for yielding for just a moment and \nallowing me to speak very briefly to what I think is very significant \nfor this country, both domestically and internationally. Let's let the \nUnited States of America be that energy superpower that we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8758-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8758-S8759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PASSENGER RAIL SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise first to commend the three Senators \nwho have just completed their colloquy. They have been discussing an \naccomplishment this year that results from bipartisan efforts. I too \nwould like to speak about a bipartisan effort that I have been engaged \nin with the Senator from New Jersey, who joins me on the floor today, \nwhich would be the passenger rail portion of the Transportation bill \nwhich the President has already signed.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Jersey and I be \nallowed to engage in a colloquy concerning this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am so pleased to have worked with \nSenator Booker on the rail portion and on the entire Transportation \nbill. I am pleased it has passed the House and Senate and been signed \ninto law by the President--a major accomplishment.\n  I would note that predecessors of ours from our States were part of \nthe last major effort for a comprehensive rail bill. My predecessor, \nTrent Lott, along with the late Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, were \nthe authors of the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act, which was \nintroduced in 2007, and much work on it was done before Senator Lott \nresigned at the end of 2007. It was actually passed in 2008. So I think \nit is quite appropriate that Senator Booker and I would be allowed to \nfollow in their footsteps and participate in this legislation, which \ndeals with making our rail system safer in the United States and more \nefficient and puts greater attention on planning and efficiency. I know \nthat Senator Booker shares my enthusiasm for the accomplishment that \nthis Congress has made in that regard.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I would first say thank you. I do share \nthat enthusiasm. I appreciate the way the Senator began his remarks. \nThis is a tradition of bipartisanship that goes beyond the Senator and \nme, but I want to say this about Senator Wicker because I am new to the \nSenate. I am here about 25 months now. But this last full year when I \nhave been working on this passenger rail bill as the ranking member of \nthat subcommittee, I have found him to be tough, to be balanced, to be \nstrong and thoughtful about what is best for America, thinking about \nour country first, thinking about his great State, our country, how we \nare going to create jobs and how we are going to improve in an \nincreasingly globally competitive environment. It has been an honor to \nwork with him. I think what we accomplished together is extraordinary, \nand it is going to have a profound impact.\n  This bill makes critical investments in our rail infrastructure. It \nmakes important safety reforms, and it helps to move our country \nforward, literally and figuratively.\n  Rail efficiency and safety is critical to our national success. It is \na priority. This idea of protecting Americans is a priority of both \nSenator Wicker and me, and it is critical that we have rail safety, \nespecially as we go forward. I have seen, unfortunately, in the past \nsome very challenging accidents.\n  For me and my constituents in New Jersey, rail is incredibly \nimportant. We are part of the Northeast Corridor, which is probably the \nbusiest rail corridor in the country. It is one of the most productive \nregions of our Nation, and, unfortunately, it has an inadequate \ninfrastructure. More people use rail than fly in that corridor. The \nchallenge is that the corridor itself has become a choke hold right \naround the New York-New Jersey region. One of the reasons is because \nthe Hudson River crossing--the busiest river crossing in the United \nStates of America--has tunnels that are inadequate and ineffective at \nthis point. These tunnels were built back in 1910. Nobody in this body \nremembers those years, personally, but the tunnel began construction 1 \nyear after the famous flights at Kitty Hawk were just getting off the \nground in air travel. These tunnels were completed less than a decade \nbefore the start of the First World War.\n  So today, these tunnels are in horrible condition. The whole region \nis suffering as a result of it. I hear time and again from constituents \nabout the urgency for investment in rail. Residents now, because of the \ndelays, because of the challenges with New Jersey Transit, have to \nleave earlier for work, miss time with their families, miss dropping \noff their kids at school, lose out on productivity. The productivity \nlosses in this region amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. So \nthis is an urgent cause for us. That is why I was so grateful, really \ncelebrating the fact that we have a partnership in the Senate that can \nactually get something done when it comes to rail travel.\n  For us in this region, we know the challenges. We have tunnels under \nthe Hudson River that are clearly in a state of significant decay and \ndisrepair that some engineers say have less than a decade on them. One \nsingle day of missing access to those tunnels for that artery could \nhurt our regional economy by about $100 million for one single day in \nwasted productivity.\n  So this spring Senator Wicker and I joined together to introduce this \nlegislation, the Railroad Enhancement and Efficiency Act. That bill is \nmaking critical investments. The bill very critically would allow the \nNortheast Corridor to reinvest its profits into that region, which is \ngoing to be significant for helping to give us a 21st century \ncompetitive infrastructure. That is something I cannot understate the \nurgency of. The bill adds critical safety provisions that will help \nwith positive train control.\n  Earlier, as was mentioned by Senator Wicker, the Chamber passed the \nFixing America's Surface Transportation Act, or FAST Act, a 5-year, \n$305 billion transportation compromise bill that, for the first time, \nincludes the rail provisions that I am proud to say were in our \nRailroad Enhancement and Efficiency Act.\n  So this bill that passed the Senate will enable critical projects, \nsuch as the Hudson Tunnel plan. It is going to achieve incredible \nsafety for our communities. I just want to again thank\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\nSenator Wicker for his noble service. I am sure he and I would both \nlike to thank Senators Thune and Nelson, the ranking members on the \noverall committee, who worked to ensure that our bill was part of the \nmassive highway transportation bill. There is our long-term economic \ncompetitiveness as a country. We talked about national security. Well, \nour economy fuels our strength at home and abroad. Investing in \ninfrastructure, which has a long history of being a bipartisan \npriority, is something on which I am proud to join with Senator Wicker \nand continue that great American tradition of investing in our \ncommunities, creating more growth, creating more jobs, and creating a \nstrong economy, which makes for a strong nation.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, it probably doesn't come as a surprise for \npeople to hear a Senator from the northeast be such a strong advocate \nof passenger rail and Amtrak. But I can tell you as this representative \nof Mississippi and a Senator from the southeastern part of the United \nStates, we believe in passenger rail, too. It is important to the \nentire national economy, and so it is important to our economy. It is \nalso important to the economy in my region of the country.\n\n  I am pleased and excited about the possibility of restoring passenger \nrail to the gulf coast for the first time since Hurricane Katrina. We \nmade it work between New Orleans and the Mississippi gulf coast and \nMobile and Orlando before the storm, and we think we can make it work \nnow.\n  One provision in the bill establishes a new gulf coast working group, \nwhich will receive a $500,000 grant specifically for the purpose of \nreturning rail to the area. Another provision creates a grant program \nthat can assist applicants like the Southern Rail Commission and has \nworked to restore passenger rail to the gulf coast.\n  In addition, I am an advocate of competition, so I am pleased to see \nthat this new legislation opens up the possibility of having private \nrail carriers competing for up to three of Amtrak's long-distance \nroutes. I think in this way we can achieve cost savings, better \nperformance, and good worker protections.\n  In closing, let me say that we are glad the law has been passed and \nsigned. It seems from this angle that it was so inevitable, but I can \ntell you and I think Members of the floor on the Senate who are \nlistening to this colloquy would have to admit that this didn't have to \nhappen. As a matter of fact, it could easily have fallen off the rails \nor fallen off the tracks.\n  On a bipartisan basis, people on this side of the aisle and on \nSenator Booker's side of the aisle did not allow the distractions and \nthe naysayers to prevail. We insisted that if we kept working, we could \nget this entire package done on a bipartisan basis.\n  I wish to salute Republican Members in the majority who put this \nforward from a committee standpoint, but I also want to salute my \nDemocratic brothers and sisters who said: Yes, we can do this, and we \nought to do it not as Republicans and Democrats but as Americans for \nthe American economy. My hat is off to my partner in this effort and to \neveryone on both sides of the aisle for making this a reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want to say in conclusion that there is \nthat story about the little engine that could and that did not give up \nand worked through trials and tribulations. Senator Wicker represented \nthe values in that story. I am grateful to have worked with him on this \nproject, and I look forward to working with him again to move our \ncountry forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act of 2016, otherwise known as the omnibus. Three \nmonths ago, it was unclear if we would get a budget deal that would \nlift the caps for both defense and nondefense spending. It was unclear \nif we could really not head to a showdown. It was not clear if were \nheading to a shutdown, and we were not clear if we could cancel \nsequester.\n  I am proud to say, as the vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, \nthat the committee has completed its work. We have done it in a \nbipartisan way and in a way that there will not be a shutdown of the \ngovernment. We have canceled sequester, and we have done this in a \nresponsible way.\n  The House is working on the bill now. We shall be voting on it \ntomorrow. Tomorrow I will talk about the national implications of the \nbill when it comes before the Senate, but today, as the Senator from \nMaryland and for Maryland, I wish to talk about the public investments \nthis bill makes to support the Nation's needs, which also supports \nMaryland's needs, which supports Maryland's jobs.\n  As the vice chair of the committee, my first job--and as the \nConstitution requires--is to be the Senator from Maryland, and I \nrequire myself to be the Senator for Maryland. I am proud to say that \nthis bill does make the kinds of public investments that I believe will \nhelp America's and Maryland's future.\n  This bill delivers on a promise I made many years ago that I would \nlook after the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range \nneeds of this country.\n  You will be interested to know that Maryland is the home to 20 major \nFederal facilities with more than 200,000 Federal employees and \nretirees. We have great military installations, such as Fort Meade, the \nNational Security Agency, Cyber Command, the U.S. Naval Academy, Naval \nBethesda, and Walter Reed. It also has great public institutions, such \nas the National Institutes of Health, the National Weather Bureau, the \nnational NOAA satellites that tell us what the weather will be, and \nalso agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Although we have the Federal assets in Maryland, they serve the \nNation. These aren't Maryland's institutions; these are national \ninstitutions, but they employ Marylanders.\n  In this bill, working on a bipartisan basis, we have increased the \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion, increasing \nit to $32 billion. Working with both Senator Murray, the ranking \nmember, and Senator Blunt, the chair of the subcommittee, we have \nnicknamed the National Institutes of Health the ``National Institutes \nof Hope.'' Why? Because it looks to find the cures and breakthroughs \nfor America's devastating diseases, from cancer to Alzheimer's. But at \nthe same time, while we have worked on funding the research to find \ncures and breakthroughs, they must be moved to clinical practice. That \nis why we in Maryland have fought so hard to make sure the Food and \nDrug Administration is capitalized in a way that it does its job.\n  The Food and Drug Administration, which employs over 4,000 people, is \nresponsible for our food safety, both here and as it comes in from \nabroad, and also for being able to move drugs, biologics, and medical \ndevices into clinical practice and demonstrating that they are both \nsafe and effective. It is a big job, and it is a big employer in our \nState.\n  We also want to make sure that we look out for those who are the most \nneedy. This Senate and this Congress often talk about Social Security \nand it also talks about Medicare. Both of those--the Social Security \nAdministration and CMS--are located in Maryland. We are very proud of \nthat. The Social Security Administration is in a community called \nBaltimore County, a neighborhood called Woodlawn. It has a building \nthat is 57 years old, and it hasn't had any improvements since 1959. \nThey work in terrible situations, with mold, decay, crumbling \ntechnology, and even vermin. We make sure that those who administer the \nSocial Security Program have the right facilities and also have the \nright technology.\n  We worked very hard to be able to stand up for our Federal employees. \nAgain, working on a bipartisan basis, we allowed a 1.46 percent cost-\nof-living adjustment.\n  We were absolutely appalled to find out about the OPM data breach, \nwhich had a devastating effect on over 130,000 Federal employees both \nhere and around this country. What we did, working on this bill, we are \ngoing to make sure that the Federal employees have 10 years of credit \nprotection since OPM fell down on its job in protecting them.\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\n  We also have been very concerned about physical infrastructure. We \nwork very hard in terms of the Metro. Metro is not a Maryland subway; \nit is not a Virginia subway; it is America's subway. For all who ride \nthat subway, we have been absolutely concerned about their safety. \nWorking with our colleagues across the Potomac, we have been \nconcentrating on Metro safety, and we were able to put the funds in the \nFederal checkbook to be able to improve that. We also want to be able \nto get people to the jobs, and that is why we funded the Purple Line.\n  There is a great opportunity in Maryland, and I hope it comes to \nother parts of our country, which is modernizing our ports. Whether you \nare in New Orleans, whether you are in Baltimore, whether you are in \nCharleston, Long Beach, CA, the ports need to be modernized. It is a \ngreat opportunity for jobs--real jobs in construction and real jobs \nhere.\n  I am happy to say we worked very hard over the years with my \ncolleagues, my beloved friends--Congresswoman Helen Bentley, a \nwonderful Republican woman. They called us the salt and pepper of the \nMaryland delegation. We worked to make sure our port was dredged and \nready for the future.\n  There are many other issues that I can show, but I wanted to show \nthat we are making public investments that not only look out for \nAmerican jobs but our Federal employees working in these key agencies--\nthe National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, \nthe National Weather Service. These are civil servants who, while they \nare located in Maryland, are working on a national mission. I am glad \nof the role I played to make sure they were capitalized.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle because they, \ntoo, understood why these investments are important.\n  Much is said about why we need to be America the exceptional, and I \nbelieve it is these kinds of programs. Our human infrastructure, our \ninnovation, and our physical infrastructure is what we are doing.\n  There are many things in this bill. Many will complain about how big \nit is. But it is not how big the bill is, but it is how effective we \nare in helping America be able to be what America is--a land of \nopportunity and a land of growth and a land that knows how to protect \nits people and protect the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8760-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8760-S8761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, as we continue consideration of the \nomnibus, I rise today to applaud the inclusion of language I coauthored \nwith Senator Mark Warner that will ensure that the fate of mortgage \ngiants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--entities Congress created--will be \ndetermined by Congress, and this language makes crystal clear that this \nbody does not support efforts to return to the failed model of private \ngains and public losses.\n  As we wrap up our legislative business of 2015, I am also here to \nremind my colleagues that there is much work to be done in the new year \nto finally address the last unfinished business of the 2008 financial \ncrisis. Prior to the crisis, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nwere publicly traded. They benefited from an implicit government \nguarantee, which meant any upside went to the company. But as we saw at \nthe height of the financial crisis, the downside of that structure fell \non the taxpayers and it fell hard.\n  In September of 2008, because of this flawed model, losses mounted at \nFannie and Freddie, causing taxpayers to write a $188 billion bailout \ncheck to keep them afloat. These entities remain in government \nconservatorship today, backed by the taxpayers and owned by the U.S. \nTreasury Department.\n  A 2014 Federal Housing Finance Agency stress test projected that the \nGSEs could require a $190 billion taxpayer bailout to keep them afloat \nduring a future crisis--something none of us wants to see happen.\n  Because housing finance reform remained the last unaddressed piece of \nthe financial crisis left, in 2013 Senator Mark Warner and I developed \nlegislation that attempted to address the flaws in our housing finance \nsystem and protect the taxpayers. This bill has been called the \nblueprint for how our Nation's housing finance system should look in \nthe future.\n  After working with a group of bipartisan Members and then-Chairman \nTim Johnson and Ranking Member Mike Crapo, a reform bill passed the \nSenate Banking Committee in May of 2014 by a vote of 13 to 9. This bill \nwould protect taxpayers from future economic downturns by replacing \nFannie and Freddie with a privately capitalized system. Unfortunately, \nit did not come to the Senate floor, but that does not change the fact \nthat there continues to be broad, bipartisan, bicameral support to \nreform these entities.\n  That broad support at the committee level and throughout Congress \ncame despite pushback from a number of large, self-interested Wall \nStreet hedge funds. Let me explain. As a result of the 2008 bailout, \nTreasury purchased senior preferred stock in Fannie and Freddie and was \ngiven sole discretion to sell or otherwise dispose of those shares. \nSeeing an opportunity to make huge profits at the expense of taxpayers, \na number of big Wall Street hedge funds and other entities rushed in \nwhen Fannie and Freddie crashed. They bought shares for pennies on the \ndollar after the government had taken them into conservatorship and \nknowing full well the government would have the authority to make \ndecisions relative to their future.\n\n  Now the hedge funds appear to be spending big money and going to \nextreme lengths to stop housing finance reform in order to reap huge \nfinancial returns. As they know how to do so well, these wealthy hedge \nfunds made a highly speculative bet that Congress would fail to do its \njob, structural reform efforts would fail, and Fannie and Freddie would \nbe recapitalized and released out of conservatorship. Under that bet, \nthe taxpayers lose while some of the wealthiest hedge fund managers get \neven wealthier. That is why the Wall Street hedge funds want to stop \nefforts to protect taxpayers in the hope that Fannie and Freddie could \nbe recapitalized and released from conservatorship.\n  Let me be clear. Under that scenario--recapitalizing and releasing \nFannie and Freddie in their current form--we would fall back to a \nsystem of private gains and public losses, lining the pockets of \nmultimillionaires while leaving taxpayers on the hook for future \nbailouts. Looking at what is at stake, one can see why these hedge \nfunds are so engaged in stepping on the taxpayers and preventing reform \nfrom occurring.\n  Using a self-analysis from one prominent hedge fund under a recap-\nand-release scenario, this fund--with an estimated current holding of \n$366 million--has a potential net profit of $8.1 billion and a total \nsale of $8.4 billion. To give another example using those same \nprojections, another prominent hedge fund with an estimated current \nholding of $501 million has a potential net profit of $2.3 billion or a \nsale of over $2.8 billion.\n  These hedge funds, and several others, would benefit greatly from a \nrecap-and-release scenario, which is why they are so adamantly opposed \nto housing finance reform that would put taxpayers' interests above \ntheir own. Surely, we will not conflate the clear interests of the \nhedge fund managers, which are billions of dollars in profits, with the \ncritical need to protect taxpayers from a future bailout by enacting \nsound housing policy in our country. Returning to the failed model of \nprivate gains and public losses would leave taxpayers on the hook for \nthe GSE's $5 trillion in outstanding liabilities. That is why I believe \nwe must act.\n  Inclusion of the jump-start provision in this bill is a good first \nstep. This legislation would prohibit the sale of Treasury-owned senior \npreferred shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without congressional \napproval and ensure Congress, and not self-interested hedge funds, has \nthe final say on how our housing finance system should look in the \nfuture.\n  While I believe that recap-and-release is totally inappropriate, I do \nunderstand that the hedge funds still have claims to deal with in \ncourt, and this legislation does not prejudice those claims.\n  I believe the blueprint Senator Warner and I laid out in 2013 is a \ngood\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\nstarting point and one that will protect taxpayers, but this \nlegislation in the omnibus bill is silent on the future system. It \nsimply says Congress should have the final say in what happens to these \nentities--again, entities that Congress created in the first place.\n  With passage of this provision--in the face of extremely intense \nopposition--we are telling taxpayers we are putting to bed the idea \nthat returning to the status quo is an option. We will not return to a \nsystem where big Fannie and big Freddie control the lion's share of our \nhousing system and taxpayers are exposed for future bailouts, but there \nis more work to be done.\n  The question I have is this: Moving forward, who are we going to \nfight for? Are we going to abdicate our responsibility and shy away due \nto efforts by large Wall Street hedge funds wanting to get wealthier \noff of taxpayers by placing taxpayers at greater risk or are we going \nto fight for the people whom we represent?\n  As all of us who served in this body during the financial crisis know \nwell, the American people do not want to write another bailout check. \nWithout housing finance reform, that is an all-too-real possibility.\n  To my colleagues, trust me. I know a number of you have felt pressure \nfrom large Wall Street hedge funds and the interest groups they \nsupport, but I also know there is not one of you who truly wants to put \nprivate investors' interest ahead of the people we represent.\n  In the new year, it is time for Congress to finally do its job. By \nfinally addressing the last major piece of unfinished business from the \nfinancial crisis, we can once and for all end this failed model. \nFortunately, a lot of the heavy lifting has already taken place.\n  As we look forward to 2016, protecting taxpayers by reforming our \nNation's housing finance system should be near the top of the to-do \nlist. This legislation takes us a step in the right direction toward \nthat effort by saying the fate of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac will be determined by Congress.\n  I remain committed to doing everything I can to make sure we do not \nreturn to the same failed model that put taxpayers on the hook for \nbillions of dollars, and instead we can create a dynamic housing \nfinance system that works for Americans rather than against them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8761-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   END MODERN SLAVERY INITIATIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I also rise to applaud Congress for \nincluding important funding in the Omnibus appropriations bill that \nwill help in our efforts to fight human trafficking and slavery around \nthe world through the End Modern Slavery Initiative Act.\n  I think most Americans would be stunned to know that over 27 million \npeople are enslaved in more than 187 countries, including our own. Over \n27 million people are enslaved today. That is more than four times the \npopulation of my home State of Tennessee.\n  Modern slavery comes in many forms and it preys on women and children \nthe most. This brutal, multibillion-dollar industry deprives \nindividuals of their basic human rights. Rather than holding a \nschoolbook, children in India are stacking bricks. Rather than sitting \nin a classroom, young girls in the Philippines are sitting in brothels \nforced into sexual servitude. In Ghana, young boys are forced into a \nlife of slavery on fishing boats, and worldwide men and women hoping \nonly to better the lives of their families are stripped of their \npassports and trafficked for labor.\n  I cannot thank the Senator from Texas enough for the incredible \nefforts he put forth to ensure that we do everything we can in our own \ncountry to keep this from happening. He has been heroic.\n  These are our daughters, sons, mothers and fathers, and that is why \nit is so important that we take bold action. Those who have been \nfighting this heinous crime for years all say that to end the practice \nof modern slavery, we need a reliable baseline data and consistent, \neffective monitoring and evaluation. They also say that what is most \ncritical in this fight is the need for a focused, sustained effort that \ncan leverage and coordinate private and government funding. That is \nwhere the End Modern Slavery Initiative Act comes into play.\n  This bold, bipartisan initiative has received broad support from over \n90 industry experts, nongovernmental organizations, and faith-based \ngroups. This initiative will seek to raise $1.5 billion--more than 80 \npercent of which is expected to come through matching funds from \nprivate sector and foreign governments--to fight slavery worldwide. \nThis model is designed to leverage limited foreign aid dollars and \ngalvanize tremendous support and investment from the public sector, \nphilanthropic organizations, and the private sector to focus resources \nresponsibly where this crime is most prevalent.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill that we will vote on this week brings \nus one step closer to making this initiative a reality with a $25 \nmillion downpayment. There are many complex problems facing this \ncountry that demand our attention but perhaps none whose existence \nthreatens the very concept of what it means to live in a free society. \nEnding modern slavery and human trafficking will not come easy, but we \nhave a moral obligation to try, and I am proud--really proud--that \nCongress is taking that step and investing in this critical fight.\n  With that, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Texas for \nallowing me to speak at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Tennessee leaves \nthe floor, I wish to thank him. Among many other issues he has dealt \nwith on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Banking Committee, \nhe has done great work on this issue. He is absolutely right about the \nscourge of human trafficking and how we need to do more--not just here \nat home but internationally--to try to break it up and rescue some of \nthese children. Often the typical profile of a trafficked person in the \nUnited States is a young girl 12 to 14 years old. It is a travesty. I \nthank him for his great work and congratulate him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8761-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8761-S8765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OMNIBUS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, this week the Omnibus appropriations bill \nwas released, along with the tax relief bill, that extends and makes \npermanent many important tax credits and lays the foundation for \ncomprehensive tax reform, hopefully sometime soon. Members of this \nChamber and the House have been reviewing the text of both pieces of \nlegislation, and I am happy to report that the House of Representatives \nhas now given a resounding bipartisan vote on the tax relief bill, with \n318 Members of the House of Representatives voting to support it. The \nHouse, we are told, will move on the Omnibus appropriations bill \ntomorrow morning, and then we will take up both bills tomorrow morning \nin the Senate.\n  I want to just remember and recall for anybody listening that the \nappropriations process did not have to end up this way. As a matter of \nfact, after having passed the first budget that Congress has had since \n2009, that then authorized the Appropriations Committee to begin the \nprocess of considering and passing 12 separate appropriations bills. \nOnce they are voted out of committee, we will bring them to the floor, \nwhere they are open for amendment and debate in a completely \ntransparent process, where people can understand the details of the \nlegislation.\n  It didn't turn out that way because our Democratic colleagues \nfilibustered these individual appropriations bills, thereby leaving us \nwith no alternative but to consider this massive Omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  I am tempted to call this omnibus bill an ominous bill, but I am not \nsure that is pejorative enough. It is not the right way to do business. \nI am disappointed. I am disappointed in our colleagues across the aisle \nwho forced us to do business this way with them, but I hope next year \nwe can have a regular and open appropriations process, one that will \nserve the American people far better.\n  I am by no means happy with the way this year-end funding bill has \ncome together, after having been hijacked, held up, and effectively \nshut down, but if this sounds familiar, this looks a lot like the \nstrategy they employed when they were in the majority\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\npreceding the election of just a year ago. Do you know what happened? \nWell, it didn't work very well because they ended up losing their \nmajority.\n\n  Needless to say, the American people actually want us to do our jobs, \nto look out for their interests, and to make sure we pass legislation \nthat is thoroughly considered, transparent, and then we could be held \naccountable for the votes we have made. Unfortunately, this omnibus \nappropriation process undercuts those principles, and as I said a \nmoment ago, it is not a good way--it is a terrible way--to have to do \nbusiness.\n  But I am happy and proud of the fact that in virtually every other \narea we have undertaken--following the budget, the multiyear highway \nbill, the trade promotion authority legislation, the Defense \nauthorization bill that was led by our colleague from Arizona, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, the Justice for Victims of \nTrafficking Act that passed 99 to 0--as I was talking about with the \nSenator from Tennessee, it is clear we know how to work together on a \nbipartisan basis, disagreeing on some issues but finding common ground \nwhere we can, and the American people end up being the winner.\n  Dysfunction and shutdowns do not work. That is not why most of us \ncame here. Most of us came here to try to make this institution and the \ncountry and conditions for our constituents a little bit better, one \nstep at a time.\n  In this Omnibus appropriations bill there is an issue I want to \nhighlight, and that is a clear win for progrowth and one that will \nfoster, not hinder, job creation, and that is lifting the decades' old \nban on exporting crude oil produced here in America. This month \nactually marks 40 years since the United States implemented a ban on \nthe export of crude oil, a policy that was put into place as a \nprecaution to protect the United States from disruption in the global \noil supply. But as we all know, the world looks a lot different than it \ndid back then. The shale revolution has helped the geopolitical energy \nlandscape turn in favor of the United States, and we have an abundance \nof oil and natural gas available, not only for our use here \ndomestically but to export to our friends and allies around the world. \nBy doing away with this antiquated policy and allowing our domestic \nproduction to reach global markets, we can kick start the U.S. economy \nand provide a real opportunity for job creation in the country.\n  Lifting the ban would not just be beneficial to people working in the \ndomestic energy sector because the domestic energy production involves \nmany different sectors--construction, shipping, technology. By allowing \nmore export of our crude, we have the potential to create thousands of \nmore jobs deep into the supply chain in a variety of sectors and across \na multitude of States. In fact, one study estimated that for every new \nproduction job in the oil field it translates into three additional \njobs in the supply chain and another six in the broader economy. So we \nare talking about a major opportunity for job creation throughout our \ncountry.\n  Doing away with this outdated protectionist policy also gives the \nUnited States an opportunity to promote stronger relationships with our \nallies and partners around the world. Today many of our allies in \nEurope, including some of our NATO allies, rely on countries such as \nIran and Russia for their energy needs. Our allies' dependence on our \nadversaries for basic needs such as heating, electricity, and fuel \ncreates a real vulnerability that exists for the United States, as \ntheir ally and partner. By lifting the ban, the United States can help \noffer our friends a chance to diversify their energy supplies and \nenhance their energy security and avoid giving people such as Vladimir \nPutin the opportunity to use oil and gas and energy as a weapon.\n  Lifting the crude oil export ban will strengthen our economy. It will \nactually save Americans on their gasoline prices at the pump by \nincreasing supply, and it will help our friends and allies around the \nworld. So it is a big win for the American people, whether or not you \nwork directly in the industry.\n  Finally, I would say--and I know the Senator from Arizona is waiting \nto speak, so I will be brief--that I am happy to see that the omnibus \nalso includes several bipartisan priority items that will benefit my \nconstituents in Texas. For example, for years I have worked alongside \nof Congressman Filemon Vela, a Democrat from South Texas, to put \npressure on Mexico to fulfill its commitment to deliver water to South \nTexas as outlined and required in a 1944 treaty. Now this is incredibly \nimportant for a wide swath of folks whose access to water is not always \nassured. This bill includes language that reinforces that commitment \nand includes a measure that requires the State Department to assess the \nimpact of Mexico's water debt on Texas and the rest of the United \nStates.\n  This bill also renews an innovative port of entry partnership program \nmodeled after the Cross-Border Trade Enhancement Act. This, too, is \nbipartisan legislation in this case, which I have introduced along with \nCongressman Henry Cuellar, another South Texas Democrat, earlier this \nyear. Specifically, it provides new opportunities for border \ncommunities and businesses to improve staffing levels and upgrade \ninfrastructure at our international border crossings to help move \npeople and goods across our border more safely and efficiently. \nObviously, with 6 million jobs in the United States dependent on cross-\nborder commercial traffic and trade between the United States and \nMexico, this is really important.\n  This omnibus legislation also includes a provision to fully repeal \nthe country-of-origin labeling regulations known as COOL. This has been \na real problem for our livestock producers in Texas and in the United \nStates. By repealing these costly food labeling mandates, the United \nStates will avoid a trade war with Canada and Mexico, two of our \nlargest export and trading partners, and will help Texas farmers, \nranchers, and manufacturers back home in my State and across the \ncountry.\n  In terms of national priorities, the omnibus bill increases resources \nfor our military, thanks to the leadership of people such as the \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. This bill will \nincrease resources for our Active-Duty military to make sure that those \ndeployed around the world, as well as those serving stateside, have \nwhat they need to get the jobs done that they volunteered to do.\n  This legislation also blocks overreach by the Environmental \nProtection Agency by providing no new or expanded funding for its \nprograms--the lowest level of funding since 2008.\n  Finally, this bill prioritizes our veterans and helps ensure they are \nbetter able to receive the care and benefits they deserve in a timely \nmanner.\n  This legislation also includes the Protecting Americans from Tax \nHikes Act, which includes the permanent extension of State and local \nsales tax deductions, something that amounts to more than $1 billion in \nannual tax relief for Texans. This will ensure that Texans are on a \nlevel playing field with those who deduct their State income tax, \nbecause we don't have an income tax and never will. That is something \nthat I can say that Texas will never have. As I said, it never will.\n  This also rolls back several of President Obama's ObamaCare taxes and \ncan provide relief to folks all over the country being crushed by the \nPresident's failed, unpopular health care law.\n  So while no legislation is perfect, and indeed this process is the \nantithesis of perfect--it is the wrong way to do business--this is the \nhand we have been dealt by the filibusters of the appropriations bills \nby our Democratic colleagues. So we are doing the best we can with the \nhand that we have been dealt. In the end, nothing passes Congress and \ngets signed into law by the President without some level of bipartisan \ncooperation in both Chambers of Congress and working together with the \nexecutive branch. This legislation does include several significant \nwins for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2016. I am obviously pleased we are \nnot going to pass another continuing resolution, which I believe is \nirresponsible, but at the same time the process by which we are now \nconsidering this legislation is just as irresponsible.\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\n  As my colleague from Texas just pointed out, we are here where we are \nbecause my colleague and leader on the other side of the aisle refused \nto allow the appropriations bills that had been passed through \ncommittee one by one to be considered and voted on and amended in the \nfashion that the American people expect us to behave, and, frankly, the \nConstitution demands. So here we are after months and months of \ngridlock with the Democrat leader not allowing us to bring up these \nbills one by one.\n  We are now faced with a $1.1 trillion bill that, in the view of many, \nis must-pass with literally hours to review and debate and no \namendments--no amendments. So we are faced with a parliamentary \nsituation of $1.1 trillion we are considering without an amendment--\nwithout a single Member on either side of the aisle being able to \npropose an amendment to make it better. My friends, this is a recipe \nfor corruption. It is a recipe for corruption.\n  A few people--a very few people--not all 100 Members of the Senate or \n435 Members of the House but a handful of people behind closed doors \nwork, and then 48 hours or so, or whatever it is, before the vote, it \nis presented to us as ``take it or leave it,'' with the choice being \nthis: Well, you can sign on to it; you will probably have to hold your \nnose, but we have no choice.\n  Well, my friends, I believe we do have a choice. I believe we do have \na choice. I believe we should behave in the manner in which our \nconstituents expect us to behave: Take up a bill, have an amendment, \nhave a debate, have a discussion, and do what we are supposed to do. \nAnd if the Democratic leader wants to block us, then let him take the \nresponsibility for doing so. Now we are faced with a $1 trillion \nspending bill that includes numerous policy provisions that have never \nbeen debated and discussed, pork barrel spending that would never stand \nthe light of day--never, ever--and I will be talking about some of \nthem.\n  I will give you some examples of the pork that has been snuck into \nthis bill. Let me give you a few examples here that I think might \ninterest our constituents. This is in this bill, in law: $3.6 million \nfor 30 vineyards, breweries, and distilleries to build tasting rooms, \nconduct whiskey production feasibility studies, and other alcohol \nmarketing gimmicks. Yeah, the one thing we really want to do is give \nmoney to help alcohol marketing. There is $100,000 in funding to sell \ngoat whey sodas and soft-serve frozen goat yogurt, $247,677 to develop \npecan snacks, and $49,750 to introduce Americans to flavored beef \nbratwurst and beef chili. If there is anything I think the American \npeople need to be educated and introduced to, it is bratwurst and \nchili. There is $49,990 for spinning raw alpaca fiber into a very fine \nyarn, $42,000 to produce cheese from buffalo milk, $250,000 to produce \nand market lamb jerky, $26,270 to determine the feasibility of \nproducing blue cornmeal from Navajo corn, and $200,000 to make apple \npies. Now this list goes on and on.\n  My favorite, my friends, of many of them is a thing called the \ncatfish inspection office--the catfish inspection office. Most of us \nenjoy catfish and we appreciate the benefits to our nutrition and of \ncourse the sizeable industry around catfishing. What we have again this \nyear is a Department of Agriculture catfish inspection office. Now \nthere is the Department of Agriculture catfish inspection office, but \nthe FDA also has a similar catfish inspection office, and the GAO, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, has issued more than six reports \ncalling the U.S. Department of Agriculture catfish Inspection Office \n``wasteful and duplicative.'' As a result of this protectionist \nprogram, an estimated $15 million of your tax dollars per year will be \nspent on enabling government bureaucrats to impose barriers on foreign \ncatfish importers, which will in turn increase the price of catfish for \nAmerican consumers, restaurants, and seafood producers. So, my friends, \nin this bill $15 million every year of your tax dollars will be spent \nfor a catfish inspection office. That is the kind of thing that happens \nwhen you get to this date at the end of the year with a mammoth bill \nworth $1 trillion. It is too ripe. It is too ripe for the picking by \nthe pork barrellers who we have in the Senate and the House.\n\n  I will quickly give a couple more examples: $1.7 million for the \nSenate kitchen exhaust systems upgrades; $65 million for Pacific coast \nsalmon restoration for States. On the face of it, you would think that \nmoney for Pacific coast salmon restoration would perhaps be a \nbeneficial expenditure of your tax dollars. Guess what. The State of \nNevada is included in this $65 million salmon restoration. A cursory \nglance at a map of the United States might indicate that the State of \nNevada is not exactly an ideal place for salmon restoration, but they \nare going to get some of these millions of dollars, and I am sure it \nhas nothing to do with the makeup of the U.S. Senate from Nevada.\n  There is $15 million for an ``incentive program'' that directs the \nDepartment of Defense to overpay on contracts by an additional 5 \npercent if the contractor is a Native Hawaiian-owned company. So if you \nhave a contract with a Native Hawaiian-owned company, the Department of \nDefense will add approximately 5 percent of taxpayers' dollars.\n  There is language that makes it easier for the Department of Defense \nto enter into no-bid contracts. If there is anything in my years I have \nseen that lends itself to outrageous spending, of course it is no-bid \ncontracts. The Department of Defense may eliminate competition and use \na no-bid contract for a ``product of original thinking and was \nsubmitted in confidence by one source.'' That is interesting.\n  Well, anyway, there are many more of those.\n  I am proud of what this Congress has done this year. There are many \ngood things that have been done. There has been the Defense \nauthorization bill. For the first time, there has been a budget. For \nthe first time, we have reformed education. For the first time, we have \ndone so many things. We have finally sent a bill to the President's \ndesk repealing and replacing ObamaCare, but to end the bill with this \nis really an embarrassment.\n  So here we are looking at $1 trillion, and I particularly want to \ntalk a little bit about national defense. I could not be more proud of \nthe bipartisanship--both Democratic and Republican--that has been \ninvolved in the Senate Armed Services Committee and the bipartisanship \nwith our friends on the other side of the Capitol.\n  We have come up with legislation that has been described as the \nbiggest reform bill for defense in 30 years--I am proud of it--and we \nhave a lot further to go. We had hours and hours of hearings, hours and \nhours of markups. We had over 130 amendments to the Defense \nauthorization bill considered on the floor of the Senate.\n  We did things we have never done before. For example, we are \ncompletely reforming the retirement system for the military. It used to \nbe that you had to stay 20 years before you could receive any financial \nbenefit. Now, after 2 years and 1 month, you can get into a matching-\nfunds agreement with the Federal Government. So now, instead of 85 \npercent of those who joined the military never receiving a financial \nbenefit, 85 percent of those who join will receive it.\n  So I am very proud, and I am very proud of the work I did with my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, as well as our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  Then at the last minute, these earmarks, these pork barrel projects, \nthese egregious, wasteful projects are airdropped into what I believe \nis a 2,000-page--whatever it is, it is huge, and we saw it for the \nfirst time at about 10 p.m. or 12 a.m. last night, and they want us to \nvote on it tomorrow. That is crazy.\n  What the appropriators did, they included over 150 different programs \nand initiatives where the appropriations exceeded what they were \nauthorized, totaling $9.4 billion. By passing the Defense \nauthorization, we set an expectation on how to allocate funds. This was \nobviously completely broken.\n  As an example, the appropriators included $160 million for humvees \neven though the Army requested zero dollars for humvees. We had \nhearings on this. We had hearings on the issue of what the Army needed, \nand it was abundantly clear that the Army did not need any more \nhumvees. Somehow the appropriators decided that there would be $160 \nmillion for humvees; $7 million for a machine gun--five times\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\nthe current size of the program. Again, our Army and Department of \nDefense said they didn't need it.\n  But this is the worst one of all, my friends, and it will not \nsurprise anyone that it is manufactured in Alabama. There is $225 \nmillion for the addition of a joint high-speed vessel, which is, of \ncourse, manufactured in Alabama. This will be the 12th ship of this \nclass. The Navy's requirement was 10--10 vessels. Remember, this is \n$225 million for this vessel. The Navy said stop at 10. We stopped at \n10. Last year the appropriators added one for $225 million; this year, \nanother $225 million. By my calculation, that is $450 million for two \njoint high-speed vessels that the military--the Navy and the Department \nof Defense--said they don't need or want. What could we have done for \nthe men and women in the military with that $450 million we just wasted \non two ships the Navy and the military said they didn't need? It is \nunacceptable.\n  The bill includes over $2 billion in funding--I am not making this \nup--it includes almost $1.2 billion on top of the $1 billion for \nmedical research within the Defense Department. My friends, I want to \nemphasize that I am all in for medical research. I think medical \nresearch is vital to the future of all Americans. But what in the world \ndoes most of this have to do with Defense appropriations? Nothing. \nNothing. It is the Willie Sutton syndrome at its best. Mr. Sutton was \nonce asked why he robbed banks, and he said, ``Because that's where the \nmoney is.'' My friends, the Department of Defense is where the money \nis, so we have seen this gradual creeping up of funding out of defense \nfunds for programs--which I will read a few of--that have nothing to do \nwith defense.\n  I will say again that I am for funding medical research. I think it \nis vital, and I think it is important. But someone is going to have to \nexplain to me how tuberculosis, autism, lung cancer, gulf war illness--\nactually, that is one of them--spinal cord injury, ovarian cancer--\nthose research funds should come out of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill, not out of defense at a time of \nsequestration, when we have planes that can't fly and guns that won't \nshoot and ships that can't sail.\n  So what have we done? Let me show you what they have done this year. \nYou can see the gradual increase. Beginning in 1992, there was about \n$20 million, I guess, something like that. Then in 1994 it went up and \nthen up. Then something happened and it went down. Then you can see the \ngradual, almost steady increase of funding for medical research as the \nfunding for defense has remained constant or even in some cases \nreduced.\n  So what have we done this year, my dear friends? Here it is: $2.2 \nbillion of your tax dollars is now earmarked for medical research--all \nof them worthy causes. Almost none of them have anything to do with \nguns, ships, planes, barracks, or medical research that is directly \nconnected to our military. To add to that, the Army received an \nadditional $16 million to conduct research on Parkinson's disease, and \nthe list goes on and on.\n  So what do we have here. By the way, the bill also includes nine \n``Buy American'' provisions, which will inevitably add to weapons \nsystems and other contracting costs. The ``Buy American'' provisions \nare a handout to labor unions and are a ploy to protect defense \ncompanies in a particular State.\n  I won't waste time and go too much longer except to say that today we \nsee an interesting political environment in America. We see on the \nRepublican side--my side--we see the leading candidates, people who are \nbasically seeking the nomination of the Republican Party because they \nare running against Washington; that they don't want business as usual; \nthat they are frustrated by the fact that, in their view, the Congress \ndoesn't work for them.\n  The approval rating of Congress is consistently somewhere in the \nteens, and Americans are frustrated and they are angry. Many of them \nsupport an individual who says: We will make America great again; it \nwill be huge. It is language that is not very specific, but it inspires \nthem to see change take place.\n  Although I disagree with that and I think we have a record this year \nthat we can be proud of in many respects--whether it be education \nreform or whether it be finally sending a bill to the President's desk \nto repeal ObamaCare or fixing education, as I mentioned, or better ways \nof defending the Nation with many reforms of how the Pentagon does \nbusiness--there are many things I am very proud of. I think we can \nreturn to our constituents and tell them that for the first time this \nyear, Congress has done some things that will be helpful to the \neveryday man and woman who has not received really much benefit over \nthe last 8 years since the economic collapse.\n  But then we send them this Christmas turkey. We send them a bill \nladen with millions and millions of dollars in wasteful and unnecessary \nspending. We send them a bill that purchases for $225 million a ship \nthat nobody wants or needs. That, my friends, gives substance and \nreason behind the frustration many of our constituents feel.\n  It is probably over for this year. I think it is probably going to be \na situation where there are sufficient votes to pass this ``omnibus \nbill'' worth $1.1 trillion of taxpayers' money without a single \namendment, not a single one. Then we will go home, enjoy Christmas, and \nthen come back in January hopefully refreshed. But I hope that in \nJanuary we will make a commitment to the American people that we will \nstop doing business this way, that we will stop waiting until the last \ndays and having these extensions that last 2 days or 3 days before the \nthreat of a government shutdown--which no American I have ever met \nenjoys--and learn that the American people expect better of us than \nthis process.\n  I am not proud of this. In fact, I am a bit ashamed because, \nparticularly on defense, there are so many critical needs of the men \nand women who are serving in our military. Their carriers are going on \n10-month cruises. Some of our men and women who are serving are on \ntheir fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh tour to Afghanistan. Even now many \nare going back to Iraq, and they will be going back, my friends. They \nwill be going back. They will also be in Syria because, I predict to \nyou now, there will be another attack on the United States of America \nbecause this President cannot lead. We are paying the price for a \nfeckless foreign policy that is a disgrace and will be judged by \nhistorians as one of the low points in American history as far as \nnational security is concerned.\n  So instead of providing for those critical needs--and I guarantee I \ncan come up with billions of dollars of critical needs. By the way, I \ncan also come up with reforms that will save billions of dollars in our \nlegislation.\n  We are proud of that. For example, we require a reduction of 7.5 \npercent per year for 4 years in the size of the staff in the military. \nThat will save over $3 billion over time. I am proud of that. So we \ncome to the American people with a defense bill that is lean and \nefficient. We have a long way to go, but we are proud of it. Then we \nlook at things like this. It is not acceptable.\n  I hope I don't have to stand up here again next year. I hope we can \nfinally sit down and work for the American people, and that means \ntaking up the appropriations bills one by one by one and giving them \nthe same attention the Defense bill got. The Defense bill got 2 weeks, \n133 amendments, debate on every issue conceivable concerning national \ndefense. We need to do that with each of the 12 appropriations bills. \nThat way we can give the American people a product that is the most \nefficient, that is the least wasteful, and something we can be proud \nof.\n  I urge my colleagues to understand that this legislation on the \nDefense appropriations part of it does not help America defend itself \nin these difficult times. In fact, because of the waste, because of the \npork-barrel spending in this, because of the earmarks in it, we have \nactually harmed the ability of our Nation to defend itself and the \nwelfare of the men and women who are serving. That is something we \ncannot be proud of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we count down the remaining days on the \n2015 legislative calendar, there is still quite a bit of work to do and \na few more big-ticket items to put to bed. Still, even with so much \nstill on our plates, I believe it is appropriate to take a look back at \nthe year we are now finishing up and reflect on what we have been able \nto accomplish.\n  Now, 2015 has been a big year in the Senate. After many years of \nunproductive division and stagnation, the Senate finally has returned \nto work. While some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have \ntried to downplay the productivity we have enjoyed under the current \nSenate leadership--and the Washington Post Fact Checker awarded them \nsome Pinocchios for their efforts--no one can seriously argue that \nthings haven't changed around here.\n  Under the current Senate majority, the committees have been allowed \nto function and work. Under the current Senate majority, we have had \nfuller and fairer debates on the Senate floor. Probably most important \nof all, under the current Senate majority, the Senate has actually been \ndoing the people's business. Instead of being bogged down with \ndivisive, political show votes, we have tackled tough challenges--\nincluding numerous challenges that have plagued this body for many \nyears--and we have delivered results, usually with a strong bipartisan \nmajority, which I find to be very heartening.\n  I am pleased to say this new trend toward efficiency and bipartisan \nsuccess has been evident in the Senate Finance Committee, which I have \nbeen privileged to chair since the 1st of January this year. I would \nlike to take some time to pay tribute to my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee and the successes we have enjoyed this year. I will start \nwith the basics, just some top-line numbers.\n  In 2015, the Finance Committee held 30 full committee hearings to \ndiscuss various legislative efforts, conduct oversight of the \nadministration, and to question executive branch nominees. There were \nalso two subcommittee hearings. We convened 10 separate markups to \nconsider and report legislation and nominations.\n  Let's dig a little deeper with the numbers. In terms of legislation, \nthe Finance Committee moved at a historic pace in 2015, considering and \nreporting 37 individual bills. Those are more bills than the committee \nreported in the past four Congresses combined and more than any single \nCongress in the last 35 years. I just have to reiterate that I am not \ncomparing 2015 to any single previous year. I am comparing it to the \nentirety of past Congresses. We have moved more legislation in just 1 \nyear than the Finance Committee has in any entire Congress in the past \nthree and one-half decades.\n  Even more striking is the fact that every one of the 37 bills we \nreported this year enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in the \ncommittee. So far, 9 of those 37 reported bills have been signed or \nincorporated into law, and several more are likely to get there before \nthe end of this week. In addition, three other bills that came through \nthe Finance Committee were discharged and subsequently signed into law.\n  However, while these raw numbers may be impressive, they only tell \npart of the story. If we take the time to delve into the specifics of \nour efforts on the Finance Committee, we will see that we have actually \nenjoyed significant successes in each of our major areas of \njurisdiction, including tax, trade, health care, Social Security, and \noversight. I have often spoken about many of our individual \nachievements on the Senate floor, but I think they deserve another \nmention today.\n  Trade. I will start by talking about our efforts with regard to \ninternational trade policy. We began 2015 with a desire to advance a \nbold and ambitious trade agenda that would update our trade laws for \nthe 21st century global economy and set the stage for American \nleadership in the international marketplace. By any measurable \nstandard, our efforts have been a smashing success. The centerpiece of \nour trade agenda was the legislation to renew trade promotion \nauthority, or TPA. Prior to this year, it had been nearly three decades \nsince a TPA bill was fully considered and reported out of the Senate \nFinance Committee. Our TPA bill received a strong bipartisan vote in \nthe committee and another one on the floor. Actually, to be precise, we \nhad to pass it twice in the Senate, with similar results on both \noccasions.\n  This legislation put in place strong negotiating objectives to ensure \nour negotiated trade agreements reflect the collective will of \nCongress. It also empowered our negotiators to reach the best deals \npossible by providing a path to getting fair up-or-down votes for \nfuture trade agreements, giving our trading partners the assurances \nthey need to put their best offers on the table. I don't want to go \ninto too much detail today about any specific trade agreements that may \nor may not make their way to Congress in the future. I just want to \npoint out that the Finance Committee's TPA bill--now a law--will ensure \nthat we have all the information we need to make an informed decision \non any agreement that Congress has the ultimate say over whether any \nagreement enters into force.\n  In addition to TPA, the Finance Committee developed legislation to \nrenew some of our most vital trade preference programs, including \npreferences for Haiti and countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the \nGeneralized System of Preferences, or GSP, Program. These programs are \nkey tools in our arsenal for assisting developing nations and providing \nimportant benefits for job creators and consumers here at home. The \npreference bill was signed into law after getting a near-unanimous vote \nin both the House and the Senate.\n  We also crafted the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act, a \nbill which will, among other things, authorize the Customs and Border \nProtection agency and update our processes and standards for \nenforcement at our borders, most notably with regard to the protection \nof intellectual property rights, an issue that has long been of \nparticular interest to me.\n  This legislation also had a lot of support in the Senate and in the \nHouse. The conference committee, which I chaired, charged with \nreconciling the differences between the House- and Senate-passed \nversions of the bill, filed its report just this last week. My hope is \nthat we will consider and pass this conference report as soon as \npossible.\n  International trade is a key element of a healthy U.S. economy. We \nhave made great strides toward promoting trade and improving global \ntrade standards already this year--and hopefully we will be able to \nmake a few more in the very near future.\n  Entitlement reform. The Finance Committee has also enjoyed \nsignificant success when it comes to entitlement reform, which I think \nhas surprised many people around here. For years--decades even--we were \ntold that bipartisan entitlement reform was impossible. The political \nstakes, according to the naysayers, were far too high. The parties and \nstakeholders, they said, were too entrenched.\n  Yet, in 2015, we have successfully enacted significant reforms to our \ntwo most ``untouchable'' entitlement reform programs: Medicaid and \nSocial Security.\n  In April, Congress passed, and the President signed, legislation \noriginally drafted and reported out of the Finance Committee in late \n2014 to repeal and replace the Medicare sustainable growth rate--SGR--\nformula. Although it has been a little while since the bill passed, I \nthink we all remember the periodic scramble to find short-term offsets \nto patch the SGR and kick the can even further down the road. It was, \nquite frankly, an embarrassment we forced ourselves to endure year \nafter year and a prime example of government ineptitude and our \napparent inability to do anything in Congress to fix it.\n  That all changed this year with the passage of the committee's \nlegislation, which not only reformed Medicare in terms of the SGR but \nalso featured cost-saving measures within the underlying program. These \nincluded a limitation on so-called Medigap first-dollar coverage, more \nrobust means testing for Medicare Parts B and D, and program integrity \nprovisions that have\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nstrengthened Medicare's ability to fight fraud.\n  While we are on the subject of Medicare reform, I will mention that \nthe Finance Committee also reported the Audit and Appeals Fairness, \nIntegrity, and Reforms in Medicare--or AFIRM--Act earlier this \nyear. This bipartisan bill is designed to address the already massive \nbacklog of Medicare audit appeals while also allowing for increased \nefforts to improve program integrity and reduce improper payments out \nof the Medicare trust fund. It will make life much easier for both \nMedicare beneficiaries and their doctors who, under the status quo, \nwait, on average, a year and a half before an appeal is processed and \nthey are able to know for sure whether their claims will be covered or \nif they will be paid for the services they perform.\n\n  In addition to these steps forward on Medicare, Congress also \npassed--as part of the recent budget and debt-ceiling bill--legislation \nto reform the Social Security Disability Insurance Program, or SSDI, \nand to prevent benefit cuts looming in the not-too-distant future.\n  Congress knew for years that the SSDI trust fund would be exhausted \nin 2016 and did little to address it. Despite my pleas and those of a \nhandful of others, they did little to address it. I might add that for \nthe Obama White House and our friends on the other side of the aisle to \nengage on this issue, it took some time. Facing the prospect of across-\nthe-board benefit cuts for all SSDI beneficiaries, the Finance \nCommittee developed proposals to extend the life of the trust fund and \nput in place needed reforms to the SSDI Program itself. Most of these \nproposals were included in the final legislation.\n  While, admittedly, these reforms are not the fundamental changes both \nthe SSDI Program and Social Security more broadly need to be \nsustainable for future generations, they represented a very real first \nstep toward that long-term goal and are the most significant changes to \nany Social Security Program enacted in the past three decades.\n  Clearly, much more work needs to be done to put both Medicare and \nSocial Security on firm fiscal footing. The same is true of Medicaid \nand other entitlement reforms. Still, the steps Congress took this year \ntoward fixing those programs were the biggest we have taken in a long \ntime. I am pleased to acknowledge that the efforts that led to those \nsteps began in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Highways and Infrastructure. One of the biggest and greatest \nsuccesses we have had in the Senate this year was the passage and \nenactment of a long-term extension of the highway trust fund. The final \nhighway bill, which we passed a few weeks ago, provides 5 years of \ncontinuous highway funding, the longest extension of transportation \nfunding since 1998 and one of the longest since the Reagan years.\n  Prior to this year, the typical cycle for funding highways went \nsomething like this: Step 1, leaders of Congress recognize and \nacknowledge a near-term exhaustion of highway funding. Step 2, those \nsame leaders work with the relevant committee chairmen to cobble \ntogether enough offsets to pay for a short-term extension, usually \nsomewhere between 6 and 18 months. Step 3, Congress passes a short-term \nextension with little fanfare and absolutely no celebration. Step 4, \nevery Member of Congress spends the next 6 to 18 months complaining \nabout this process. Step 5, start again at Step 1.\n  Thankfully, we broke that cycle this year. We began with a goal to \nprovide the longest extension possible. I was determined to do all I \ncould to find a way out of this rut, which is why I believed we had to \nthink a little outside the proverbial box and look everywhere for \npotential offsets.\n  Generally speaking, the Finance Committee is responsible for the \nfinancing title of any highway bill that goes through the Senate. \nUsually, we focus on areas within our jurisdiction as we search for \noffsets. But over the years, those resources became harder and harder \nto come by, requiring us to look elsewhere.\n  The committee spent weeks examining numerous options and \nalternatives. Many thought we could not come up with much more than \njust one 1 or 2 years. Eventually, we were able to present our \ndistinguished majority leader with a list of potential offsets that \ncould provide funding for a long-term highway bill without raising \ntaxes or increasing the deficit.\n  That list we came up with on the Finance Committee, in large part, \nformed the basis of the long-term highway bill that we passed earlier \nthis month, which has provided much needed certainty for our States as \nthey plan and complete highway projects, preserving jobs and \nstimulating growth in our economy. That long-term Transportation bill \nwas, after all, a win for good Government and for bipartisanship in \nCongress. To a lesser but not insignificant extent, it was also a win \nfor the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Tax. The committee also took important steps toward fixing our \nNation's Tax Code in 2015. From the beginning of the year, the Finance \nCommittee began considering and reporting bipartisan tax legislation \naimed at specific needs for our country. For example, in January, we \nreported the Hire More Heroes Act, which relieves small businesses of \nburdensome ObamaCare mandates that made it harder for them to hire \nveterans. This legislation was signed into law in July.\n  In February, we held a markup to consider 17 separate tax bills, all \nof them bipartisan, all of which passed without objection through the \ncommittee. To date, two of those bills have become law, and, hopefully, \nbefore we adjourn this week we will pass legislation that incorporates \nat least 11 more.\n  Adding those 11 bills to the Finance Committee total, 20 of the 37 \nbills we reported will have been signed into law. That is a pretty good \nbatting average, and when you include the bills we discharged from the \ncommittee, the grand total comes to 23 separate bills out of our \ncommittee signed or incorporated into law--not bad for a year's work.\n  In addition, at the beginning of the year, we launched five separate \ntax reform working groups in an effort to advance the larger tax reform \nconversation. These working groups, each of them cochaired by a \nRepublican and a Democrat, spent months examining various areas of the \nTax Code, listening to stakeholders and learning the various pressure \npoints and tradeoffs that come with any significant changes to our tax \nlaws. This past summer, each of the five groups released a report \ndetailing their findings, outlining reform opportunities, and \nacknowledging areas of likely disagreement.\n  I am not naive. I know that tax reform, whenever it happens, will be \na long, difficult process. However, I believe the effort our committee \nmembers put in with these working groups will make a difference in how \nthat process plays out and how the tax reform debate unfolds in the \nfuture.\n  While these are important steps for tax policy and tax reform, I am \nhoping that we can take an even larger step before we adjourn for the \nyear. Earlier this week, leaders and tax writers in both the House and \nSenate, and from both parties, reached an agreement on legislation that \nwould provide significant tax relief for millions of families and job \ncreators around the country. We would do so mostly by unwinding the \nnear-annual tradition of extending expired tax provisions.\n  Like the SGR and highway funding, the periodic tax extenders exercise \nhas been a constant source of consternation around here, with a new \ncliff or crisis developing with any hint that expiring provisions would \nbe not be extended. Sometimes we haven't extended them. And, of course, \nthe whole ordeal has been further evidence that Congress is incapable \nof making tough choices in order to govern more effectively--at least \nin the minds of some.\n  The bill we unveiled this week--which the House passed earlier today \nwith an overwhelming bipartisan vote--would change that dynamic by \nmaking many of the most important consequential tax provisions \npermanent, significantly relieving the ongoing extenders pressure, and \nallowing for a more sensible approach to tax policy. I spoke about this \nlegislation at length on the floor yesterday.\n  Permanent tax policy, such as the kind we would achieve in our bill, \nmeans more certainty for taxpayers: individuals, families, and \nbusinesses. It means an improved revenue baseline for future tax reform \nefforts. More than anything, it means tax relief for hardworking \ntaxpayers, to the tune of about $680 billion over 10 years.\n  We moved this effort forward on the Finance Committee in July when we\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\nmarked up the so-called extenders package, taking note of Senators' \npriorities and desires for long-term solutions and setting the stage \nfor a real discussion about permanence. We took that momentum into the \nbicameral, bipartisan negotiations, and, ultimately, the bill reflects \nmany of the preferences expressed in the committee.\n  Our bipartisan tax bill also contains a 2-year moratorium on the \nmedical device tax under ObamaCare, something that has been very \nharmful to our medical device industry. We will look at that in 2 more \nyears. For years now, we have seen support grow on both sides of the \naisle for repealing this horrendously misguided tax, the medical device \ntax. It has been a top priority of mine since the day ObamaCare was \nsigned into law. Other Members of the Finance Committee have led on \nthis issue as well, and one way or another we are going to get it done. \nFor now, we have a good first step: a bill crafted by both parties to \nsuspend the tax for 2 years.\n  Two similar suspensions of ObamaCare taxes are included in the \nOmnibus appropriations bill, including a 2-year delay of the so-called \nCadillac tax--which is just a massive middle-class tax hike disguised \nas a tax hit on the rich--and a 1-year moratorium on the health \ninsurance tax.\n  In other words, on top of permanence in the Tax Code and relief for \ntaxpayers across the country, we have bipartisan agreement to delay or \nsuspend some of the more harmful elements of the Affordable Care Act. \nIt is not a bad way to end the year, if you ask me. Of course, now we \nhave to pass these bills. In a day or so, I think we will.\n  Health Care and Human Services. Let me move on to another important \narea of our committee's jurisdiction: heath care and human services. We \nhave been very active in the Finance Committee in this space as well. \nMost recently, we worked with our colleagues on the Budget and HELP \nCommittees to put together the reconciliation legislation repealing \nObamaCare, which, after it passed in the Senate, paved a way toward \nfinally putting a repeal bill on the President's desk. This is a key \npromise for congressional Republicans, one that we delivered on just a \nfew short weeks ago.\n  In June, the Finance Committee held a markup where we considered and \nreported 12 separate health care bills representing a number of \npriorities for our committee Members on both sides of the dais. In \nkeeping with the ongoing trend for 2015, all of these bills had \noverwhelming bipartisan support. So far, three of these bills have been \nsigned into law.\n  In addition to these successes, the Finance Committee has spent 2015 \nengaged in some very important ongoing efforts that we believe will \nyield results in the near future. One of those efforts is to improve \nMedicare services for patients living with chronic illnesses. We held \ntwo hearings this year to examine this issue. We sought and received \nthe advice and recommendations of various stakeholders and have \nreleased those recommendations to the public.\n  The committee's efforts on chronic care reflect a bipartisan desire \nto significantly improve the quality of care for Medicare patients at \ngreater value and lower cost, without adding to the deficit. This work \nwill go on into next year as we continue to review and analyze \nproposals with an aim toward developing bipartisan legislation.\n  Another one of our ongoing efforts has been to improve our Nation's \nfoster care system. This year, we held two hearings related to this \ntopic--one on group homes and another on prevention. Last month, \nutilizing what we learned in these hearings and with input from \nnumerous stakeholders, Ranking Member Wyden and I reached an agreement \non legislation that we called the Family First Act, which will increase \nthe availability of prevention services to allow children at risk of \ngoing to foster care to remain safely at home and to reduce the \nreliance on group homes for children under the foster system.\n  As we all know, entering the foster care system can be particularly \ntraumatic for a child. Over the years, we have seen ample evidence \nsuggesting that placement in group homes significantly increases \nchildren's risks and potential for victimization. Our bill would give \nStates greater flexibility, with the goal of keeping children with \nfamily members and ending the overreliance on group homes.\n\n  The Family First Act is supported by advocates and stakeholders \nacross the country. We hope to mark up and report this bipartisan \nlegislation early in the new year.\n  I also need to acknowledge our committee's oversight efforts. We have \nbeen anxiously engaged in numerous efforts on the Finance Committee to \nshine a light on government failures and overreach, as well as some \npotentially corrupt practices in the private sector. Most notably, this \nsummer we concluded our investigation into the IRS's targeting of \nconservative groups. This was the only bipartisan investigation into \nthis scandal, and our report, which was roughly 5,000 pages long, \nprovided the most detail yet about what went on at the IRS and the \nextent of incompetence and bad decisionmaking that led to those \nunfortunate events. In addition, the report provided numerous \nrecommendations for improvement at the IRS and in a number of ways set \nthe stage for consideration of legislation to reform that agency's \noperations.\n  In addition to the IRS report, the committee has provided the most \nrigorous and extensive oversight of the implementation of the so-called \nAffordable Care Act, revealing many of its fundamental flaws and \nuncovering a number of failures and missteps on the part of this \nadministration. This has included, for example, an exhaustive look at \nthe ObamaCare co-ops, which in recent months had been failing at an \nalarming rate at the cost of billions of dollars in taxpayer funds. \nNeedless to say, we haven't taken our eyes off of ObamaCare.\n  The committee has also been conducting ongoing investigations and \noversight into the questionable contracting practices within the \nDepartment of Treasury. We have taken a good, hard look at the tax \nreturn preparation industry and practices that have led to stolen \nidentification and tax refund fraud. In fact, our investigation has \nalready led to new practices at the IRS and within the industry aimed \nat reducing instances of this terrible crime.\n  This is just a small snippet of our oversight efforts over the past \nyear. The Finance Committee, given its massive jurisdiction, has always \nhad a reputation for aggressive oversight, and we have continued that \ntradition, and then some, in 2015.\n  Finally, I just want to remark on one more of our ongoing efforts--I \nsuppose you could put this one in the miscellaneous or multidiscipline \nfile--with regard to the looming debt crisis in Puerto Rico. We have \ntaken a close look at this issue in the committee, and we even held a \nhearing on it. Along with the leaders on the Judiciary and Energy and \nNational Resources Committees, we have introduced legislation that--\nusing the limited information we currently have about Puerto Rico's \ndismal predicament--would improve the island's finances and economy by \nproviding responsible tax relief and transitional assistance to the \nterritory's government.\n  In addition, we worked to get a provision in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill that authorizes the Treasury Department to provide \nPuerto Rico with technical assistance, including help with budgeting, \nforecasting, cash management, fiscal planning, improving tax \ncollections, and the like.\n  This is something we are going to have to continue to work on, and in \nthe coming weeks and months the Finance Committee will continue to \nconsider various proposals--including the bill we introduced last \nweek--aimed at helping the people of Puerto Rico.\n  By the way, we challenged Puerto Rico to give us audited financials \nso that we could really work on this under the best possible terms. I \nintend to see that we help Puerto Rico, and hopefully we can do that. \nWe have now provided them the means so that they should be able to \ncarry on through next February, and hopefully during that time we will \ncome up with some solutions that make sense not only to Puerto Rico but \nto our taxpayers and others.\n  As you can see, we have been very busy and effective in our corner of \nthe Senate thanks to the diligent efforts of all of our Finance \nCommittee members. I have had the privilege of serving\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\nas chairman of this committee during such an eventful and productive \ntime with so many committed and honorable Members of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I, of course, have to thank Ranking Member Wyden for his work on the \ncommittee. He has been a valuable partner, and at every step of the \nway, he has worked hard to ensure that all of the committee's efforts \nwere bipartisan. He has played a huge leadership role in almost all of \nthe successes I have mentioned here today.\n  I also wish to thank the other members of our committee. If you look \ndown the Finance Committee roster, you will see--from top to bottom--\nevery member has a reputation for working hard and achieving results. \nOn the Republican side, we have Senators Grassley, Crapo, Roberts, \nEnzi, Cornyn, Thune, Burr, Isakson, Portman, Toomey, Coats, Heller, and \nScott. They are good people who are working in the best interest of \nthis country. For the Democrats, we have Senators Schumer, Stabenow, \nCantwell, Nelson, Menendez, Carper, Cardin, Brown, Bennet, Casey, and \nWarner. And, of course, we have Senator Wyden. And you can also include \nme in there. Every one of these members has played a key role in our \nsuccess on the Finance Committee, and I am very grateful to have the \nopportunity to work with them all.\n  I don't want this to sound like a farewell speech. I don't want \nanybody to think that with all this gushing and all these thank-yous, \nwe are nearing the end of anything. Last time I checked, I will still \nbe the chairman of the Finance Committee in 2016 and we are still going \nto have this great group of Senators serving on the committee. Most \nsignificantly, our Nation will still be facing a number of important \nchallenges in the coming year. We can't and we won't be sitting on our \nlaurels in 2016.\n  While I am pleased to have this opportunity today to take a short \ntrip down memory lane, everyone both on and off the Finance Committee \nshould be prepared: We are just getting started.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in just the past 10 weeks, Iran has \nconducted two ballistic missile tests. These tests are a direct \nviolation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929. \nDespite this flagrant violation, the U.N. has not taken collective \naction to enforce U.N. Resolution 1929 with increased sanctions against \nIran.\n  Applying sanctions against Iran in response to ballistic missile \ntesting would not violate the Iran nuclear agreement negotiated earlier \nthis year. New sanctions for this type of behavior are not only allowed \nunder the terms of that agreement, in fact, it is critical to the \nagreement's success that the United States be willing to respond to \nIran's bad behavior. In the face of inaction by the international \ncommunity, it is critical that the United States take the lead in \nsending a message to Iran that their inflammatory actions have \nconsequences, whether under the nuclear deal, U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1929, or other U.S. sanctions regimes.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee, I work year-round with my colleague Senator Jeff Sessions \nto oversee the U.S. nuclear arsenal, our nonproliferation programs, and \nalso our missile defense posture. I have long been an advocate for \nrobust, effective missile defense programs against both global and \nregional threats. While I firmly believe those systems are an absolute \nnecessity in the face of evolving threats from places such as North \nKorea and Iran, I also believe they are our last line of defense, not \nour first. Today, thankfully, some of those on the frontlines of the \nfight against Iran's ballistic missile program are also in the State \nDepartment and the Treasury Department.\n  I speak today to call on the administration--if the international \ncommunity will not act together--to take unilateral action readily \navailable to them under current law to respond decisively to Iran's \nballistic missile tests. The administration has made clear that the \nUnited States reserves the right under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction to take action through our sanctions tools in response to Iran's \nsupport for terrorism, its human rights abuses, its illegal arms \ntrafficking, and its ballistic missile program. It is time to back up \nthose words with decisive and specific action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8768-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ADAM SZUBIN\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, in addition, I can't speak today without \nalso raising my deep concerns and increasing disappointment that the \nSenate continues to senselessly delay the confirmation of Adam Szubin \nas Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. Mr. \nSzubin has an impeccable record across both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations for combating terrorist financing and overseeing our \nsanctions against foreign adversaries. He is one of the best tools in \nour toolbox against the likes of Iran, ISIS, and Al Qaeda. Yet, despite \nglowing praise from both sides of the aisle, week after week, month \nafter month, Mr. Szubin's confirmation remains in limbo.\n  This Sunday will mark the 7-month anniversary of Mr. Szubin's \nnomination. In those 7 months, we have watched ISIS spread across Iraq, \nSyria, and beyond. We have seen Iranian funds and weapons continue to \nflow to terrorists across the Middle East. We have witnessed the tragic \nattacks in Paris, San Bernardino, and elsewhere.\n  In an acting capacity, without having received the full support of \nthe U.S. Senate, Mr. Szubin's status and stature is undermined when he \ntravels abroad to persuade allies to cooperate with us in the fight \nagainst terrorism and especially in efforts to go at one of the \nterrorists' Achilles heels: their funding sources.\n  Seven months is too long. Both of Mr. Szubin's recent predecessors \nwere approved over a much shorter period of time. One was approved in \njust 3 weeks.\n  So with the same urgency that I would ask the international community \nto act collectively--and failing that, the administration to \nunilaterally sanction Iran for its flagrant violation of Resolution \n1929--I also urge the Senate to take immediate action to confirm Mr. \nSzubin for a post vital to our national security and one for which he \nis eminently qualified.\n  I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a number of my colleagues will be coming \nto the floor in just a while to talk about the crisis that is going on \nin the island territory of Puerto Rico. Remember, Puerto Rico is a \nterritory. Its citizens are U.S. citizens, and we often forget that, \nparticularly as they are now facing economic challenges that are \ngrowing worse by the day.\n  Although we just had an opportunity in the Omnibus appropriations \nbill to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, it appears that Congress \nis going to go home without having done the bare minimum for Puerto \nRico. In the meantime, Puerto Rico is going to start the New Year on \nthe verge of default as the Governor faces the troubling choice of \nwhether to pay for essential public services or make a $1 billion debt \npayment to Wall Street creditors. The public services include those for \nhealth, fire, police, water, et cetera, versus paying the bonds that \nare coming due.\n  Many of us have been urging our colleagues for months--Senator \nDurbin, Senator Cantwell, Senator Schumer, and myself--to meaningfully \naddress this fiscal crisis by providing Puerto Rico with the same debt \nrestructuring authority that is available to any other State under \nchapter 9 of the\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\nBankruptcy Code. This is the authority that Puerto Rico had until it \nwas taken away by Congress without any explanation 30 years ago.\n  That is why I have joined Senator Cantwell, who is here, and Senators \nSchumer and Blumenthal, in introducing legislation that would allow \nPuerto Rico's municipalities and public corporations to restructure its \ndebt under the watchful eye of the Federal bankruptcy judge.\n  This is not a bailout. Providing Puerto Rico with an opportunity to \norderly manage its debt as we do for every State under chapter 9 of the \nbankruptcy laws costs the Federal Government nothing. It also prevents \nPuerto Rico from having a drawn-out battle with bond holders following \na potential default. Yet nowhere in the Omnibus appropriations bill, \nwhere we have a lot of other stuff--nowhere in the omnibus \nappropriations bill--is there anything to give Puerto Rico the \nlegitimate orderly process of chapter 9 in bankruptcy that it needs. \nThere are a few provisions to help Puerto Rico's hospitals, but even \nthey don't go far enough.\n  It deeply troubles me that we will celebrate the holidays knowing \nfull well that there is so much more that the Congress could have done.\n  I would like to put this in perspective. Just a few weeks ago we met \nwith a group of Floridians who were here for the National Day of Action \nfor Puerto Rico. What they describe--and what this Senator has seen in \na visit to Puerto Rico and the government in San Juan a month ago--is a \nhumanitarian crisis due to the crushing government debt, a failing \neconomy, and a growing poverty.\n  What is the result? Thousands of Puerto Ricans--U.S. citizens--are \ncoming to my State. They are certainly welcome, but these are often the \nvery talented, educated people that are so desperately needed for the \nwell-being of the population on the island. Some that come are \nfortunate to move in with relatives. Others are living in motels. \nOthers are even living out of their cars. A lot of them come to central \nFlorida to the metro Orlando area, where there is a huge Puerto Rican \npopulation. What we see in the discrepancy and the economic despair \nthat is happening on the island is absolutely heartbreaking. How in the \nworld can we fail our fellow Americans like this?\n  Notice who have been the most courageous in the military? It has \noften been the soldiers who are Puerto Rican. These Americans have \ncontributed to the diverse fabric of our country, and they proudly \nserve in so many Federal responsibilities, including our military. We \nshould be doing all that we can to provide them with the tools they \nneed--the financial tools Puerto Rico needs to emerge from its current \neconomic challenges--and debt restructuring authority is one of those \nthings.\n  I want to urge our colleagues, since we didn't get it into the \nomnibus, in the spirit of our patriotic unity to help each other and \nthat unity that binds all Americans, to come together and help Puerto \nRico at this critical time.\n  I see my colleague from the State of Washington. I appreciate the \nleadership that she has taken. My State is one of the ones that is most \naffected. Her State is not as affected, and yet the Senator from \nWashington has stepped up and done this because she knows it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to hearing from the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \ncoming to the floor and speaking so articulately about the need for \nhelp for Puerto Rico. His State is the most impacted State in the \nUnited States when it comes to our policy as it relates to Puerto Rico. \nHe is right that there are not many Puerto Ricans in the State of \nWashington. But as the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources, which has jurisdiction for the territories, I \ncan tell you territorial oversight is about giving people who are U.S. \ncitizens fair access to the law. If we are not going to help people who \nare U.S. citizens have fair access to the law, I am not sure why we are \ncontinuing to say that they are a territory of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  What we are talking about, and the Senator from Florida understands \nthis, is if you don't give them fair treatment under the law, just as \nwe do with individual citizens who need to reorganize their debt, \nbusinesses who need to reorganize their debt, municipalities that need \nto reorganize their debt, or even the United States of America in the \nbig bank bailout basically allowing a lot of people to reorganize their \ndebt, then we won't let the people in Puerto Rico come to a resolution \nof their debt in bankruptcy. It is a hypocrisy that is unexplainable at \nthe moment. We should get to the bottom of this because we want to give \nfair treatment to Puerto Rico so they can solve their own problems.\n  What my colleague mentioned is that a restructuring authority for \nPuerto Rico costs the U.S. taxpayers zero. Zero dollars. That is to \nsay, we are not proposing, at least on our side of the aisle, that we \ngive them immediate funds to restructure. We are simply saying: Give \nthem the tools of bankruptcy so they can restructure. My colleagues \nthink this is important because we know that the mass exodus from \nPuerto Rico, which has been about 300,000 people in the last several \nyears, will continue if we don't give them the tools to reorganize \ntheir debt. What that will mean, as the Senator from Florida mentioned, \nis that people will come in droves to Florida and continue to impact \nthat economy by asking for federal social services that are capped in \nPuerto Rico. They will come to Florida and ask for those services. So \nthe United States, by denying Puerto Rico the bankruptcy tools, \nactually will be impacted economically. Some people have estimated the \nimpact will be as much as $10 to $20 billion over a 10-year period of \ntime. I would say we have a lot of skin in the game to get people to \nreorganize this debt.\n  Many newspapers across the United States also believe that we should \ngive Puerto Rico these tools to reorganize. In an editorial recently in \nthe New York Times, which talked about the President's proposal, it \nsaid: ``Crucially, it asks Congress to change the law so that Puerto \nRico's territorial government and municipalities can seek bankruptcy \nprotection.'' They understood this issue, as did the Washington Post \nwhen they wrote: ``. . . letting an impartial bankruptcy judge sort out \nthe competing claims on a failed public entity is the fairest, most \nefficient approach; without that option, Puerto Rico has no leverage in \ndebt negotiations, and litigation could ensue.''\n  So there are newspapers throughout the United States of America that \nare looking at this issue and saying: Give them the ability to \nreorganize their debt.\n  Why is this so important? Because the Puerto Rican government may \ndefault on its debt as early as January 1, when nearly $1 billion in \npayments are due.\n  Many of us here want to see a resolution of this issue now, giving \nthem the tools to avoid that. Once they default, the economic impact to \nthe rest of us and the U.S. taxpayers will be far greater. Why do I say \nthat? Because if you look at the inaction that takes place, U.S. \ntaxpayers contribute $6.4 billion to Puerto Rico's annual budget, \nfunding these various programs. If you default, that means we will be \nspending more than $6.4 billion.\n  I know some of my colleagues want to protect the hedge funds from \nbeing a part of the bankruptcy reorganization. But, when you are \nprotecting the hedge funds from being a part of the bankruptcy \nreorganization, you are adding costs for the U.S. taxpayers. That is \nsomething we cannot afford.\n  If Puerto Rico is allowed to restructure their debt, they could make \nthese decisions and save us money as U.S. taxpayers. In the long run, \nas I said, it would prevent the mass exodus from the island to many \nother States and provide Puerto Rico with the tools they need. Yet some \nin Congress are more comfortable with inaction, which basically is just \nbad public policy. Why is this? Because 20 to 50 percent of the \nisland's debt is owned by hedge funds. These hedge funds swoop in to \nbuy cheap Puerto Rican debt and are using their influence here in \nWashington, DC, to block Puerto Rico from access to bankruptcy \nprotection that is allowed in other places. It is no secret that the \nsolution will require sacrifice by everyone, and that is what we want \nto see. If\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\nCongress continues to protect these hedge funds and fails to act, it \nwill be at both the expense of the Puerto Rican people, who have \nalready suffered immensely, and of the American taxpayer.\n  Sitting by idly is not a solution. We should remind our colleagues \nthat Puerto Rico had preexisting bankruptcy authority which was taken \naway in 1984, mysteriously. Nobody knows why, or how, or any \njustification for it. They just know that it disappeared. Congress \nshould reinstate that authority that was taken away. As the Governor of \nPuerto Rico said before the energy committee, quoting another leader: \n``Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.''\n  Now is the time to act, before we see a greater mass exodus of \npeople.\n  This chart shows the migration between Puerto Rico and the United \nStates. You see that it continues to grow. It has grown 500 percent in \nthe last 10 years. The issue is that now government workers are being \ncut to three days a week, patients are waiting for months without basic \nmedical care, hospitals are going bankrupt, and the health industry is \nabout to collapse.\n  On the other side of the aisle there is talk about the humanitarian \ncrisis that might occur next year and how they might want to respond to \nit, but they don't want to stand up and say to the hedge funds that \nthey also have to take some responsibility in this issue. Forty-five \npercent of the population in Puerto Rico is now living in poverty, \nincluding 58 percent who are children. Unemployment is in double \ndigits, and it is, if you compare it to all our States, very high in \nthe ranking of States in the United States. As a result, 80,000 people \nare leaving the island each year as part of a mass migration.\n  So what is the solution? As we said: Restructure their debt; give \nthem the tools to restructure their debt. It costs nothing to the U.S. \ntaxpayer, saves us money in the long run, prevents a mass exodus from \nthe island, and prevents more spending on Federal benefits to people \nwho might migrate to the United States.\n  We think this ought to be a lot of motivation to sit down and solve \nthis issue today. In fact, now we are hearing from different \nbusinesses, and I will submit one letter for the Record, in the United \nStates that do business in Puerto Rico and that don't want to lose \ntheir investment because they are so concerned about the level of \ncollapse that could happen in Puerto Rico, and the loss of \ninfrastructure and infrastructure investment.\n  So why do we need to continue to move forward? Well, inaction, \nbasically, is to say that the hedge funds have won in this game. Twenty \nto fifty percent of the island's debt is owned by the hedge funds, and \nhedge funds are using their influence in Washington to block a Puerto \nRico bill from coming to the floor. Failure to act would be at the \nexpense, as I said, of taxpayers and individuals.\n  Just yesterday, a leader who has been supportive of reorganization of \na task force in New York that was under a budget crisis said: ``The \nhedge funds got their way in Congress.'' That is referring to the fact \nthat we were not able to get, as my colleague from Florida said, this \nlegislation as part of the budget omnibus bill or other bills moving \nthrough the process.\n  So now is the time to act to give Puerto Rico the tools. Now is the \ntime for all of those who have made investments to say ``we all have to \ncome to the table and resolve this issue.'' The longer we wait, the \ngreater the risk for the United States of America--to say nothing of \nthe issue of a territory that we lay claim to, giving them the ability \nto solve their problems.\n  I ask my colleagues to come to a commonsense resolution on this \nissue. Stop protecting these hedge funds and start working for people \nwho are called U.S. citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe articles and the letter I mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 24, 2015]\n\n                     A Rescue Plan for Puerto Rico\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       There was long-overdue drama at a Capitol Hill hearing \n     Thursday. We are referring, of course, to Treasury Department \n     counselor Antonio Weiss's testimony before the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in which he warned \n     of a looming ``humanitarian crisis'' in the financially \n     distressed commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Mr. Weiss's words \n     marked a break with the Obama administration's previous low-\n     key approach to the island's debt crisis, and if he resorted \n     to hyperbole to compensate for that, it was only slightly. \n     Having already cut spending, jacked up taxes and postponed \n     various bill payments, Puerto Rico is out of cash and facing \n     a year-end liquidity crunch that could lead to a breakdown in \n     public services, or even public order.\n       Mr. Weiss backed up his words with the administration's \n     most comprehensive policy proposals yet, the most important \n     of which would require congressional action. Specifically, he \n     advocated not only permitting Puerto Rico's municipalities \n     and public corporations to file for bankruptcy, which would \n     affect about a third of its $73 billion debt, but also \n     extending the bankruptcy option to the commonwealth \n     government itself. He called for a permanent fix to the \n     island's Medicaid program, which faces crippling uncertainty \n     because of limits on federal assistance unlike those of the \n     50 states. And to address its lagging labor force \n     participation--a huge drag on economic growth--he proposed \n     creating an Earned Income Tax Credit to encourage low-wage \n     workers' return to the job market.\n       In short, for the first time the executive branch has put \n     its weight behind solutions that would cost money, billions \n     of dollars of it. A good benchmark would be Gov. Alejandro \n     Garcia-Padilla's projection of a $14 billion hole in the \n     island's finances over the next five years. The \n     administration's plans for Medicaid and an EITC would put \n     U.S. taxpayers on the hook. Bankruptcy would be the mechanism \n     through which creditors chip in; an average 40 percent \n     ``haircut'' on their bonds is probably in order, according to \n     a recent study by BlackRock. As the example of Detroit shows, \n     letting an impartial bankruptcy judge sort out the competing \n     claims on a failed public entity is the fairest, most \n     efficient approach; without that option, Puerto Rico has no \n     leverage in debt negotiations, and litigation could ensue.\n       Which brings us to what can fairly be expected of the \n     commonwealth itself. Its predicament is due to many forces \n     beyond its control, starting with the anomalous semi-\n     sovereign political status that traps it--like Greece in the \n     European Union--in a monetary union with the far larger and \n     more competitive United States. Still, Puerto Rico has \n     squandered vast resources on mismanagement and anti-growth \n     policies. Therefore, it may appropriately be held to a \n     structural adjustment program that ensures it uses fresh cash \n     efficiently. For that program, in turn, to have credibility, \n     it must be subject to oversight by a truly independent body; \n     indeed, if oversight doesn't work, nothing in Mr. Weiss's \n     plan can work, either economically or politically, since buy-\n     in from Republican fiscal hawks is needed. Designing that \n     institution is the task to which Congress, Puerto Rico and \n     the administration must now turn in a spirit of cooperation, \n     but also urgency.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 24, 2015]\n\n                 Save Puerto Rico Before It Goes Broke\n\n                        (By the Editorial Board)\n\n       Puerto Rico's government is on the verge of running out of \n     money. A messy default is in nobody's interest, which is why \n     Congress ought to move swiftly to provide the American \n     territory with a way to restructure its huge debt and revive \n     its economy.\n       The Obama administration last week offered the outline of a \n     rescue plan to help the island and the 3.5 million American \n     citizens who live there. The plan would impose new oversight \n     on the island's finances and expand access to government \n     programs like Medicaid and the earned-income tax credit. \n     Crucially, it asks Congress to change the law so that Puerto \n     Rico's territorial government and its municipalities can seek \n     bankruptcy protection.\n       Political leaders in Puerto Rico and many financial and \n     legal experts have been saying for months that the territory \n     cannot repay the approximately $72 billion it owes to hedge \n     funds, mutual funds and other investors. Its economy is not \n     growing, and tens of thousands of residents are leaving every \n     year for the mainland to look for work. More than 300,000 \n     have left in the last 10 years.\n       Its public pension plans need a cash infusion of about $44 \n     billion. Puerto Rico has cut spending and raised taxes in the \n     hope of saving itself, but that hasn't worked, and it won't \n     work in the foreseeable future given the sorry state of the \n     island's economy.\n       Bankruptcy seems inevitable. But under federal law, Puerto \n     Rico's government, its municipalities and its government-\n     owned utilities cannot go to bankruptcy court--hence the \n     administration's request for a new bankruptcy process for \n     territorial governments and a change in the law to allow \n     Puerto Rican cities and public utilities to seek Chapter 9 \n     protection, much as local governments like Detroit and Orange \n     County, Calif., have done.\n       Many investors who have lent money to Puerto Rico and stand \n     to lose under any debt restructuring are bitterly opposed to \n     the Obama plan. They say Puerto Rico can repay all of its \n     debt if it tightens its belt and privatizes utilities and \n     other government-owned businesses. Changing the law now, they \n     argue, is deeply unfair. But the record\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\n     of what has happened in troubled countries like Greece is \n     clear: Austerity policies have only worsened the crisis. As \n     for the fairness argument, legislators change laws all the \n     time to meet new circumstances.\n       What investors must realize is that an orderly \n     restructuring is a far better alternative than the long and \n     complex legal battles that would inevitably follow a sudden \n     default. American bankruptcy courts have a good track record \n     of resolving complicated debt cases. And if, in addition to \n     reworking the bankruptcy law, Congress also created an \n     oversight board, as the Obama administration recommends, \n     investors could have some confidence that Puerto Rico's \n     politicians would make needed policy changes.\n       There is no doubt that Puerto Rican leaders have mismanaged \n     the island's finances and economy. What's at issue now, \n     though, is not Puerto Rico's past but its future and that of \n     its inhabitants. If Congress doesn't like the \n     administration's ideas, it needs to come up with its own.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House Minority Leader, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker, Leader Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and \n     Leader Reid: As senior executives of companies that are based \n     in the U.S. mainland and that conduct extensive business in \n     the U.S. jurisdiction of Puerto Rico, we write to \n     respectfully urge you to swiftly enact a legislative package \n     that will promote economic growth and fiscal stability in the \n     territory.\n       We are extremely concerned about the situation in Puerto \n     Rico for both humanitarian and business reasons. The current \n     economic, fiscal and demographic crisis is harming the 3.5 \n     million U.S. citizens that reside on the island, compromising \n     their quality of life and causing thousands to relocate to \n     the U.S. mainland in search of better opportunities. It is \n     also hurting private sector businesses that manufacture \n     products in Puerto Rico, depend upon Puerto Rico's consumer \n     base, or seek to contract with the central government of \n     Puerto Rico or its public corporations to provide public \n     services on a more cost-efficient basis.\n       This letter is also endorsed by the Jacksonville Port \n     Authority (JAXPORT), which is the U.S. mainland hub for trade \n     with Puerto Rico. Roughly 70% of all cargo shipped from the \n     U.S. mainland to Puerto Rico goes through JAXPORT. This trade \n     is responsible for 32,000 jobs in the State of Florida alone.\n       We understand that the causes of Puerto Rico's problems are \n     complex and multifaceted. But we also believe that action by \n     the federal government is essential to enable Puerto Rico to \n     address these problems. There are many specific steps that \n     Congress could take, such as (1) fully including Puerto Rico \n     in the earned income tax credit program and the child tax \n     credit program, which incentivize work and spur consumer \n     demand; (2) providing more equitable treatment to Puerto Rico \n     under federal programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which \n     would improve patient care, reduce migration, and relieve the \n     fiscal burden on the Puerto Rico government; and (3) \n     providing Puerto Rico with state-like treatment under Chapter \n     9 of the federal bankruptcy code, which would help Puerto \n     Rico manage its debt burden and position the island to \n     achieve economic growth in the future.\n       We thank you for your consideration of this important \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel Davis,\n       President & CEO, JAX Chamber.\n     Michael G. Roberts,\n       Senior Vice President & General Counsel, Crowley Maritime \n     Corporation.\n     Tim Nolan,\n       President, TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico.\n     Brian Taylor,\n       Chief Executive Officer, Jacksonville Port Authority \n     (JAXPORT).\n     John P. Hourihan, Jr.,\n       Senior Vice President & General Manager, Crowley Puerto \n     Rico Services.\n     Thomas J. Alcide,\n       President, Saft America.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor to any of \nmy other colleagues who have come to the floor to join us.\n  The Senator from New Jersey probably has the second most, if not the \nmost, number of Puerto Ricans in his State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished senior \nDemocrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which has \njurisdiction over the territories, including Puerto Rico, for her \nadvocacy, for her strength of passion in this effort, and for her work. \nI also thank my colleague from Florida who has always joined me on \nissues on Puerto Rico and who has always been a strong voice for the \nisland.\n  I would hope to prick the conscience of the Senate about the 3.5 \nmillion U.S. citizens who just happen to live on the island of Puerto \nRico and to do something before this crisis transforms into a full-\nblown human catastrophe. These 3.5 million Americans who call Puerto \nRico home have a long history with the United States. Over 200,000 of \nthem have served in every conflict since World War I and worn the \nuniform of the United States.\n  Over 20,000 of them currently wear the uniform of the United States \nand put their lives at risk for the safety and security of all of us \nhere at home. They are stationed across the globe.\n  If you went with me--and I invite any colleague who wants to go to \nthe Vietnam Memorial--you would see a disproportionate number of Puerto \nRicans who served in the Vietnam war and gave their lives on behalf of \nthe country. Puerto Rico is an integral part of America and its people \nare as American as you and I. They have full citizenship rights. The \nstatus of where they live does not alter their rights under the \nConstitution, and the fiscal timebomb that is waiting to explode in \nPuerto Rico is an American problem.\n  In my time in the House of Representatives, I could never believe it \nwhen I would have colleagues who asked me if they needed a passport to \nvisit Puerto Rico. I thought they were joking, but they were serious. \nThis is an American problem.\n  We not only have an opportunity, but more importantly I think we have \na responsibility to take immediate action to stabilize the island and \ngive our fellow citizens the opportunity to fix the current crisis, but \ninstead of deescalating the crisis, we are demagoguing those who are \nfacing it. Instead of providing the tools Puerto Rico needs to get on \nthe path to solvency, we are tying our hands behind our backs.\n  So let me put this plainly and simply: Puerto Rico is getting a raw \ndeal. While we dither here, the island is economically in flames. We \nare about to spend over $600 billion in tax breaks but denied the \nearned-income tax credit and child tax credit equity for American \ncitizens living in Puerto Rico. We are about to pass a $1.1 trillion \nbudget but ignored pleas on the island to receive the same chapter 9 \ntreatment in bankruptcy to reorganize and restructure their debt that \nany State has and that they had at one time and was surreptitiously \ntaken out. That right that they had was taken out.\n  As has been said by the distinguished ranking member, giving Puerto \nRico back the right they had will not cost the American taxpayer one \nsingle dime. Those bottom feeders who ultimately went and tried to buy \nenough bonds dirt cheap and now want to get paid at maximum amount, \nthat should not be where the focus of the Senate is when it comes to \nthese 3.5 million Americans. I am wondering if it was some other group \nof people, whether we would feel the same way. I really have to wonder. \nWe are about to increase Big Oil's profits by about $170 billion over \nthe next decade, but we can't do anything for the 3.5 million people \nwho call Puerto Rico home, who are U.S. citizens, and who wear the \nuniform of the United States.\n  I am pleased to see that the legislation will include a little piece \nof my high-tech legislation to help the hospitals in Puerto Rico, but \nthat is not going to do anything as it relates to the crisis we are \nfacing. This crisis didn't develop overnight--it was over several \nadministrations--nor will it be fixed in a day. Governor Padilla and \nthe Government of Puerto Rico have done everything they can to right \nthe ship and restore a path to solvency. They have closed schools and \nhospitals. They have laid off police and firefighters. They have raised \ntaxes on businesses and individuals. They have gone beyond what any \nsovereign nation would consider doing to right the economic status, but \nthey are out of options.\n  All the cuts and tax hikes will not make a dent in this crisis \nwithout the breathing room that restructuring authority provides. That \nis all we are asking for, not a single cost to the American paper. This \nproblem is not\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\ngoing away. Mark my words, if we don't act now, this crisis will \nexplode into a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe that isn't going to \ntake a year or months. It is going to be right around the corner.\n  It is pretty amazing that instead of dealing with this issue in a way \nin which we can solve it, we are basically--it is the equivalent of \nwaiting for a malignant tumor to metastasize before we actually act on \nit. That is what we are doing. The sooner you act, the higher your \nchances of success are, and that is no different in the case of Puerto \nRico. They are not asking us to pull them out of this hole. They are \nsimply saying give us the tools so we can do it on our own.\n  It is the same can-do spirit of the Borinqueneers, who served our \ncountry during the Korean war--an all-Puerto Rican division, the most \nhighly decorated in U.S. military history who said: Just give us the \ntools and we will fight for our Nation--or NASA engineer and \nExceptional Achievement Medal winner Dr. Carlos Ortiz Longo or the \nbaseball great and philanthropist, Roberto Clemente. I could go on and \non about the contributions of Americans of Puerto Rican descent to this \ncountry. Just give them the tools.\n  Instead, this Congress is going to go home for the holidays and say \nto Puerto Rico: You get coal in your stocking, instead of giving them \nthe tools to help them be able to face a better day. At the end of the \nday, believe me, if we do not act, more will come to Senator Nelson's \nState of Florida, more of them will come to New Jersey, more of them \nwill come to New York, more of them will come to Ohio, and more of them \nwill come to Pennsylvania--which are some of the largest concentrations \nin the Nation--because they are U.S. citizens. When they come, they \nwill have the rights to everything that every other citizen has.\n  That is the reality, and I cannot imagine why our friends on the \nRepublican side cannot get to the point of understanding that these 3.5 \nmillion residents of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens. They fought for \ntheir country, died for their country, shed blood for the country, have \nbeen maimed for the country, and yet we just can't give them the tools \nto get themselves into fiscal order again.\n  It is pretty amazing. It is pretty amazing that we will leave for the \nholidays and actually have for some--not for those of us on the floor--\nbut for some no regret that we are leaving those 3.5 million U.S. \ncitizens without any options.\n  I don't believe in leaving any American behind. That is why I have \nvoted on this floor for flood damage in the Mississippi. That is why I \nvoted for wildfires in the West, to help them be dealt with. That is \nwhy I voted for crop damage. I have been there because I believe there \nis a reason we call this the United States of America. Puerto Ricans, \nin terms of their citizenship, they are U.S. citizens. They deserve the \nsame rights as anyone else.\n  With that, I see my distinguished friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, who I know feels very passionately--the way I do--about \nthis issue, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am inspired by the very eloquent \nwords of my colleague from New Jersey and others, from Senator Nelson \nof Florida and particularly from Senator Cantwell, and thank them for \nchampioning this cause.\n  I am inspired by those words to begin with a story. My visit to \nPuerto Rico to the association headquarters of the Borinqueneers--\nmembers of generations who have fought for this country, veterans of \nour wars, who had visited the White House to receive the Congressional \nMedal that we in this body voted to award them because of their service \nto our Nation. It was awarded by the President of the United States \nwhen they visited the White House. I visited them in Puerto Rico to say \nthank you and to recognize their service. I can tell you at the White \nHouse and in Puerto Rico what I saw in their faces and heard in their \nvoices was a patriotism every bit as deep and passionate as any I have \nheard anywhere in this country. Puerto Ricans are not only Americans, \nthey are proud to be American, and we should be proud they are \nAmericans because they are hard-working, dedicated, and they believe in \ngiving back to America.\n  My friend from New Jersey has said that Puerto Rico is receiving a \nraw deal, and he is right. It is a raw deal and an unfair deal because \nthe people of Puerto Rico find themselves in an untenable financial \nsituation in large part due to circumstances beyond their control. In \nfact, in some instances, actions of this very body, in tax policies and \nhealth care program decisions, put them at a disadvantage and \ncontributed to the fiscal situation that has put them and their economy \nin free fall today.\n  So 2.5 percent of Puerto Rico's population has fled the island in \njust the last year. If Puerto Rico defaults and that default is \npermitted to continue, the ramification of additional people fleeing \nthe island and the financial markets feeling the effects of that \ndefault will be horrendous.\n  The day of reckoning for Puerto Rico is inescapable. The only \nquestion is whether it occurs in the courts with endless, costly \nlitigation that enriches lawyers--let's face it, the lawyers will be \nbetter off if there is no orderly and structured process--or, when that \nday of reckoning occurs, in the bankruptcy courts where it can be \norderly and structured and less costly. This body, the U.S. Senate, has \nthe responsibility to extend to Puerto Rico the same treatment under \nChapter 9 that any municipality and utility has around the country--\nnothing more, nothing less.\n  The people of Puerto Rico are already suffering because of the \nuncertainty of their financial situation. That uncertainty in turn is \nalready costing them because the borrowing costs are rising as a \ndisorderly default faces them. To simply provide more money is not the \nanswer. There has to be a structure for orderly and planned payment of \ndebts that are due. Right now, Puerto Rico is insolvent. It can't pay \nits debts on time, and that is the definition of default. Bankruptcy is \nnot a safety net. It is not a bailout. It is, in fact, a reckoning.\n  There has been some talk here about who is responsible. There is no \nquestion that some stand to profit if there is chaos--not just lawyers, \nbut some of the financial interests who are holding certain of the \nfinancial instruments. We don't need to name names or blame them. What \nwe need to do here is to solve a problem and make sure that Puerto Rico \nis treated fairly and that it is spared this raw deal that will have \nramifications for the entire United States of America--for our \nfinancial markets, for our communities, and for the people of Puerto \nRico who have families here and who will come here themselves.\n  I hope we will do the right thing even in the hours--and there are \njust hours--left before the end of this year. There is too much at \nstake for either partisan differences or special interests to dictate \nthe result. The day of reckoning is here. It is just a question of \nwhere it occurs--in a bankruptcy court or in endless litigation that is \ncostly to Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans and all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues in this \nstatement on the floor relative to the situation in Puerto Rico. I \ncommend Senator Cantwell as well as Senator Blumenthal, who is a lead \ncosponsor of the bill that I am cosponsoring, as well as Senator Nelson \nof Florida, who has a special interest with so many Puerto Ricans in \nhis State, and, of course, Senator Menendez of New Jersey with the same \ninterest. I share it. It is a feeling that is based on some friendships \nwith Members of Congress of Puerto Rican descent, particularly my \nfriend and colleague from Illinois, Luis Gutierrez, but many others, \nsuch as Nydia Velazquez and Jose Serrano of New York. I have served \nwith all of them, and I understand the deep personal feelings they have \nabout the situation.\n  The financial crisis facing Puerto Rico and its 3.5 million residents \nwho are U.S. citizens demands that we not walk away but address this in \nan honest way. Congress is working to complete its legislative \nbusiness, and it is deeply troubling that at this point we are \npreparing to leave town without resolving Puerto Rico's urgent \nsituation.\n  The challenges facing Puerto Rico are very serious. The island has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\nmired in an economic recession for more than a decade. Their \nunemployment rate is nearly 12 percent and the poverty rate is almost \n45 percent. Tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans are leaving the island \neach year and, as Senator Blumenthal said, 2.5 percent of the \npopulation left just this last year. That is the reality of this \neconomic challenge. If we don't help Puerto Rico get back on its feet, \nstabilize, and grow its own economy, the alternative, sadly, will be \nmany more people coming to the United States. If they wish to come, \nthat is certainly their right, but we don't want to force them to come \nto this country because of dire economic circumstances in Puerto Rico \nthat can be avoided.\n  The island has over $70 billion in outstanding debt. According to \nMoody's, this debt load is approximately 100 percent of Puerto Rican's \nisland's gross national product. Moody's also found that in fiscal year \n2015, the debt service of the territory and its agencies amounted to \nalmost 40 percent of the revenues available to the government--compared \nto an average in most States of 5 percent.\n  I noted an article in the Wall Street Journal not that long ago that \nquarreled with this 40 percent figure. They said it was less than half \nof that amount, and, therefore, it wasn't a dire situation. Yet we had \na hearing before the Judiciary Committee with experts present, and it \nwas very clear that 40 percent is a valid figure, not arrived at by \npolitical figures but by Moody's, a firm that is supposed to be expert \nin reaching that conclusion.\n  The Puerto Rican government was able to make large debt payments on \nDecember 1 only through some very contorted fiscal determinations. But \nanother debt payment of $332 million looms on January 1, and a default \nis a real possibility.\n  We had this hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. It was an \neye opener. One of the witnesses that I remember specifically is \nRichard Carrion, the executive chairman of Puerto Rico's largest bank, \nBanco Popular. He testified that, as a banker, it was truly painful for \nhim to ever talk about bankruptcy and not paying their debts. But Mr. \nCarrion went on to say that there needs to be some kind of bankruptcy \nor restructuring regime made available for Puerto Rico because the \nmoney just isn't there.\n  If Puerto Rico goes into default, the ramifications are frightening. \nNot only would a default threaten the island's fiscal stability, but it \nwould also cause a humanitarian crisis where we have such a high rate \nof poverty. It would threaten access to essential services, such as \neducation and even basic utilities.\n  It is true that there are a lot of factors that contributed to this \nfinancial situation, and there is no silver bullet to fix all of these \nproblems. But one step that would certainly help is to allow Puerto \nRico to use Chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy Code, and that is what Senator \nBlumenthal's legislation proposes.\n  About $20 billion of Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt is debt issued by \nmunicipalities and public corporations. Chapter 9 creates a mechanism \nfor a State to allow a municipality or public corporation to \nrestructure its debts in bankruptcy. This authority has been used over \nand over again, but Congress passed an unusual law in 1984, which no \none has been able to explain. It contained a provision that excluded \nPuerto Rico specifically from Chapter 9. No other State or territory \nwas excluded except Puerto Rico. There is no legislative history to \nexplain why Puerto Rico was singled out.\n  It appears that the bar on Puerto Rico using Chapter 9 bankruptcy was \neither an error or it was an intentional discrimination against this \nterritory and its 3.5 million American citizen residents. Either way, \nit is time we correct this inequity, if not for the simple fairness of \nthe argument, then for the point being made by Senator Blumenthal \nearlier: So many of these Puerto Rican residents have literally risked \nand given their lives in defense of the United States. There is \nabsolutely no excuse for discriminating against these people.\n  I am a cosponsor of Senator Blumenthal's bill that would allow Puerto \nRico to use Chapter 9. This would create a backstop to address a \nsignificant portion of Puerto Rico's debt.\n  The availability of a bankruptcy process would also create an \nincentive for creditors, bondholders, and others to negotiate voluntary \nrestructuring. The option of bankruptcy helps bring all the parties to \nthe negotiating table because typically it is a dose of reality.\n  I regret that not a single Republican has been willing to cosponsor \nthis bill, and I don't get it. I just don't understand it. I regret \nthat the Republican majority has been unwilling to bring the issue of \nPuerto Rico bankruptcy reform to the Senate floor. It should have been \nbrought to the floor. It is timely, and it is important. Nobody wants \nto encourage bankruptcy, but the Founding Fathers recognized the \nimportance of this legal option in giving individuals and institutions \nthe ability to dig out of debt in an orderly fashion. That is why \nCongress's power to enact bankruptcy laws was actually written into the \nConstitution.\n  Furthermore, the bankruptcy process is well-known and understood. It \nis not a Federal bailout because it won't cost the taxpayers a dime if \nPuerto Rico chooses bankruptcy. In contrast, if Puerto Rico defaults, \nwe will face a new, uncertain future that may well require Federal \ncorrective action and may cost money. These steps likely would be far \nmore upsetting to creditors and taxpayers in the United States than any \nbankruptcy process.\n  We know that bankruptcy reform is not the silver bullet solution. \nThere are other steps that should be taken when it comes to tax laws, \nhealth care reform, and fiscal oversight that would help Puerto Rico. \nBut it is clear that Congress has to act.\n  I want to commend my colleagues again for joining me on the floor to \nraise this important issue. We cannot ignore this crisis. Puerto Ricans \nare American citizens. Puerto Rico's challenges are America's \nchallenges. And the clock is literally ticking.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to support Senator Blumenthal. This \nmodest bankruptcy reform bill will help us step forward to solve this \nproblem. We need to work with the administration and with both \npolitical parties to chart a fair and responsible path forward for \nPuerto Rico.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, here we are again: another year of \nlegislative dysfunction capped by an undemocratic, unrepublican process \nthat uses the threat of another manufactured crisis to impose on an \nunwilling country the same broken government policies that have \nrepeatedly failed the people they are supposed to serve.\n  The bills moving through Congress today and tomorrow, made up of the \nomnibus spending bill and the tax extenders package, and the process \nthat produced it are an affront to the Constitution--to the very idea \nof constitutionalism--and an insult to the American people we were \nelected to represent.\n  I am not even talking about the substance of the bill, which is bad \nenough and which I will get to in just a moment. I am talking about the \nway it was produced. A small handful of leaders from the two parties \ngot together behind closed doors to decide what the Nation's taxing and \nspending policies will be for the next year. Then, after several weeks, \nthe negotiators emerged, grand bargain in hand, confident the people \nthey deliberately excluded from the policymaking process would now \nsupport all 2,242 pages of the legislative leviathan that they cooked \nup. This is not how a self-governing--or a self-respecting--institution \noperates, and everyone here knows it.\n  The leaders who presided over these negotiations were elected, just \nlike the rest of us, to represent the people residing in their State or \ncongressional district and not the entire population of the country. \nYet they excluded 99 percent of the country from this process, as if \ntheir representatives are just partisan seals trained to bark and clap \non cue for their leaders.\n  That anyone is celebrating this bill as some kind of achievement is \nfurther evidence of how out of touch Washington has truly become. \nIndeed, the very premise of this process--that the established leaders \nof the two parties\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\ncan accurately and fairly represent 320 million Americans--is itself \nabsurd. This isn't just my opinion; it is the opinion of the vast and \nbipartisan majority of our constituents.\n  Seventy percent of the American people think the country is on the \nwrong track, and Congress, for its part, is the least trusted \ninstitution in this country. A dwindling minority of Americans trust \nthe Federal Government to do what is right for the country.\n  The country doesn't trust us or respect us. And if we pass this bill \nand assent to the secretive, undemocratic process behind it, we will be \ntelling the country, loud and clear, that the feeling is mutual. All of \nthis is before we even get into the substance of this bill. We are \nbeing told that the omnibus and tax extenders grand bargain is a \nlegislative accomplishment of the highest order--some kind of shining \nexample of what can happen when the two parties in Washington come to \ntogether to ``get things done.'' In a sense, I don't disagree. This \nbill is the textbook example of how Washington actually works, and that \nis precisely the problem because all too often, when Washington works, \nit does so not for American families, workers, or future generations, \nbut for political elites and the sprawling ecosystem of lobbyists and \nspecial interests that subsist on the Federal Government's largesse.\n\n  This bill is a case study of Washington's bipartisan bargains turning \ninto special interest bonanzas. Like so many policies that come out of \nCongress today, the omnibus and tax extenders have something for \neveryone.\n  Maybe you are a Puerto Rican rum distributor or exporter. If you are, \nthis bill has you covered. It renews an underhanded tax scheme whereby \nthe United States imposes artificially high import taxes on rum from \nPuerto Rico and then sends the proceeds back to the island's \ngovernment.\n  Perhaps you own a stable, multimillion-dollar racehorses, or maybe a \nNASCAR speedway. In either case, you are in luck, too, because this \nbill maintains the profitable accelerated depreciation schedules carved \nout in the Tax Code just for you.\n  Maybe you run a salmon fishery and you are concerned about \ngenetically engineered salmon cutting into your market share. Don't \nworry, there is something in this bill for you, too--a provision that \nempowers the Food and Drug Administration to use its regulatory powers \nto block genetically engineered salmon from hitting the grocery store \nshelves.\n  Puerto Rican rum exporters, racehorse owners and breeders, speedway \nowners, salmon fishermen--this bill has something for everyone except \nfor one group: the hard-working individuals and families living in one \nof America's forgotten communities left behind by Washington, DC's, \nbroken status quo.\n  I will be the first to admit there are some laudable provisions in \nboth the spending and the tax bill that make some important policy \nreforms. There is the 2-year moratorium on ObamaCare's ill-conceived \nmedical device tax and the defunding of ObamaCare's cronyist Risk \nCorridor Program. There is the lifting of the government's foolish ban \non crude oil exports and the extension of several sound tax provisions \nthat never should have been temporary in the first place. But the \nprocess has been rigged so that we can't vote on these commendable \npolicy reforms by themselves. In fact, we can't vote for any one of \nthese sensible, positive reforms without also voting for each and every \ndysfunctional, irresponsible, and unsustainable policy found in the \n2,000-page bill--a bill, by the way, we received 36 hours ago--nor, it \nappears, will we have the opportunity to amend a single provision found \nwithin this massive legislation.\n  This is a ``take it or leave it'' proposition. That means no up-or-\ndown votes on controversial provisions that Members of the House and \nSenate as of 36 hours ago had no idea were going to be in this bill. \nThere will be no up-or-down vote on the President's controversial Green \nClimate Fund; the unpopular and unwise cyber security measure; the \ndivisive rules promoted by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment; and the backdoor tweaks to the H-2B immigration visa \nprogram--all hidden within the pages of this bill, none of which saw \nthe light of day, none of which saw committee action, none of which had \nthe opportunity to be debated and discussed and changed, improved, \namended until 36 hours ago and still will have no opportunity to be \nchanged, improved, or amended even after they hit the floor.\n  We will not have a chance to add the priorities of the more than 500 \nMembers of Congress who were not in the negotiating room. So all \nMembers who weren't there are left out of the process altogether. For \ninstance, Members of Congress from Western States, including my home \nState of Utah, have been working tirelessly for months on a provision \nto prohibit the Bureau of Land Management from using government funds \nto implement the Bureau's land-use plans in the nearly 67 million acres \nof sage grouse habitat situated on western Federal lands.\n  Amendments to strike or to add those provisions might have succeeded \nor they might have failed, but either way, the American people at least \nwould have known where their representatives stood on these issues. \nWith that transparency comes accountability, credibility, and \nultimately trust. If the House and Senate actually voted for these \nmeasures as amendments to the spending bill, I might not like it, but \nit would at least put the question back into the hands of the American \npeople and their elected representatives instead of deliberately taking \nit from them.\n  Our credibility is on the line here. There is still time to get it \nback. We can still fix this. We can hit the reset button. We can pass a \nshort-term, stopgap spending bill and then come back to this in the new \nyear and give it the time it deserves, approach this with the kind of \nprocess for which this body has always up until now been known. Give \nthe American people back their voice. Let's keep the government funded \nbut buy ourselves more time so that this can be debated, discussed, \nimproved, changed, and, where appropriate, amended.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8774-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8774-S8776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OMNIBUS TAX PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon \nto talk about the tax provisions in the agreement before us. I want to \nstart by making sure that people understand what this is really all \nabout. This is the biggest bipartisan package that provides real tax \nrelief for working families in literally decades. It is the biggest \nanti-poverty program Congress has moved forward in decades. So being \nable to do all of this for working families and help millions of \nAmericans find their way out of poverty is, in my view, something \nparticularly important--the largest bipartisan tax agreement in 15 \nyears.\n  I want to spend a few minutes describing how this came together, why \nit is such an important piece of legislation, and what it means for the \ncause of tax reform.\n  Hundreds of thousands of Oregonians and millions of families across \nthe land count on the child tax credit and the earned-income tax credit \nto make ends meet. More than 100,000 Oregon students and millions of \nstudents nationwide count on the American opportunity tax credit to \nhelp them pay for college. These are concerns Senator Merkley and I \nheard directly from students at the roundtables we held recently at the \nUniversity of Oregon and at Southern Oregon University. In my view, \nthey are bedrock priorities for working families when it comes to \ntaxes.\n  Starting more than a year ago, all of my Democratic colleagues on the \nFinance Committee came together around the principle that when Congress \ntook up the temporary tax cuts known as extenders, these vital \nindividual tax incentives for working families would be our special \npriority. If our colleagues on the other side insisted on making \ncertain business-related tax breaks permanent, we were going to make \nclear at every single opportunity that the tax cuts for working \nfamilies and students would have to be made permanent as well.\n  Back in 2009 when these working family tax cuts were actually \nexpanded, there were some Members here in the Senate who said they \nwould never allow them to become permanent. In effect, what they said \nis that\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\nworking families would get a little bit of relief back then in 2009 but \nthat would be it for those working families. We said that is not good \nenough. We said that without the certainty of permanent extensions, too \nmany families across this country would be thrown into the dark as the \nprovisions expired over and over again.\n  Advocates for those who walk an economic tightrope, balancing their \nfood against their fuel and their fuel against their medical care--over \n130 groups who advocate for those working families wrote a letter \nurging lawmakers to make the working family credits permanent. They \nsaid: Don't keep those families guessing about their taxes; give them \ncertainty and assistance on a permanent basis. That is what this \npackage does. There is a new measure of certainty and predictability \nwhen it comes to taxes. The last tax bill in America passed just over a \nyear ago. It had a shelf life shorter than a carton of eggs. What we \nare doing with this bill is providing an alternative--an alternative \nwith real certainty and predictability on a permanent basis.\n  I see my colleague Senator Brown here. He has done yeoman's work in \nadvocating for working families and their kids. I so appreciate his \nleadership.\n  Suffice it to say that what we just heard from the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities is that 16 million Americans, including 8 million \nchildren, will be lifted from the depth of poverty or out of poverty \naltogether in 2018 and beyond because of this legislation.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the former chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  About a year ago, when it wasn't so clear at all that the earned-\nincome tax credit, which, according to President Reagan and most \nPresidents of both parties since, has been the most effective tool to \nfight poverty in recent memory--I would also say Social Security and \nMedicare, of course--what the earned-income tax credit, coupled with \nthe child tax credit, has done is it has rewarded work, helped people \nwho are making $9, $10, $12 an hour, sometimes working two jobs--it has \nhelped lift them out of poverty because they simply don't make enough \nmoney to be able to live a decent standard of living if they are making \n$9 an hour.\n  When it wasn't at all clear that the earned-income tax credit \nwouldn't expire in the next couple of years, what Senator Wyden did, \nworking with a number of us, was he negotiated and basically said: \nSure, we want to do these business tax credits or business tax \ndeductions because we think this will help our country grow, but we \nshouldn't give tax breaks to large businesses and leave workers behind.\n  That is what this coalition did, was pretty much said to people here \nwho haven't always thought much about low-income people--frankly, we \nwork around here, and if you don't go out of your way to meet low-\nincome people and you don't talk to them about their lives, if you are \nnot in the cafeteria--those people are making way too little money, and \npeople here don't know their names and all of that. But when you think \nabout this, it makes a huge difference in people's lives.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his role in helping put that coalition \ntogether.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reclaiming my time, Mr. President, before Senator Brown \nleaves the floor, I want to thank my colleague from Ohio, whose \nadvocacy and constant tenacity, coming back again and again to talk \nabout what this means for those families walking on what I call an \neconomic tightrope--we wouldn't be here without that advocacy.\n  I just learned from some of the experts in the field that altogether \n50 million Americans are going to benefit from the earned-income tax \ncredit and the child tax credit being made permanent. That is real \nrelief on a permanent basis. Students will be able to count on the \nAmerican opportunity tax credit to cover up to $10,000 of a 4-year \ncollege education. That is an awful lot of money they are not going to \nhave to borrow. There are other important highlights in the package, \nsuch as permanent help for the commuter, permanent assistance for low-\nincome housing, permanent tax breaks to encourage charitable giving. \nThat is a huge lifeline for places like the Oregon Food Bank. I was \nthere just a few days ago, and I saw all those young people and \nvolunteers last Saturday morning. They were all pitching in and packing \nfruit baskets for families to enjoy. They do incredible work to combat \nhunger.\n\n  There will be 5 years of assistance for job seekers, including \nveterans, long-term unemployed, and people with disabilities. Also, 5 \nyears of aid is included for hard-hit communities with the new markets \ntax credit, 5 years of certainty for solar and wind energy. This is \nespecially important. We have seen the extraordinary interests in \nclimate change. You can debate whether you think there is a serious \nproblem. Based on the numbers from the scientists at NOAA, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Agency, I know I certainly do. It is a serious \nproblem, and now we have 5 years of certainty for solar and wind \nenergy, which I think is going to make an extraordinary difference in \nrenewable energy.\n  Here is what the math of this package looks like: 40 percent of the \ntax breaks goes to families and individuals. That is a huge improvement \nover the typical math with these tax breaks. When Congress just passes \nthe same old, same old set of tax extenders, as it has done for years, \nonly 20 percent goes to families and individuals. This package doubles \nthe percentage of families who will benefit as it relates to this \nparticular package.\n  There are clearly a number of business-related tax cuts and, by the \nway, I think many of those make a great deal of sense as well. We have \nthe permanent tax break for research and development. Thanks to the \ngood work of our colleague from Delaware Senator Coons, it is going to \nbe available for the first time on a widespread basis for small \nbusiness and startups. It is in there.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer--because I have been to his State--\nthis is going to be a real booster shot for America's innovative \neconomy. Permanent small business expensing is going to help a lot of \nemployers invest, grow, and create new high-wage, high-skilled jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  I have town meetings in every county every year in Oregon. When I \ndrive through rural Oregon, I see all of those little businesses that \nin effect sell farm implement equipment. Last year they were trying to \nfigure out what was going to happen with respect to the expensing \nrules, and then they saw it only lasted a few weeks. Now we have \npermanent small business expensing. That is going to help small \nemployers in rural areas. Research and development credits, which are \npermanent, will help small businesses in rural and urban areas. In many \ncases, it will help employers pay wages thanks to those new innovation-\nrelated programs. I think the tax breaks I have just mentioned, such as \nexpensing for small businesses and permanent research and development \nbreaks, ought to be the kind of thing that both Democrats and \nRepublicans should approve.\n  I want to take just a few minutes and talk about the impact of this \nlegislation on tax reform. I will tell you that my wife always says: \nDon't describe the Federal Tax Code in your typical way because you \njust frighten the children, but the reality is the American Tax Code, \noverall, is just a rotting economic carcass. It is infected with \nloopholes and inefficiencies. Now we have this version virus mutating \nand growing. This is really a mess of a system. What this legislation \ndoes--particularly by making the breaks for working families and the \nsmart policies that encourage business, innovation, and economic growth \nin our communities, research and development, and realistic writeoffs \npermanent, this is going to, in effect, clear the deck for tax reform. \nThis lays out the opportunity by giving breathing room to the cause of \nbipartisan tax reform. That is something I am particularly interested \nin because our colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, and I have \nwritten a bipartisan comprehensive tax reform bill.\n  What this legislation does, in terms of creating breathing room for \ntax reform, is it breaks the chain of just extending these tax \nextenders every 2 years. What it means is that we have some \npredictability, certainty, and some breathing room in order to lay out \na bipartisan comprehensive tax reform effort.\n\n[[Page S8776]]\n\n  By the way, the fact is, this inversion virus is something that can't \nbe ignored any longer. That alone is an indication that the Congress \ncannot duck the need to reform the Tax Code comprehensively. Look at \nthose Members who are in key positions in the Congress and have made it \nclear that they want bipartisan tax reform--both Democrats and \nRepublicans. For example, Chairman Brady, Chairman Hatch, and myself, \nas well as a number of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, have said \nthey want to do comprehensive tax reform and want to--as I have \ndescribed it--pass these extenders so we can break the chain of the \nevery year or every 2 years extension. We are not the ``extender'' \nCongress. I don't want us to have to come back to this every 2 years, \ndoing the same old, same old. We can do a lot better, and this time we \nhave at least laid the foundation for real tax reform.\n  I want to thank a number of my colleagues. In particular, I wish to \nthank Chairman Hatch, our committee members on both sides of the aisle, \nand the two leaders--Leader Reid and Leader McConnell--for their \nefforts. We had an awful lot of dedicated staff people working on this \nissue. Our diligent tax counsel is here, Todd Metcalf. I thank him for \nhis great work. Our terrific staff director, Josh Sheinkman, our chief \ncounsel, Mike Evans, and the members of our tax team, Ryan Abraham, \nBobby Andres, Chris Arneson, Adam Carasso, Danielle Deraney, Kera Getz, \nRob Jones, Eric Slack, Tiffany Smith, and Todd Wooten. All of them have \nworked long hours to get us up to this point.\n  I also want to commend Liz Jurinka and Juan Muchado of our health \nstaff because they joined a very good leadership team. I must thank \nSenator Reid's chief tax aide, Ellen Doneski, Chairman Hatch, and his \nstaff, led by Chris Campbell, Mark Prater, and Jay Khosla. Brendon \nDunn, with Senator McConnell's office and George Callas and Chairman \nBrady's tax staff were instrumental. All of them came together to help \nus put this together.\n  I now believe there is a real opportunity to use this bill as a \nspringboard to real tax reform. I have written two bipartisan tax \nreform bills over the years, first with our former colleague from New \nHampshire, Judd Gregg, and the second with our current colleague, \nSenator Coats, the distinguished Senator from Indiana. I know my wife \nwould always say: I keep hearing about these tax reform bills, dear. \nWrite me when something actually happens.\n  I will tell you, I think the combination of this inversion virus--\nwhich if it keeps growing is going to hollow out America's tax system--\nand the fact that we have brought some certainty and predictability to \nthe Tax Code added some very sensible provisions in a permanent way. \nThis really gives us an opportunity now. The table is set for real tax \nreform, and that is not something we have had before.\n  I just want to close by way of saying that I am so honored to \nrepresent Oregon in the U.S. Senate. I was director of the senior \ncitizens Gray Panthers for about 7 years before I came to the Congress. \nI have had a lot of exciting moments in my time in public service, but \nto be part of this bipartisan legislative effort that provides the \nbiggest tax cut for working families and the biggest anti-poverty plan \nCongress has moved forward in decades is particularly thrilling.\n  I thank all of my colleagues and their staff who have done so much to \nmake this possible.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to address my colleagues on the \nNational Labor Relations Act. It was enacted in 1935, and that \nlegislation exempted Federal, State, and local governments but did not \nexplicitly mention Native American governments from the provisions of \nthe act. As a matter of sovereignty, Indian tribes--tribes across the \ncountry--should be excluded from the provisions of the NLRB. For 70 \nyears, the NLRB honored the sovereign status, and it accorded them the \nrights they are entitled to under the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Beginning in 2004, however, the NLRB reversed its treatment of tribes \nand legally challenged those tribes in regard to the NLRB. The Tribal \nLabor Sovereignty Act, which I introduced and passed in the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs in a bipartisan way, is simple.\n  The National Labor Relations Act is amended to provide that any \nenterprise or institution owned or operated by an Indian tribe and \nlocated on tribal lands is not subject to the NLRA. This is not a labor \nissue. This is a sovereignty issue. The narrow legislation protects \ntribal sovereignty and gives tribal governments the ability to make the \nbest decisions possible for their people. This legislation seeks to \ntreat tribal governments no differently than other units of local \ngovernment, counties, and cities. As I said, this legislation not only \npassed the Senate committee, but similar legislation passed the House \nof Representatives in a bipartisan vote.\n  The late Senator Inouye of Hawaii wrote in 2009: ``Congress should \naffirm the original construction of NLRA by expressly including Indian \ntribes in the definition of an employer.''\n  This bill presents Congress with an opportunity to reaffirm the \nconstitutional status of sovereignty that tribes are entitled to under \nthe supreme law of our land.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 220, S. 248 and that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will briefly explain the reasons I am \nreserving the right to object. I, first of all, thank Senator Moran. As \na fellow member of the banking committee, while I disagree with him on \nthis issue, we have found many things we can work together on, and I \nappreciate that.\n  As Senator Moran does, I strongly support sovereignty, as I know \nvirtually everybody in this body probably does. But this bill, frankly, \nisn't about tribal sovereignty; it is about undermining labor law that \nprotects the rights of workers to organize and collectively bargain.\n  We have a middle class in this country in large part because since \nthe 1930s--since Hugo Black sat at this desk and Senator Wagner sat at \nanother desk in this chamber and wrote collective bargaining laws--we \nknow what that has done to raise wealth, not just for union members but \nfor others also.\n  This bill attempts to overturn the National Labor Relations Board \ndecisions that have asserted the Board's jurisdiction over labor \ndisputes on tribal lands. The Board methodically evaluates when they do \nand don't have jurisdiction on tribal lands by using a very carefully \ncrafted test to ensure that the Board's jurisdiction would not violate \ntribal rights and would not interfere in the exclusive right to self-\ngovernance. We support that.\n  In the June 2015 decision, the NLRB employed the test. They did not \nassert jurisdiction in a labor dispute on tribal lands. Instead, this \nbill is part of an agenda to undermine the rights of American workers, \nincluding the 600,000 employees of tribal casinos. Of those employees, \n75 percent are non-Indians. Courts have upheld the application to the \ntribes of Federal employment laws, including the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Employment Retirement \nIncome Security Act--that is OSHA and ERISA--and title 3 of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, the ADA--all very important to protect \npeople, workers, and citizens.\n  In addition to harming thousands of already organized workers in \ncommercial tribe enterprises, casinos, and other things, this bill \nwould establish a dangerous precedent to weaken longstanding tribal \nprotections on tribal lands. For these reasons, Mr. President, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am disappointed the Senator from Ohio has \nobjected, and I will continue our efforts both in the committee and on \nthe Senate floor to see that this legislation or\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nlegislation similar to it is advanced for the purposes of reaffirming \nthe constitutional grant of sovereignty--the sovereignty of those who \npreceded us in the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8777-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRIAN PERKINS\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, on a different topic, just for a moment I \nwould like to indicate that it is time, unfortunately, for me to say \ngood-bye to one of my long-time employees, Brian Perkins of Wichita, \nKS. A Kansan through and through is departing our staff at the end of \nthe year.\n  Brian came to our office when I was a House Member in 2009 and \nfollowed me here to the U.S. Senate. Among the issues that I consider \nmost important as we try to care and work on behalf of Kansans and \nAmericans are issues related to health care and issues related to \neducation. Brian has been front and center in our office, day in and \nday out, on these issues.\n  I have many wonderful and qualified staff members, but I think Brian \nis the role model for all of them, including for me. We have seen Brian \ntime and again step up and act above and beyond the norm. In every \nsetting he is genuine, he is sincere, and he demonstrates his care for \nKansans in each and every circumstance. He is intelligent and knows the \ndetails of health care and education law, but the compelling factor \nabout Brian is that he cares so much about getting it right and doing \nthings for the right reasons.\n  I understand there is sometimes a lack of appreciation by Americans \nacross the country for the people who work here. I would exclude me and \nother Members of Congress from this statement, but I would think that \nalmost without exception all of our staffs are worthy; those who work \nin the Senate, who work in our offices, and who work in committees are \nworthy of esteem and respect. These are people who work hard every day \nfor a good and worthy cause. Most of them have an interest in policy or \nan interest in politics and decided that Washington, DC, the Nation's \nCapital was a place where they could do something for the good of their \ncountry. Brian exemplifies that.\n  It is not easy to say good-bye to Brian. As Senators, we spend a lot \nof time with our staff. I want to express my gratitude to him on behalf \nof my family and me. I wish him and his family, Beth and their \nchildren, all the best as they move closer to family. It is another \nattribute of Brian; I think he has the sense that he hates to leave, \nbut he knows he has a responsibility to his family. That is something \nKansans also admire and respect.\n  Brian, thank you very much for all the hours, days, weeks, months, \nand years in which you have advanced the good cause of government for \nthe people of our State and the people of our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. SASSE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SASSE. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks by the Senator of Nebraska and the Senator of \nGeorgia that I be recognized along with the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8777-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8777-S8779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXECUTIVE OVERREACH AND THE SEPARATION OF POWERS\n\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, today I would like to propose a thought \nexperiment. Imagine if President Trump has been propelled into the \nWhite House with 300 electoral votes, having won mainly by the force of \nhis personality, by calling BS on this town, and by his promise to \n``get things done'' by acting unilaterally.\n  The first 100 days are huge. He signs an order to turn the Peace \nCorps into stone masons to build a southern wall. He shutters the \nDepartment of Education, and by Executive order, he turns the \nDepartment of Interior into the classiest oil company the world has \never known.\n  What happens next? Would those who have stayed silent about Executive \noverreach over the last 7 years suddenly find religion? After years of \nlegislative atrophy, would Congress spring into action and remember its \nsupposed power of the purse?\n  And what about the Republicans? After having raged against a \nsupposedly lawless President, would they suddenly find that they are OK \nwith a strongman President, so long as he is wearing the same color \njersey they are? He may be a lawless son of a gun, some would say, but \nhe is our lawless son of a gun. Would the end justify the means?\n  The way Congress thinks and talks about Executive power over the last \nfew years has almost been this sophomoric. It has been based \noverwhelmingly on the party tag of whoever happens to sit in the Oval \nOffice at any given moment. Republicans, Democrats, us versus them--\nthese are the political trenches, and the no man's land lies somewhere \nbetween this Chamber and 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. When your \nhighest objective is advancing partisan lines on a map, it is easy to \nforgive a President who oversteps his authority, so long as he is your \nguy and the one with authority is in your party.\n  This Senator suggests that this is the entirely wrong way to think \nabout this issue. The problem of a weak Congress--which we are--and the \ngrowth of the unchecked Executive should be bad news to all of us. But \nmore importantly than us, this should be bad news for every constituent \nwho casts their votes for us under the impression that the Congress \nactually makes decisions and doesn't just offer whiny suggestions.\n  The shrinking of the legislature in the age of Obama should be bad \nnews for all of us for three reasons. First, we have taken an oath to \ndefend the Constitution, and the Constitution invests the legislature \nwith the legislative powers.\n  Second, the Founders' design of checks and balances actually was and \nis a good idea. They were struggling to preserve the freedom of the \nindividual and especially of the vulnerable against the powerful--\nagainst those who could afford to hire the well-connected lobbyists. \nThe Founders were equally afraid of the unchecked consolidation of \npower in a king or in the passions of a mob. They understood that human \nnature means that those in power will almost always try to grab more \npower, and that base reality hasn't changed over the last 230 years.\n  Third, under the system that is now emerging, the public is growing \nmore and more frustrated. They think that most of us will be reelected \nno matter what, and they think that the executive agencies that daily \nsubstitute rulemaking for legislating will promulgate whatever rules \nthey want, no matter what, and that the people have no control. People \ngrow more cynical in a world where the legislators who can be fired--\nthat is what elections are for--have little actual power and a world \nwhere bureaucrats, who have most of the actual power, cannot be fired. \nIt is basically impossible for the people who are supposed to be in \ncharge of our system to figure out how they would throw the bums out. \nThey ask: Where is the accountability in the present arrangement?\n  Allow me to be clear about two issues up front. First, this Senator \nbelieves that the weakness of the Congress is not just undesirable; it \nis actually dangerous for America and her future. Second, this Senator \nthinks so not because I am a Republican and we have a Democrat in the \nWhite House; rather, I think this because of my oath of office to a \nconstitutional system, and I will continue to hold this view, having \ntaken this oath, the next time a Republican President tries to reach \nbeyond his or her constitutional powers. Despite these two strongly \nheld views, though, in this series of addresses on the growth of the \nadministrative State and more broadly on the unbalanced nature of \nexecutive and legislative branch relations in our time, my goal will \nnot be primarily to advocate. My first goal is just to do some history \ntogether.\n  My goal is primarily to describe how the executive branch has grown \nand how Presidents of both parties are guilty of it. But it isn't just \nthat Republicans and Democrats are guilty of trying to consolidate more \npower when they have the Presidency, although that is true; it is a \none-way ratchet. It\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\nis also true that Republicans and Democrats are to blame in this \nCongress for not wanting to lead on hard issues and take hard votes, \nbut rather to sit back and let successive Presidents gobble up more \nauthorities.\n  My goal is to give all of us who are called to serve in this body a \nshared sense of some historical moments, how we got to this place where \nso much of the legislative function now happens inside the executive \nbranch, and to convince my colleagues of both parties that we have to \ntake this power back, regardless of who serves in the White House and \nwhat party they are from.\n  So how did we get to the place where so many giant legislative \ndecisions are now made inside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and in the \ndozens of alphabet soup agencies? To understand that, we have to look \nbriefly at the Founders and what they were trying to accomplish. These \nwere educated men who had studied all forms of government throughout \nhuman history. They had a worked-out theory of human nature. They knew \nthat we are created with inherent dignity worthy of respect, that our \nrights come to us from God via nature, and that government doesn't give \nus rights; government is just our shared tool to secure those natural \nrights. At the same time they knew that we also have a disposition to \nself-interest and a capacity for evil. They observed it throughout all \nof human history, rulers trying to consolidate more power for their own \nends, and this is obviously dangerous.\n  One of the lessons they drew from their rich historical understanding \nwas the importance of keeping three main functions of government \nseparate. As Montesquieu wrote: ``All would be lost if the same man or \nthe same body of principal men, either of the nobles or of the masses, \nexercised these three powers: that of making the laws, that of \nexecuting public resolutions, and that of judging the crimes and \ndisputes among individuals.''\n  The separation of powers could not, of course, be absolute, for the \nbranches had to work together, each power had to counterpose one \nanother. The key was to divide the power among different institutions \nwhile ensuring that those institutions could act together as a coherent \nwhole on the basis of what they call ``mixed government.''\n  The Constitution that emerged from the Founders' debates and \ndeliberations intentionally enshrines the separation of the powers, and \nthis was a direct result of the Founders' study of human nature and \ntheir conclusion that that nature was relatively constant. Men \neverywhere tend to aggrandize power and to use it for selfish ends. \nWhen power checks power in the government, the people are better \nprotected. As Tocqueville said when he studied America: Their more \nconstrained government leaves them more room for civil society.\n  We have a limited government because we mean to enable nearly \nlimitless--that is, more free families, more free inventors, more free \nchurches and synagogues, more free not-for-profits, more free local \ngovernments, and so on.\n  If you have to describe the essence of the American government in one \nsentence, Lincoln, to paraphrase, would say, it is ``of the people, by \nthe people, and for the people.'' Americans believe that we are free, \nendowed by our Creator with unalienable--that is unchangeable and \nuntouchable--rights. That is opposite of everything the world had ever \nheld in government until 1776.\n  This is what American exceptionalism means--not that there is \nsomething unique about Americans distinct from people in any other \nplace, but that the American idea is premised on rejecting the idea \nthat the King is the one who is free. The King, after all, had an army, \nand you didn't, and he could use his power however he wished. His \nsubjects--remember they were not called citizens; they were subjects--\nwere dependent. If they wanted to open a business, to start a church, \nto publish a book, then they needed to ask the King for permission. All \nthat was not mandatory was forbidden unless the King gave you an \nexception, unless the King gave you a carve-out, unless the King gave \nyou a waiver.\n  In America, the opposite was to be true. You are born free, \nregardless of where you are from or who your parents are, regardless of \nyour bank balance or the color of your skin. In America, if you want to \npreach a sermon or write a piece of investigative journalism, if you \nwant to say that your elected leaders are losers, if you want to invest \nin a new app or launch a nonprofit, you don't need the King's \npermission, for you are free.\n  About 100 years ago, this idea and our system of separation of powers \ncame under attack. There are three or four large reasons why the era of \nurbanization, industrialization, and then progressivism and the rise of \nspecialized experts called our constitutional system of limited \ngovernment into question. We will tackle some of those topics after the \nholidays. But for now, it is sufficient to say that the Presidency \nbegan to grow larger in the first two decades of the 20th century, and \nthe Congress began to lose some of its powers.\n  It happened because Presidents of both parties were willing to \noverreach and because the Congress was willing to underreach, to \nretreat from that field of competitive ideas, to retreat from our \nconstitutional commitments.\n  For every TR--Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican--there is an FDR, a \nDemocrat. This should not be a partisan issue, for both sides have been \nguilty of extensive executive branch overreach. Meanwhile, the \nprofessional legislators realized that permanent incumbency is easier \nif you cede control rather than lead, if you decide not to take the \nhard votes but just quietly ask the executive branch to make the \ndecisions unilaterally.\n  Today many in my party argue that no President has ever even \ncontemplated what President Obama regularly does. That is actually not \ntrue. Whatever one might think of President Obama's gobbling up of \npowers, his theories are not at all new. His theories date back to the \nProgressive Era's disdain for limits of the Constitution, and this is \nespecially evident in the self-conscious Executive expansionism of \nTeddy Roosevelt, the Republican, and Woodrow Wilson the Democrat.\n  After the holidays, we are going to spend a little time exploring \nboth of these men and their attempts to marginalize and to \nintentionally ignore the Congress to--as TR put it--``greatly broaden \nthe use of executive power.''\n  I hope that this look at the rise of the executive branch and its \nlegislating over the next number of months will contribute to the \nefforts of all of us here together who want to recover and safeguard \nthat constitutional vision.\n  But in historical terms, the Congress, in the age of Obama, is very \nweak. This isn't about the current majority leader, and it isn't about \nthe most recent previous majority leader. It is much bigger than that. \nThis institution is arguably the weakest it has been relative to the \nexecutive branch at any point in our Nation's 2\\1/2\\ centuries. Others \ninterested in the history of this special place might argue that there \nis some other moment with greater relative weakness than this current \nmoment. We should have that debate, for we should be discussing how and \nwhy this institution became so weak.\n  We should stop pretending--the constant exaggeration around here as \npeople fake it, pretending that some tiny procedural vote that didn't \npass somehow still changed the world. We should stop pretending \nomnicompetence across huge expanses of often unknowable executive \nbranch governmental action.\n  Voters--better, citizens--don't believe us. The lobbyists don't \nbelieve it either. They are willing to fake it with you, but they don't \nreally believe you, which is why so many lobbying firms today are \nexpanding most of their efforts in the regulatory--not the \nlegislative--lobbying space, for that is where the action is.\n  It would be far more useful in this body--not to mention far more \nbelievable to the people who we work for--for us to learn to talk \nopenly about how and why this once powerful and still special body \nbecame so weak. Congress is mocked, and we should tackle the hows and \nwhys, for the people are not wrong. We should stop this trend, and the \nfirst step toward that would be to better understand and to more openly \nadmit the nature of the problem.\n  I planned this series on the growth of the executive branch for early \nin 2016 because it would be healthy for the Senate and for our broader \npublic to be\n\n[[Page S8779]]\n\nwrestling with the duties and constitutional authorities in advance of \nNovember's Presidential elections before we will know which party will \nwin. We need to have this conversation now precisely because we don't \nknow which party will win.\n  Let me be realistic for a minute. I hope it is not pessimistic, but I \nwill be realistic. I actually don't think there is much will in this \nbody to do things like recovering the power of the purse. And even if \nthere were, the will to get beyond R's and D's, shirts and skins Kabuki \ntheatre, as we drift toward a parliamentary system with ``winners take \nall'' in the executive branch--the actual act of trying to recover \npower, the power of the purse and the legislative powers that the \nConstitution vests in this body--would be very difficult at a time when \nthe public is so cynical and so disengaged because of how dysfunctional \nthis institution is.\n  I think that the Democrats are likely only to recover a sense of \ntheir article I powers if they are looking at a President Trump or a \nPresident X or a President Y or whoever the scariest candidate might be \nto the Democrats.\n  Similarly, I think the Republicans are most likely prone to forget \nmost of their concerns about Executive overreach if a Republican does \ndefeat Secretary Clinton in November.\n  I will just end with two brief stories. In the first, FDR was \nfrustrated with the Supreme Court, so he had a solution. He would just \npack the Court. Who could stop him? He had control of the Congress, \nafter all.\n  Well, someone did stop him--Senate Democrats who cared about the \nConstitution and their oath stepped up.\n  In one of the other great instances of this place just saying no, \nregardless of party, LBJ--arguably the most powerful leader until the \nlast 10 years in the history of the Senate, the most powerful leader \nthis place had ever known in his age--became VP and said he would \nessentially remain majority leader of the Senate at the same time. \nAgain, it was Democrats in this body who said no based on their \nconstitutional responsibilities, not their partisanship. These were men \nand women who cared more about their country and more about their \nConstitution and more about their oaths than their party.\n  I think that all of us in both parties should look to those examples \nand again be talking in the future about how we emulate them and \nrecover the responsibilities of this body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think it is important that we pause for \na moment at the end of 2015, look back upon the past 12 months and, in \nparticular, look at the Veterans Administration and the veterans who \nhave served our country, looking at the problems that we have solved \nand the things we have done to better improve those services.\n  When the year dawned, we had a scandal in Arizona at a Phoenix \nhospital. We had bonuses being paid to employees who had not performed. \nWe had medical services that weren't available to veterans who had \nearned them and deserved them. As a Senate, we came together in the \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committee, which I chair. We had a bipartisan \neffort to see to it we addressed those problems.\n  So for just a second I want everyone to pause and realize what we \nhave done bipartisanly and collectively for those who have served our \ncountry and the veterans today.\n  No. 1, by the end of January, we had passed the Clay Hunt Suicide \nPrevention for American Veterans Act to deal with the growing problem \nof suicide with our veterans. It is already working with more \npsychiatric help available to our veterans, quicker responses for those \nwho seek mental help, better diagnosis of PTSD and TBI, and a reduction \nin the rate of the suicides that take place in the veterans community. \nThat was affirmative action. It passed 99 to 0--Republicans and \nDemocrats--in the Senate of the United States.\n  We took the veterans choice bill, which had passed in August of last \nyear, and made it work better for the veterans of our country. In the \nfirst 9 months of this year, the Veterans Administration fulfilled 7.5 \nmillion more individual appointments for veterans and benefits than \nthey had in the preceding year, all because we made the private sector \na part of the VA and allowed veterans to go to the doctor of their \nchoice under certain qualified situations. We made access easier, we \nmade access better, and because of that, we made health care better.\n  Then we addressed the Denver crisis, and this is the most important \nthing of all. In January we got this little note from the VA that they \nhad a $1.3 billion cost overrun on a $1.7 billion hospital, a 328-\npercent increase in cost with no promise that it would go down.\n  Ranking Member Blumenthal, myself, and the Colorado delegation flew \nto Denver and brought in the contractors and the VA. We made \nsignificant changes. First we took the VA out of the construction \nbusiness. They had proven they didn't deserve the ability to manage \nthat much money or to build things. Their job was to deliver health \ncare.\n  We took the construction and put it in the hands of the Corps of \nEngineers, where construction and engineering was responsible. We told \nthe VA: You may have a $1.385 billion cost overrun, but if you are \ngoing to pay for it, we are not going to borrow from China. You are \ngoing to find it internally in the $71 billion budget of the Veterans \nAdministration. And they did.\n  By unanimous consent this Senate and the House of Representatives \napproved the completion of that hospital, the funding of the shortfall, \nand the management takeover by the Corps of Engineers. Today it is on \nprogress to be there for the veterans of the Midwest and the West in \nDenver, CO.\n  Then we dealt with many other programs, such as homelessness and \ncaregiver benefits to our veterans' caregivers, to see to it we have \nthe very best care possible available.\n  Then we changed the paradigm. The VA had so many acting appointees \nand so many unfilled positions that they couldn't function as well as \nthey should. So we went in, and we approved Dr. David Shulkin to be the \nunder secretary for medicine. We took LaVerne Council and approved her \nto be the head of information technology. We took former Congressman \nMichael Michaud and made him the Assistant Secretary of Labor for \nVeterans' Employment and Training. We put highly qualified people who \nknew what they were doing in positions where we had vacancies. We are \nalready seeing a benefit in health delivery services, planning for IT \ncoordination, and, hopefully, interoperability between the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense in terms of medical \nrecords, which is so important.\n  But we also did something else. We said we are no longer going to \ntolerate scandals in the VA or look the other way, and we are not going \nto pay rewards and bonuses to people who aren't doing the job. As you \nheard earlier today with Senator Cassidy from Louisiana and Senator \nAyotte from New Hampshire, with the help of Senator Sherrod Brown of \nOhio, we are going to pass legislation that is going to hold VA \nemployees accountable, have a record if they are not performing, and in \nthe future prevent any Veterans Administration employee who is not \ndoing a job from getting a bonus for a job that is not well done. That \nis the way it works in the private sector. It ought to be the way it \nworks in the government.\n  Then we took another problem. We took the problem of the scandal in \nthe VA relocation benefits, which cost hundreds of thousands of lost \nrevenue to the VA--funds that were given to VA people for transferring, \nsome of them within the same geographic area where they originally were \nworking. We told Secretary McDonald: You need to go in there, and you \nneed to clean this thing up. To his credit, the Secretary did, and to \nhis credit, the former brigadier general who was the head of that \ndepartment retired. He resigned from the VA rather than face the music \nin terms of the investigation.\n  But we took affirmative action to see to it we would have no more \nscandals. We want zero tolerance for poor performance, and we want to \nreward good performance, but that is the way it needs to be. It is very \nimportant also to understand that we have goals for the future. We are \ngoing to continue as a committee with the VA leadership on a quarterly \nbasis. Senator Blumenthal and I go to meet with the leadership of the \nVA to see what they are doing and to share with them the frustration we\n\n[[Page S8780]]\n\nhave in the House and the Senate about things that aren't going right, \nbut to share with them the joy we have with the things that they are \ndoing to improve.\n  Then we have set goals for next year, a full implementation of the \nVeterans Choice Program and a consolidation of all veterans' benefits \nand VA benefits to see to it that veterans get timely appointments and \ngood-quality services from the physicians in the VA or physicians in \ntheir communities.\n  We are going to improve the experience of our servicemembers in \ntransitioning from Active Duty to Veterans Affairs. Quite frankly, \ntoday that is the biggest problem we have in the country. Active-Duty \nservicemembers who leave service and go to veteran status fall into a \nblack hole. There is no interoperability of VA and DOD health care \nrecords and electronic records. There is no transition in the handoff. \nWe are going to see that change.\n  We are going to improve the experience of women veterans, including \nprotecting victims of military sexual trauma.\n  We are going to combat veteran homelessness and meet the goal of the \nPresident to get it to zero. We have already reduced it by a third.\n  We are going to ensure access to mental health so no veteran who \nfinds himself in trouble doesn't have immediate access to counsel. On \nthat point, I commend the Veterans Administration for the hotline. The \nsuicide prevention hotline that they established has helped to save \nlives in this country this year, and we are going to continue to see to \nit that we have more and more access for our veterans.\n  Simply put, we are going to make the Veterans Administration work for \nthe veterans and work for the American people. We are going to have \naccountability of the employees. We are going to reward good behavior, \nand we are not going to accept bad behavior. In the end, we are going \nto take the veteran of America, who served his or her country, and make \nsure that they get every benefit that is promised to them and that it \nis delivered in a high-quality fashion. We are going to do it working \ntogether as Republicans and Democrats and as Members of the Senate to \ndo so.\n  As we close this year, I wish to pause and thank the Members of the \nSenate for their unanimous bipartisan support for the significant \nchanges we have made to address the problems of the Veterans \nAdministration and to remember this season of the year in Christmas the \ngreat gift we have had to all of us of our veterans who have served us, \nmany of whom have sacrificed and some of whom have died to see that \nAmerica remains the strongest, most peaceful, and freest country on the \nface of this Earth.\n  With that, I pause and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, I will not go into the detail I was \nplanning to go into as to what we are faced with and what we are going \nto be voting on tomorrow, but I think it is very important--because I \nhave heard a lot of erroneous things coming out of various talk radio \nshows and elsewhere--as to how we got into the mess we are in where we \nare going to be looking at a major spending bill instead of the normal \nway of doing things.\n  Historically, in both the House and the Senate, the order has been to \ndo an authorization bill, and that is followed by an appropriations \nbill. That works out fine in the House. In the Senate, it is not quite \nthat easy because we have some rules in the Senate that allow the \nminority--whether that be Republican or Democratic--to object to a \nprocedural basis. So it actually takes 60 votes, not 51 votes, to pass \nappropriations. This has created a real problem.\n  I remember that on June 18, we passed the Defense Authorization Act. \nGiven that we are in a time of war, it was incredibly important to \nprovide our Defense Department what in the regular course of business \nwould be appropriated to it. However, we have been trying to \nappropriate that since June 18, and the minority has kept us from doing \nthat. I can say the same thing about other appropriations bills, such \nas Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, Energy and Water, and \nothers.\n  One might say: Why would they be doing this? In the case of the \nappropriations bill for defense, it is very simple: The President and a \nlot of the Democrats want to make sure that as we are coming out with \nadditional spending to avoid sequestration, an equal amount be used for \ndomestic purposes instead of military, where we really have a crisis \nright now.\n  Let me say something about the House. This morning on a talk show, I \nheard everyone criticizing the House and the new Speaker of the House. \nIn reality, they did their job over there. That is a bum rap for those \nguys. They passed their appropriations bills. They passed them on the \nfloor. They passed appropriations bills on the floor. So they did what \nwas supposed to be done. However, you can't pass legislation with just \nthe House; it has to be in the Senate also.\n  So I think we need to look at that. I don't like the idea of a \nsituation where we are faced with a ``take it or leave it'' deal at the \nend of the year. That doesn't really allow us to offer amendments. It \nis done behind closed doors by a limited number of people. This is not \nright. This is not the way it is supposed to be.\n  I would just say there is a way out. I am going to suggest that this \nshould be the last time we should have to do this. If we had a system \nwhere we could reform it and have it so you could make an exception to \nsome of the motions to proceed for appropriations bills, then we would \nbe able to go ahead and get this done. That is the simple solution. \nThat is what I would recommend. However, there is a lot more detail in \nthat. It happens that there is a committee taking place right now in \nthe Senate. James Lankford, my junior Senator from Oklahoma, Cory \nGardner, Lamar Alexander, and I think two other Senators are looking to \npropose rule changes, and I think it is overdue.\n  I want to mention one other thing too. I said back in 2006 that I \nwould never vote for another omnibus bill like the one we are preparing \nto vote for. I said: That is the last one; I am going to serve notice--\nthinking that if enough people did this, we wouldn't find ourselves in \nthis position. However, we are still in this position.\n  The reason I am standing here today is to get on the record why I am \ngoing to support this. Back when I had the highway bill, we were trying \nto put additional things on the highway bill. One was to lift the ban \non exports of oil and gas, and we were not successful. So at that time, \nI made the announcement--we had a couple of other chances, the last one \nbeing the omnibus spending bill. We got a commitment that would be on \nthat bill. So I said at that time that if that is the case, if we end \nup lifting the ban on that bill, then I will change from my original \n2006 commitment and I will vote for and support this.\n  When we stop and think about what we are doing, does it make good \npolicy that we in the United States can say to Russia and say to Iran, \npeople who don't look after our best interests: It is all right for you \nto do that, but we in the United States cannot export oil.\n  We have all the former Soviet Union countries. I went to Lithuania \nand participated in an opening of a terminal there so they could get \nout from under this restriction. It was a joyous occasion.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, we have lost 20,000 jobs because since we \nhave had success in getting oil and gas out, we have been encumbered by \nthe fact that we can't export it. This has been a real hardship. I \nwould say the most important thing in this bill in terms of my State \nwould be that we are going to be able to correct that and we are going \nto be able to do that.\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\n  So with the changes that are being made, I am looking forward to \nsupporting it. I certainly think we should all look and see what is in \nthe best interest of the United States and should be aware of the fact \nthat what they are seeing out there in terms of the cost of this bill \nis exactly the same cost as if we had done it the way we were supposed \nto do it. If we add up the total number of appropriations that we \npassed out--all 12 appropriations--add them up, and that is the same \namount as this bill we will be voting on tomorrow. So that criticism is \nnot a genuine criticism.\n  With that, I will move to another subject that I think is very \nsignificant, and then I want to join with my friend from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8781-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8781-S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TSCA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we had a very dear friend in Frank \nLautenberg. He was a Democrat; I am a Republican. I chaired the \ncommittee he served on, and we had a very close relationship.\n  The bill we just passed began with a meeting to gather stakeholders. \nIt happened in my office with Frank Lautenberg. Senator Vitter and \nSenator Udall--whom we will hear from in just a moment--and their staff \nhave put together the first reform of TSCA in 40 years, which will \ncreate more regulatory certainty for American businesses and uniform \nprotections for American families.\n  We have a real opportunity to enact reform to a major environmental \nstatute. It is the result of over 3 years of work and negotiation, and \nI thank those responsible for spending countless hours to produce this \nproduct. Dimitri Karakitsos began working for me while I was ranking \nmember, stayed with Ranking Member Vitter working on this bill, and \nthen back with me as chairman of the committee. He has shepherded the \ndrafting and negotiation of this bill the entire time. He is the guy in \ncharge. I thank Jonathan Black in Senator Udall's office as well as \nAndrew Wallace, who took up the TSCA reform leadership following \nSenator Lautenberg. I thank Zack Baig in Senator Vitter's office, Colin \nPeppard with Senator Carper, Michal Feedhoff in Senator Markey's \noffice, Adam Zipkin in Senator Booker's office, Adrian Deveny in \nSenator Merkley's office, and Emily Enderle with Senator Whitehouse. \nThanks to all the staff.\n  People don't realize how much work the staff does. When we passed the \nTransportation reauthorization bill, it was hundreds and hundreds of \nhours. This one, because of a technicality, has been held up for about \na month and a half. That has been worked out, so I am just pleased we \nare able to do it. I think that is a tribute to Frank Lautenberg and \nhis wife Bonnie. I say to my friend from New Mexico, I think Frank \nLautenberg's legacy has been fulfilled.\n  Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I couldn't agree with Chairman Inhofe more. \nI know he knew Senator Lautenberg very well and worked with him on the \ncommittee and off the committee on a variety of issues. He was very \ncommitted to his grandchildren. As Senator Inhofe knows, many times we \nwould see him in committee, and when he would talk specifically about \nthe bills before us, he would say: Is this going to help my children \nand their children? One of the things he talked about on this bill was \nthat this would save more lives and help his grandchildren's generation \nmore than any bill he ever worked on. So he was very proud of this \nbill, and we were very sorry to lose him.\n  But the thing I want to say about Chairman Inhofe is that as a \ndedicated and determined legislator, he saw the opportunity. Senator \nVitter and I had worked on this. We came to Senator Inhofe at the \nbeginning of the Congress and said: We have a good bipartisan piece of \nlegislation we have worked on for a while. But you took the bull by the \nhorns. You ended up helping us improve it. I think when we started in \nthe committee--when you marked it up earlier in the year in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, we had maybe one or two \nDemocrats supporting it. We expanded that, and it passed out with a 15-\nto-5 vote, so a very significant vote in terms of holding people \ntogether.\n  I really give you a lot of credit for the way you ran the committee, \nhow gracious you were when Senator Lautenberg's widow, Bonnie \nLautenberg, came down and spoke, and I wasn't on the committee any \nlonger, but how you treated me and had me speak before the committee on \nthe work we had done. It has been a real pleasure.\n  All those staff members you mentioned--from Dimitri, to Jonathan \nBlack, to Drew Wallace, and all the other staff members of the large \nnumber of Senators on the committee--Senator Carper, Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Merkley, Senator Markey, Senator Booker--many \nSenators on that committee focused in with you and with Senator Vitter \nto make sure we got this done.\n  I am very proud of what we have done today. I think it will be looked \nback on as a major environmental accomplishment in terms of \nbipartisanship and pulling people together.\n  The thing we did that I am very proud of is we had all stakeholders \nat the table and we listened to them and we proceeded through. It is a \nreal tribute to Senator Inhofe's ability as a legislator. We don't have \nto be convinced on this bill. Just earlier in the year, he produced a \ntransportation bill--which was a major accomplishment--for 5 years. So \nnow once again Chairman Inhofe shows how he is able to pull people \ntogether and get this done.\n  So I once again just want to thank you. I know there are additional \ncomments we will make later on. I know the Lautenberg family has \nfollowed this closely. Bonnie Lautenberg has followed this. They are \ngoing to be very proud.\n  As you know, we are naming the legislation after Frank Lautenberg. It \nis going to be called the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act of 2015. \nSo all of us who served with Frank Lautenberg are going to be very \nhappy and proud that this significant major piece of legislation will \ncarry his name.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in response, let me say that Senator Udall \nis far too generous to me, but I can assure you right now that Bonnie \nLautenberg is watching this. We would not have been able to do this if \nyou had not provided the leadership in the Democrats. You kept bringing \nmore and more people in, making modest changes, and I was quite shocked \nat some that came in. But you and Bonnie were the leaders.\n  This bill is so significant to every manufacturer, everyone who does \nany kind of business. We will now finally get a handle on and be able \nto analyze what chemicals are in the best interest of America and the \nbest safety interests of our people. I thank Senator Udall so much for \nhis participation and bringing the group together.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know there is a lot going on today: \nthe spending bill, the budget. They are very critical to our country. \nThere is certainly a lot of focus on that. A lot of people are spending \na lot of time, myself included, digging into that agreement, but the \nnews yesterday on Iran also deserves our attention. Reuters reported \nthat Iran, according to the U.N. Security Council panel of experts, \nviolated U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 when it tested a \nballistic missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead in October. \nThey said it was a violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution. \nThey are looking at--and it is probably likely, what you see here--the \nIranians also launched another ballistic missile in November. That is \nalso another likely violation of a U.N. Security Council resolution.\n  I made some remarks on the floor a few days ago about Iran and about \nthe nuclear deal. I reminded my colleagues that one of the selling \npoints by the President and by Secretary Kerry about this deal was they \nwere making the case that it was likely to improve Iran's behavior: \nbring them into the community of nations, get them to behave more like \na normal country and not the world's largest sponsor of terrorism, \nwhich it currently is.\n  Since the signing of the nuclear deal, which we debated on this \nfloor, Iran's behavior has only gotten worse. Examples are very \nnumerous. Leaders of the country continue to hold rallies, chanting: \n``Death to America,'' ``Death to Israel.'' Iran continues to fund \nHezbollah--one of its terrorist proxies around the world--hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. It violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that \nprevent the Quds Force commander, General Soleimani, from traveling. He \nactually traveled to Russia to meet with Mr. Putin to talk about arms \ntrade, in likely a violation of another security council resolution.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recently said that up to \n2,000 Iranian troops are in Syria helping to keep the Assad regime in \npower, working with the Russians on that.\n  Something that we can never forget, probably the worst outrage that \nwe have seen, all since the signing of the nuclear agreement a couple \nof months ago, is that in a direct affront to the United States and our \ncitizens, Iran is still holding five Americans against their will. They \ntook another American hostage since the signing of this agreement. One \nof them is a marine. One of them is a pastor. One of them is a \nWashington Post reporter. They are all fellow American citizens.\n  As we prepare for the holidays, when families come together, when \nfriends come together, the President and Secretary Kerry should be \nworking day and night on the phone, every instrument of American power, \nto try and release these Americans, but that certainly doesn't seem to \nbe happening.\n  All of this has taken place since the signing of the agreement. All \nof this is proof enough that the Iran nuclear deal certainly didn't \nchange Iran's behavior for the better. To the contrary, it is becoming \nincreasingly clear that the Obama administration's deal with Iran has \nonly emboldened Iran to take more provocative action against the United \nStates, our citizens, and our allies.\n  Iran's leaders are testing us. It is clear they are testing us right \nnow. How we respond to these tests is critical. As noted, Iran's \nmissile launches on October 11 clearly violated U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1921. The one on November 21 likely did as well. What does \nthis mean? What does this mean for the current Iran nuclear deal that \nwas recently signed? What are the implications on moving forward with \nthat deal? What are the implications of this activity on moving forward \nwith that deal?\n  I believe a strong argument can be made that these actions by Iran \nmean they are already violating the spirit and the intent of the \nnuclear agreement that this body just voted on a few months ago--\nalready.\n  Former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton \nactually predicted this just last week when she stated: They are going \nto violate it. They are going to violate the nuclear agreement, and \nwhen they do, we need to respond quickly and very harshly.\n  That was the former Secretary of State, former Member of this body. I \nthink Secretary Clinton was right on this.\n  President Obama himself indicated that there is definitely a tie \nbetween the Iranian nuclear deal from his administration and Iran's use \nof ballistic missile activities. As a matter of fact, the President in \na press conference clearly stated that the prohibitions on these \nactivities were part of the nuclear agreement, when in July of this \nyear, after the signing of the agreement, President Obama stated:\n\n       What I said to our negotiators was . . . let's press for a \n     longer extension of the arms embargo and the ballistic \n     missile prohibitions. And we got that. We got five years in \n     which, under this new agreement, arms coming in and out of \n     Iran are prohibited, and we got eight years for the \n     respective ballistic missiles.\n\n  This is the President talking about his nuclear agreement.\n  To look at another tie between ballistic missiles and the nuclear \nagreement, you need to look at the U.N. Security Council that \nimplemented the Iran nuclear deal. That is U.N. Security Council \nResolution 2231. That is replacing some of the other U.N. security \ncouncil resolutions, and it is the legal framework for the nuclear deal \nthat this body debated and approved. Here is what U.N. Security Council \nResolution 2231 states: ``Iran is called upon not to undertake any \nactivity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of \ndelivering nuclear weapons . . . until the date eight years after the \nJCPOA adoption day.''\n  Again, plain English of the connection. The U.N. Security Council \nResolution--that is the international framework for the nuclear deal--\nsays: no ballistic missile activity by Iran.\n  Yet now we know in no uncertain terms because our U.N. Ambassador, \nAmbassador Power, just stated that this launch in October was what that \nU.N. Security Council resolution said Iran couldn't do. She said that \nlaunch was inherently capable of delivering a nuclear weapon. Those are \na lot of U.N. Security Council resolutions. That is a lot of activity.\n  Where does that leave us with regard to the Iran nuclear deal? It is \nobviously clear that Iran just violated U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1929. That has already been stated by the panel of experts, \nby Ambassador Power, and the language of the U.N. Security Council \nResolution 2231--the implementation of the U.N. resolution of the \nIranian U.N. deal.\n  This is what I mean when I say that Iran is already violating the \nspirit and the intent of the Iran nuclear deal. The deal that this body \ndebated a couple of months ago is already being violated by the \nIranians.\n  What should we do? Some of us have already taken action. Thirty-five \nMembers of this body yesterday sent a letter to the President--written \nby my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte--and it said \nbasically: Mr. President, given these ballistic missile activities, \ngiven that Iran is violating U.N. Security Council resolutions that \nrelate to the nuclear agreement, you should not be lifting sanctions.\n  The Obama administration is talking about lifting sanctions as part \nof the\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nnuclear agreement as early as next month--tens of billions of dollars \nto the world's largest terrorist regime--sanctions are going to be \nlifted to allow them to continue their provocative activities against \nthe United States, our allies, and our citizens.\n  What we are saying, one-third of the Members of this body, is that we \nshouldn't be doing that. The President should heed the advice of \nSenator Ayotte's letter. Additionally, I think a strong argument--and \npeople need to look at this issue--that can be made about Iran's recent \nbehavior is that we cannot lift these sanctions pursuant to the terms \nof the nuclear deal. The nuclear agreement that was debated in this \nbody states that before sanctions are lifted on implementation day, \nIran must be in accord with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, \nwhich among other things calls upon Iran not to undertake activity \nrelated to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\n  Do you see how they are related? The nuclear agreement that this body \nagreed to, the implementation plan of the nuclear agreement, paragraph \n34(3) says that Iran has to be in accord with this provision in order \nfor sanctions to be lifted.\n  Iran is not in accord with this provision. The U.N. has said that. \nAmbassador Power said that. The bottom line is, if Iran is already \nviolating this U.N. Security Council resolution, then under paragraph \n34(3) of the implementation plan of the nuclear deal by the Obama \nadministration, sanctions shouldn't be lifted.\n  Here is how the President put it when he was selling the deal. ``If \nIran violates this deal, the sanctions we imposed that have helped \ncripple the Iranian economy--the sanctions that helped make this deal \npossible--would snap back into place promptly.''\n  I agree that is what we should be doing, but here is the key point. \nThe President doesn't need to wait for the sanctions to snap back. He \ncan and he should take action now, before it is too late, before \nbillions of dollars flood into Iran--the world's largest state sponsor \nof terrorism.\n  That is why over one-third of the Members of this body wrote the \nPresident yesterday. I urge my colleagues--particularly my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle who I know are concerned about these \nissues because I have had discussions with a number of them--that they \nshould be writing the President as well. They should be telling the \nPresident the same thing: Mr. President, Iran is violating the \nagreement; don't lift the sanctions. He can and should act now.\n\n  The President should not lift sanctions against Iran. He needs to go \nback and reread his own nuclear agreement, and he needs to heed the \nadvice of his former Secretary of State to ``act quickly and harshly \nagainst Iran'' when it violates the agreement by not allowing them \naccess to tens of billions of dollars. The President needs to do that \nnow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8783-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8783-S8785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MAINTAINING AMERICA'S DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a man who \nhas dutifully served our Nation as a public servant for more than 30 \nyears--Mr. John B. Johns. John will retire from his role as the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Maintenance Policy and Programs at \nthe end of this year. We will miss his leadership, his tenacity in \ntackling the impossible, and his courage in the face of adversity.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing John for several years and have \nalways been amazed at his commitment to our country and his devotion to \nour military. In his current role, he is responsible for the oversight \nof the Department of Defense's maintenance program that exceeds an \nannual budget of $80 billion. During his distinguished career, John has \nbeen deployed twice--first to Iraq in 2010, where he served as the \ndirector of the training and advisory mission and the director of \nlogistics for the Iraqi Security Forces; and second to Afghanistan in \n2013, where he served as the executive director of Afghan National \nSecurity Forces Sustainment for the International Security Assistance \nForce.\n  One of John's primary duties in his current position is to host the \nannual Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium that recognizes \nexcellence in maintenance activities within the Armed Services and the \nCoast Guard. During this event, the Department recognizes leaders and \norganizations for the superior service they render to promote the \nreadiness of the U.S. military. I wanted to read the remarks that John \noffered at this year's symposium last week. The title of John's address \nis ``Maintaining America's Defense.'' His words are as follows:\n  ``For seven years this community has been very kind to me; you have \nbeen gracious and patient as I spoke from this stage. I now ask you to \nindulge me one last time as I speak of maintaining America's defense.\n  Brave warriors have fought and died, and their brothers and sisters \nstand watch today, in harm's way, to both secure and maintain peace, to \ndeter and defeat forces that are committed to a future fundamentally \ndifferent than the one you and I envision. The world is a complex, \ndangerous, and unstable place with evolving threats, both new and old. \nThe reality is we are facing skilled, determined enemies that would \njust as soon strike at us as they would take a breath. They clearly do \nnot share the same view on humanity, nor the value of life, as we do. \nThis environment demands the flexibility, agility and lethality that \nonly our United States Military can provide.\n  From the first shots that signaled the birth of our country, men at \narms have served as an instrument of state, and their strength, as \nindividuals and as a force, have enabled and secured both victory and \npeace. Today, the presence of United States Forces, controlling the \nbattle space, conducting strike operations with the ability to see but \nremain unseen, to dominate the land, sea, and air, to rain fire and \ndestruction, provide clarity to all those that contemplate harm to us \nor our interests. That aggression will not be tolerated. But, as you \nknow, we have not always acted properly, nor responded with appropriate \nspeed, to events in the world that have demanded our attention. We make \nmany mistakes, and it is true we are slow to anger. But, once our limit \nhas been breached and restraint abandoned, there is nothing on this \nplanet, nor has there ever been, like the hell unleashed from coiled \nfury of the United States Military.\n  You should all be proud of the role you play in maintaining that \ncapability--most recently, maintaining readiness of our forces over a \ndecade of continuous combat, in two complex theaters, in unforgiving \nenvironments, while maintaining a credible presence throughout the rest \nof the world. You enabled this, and for that, you should be proud. All \nof you in this room know a ship not ready to sail, or an aircraft not \nready to fly, has no value. And, since we have had the need for \nweapons, we have had the need for those that maintain them. This \neternal bond is a covenant, a sacred promise, between those that \ngenerate readiness and those that apply it, and we seal this covenant \nwith a commitment to excellence. All of you in this room, and those you \nrepresent, should be rightfully proud, an embodiment of this covenant \nand commitment, reminding any who mistakenly underestimate the power \nand will of our United States Military that we are capable of striking \nwith speed and violence.\n  So where, then, should we expect the approach of danger; what will be \nits origin? I suggest our greatest enemy, our greatest threat, is not \nRussia; our greatest enemy is not ISIS, ISIL, DEASH, or whatever we are \ncalling them now; it's not China, it's not North Korea, and it's \ncertainly not climate change. Yes, of course, they are all threats; I \nwould never say they're not. But they are born of something much more \nfundamental. I suggest our greatest threat is the dangerous mix of \nmediocrity, poor judgment, and tolerance--here, on our ground.\n  In his Lyceum address, Lincoln said, `Shall we expect some \ntransatlantic\n\n[[Page S8784]]\n\nmilitary giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow? Never! All the \narmies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined, with all the treasure of \nthe earth in their military chest, with a Bonaparte for a commander, \ncould not by force, take a drink from the Ohio or make a track on the \nBlue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years. At what point then is the \napproach of danger to be expected? I answer--If it ever reach us, it \nmust spring up amongst us; it cannot come from abroad. If destruction \nbe our lot, we must ourselves be its author, and finisher. As a nation \nof freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.'\n  Our greatest enemy is the dangerous mix of tolerance and mediocrity--\nmediocrity fueled by those lacking honor, judgment, courage and \ndetermination, and the tyranny of tolerance characterized by slumbering \napathy, a comfortable denial of reality, and paralyzing bureaucracy. \nThis toxic mix, this deadly combination, creates or fuels all other \nthreats, allowing what would be a simple challenge to evolve into \ndanger. Our enemies demand greatness of us; our partners in the world, \nto which we have made commitments, demand greatness of us; our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coastguardsmen demand greatness of \nus; those that have made the ultimate sacrifice demand greatness of us. \nAnd we should demand it from ourselves. But, absent clear and present \ndanger, we approach greatness hesitantly and inefficiently, only when \ncompelled, operating at the edge of greatness, at risk of losing it.\n  We have many examples of those who have achieved greatness. Some we \nwill recognize tonight just as we have in the past. And we should \ncontinue to recognize those that rise above and achieve truly uncommon \nthings, but contemplate that word ``uncommon.'' It means some stand on \nthe pinnacle of true greatness and others do not. As hard as that is to \naccept, we all know it to be true, and the slope to that pinnacle of \ngreatness is steep. Many never make it to the top, and many can't find \na way to stay there. It takes much to climb and takes even more to \nremain there. Those that stand at the top, however, are those that \nchange the world. They set an uncommon path to achieve uncommon things, \nand we see this greatness through their achievements and their \ncharacter.\n  But let's be careful because they are not the only ones with claims \non the future. Those at the bottom, and even those that occupy the \nmiddle ground, can also claim this power to change the world but, \nclearly, not in the same way as we desire. So what differentiates those \nthat carry the banner of greatness? What allows those to scale that \nslope to the peak of performance? What robs those at the bottom from \nthe ability to climb? What defines the middle ground of mediocrity? \nWhat do we need to know about standing on the pinnacle? And how do we \navoid a fall from greatness?\n  For this I refer to four words used so well by John F. Kennedy in a \nspeech to the Massachusetts State Legislature one month before he was \ninaugurated as President of the United States. He said, `When the High \nCourt of History sits in judgment of us all, no matter our station, our \nsuccess or failure, will be measured by the answer to four questions. \nWere we truly men of honor? Were we truly men of judgment? Were we \ntruly men of courage? And, were we truly men of determination?'\n  Honor--to do the right thing and treat others with respect. \nJudgment--to see the future and the path to get there. Courage--to take \naction and speak the truth. Determination--to produce required results \nand finish what we start. These are the words that define greatness; \nwords that serve as our test that guide our every thought, our every \ndecision, our every action; words that should determine who we consider \nfriends with whom we surround ourselves and how we choose leaders; \nwords that should fill both our minds and our hearts. And where we fall \non the scale defined by these words will determine not only our success \nor failure as individuals but also our contribution to our \norganizations, our country, and the world. Where we fall on this scale \nwill determine our legacy.\n  There is much at stake and we cannot afford to aspire to anything \nless than greatness. And we should remember our actions, or inaction, \naffect the strength of our military, the posture of our country, and \nthe security of the world. I would not be speaking to you this way if \nthey did not, if somehow the world spun on, immune to our words and \nbehavior, but that is not the case. Every day we send soldiers, \nmarines, sailors, airmen, and coastguardsmen into harm's way. We send \nthem to defeat an enemy that tests the will of our United States \nMilitary. We send them to provide aid and comfort to those in need, and \nwe send them to mature foreign security forces and governments \nstruggling to shape their own destiny. In executing these missions they \nnot only secure our liberty but also serve as the single greatest \nsymbol of liberty in the world. Collectively, they are the most capable \nforce that has ever existed. Every day they signal to a world at war \nthat both the hand of compassion and the sword of justice extend across \nthe world.\n  There is great honor in this, and many have worn that badge. Many of \nthose are still with us, but too many are not, having paid the ultimate \nprice, made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our country. But, \nafter all we have done and the price we have paid, the world remains a \nchaotic, complex, and dangerous place. To see this all you have to do \nis pay even a little attention to the situations in Iraq, Syria, Iran, \nAfghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, Western Pacific, Nigeria, Libya, in our \nboard rooms, on our production floors, in our class rooms, on our \ntelevisions, and in our governments.\n  Now, I could say, let's just all work it out. Let's bring everybody \ntogether on any infinite number of problems, conflicts, disagreements, \nand just work through them. How simple that sounds. Surely that would \nwork. But haven't we tried that before? How many times have we tried \nthat before? And, yet, here we are still facing some of the most vexing \nproblems we have ever faced. In fact, at times it seems that we are \nreliving some things we thought we had solved, only to see them re-\nemerge. Among many questions we must ask--why has it taken over a \ndecade to develop the sustainment strategy for our new strike fighter, \nfigure out the basic rules that govern a global spares pool, and \nappropriately budget to stand up supporting depot maintenance \ncapability? Why, after diligent collaboration and full transparency, \ncould the Department, Industry, and Congress, with all our might, find \nourselves incapable of passing common-sense revisions to the depot \nmaintenance-related statutes that would have benefited all of us? Why, \nafter over half a decade and endless debate, could we not implement an \nenterprise, performance-based approach integrating a collection of \nindividually executed contracts across the Military Departments that \nwould have offered greatly improved supply availability and reduced \ncost? Why have we seen nearly a decade-long decline in naval aviation \nreadiness with misleading and confusing explanations for root causes \nand corrective actions, from denial that there even is a problem to the \nuse of false narratives underlying recovery strategies? Why, after a \ncompletely integrated, multi-service team approach, taking nearly half \na decade, can we not make a much-needed unmanned air system software \ndepot source of repair assignment? And why, after a decade long effort \nto develop the capability and capacity of the Iraqi and Afghan Security \nForces, have we seen the near complete disintegration of those forces \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, defying all comprehension, a failed supply \nsystem, and a dysfunctional maintenance strategy that violates all \nreasonable logic?\n  How is this possible? Why do we tolerate this? Some may think my \nthoughts lack sophistication or I simply don't understand. I'll \nacknowledge that we face complex situations, but I assure you, I \nunderstand all too well.\n  The fact is we tolerate too much. We tolerate mediocrity or even \nincompetence. We tolerate lies and half-truths. We tolerate \nirresponsible self-interest. We tolerate political expediency. We \ntolerate any other innumerable demonstrations of misbehavior. But let's \nnot confuse tolerance with much needed compassion, empathy, and \nflexibility. Certainly, we need to see other perspectives and accept \nalternative paths. And we know empathy and flexibility are key \ningredients in collaboration, but that doesn't mean we need to tolerate \nthings that are fundamentally wrong, things that will\n\n[[Page S8785]]\n\nlead us down the path to ruin. I see no honor in this, no judgment, no \ncourage.\n  In these cases, we must have absolutely no tolerance--no tolerance \nfor incompetence, no tolerance for those without integrity, and no \ntolerance for self-interest that overrides the greater good. And, just \nto be clear, this is purely and simply an issue of leadership. Some may \nnot see it. And some may be misled, burdened with the inability to \ndifferentiate between true leadership and those impersonating leaders. \nBut those that are tired of political correctness, the endless pursuit \nof consensus, unprofessional behavior, and paralyzing bureaucracy, they \nunderstand.\n  And those that expect vision, those that expect strategy, those that \nexpect executable plans, those that expect fairness, honor, judgment, \ncourage, determination from our leaders, they understand. And we should \ncertainly not tolerate the behaviors of the few with cavalier disregard \nof the facts, the few that masquerade as leaders, and those that can't \nrecognize it or lack the will to deal with it as they should, those \nthat are threatened by honesty and candor that send the signal that \nthis is ok and that even reward it. Tolerance here is insidious and \ndangerous. It doesn't take many examples to poison a culture and affect \ngenerations. We cannot afford to let this happen. We cannot afford \nanything less than greatness. This is why I am speaking this way.\n  We must have the courage to recognize good performance, regardless of \nwhether it is politically correct, and deal appropriately with bad \nperformance. We must have the courage to speak truth to those below us, \naround us, and above us. Ambiguity, half-truths, misleading messages, \nand lies demonstrate poor judgment and lack of courage. Tolerance of \nthis, at best, creates inefficiency and weakness, and at its worst, \ndanger. We all should have the judgment and courage to recognize this, \ncall it for what it is, and dedicate ourselves to eliminating it.\n  In this moment we require leaders. We require leaders that are \ncapable of seeing new patterns in complexity and conflict and applying \nnew methods to achieve unconventional and uncommon outcomes. We need \nleaders at all levels that have no tolerance for status quo and \nmediocrity. We need leaders with competence and courage, with the \nability to learn and adapt quickly. We need leaders that are \ncomfortable making decisions and taking action in the face of \nsignificant ambiguity, unclear guidance, and near impossible timelines. \nWe need leaders that know how to generate both unity of command and \nunity of effort. It remains all our duty to recognize and contribute to \nthe greater good. We must be able to understand the interests of others \nand exercise the flexibility and skill in accommodating those interests \nwhile protecting our own.\n  And just because we can see the need for collaboration doesn't mean \nwe can just wish it into being. There is a science to collaboration and \nwe must be well practiced at it. In fact, we should all be experts \nbecause we must accept the simple fact that no truly great thing is \nachievable without others. No great accomplishment was, or ever will \nbe, possible without collaborative effort. In fact, the more complex a \nthing, the more challenges we face, the more disciplines are involved, \nthe more integration is required, and the more collaboration is \ndemanded. It is time for collaboration based on respect--respect for \nwell-argued positions, respect for expertise, respect for remarkable \nperformance. It is time for collaboration rooted in both art and \nscience. It is time to put in place principles that bind us by \ncovenants and not just contracts or legal documents. It is time to \nevolve from practitioners to experts and evangelists.\n  There is clearly science in this, but science is not enough. We need \nthe `artist.' We need the artist to apply the principals of this \nscience. Like any great piece of art, it is not simply a collection of \ncanvas and paint applied in the correct order. There is an ingredient \nthat only the artist can provide, an ingredient that differentiates a \ncommon work from one that is uncommon. And what makes relationships so \ndifficult is that more than one person is painting on the canvas at the \nsame time and, still, the result must look as though only one artist \nheld the brush. We need the artists; we need the leaders that know this \nand have the skill to execute it.\n  It is time, it is always the time, to carefully and ruthlessly choose \nthese leaders--leaders that understand what I have just said; leaders \nthat demonstrate extraordinary courage, honor, determination, and \njudgment; leaders that understand how to nurture and protect \ninnovation; leaders that understand and can enable collaboration. For \nit will be only those leaders that will take us to new heights of \nperformance and to deeper connections between all parties necessary to \nsolve the most complex problems of our time. It will be only those \nleaders that will move us aggressively forward in the right direction, \nintolerant of misbehavior and relentless in the pursuit of excellence.\n  For us, we see this as our duty. We are determined to the produce \nresults that are required by our military and our country--to fight and \nwin on any battlefield, of any kind, at any time. The future is ours to \nshape. And make no mistake, the high court of history will hold each of \nus accountable with the lives of those we send to stand on future \nbattlefields. I ask you to consider what I have just said.\n  In this job I have had the honor to see the work of patriots, those \nthat generate readiness for those that apply it, to support and serve \nbeside those that stand in harm's way, and to place coins in the hands \nof thousands that embody the words honor, judgment, courage, and \ndetermination. And what is left for me to do now is simply say thank \nyou. Thank you to those that secure our freedom, no matter their \nposition. Thank you to those for which I have great admiration and to \nwhich I will always be in debt.''\n  John's speech is a lesson to us all. I personally will strive to \nanswer the call and live up to the virtues he praises: honor, judgment, \ncourage, and determination. As I stated in a video message to this \nyear's symposium attendees, I count myself fortunate and blessed to \ncall John a friend and wish him continued success in his future \nendeavors.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8785-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8785-S8786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JORDAN SMITH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to give tribute to a \nKentuckian who has become a local icon and a national celebrity. Jordan \nSmith from Harlan, KY, has risen to fame over the past few months for \nhis astounding performances throughout this season of the television \nshow The Voice. He sang his way into the hearts of Americans, and \nfollowing his rendition of Queen's ``Somebody to Love'' on December 16, \nthe show's viewers voted him to a first place win.\n  I know I speak for my fellow Kentuckians when I say we are so proud \nto have someone like Jordan representing our State. This proud Kentucky \nWildcat fan not only clinched a first place win in the competition, he \nalso rose to a No. 1 spot on iTunes for record sales, beating out \nsuperstars like Adele. I think we have so many talented individuals \nlike Jordan in Kentucky, and I am so glad that everyone else thinks so, \ntoo.\n  A homecoming parade in Jordan's honor is scheduled for Monday, \nDecember 21, in his hometown. Kentucky is excited to welcome him home \nand even more so to see what he will do with his amazing talent in the \nfuture. I would like to congratulate Jordan Smith for all his success. \nI am certain we will be hearing much more from him in the years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article about Jordan's \nhistoric win from the Harlan Daily Enterprise be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Harlan Daily Enterprise, Dec. 15, 2015]\n\n                     Smith Is Season 9 Voice Winner\n\n                        (By Reina P. Cunningham)\n\n       After months of show-stopping performances, Harlan native \n     Jordan Smith has been announced as Season 9 winner of the hit \n     reality television show `The Voice,' winning $100,000 and a \n     recording contract with Republic Records.\n       Going into the show, Smith was sitting pretty at the No. 1 \n     spots on both `The Voice' and the Top 100 iTunes charts with \n     his most recent single, `Mary Did You Know.' Sitting at the \n     No. 1 spot is nothing new for the young man who beat out \n     national singing\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\n     sensation Adele for the No. 1 spot on the Top 100 iTunes \n     chart--he has entered most of the results rounds in the same \n     situation. Additionally, going into the live results finale, \n     Smith held half of the top 10 spots on `The Voice' iTunes \n     charts and had 10 singles ranking on `The Voice' chart--no \n     easy feat considering the criteria for doing so means the \n     single must be ranked on the Top 200 iTunes chart.\n       In addition to performing with former contestants from this \n     season, Smith performed with former Voice coach and world \n     renowned singer Usher on Tuesday night's live results show. \n     The duo sang Usher's hit `Without You' with the crowd \n     screaming and cheering throughout the performance as Smith \n     showcased his broad range.\n       Throughout the show, Smith has remained humble as the \n     judges continue to remark on his flawless performances, \n     citing his perfection and ability to connect with the \n     audience.\n       The judges are not the only ones raving about Smith. Fans \n     are posting on social media about how much the young artist \n     has inspired them through his music. In addition to \n     purchasing iTunes and making social media posts, fans cannot \n     get enough of Smith's performances. As of the finale show on \n     Tuesday, Smith's YouTube performances on the show had an \n     outstanding 55 million views to date.\n       Smith spoke about what the experience has meant to him in \n     an interview that aired during the live finale. The young \n     singer, who continuously stressed how important it is to him \n     to make it acceptable to be who you are, echoed those \n     sentiments again during the interview, saying if he won the \n     show it would prove it.\n       ``You can be exactly who you are . . . to be the winner of \n     The Voice would just prove that,'' said Smith.\n       Later in the show, the top 4 performers were surprised with \n     brand new vehicles--courtesy of the show's partners, Nissan.\n       Smith chose the Nissan Altima and expressed his gratitude \n     for the vehicle, saying he would not have to borrow his \n     parents' car anymore.\n       Smith was the only remaining contestant on coach Adam \n     Levine's team and the coach was obviously thrilled for the \n     young man who he says has inspired him throughout the show.\n       Smith will be making appearances on numerous upcoming \n     television shows as a result of the win.\n       A homecoming celebration is planned on Monday in Smith's \n     honor. A parade will begin at 2:30 p.m. in downtown Harlan \n     followed by a program at 4 p.m. at the Harlan Center.\n       To continue following Smith, like his Facebook page and \n     follow him on Twitter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8786-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8786-S8788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we close the book on the first session \nof the 114th Congress, our attention is on the thousands of pages in \nthe omnibus spending bill. But as the Republican leadership rushes to \nspin the press about what the Senate has accomplished in their 12 \nmonths in the majority, there is one Senate responsibility that should \nnot get lost in the noise. That is our responsibility to equip our \ncoequal branches of government, the Federal judiciary and the executive \nbranch, with the confirmed public servants that both branches need to \nserve the American people.\n  Senate Republicans began the year by filibustering the nomination of \nthe first Black woman to be nominated for the position of Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. No other Attorney General nominee in our \nhistory has been met with a filibuster. That did not stop Republicans \nfrom holding up Loretta Lynch's nomination longer than the last seven \nAttorneys Generals combined. Our Nation's top law enforcement official \ndeserved better treatment, but the fight to get her a confirmation vote \npreviewed how difficult it would be to get votes scheduled on other \ncrucial nominees. Republicans have blocked confirmation votes for the \npeople nominated to serve as Ambassadors to some of our closest allies. \nThey have blocked consideration of nominees who would help keep our \ncountry safe from terrorist threats, including a Treasury Department \nnominee who would lead an office that investigates terrorist financing.\n  By the end of this week, Senate Republicans will have also earned the \ndubious distinction of matching the record for confirming the fewest \nannual number of judicial nominees in more than half a century. Too \nmany Americans who have sought justice in our Federal courts this year \nhave instead found delays and empty courtrooms because of Senate \nRepublicans' obstruction on judicial nominees. I am concerned that \nRepublicans' treatment of our third branch risks politicizing it and \ndiminishing the role that it was designed to play in our system of \ngovernment.\n  For the first 6 years of President Obama's tenure in office, Senate \nRepublicans pulled out every stop to obstruct confirmations on judicial \nnominees--systematically filibustering nominees and abandoning the \nSenate's tradition of confirming consensus judicial nominees before \nlong recesses. While I was hopeful they would change course once they \nassumed the majority, they have instead taken their obstruction to \nunprecedented heights by virtually shutting down judicial \nconfirmations.\n  Over the course of the entire year, Senate Republicans have allowed \njudicial confirmation votes for only 11 nominees. In stark contrast, \nwhen Senate Democrats were in the majority during the seventh year of \nthe Bush Presidency, we confirmed 40 judges that year--more than triple \nthe number of judges confirmed this year. The Senate has a \nconstitutional duty to provide advice and consent on the President's \nnominees. It is part of the core duties we must fulfill as Senators, \nand a fully functioning Federal judiciary is dependent on us meeting \nthis obligation.\n  I have urged the Republican leaders to allow confirmation votes on \nthe uncontroversial judicial nominees before the end of the year. We \nhave 19 judicial nominees still pending on the floor. Each of these \nnominees was voice voted out of the Judiciary Committee, and each has \nthe support of their home State Senators. Traditionally, the Senate has \nconfirmed such consensus nominees at the end of a session, but \nRepublicans have repeatedly refused to do so during the Obama \nPresidency. This is the seventh year in a row that Senate Republicans \nare rejecting the Senate's practice of consenting to confirmation votes \nat the end of a session. At the end of 2009, Senate Republicans left 10 \njudicial nominees on the Senate floor without a vote. At the end of \n2010 and again in 2011, Senate Republicans left 19 judicial nominees \npending on the calendar as they left town. In 2012, it was 11 judicial \nnominees, and in 2013, it was nine that Senate Republicans left pending \non the floor. Last year, Senate Republicans attempted to block 12 \nnominees on the floor in December. Fortunately, because Leader Reid \ntook seriously the Senate's duty to fill judicial vacancies and filed \ncloture on those nominees, we were able to get those nominees \nconfirmed. In each of the last 2 years of the George W. Bush \nadministration when Democrats were in the Senate majority, we confirmed \nall of President Bush's judicial nominees pending on the Executive \nCalendar in December before we left for the year. Contrast that with \nthis year when Senate Republicans are leaving 19 judicial nominees \npending on the floor as they head home.\n  The Republicans' double standard for President Obama's nominees will \nforce the Senate to spend time next year doing work that should have \nbeen completed by now. For example, for the 19 nominations Senate \nRepublicans left in 2010 and again in 2011, it took nearly half the \nfollowing year in each case for the Senate to confirm these nominees. \nPerhaps Senate Republicans' real intent is to just run out the clock on \nthe Obama administration--but these delays are not procedural \nabstractions without real world consequences. For the judicial nominees \nwho have already made a commitment to public service in the Federal \njudiciary, the obstruction means they must continue to wait and keep \ntheir professional lives on hold wondering if the Senate will do its \njob.\n  The consequences for the judges currently serving in the Federal \njudiciary, as well as the litigants seeking justice before them, are \nalso very real. Senate Republicans' treatment of judicial nominations \nhas resulted in a dramatic increase in judicial vacancies this year. \nSince Republicans took over the majority in January, judicial vacancies \nhave increased by more than 50 percent--from 42 to 66. These vacancies \nimpact communities across America, and it is doing the most harm to \nStates with at least one Republican Senator. Of the 66 current \nvacancies that exist, 47 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in \nStates with at least one Republican Senator.\n  Of critical concern is the fact that judicial vacancies deemed to be \n``emergency'' vacancies by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nhave\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nmore than doubled this year. These vacancies represent judicial \ndistricts where caseloads are unmanageably high, leading to lengthier \ndelays for parties before those courts; yet, as we leave for the year, \n9 of the 19 nominees pending on the floor that Senate Republicans \nrefuse to confirm are judicial emergency vacancies in Pennsylvania, \nTennessee, Minnesota, New Jersey, Iowa, New York, and California.\n  In addition to the article III nominees, there are five nominees to \nthe U.S. Court of Federal Claims who were nominated well over a year \nago. Each of these nominees was unanimously voice voted out of \nCommittee last year and again this year. The Court of Federal Claims \nhas been referred to as the ``keeper of the nation's conscience'' and \n``the People's Court'' because it allows citizens with claims against \nthe government to promptly seek justice. It is critically important \nthat we confirm the five pending nominees to this court. However, they \ncontinue to be blocked by a single Republican Senator--the junior \nSenator of Arkansas.\n  Senator Cotton claims to have concerns that the court's caseload is \nnot high enough and that the court should simply depend on senior \njudges coming out of retirement to hear cases. A recent letter to the \ncommittee from the chief judge of the Court of Federal Claims, however, \nindicates that only one of the nine senior judges is willing to be \nrecalled for full-time duty and the other three would only agree to be \nrecalled on a limited basis. Furthermore, the court's overall caseload \nhas increased by 9 percent over the last year. No member of the \nJudiciary Committee raised caseload concerns when these nominees were \nunanimously approved by voice vote last year or again this year. There \nis no good reason for Senator Cotton to deprive Americans across the \ncountry of a fully functioning Court of Federal Claims by blocking the \nfive highly qualified nominees from receiving an up-or-down vote. These \nnominees include Armando Bonilla, a Cuban American who has devoted his \nentire career to public service at the U.S. Department of Justice; Jeri \nSomers, an African-American woman who spent over two decades serving as \na judge advocate general and as a military judge; and several others \nwho would contribute to our justice system. As these nominees approach \nthe 2-year mark of waiting for the Senate to take up their \nconfirmations, I urge Senator Cotton to consider these well-qualified \nnominees on their merits.\n  I have heard some suggest that Republicans' glacial pace on judicial \nconfirmations is political retribution for the change to Senate rules \nregarding nominations. This obstruction, however, does not hurt U.S. \nSenators--it hurts the American people. Behind the statistics on \nRepublican obstruction--the number of nominees languishing without \nvotes on the Senate floor, the rising number of judicial vacancies, and \nthe dramatic increase in emergency vacancies--are the experiences of \nreal people in our justice system--individuals and small businesses \nseeking justice in our Federal courts who end up waiting for years for \noverburdened courts to hear their claims.\n  The national press, including the Wall Street Journal and the \nAssociated Press, has highlighted the devastating effects of the high \nnumber of judicial vacancies. The Wall Street Journal interviewed one \nof the Federal judges in a California district where a judgeship went \nunfilled for almost 3 years. Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill said, ``Over the \nyears I've received several letters from people indicating, `Even if I \nwin this case now, my business has failed because of the delay. How is \nthis justice?' And the simple answer, which I cannot give them, is \nthis: It is not justice. We know it.''\n  Senate Republicans' obstruction on judicial nominees has also had \nanother effect; it has halted the enormous progress needed in making \nthe Federal judiciary better reflect the citizenry it serves. This \nprogress increases public confidence in our justice system. I am proud \nof the fact that there are more women and minorities than ever before \nserving on our Federal bench.\n  Yet, as we conclude this session, the Senate is leaving several \nnominees of color with outstanding qualifications on the floor without \nvotes. This includes Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo, who was nominated to a \njudicial emergency vacancy in the third circuit well over a year ago. \nWhen he is eventually confirmed, he will be the first Hispanic judge \nfrom Pennsylvania on the third circuit. Judge Restrepo has the strong \nsupport of the Hispanic National Bar Association and has bipartisan \nsupport from his home State Senators, Senator Toomey and Senator Casey. \nSenator Toomey has said not only that he strongly supports Judge \nRestrepo's confirmation, but that he also recommended him to the \nPresident. Despite this overwhelming support for his nomination and the \nemergency vacancy that needs to be filled urgently, Republican \nleadership recently skipped over Judge Restrepo on the Executive \nCalendar to confirm a district court nominee from Tennessee for a \nnonemergency judgeship.\n  In addition to Judge Restrepo, Senate Republicans are adjourning for \nthe year with four exceptional African-American district court nominees \nand an exceptional Hispanic district court nominee held up on the \nfloor. Two of the African-American nominees--Waverly Crenshaw and \nEdward Stanton--have been nominated to district court positions in \nTennessee. Both have the support of their home State Republican \nSenators and were unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote. The three other nominees of color--Justice Wilhelmina \nWright to the District of Minnesota and John Vazquez and Julien Neals \nto the District of New Jersey--are all nominated to judicial emergency \nvacancies. All have the support of their home State Senators, and all \nwere voted out of the Judiciary Committee by voice vote. The only \nreason all of these nominees could not be confirmed this week is that \nSenate Republicans would not allow it.\n  While there is no reason not to hold votes on these nominees today, I \nam glad that Republicans have consented to a bipartisan plan to confirm \nfive well-qualified judicial nominees in the 5-week period after we \nreturn in the new year. Because of this agreement, the Senate will be \non pace in the first 2 months of next year to confirm almost half the \nnumber of nominees it took us this entire year to confirm. Under the \nagreement, the Senate will hold confirmation votes for Judge Restrepo \nas well as four district court nominees: Justice Wilhelmina Wright to \nthe district of Minnesota; John Vazquez to the district of New Jersey; \nJudge Rebecca Ebinger to the southern district of Iowa; and Judge \nLeonard Strand to the northern district of Iowa. Four of these nominees \nare nominated to fill emergency vacancies, and three are nominees of \ncolor. This agreement allows for good progress that the Senate must \ncontinue to build on, so that we reduce judicial vacancies to ensure \nthat Americans can seek timely justice in our courts.\n  Federal judges serve an essential role in communities across the \nNation. In 2 weeks, the Chief Justice of the United States will issue \nhis end-of-year report. His predecessor often noted in such reports the \nimpact of unfilled judicial vacancies on the functioning of the third \nbranch. I hope that such a core resource matter will again be addressed \nin the upcoming report because the Republican majority's treatment of \nnominations this past year has been an historic disappointment.\n  I hope that, in the new year, the Senate will make progress on the \njudicial nominees pending in the Judiciary Committee as well as on \nadditional nominees that we receive from the President. I was glad to \nhear the majority leader's remarks this week that he does not believe \nthere should be a cutoff point for confirming qualified judicial \nnominees in an election year. The majority leader has been consistent \non this view, and I commend him for it. In July 2008, the Senate \nRepublican caucus held a hearing solely dedicated to arguing that the \nThurmond rule does not exist. At that hearing, the senior Senator from \nKentucky stated: ``I think it's clear that there is no Thurmond Rule. \nAnd I think the facts demonstrate that.'' Similarly, the Senator from \nIowa, my friend who is now serving as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, stated at that hearing that the Thurmond rule was in his \nview ``plain bunk.'' He said: ``The reality is that the Senate has \nnever stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months \nof a president's term.'' That was certainly the case when\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\nDemocrats were in the majority in the last 2 years of the George W. \nBush administration. I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nthen, and I can tell you that Senate Democrats confirmed 22 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in the second half of 2008.\n  The American people deserve to have judicial vacancies in their \ncommunities filled. Hard-working Americans across this country are \ncounting on us to do our jobs as Senators. Our constituents call our \noffices and meet with us to let us know how they feel about the \nlegislative issues before us. They should not also have to ask us to \nfulfill the bare minimum of our constitutional duties, such as the duty \nto consider nominees in a timely manner to keep the third branch of \ngovernment fully functioning.\n  I sincerely hope the new year will bring a new approach from Senate \nRepublicans and that we can move forward to confirm all of the pending \njudicial nominees without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8788-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8788-S8789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REJECTING HATEFUL RHETORIC\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for more than 235 years, the United States \nhas served as a beacon of hope and opportunity for millions coming to \nour shores seeking a better life. Ours is a nation founded upon the \nideal of freedom, and throughout our history, there have been moments \nwhen this most fundamental ideal has been challenged. The complicated \nhistory of our Nation is not without its dark moments, but at every \nturn, we have sought to recommit ourselves to our basic ideals and \nprinciples, always moving to be a more inclusive society.\n  Today, as some continue to espouse hate-filled views that demonize \nthose of a certain faith, we need thoughtful voices to speak out and \nremind us all of what we stand for as Americans. In his column this \nweekend in the Rutland Herald, veteran journalist Barrie Dunsmore did \njust that. He reminded us that in the wake of the attacks on Pearl \nHarbor, our own government rushed to judge Japanese Americans and \nimprisoned them in internment camps out of fear they sought to do us \nharm. This was a deplorable response to a national tragedy that remains \na stain on our history. Mr. Dunsmore reflected on how this fear was \nperpetuated by news media professionals who enabled these scare tactics \nthrough their reporting and the response by some elected leaders who \nalso promulgated this fear through their own actions.\n  Fear is what drove the racist and unconstitutional response to \nJapanese Americans in the wake of the attacks on Pearl Harbor in 1941. \nAnd fear is what is encouraging some to recklessly hurl suspicion on \nMuslim Americans today in the wake of a terrorist attack in San \nBernardino, CA, and unrest around the world. As Americans, we must \ncategorically reject the divisive and corrosive rhetoric of fear that \nonly serves to undermine us as a nation.\n  Americans cannot let themselves be coerced by the politics of fear \ntoday. If we do, then the terrorists and extremists will have won. \nTerrorists want us to be afraid, and they want us to be a nation \ndivided. Groups like ISIS actively promote the narrative that Muslims \nare not welcome in the United States, and the xenophobic, hateful \nrhetoric espoused by some today plays into our enemies' hands. It also \ndemeans us as a democratic nation founded on the principles of freedom, \nequality, and liberty. We should not let our country be defined by \nirresponsible fear-mongering. We are better than that.\n  Columns like the one written this weekend by Barrie Dunsmore are \nimportant reminders of just how far we have come as a nation. We cannot \nturn back now, and we cannot turn against our fellow Americans now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Barrie \nDunsmore's column from Sunday, December 13, 2015, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Dec. 13, 2015]\n\n                       Fear in the Driver's Seat\n\n                          (By Barrie Dunsmore)\n\n       ``Nothing in modern politics equates with the rhetoric from \n     candidate Trump.'' So wrote Dan Balz this past week in The \n     Washington Post.\n       Balz is the Post's veteran and scrupulously nonpartisan \n     senior political correspondent. He also wrote: ``Trump's call \n     for a ban on Muslims entering the United States marked a \n     sudden and sizable escalation--and in this case one that sent \n     shock waves around the world--in the inflammatory and \n     sometimes demagogic rhetoric of the candidate who continues \n     to lead virtually every national and state poll testing whom \n     Republicans favor for their presidential candidate.'' \n     Evidence of Trump's support can be seen in polls since the \n     Muslim ban idea was proposed, in which a substantial majority \n     evidently agrees with him.\n       In offering a defense for his latest scheme, Trump cited \n     President Franklin Roosevelt's decision to intern thousands \n     of Japanese-Americans shortly after the Japanese attack on \n     Pearl Harbor in 1941. News reports this past week have \n     mentioned this comparison--which was probably news to many \n     Americans. When I was teaching a semester at Middlebury \n     College, a senior who was an A student, told me he had never \n     heard of the Japanese internment. That inspired me to give \n     the subject extra attention in class, and to recall that \n     period of history in this newspaper nearly a decade ago. What \n     follows are elements of that column.\n       On Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor, \n     killing more than 2,000 people and destroying much of the \n     U.S. Pacific fleet. On Feb. 19, 1942, President Roosevelt \n     signed executive order No. 9066.\n       Over the next eight months, 120,000 individuals of Japanese \n     descent were ordered to leave their homes in California, \n     Washington, Oregon and Arizona. Two-thirds were American \n     citizens representing almost 90 percent of all Japanese-\n     Americans. No charges were brought against these individuals; \n     there were no judicial hearings.\n       After being temporarily held in detention camps set up in \n     converted race tracks and fairgrounds, the internees were \n     transported to concentration camps in the deserts and \n     swamplands of the Southwest. There, they were kept in \n     overcrowded rooms with no furniture other than cots, \n     surrounded by barbed wire and military police. There they \n     remained for three years.\n       Why did this happen? In a word: fear. But it was a fear \n     that was incited, encouraged and exploited by political \n     players of many stripes. In the weeks that followed the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, California was teeming with rumors of \n     sabotage and espionage. The mayor of Los Angeles, Fletcher \n     Bowron, spread the story that Japanese fishermen and farmers \n     had been seen mysteriously waving lights along the state's \n     shoreline. The top American military commander for the \n     region, General John DeWitt, reported as true rumors that \n     enemy planes had passed over California--and claimed that \n     20,000 Japanese were about to stage an uprising in San \n     Francisco. All of these stories were false.\n       The news media also did its share of rumor-mongering. The \n     Hearst columnist Damon Runyon erroneously reported that a \n     radio transmitter had been discovered in a rooming house that \n     catered to Japanese residents. Even the respected national \n     columnist Walter Lippmann warned of a likely major act of \n     sabotage by ethnic Japanese.\n       It would not be long before virtually all West Coast \n     newspapers, the American Legion, the L.A. Chamber of \n     Commerce, a host of other business and fraternal \n     organizations--not to mention the area's top political and \n     military leaders--were demanding that all persons of Japanese \n     ancestry be removed from the West Coast. Many of these \n     demands were overtly racist, such as that of the attorney \n     general of Idaho, who proclaimed all Japanese should ``be put \n     into concentration camps for the remainder of the war . . . \n     We want to keep this a white man's country.''\n       Professor Geoffrey Stone points out in his book, ``Perilous \n     Times: Free Speech In Wartime,'' ``There was not a single \n     documented act of espionage, sabotage or treasonable activity \n     committed by an American citizen of Japanese descent or by a \n     Japanese national residing on the West Coast.''\n       President Roosevelt was not being pushed by his own \n     advisers to sign the order for the internment. Attorney \n     General Francis Biddle opposed it. So did FBI Director J. \n     Edgar Hoover who described the demands for mass evacuations \n     as ``public hysteria.'' Secretary of War Henry Stimson \n     thought internment was a ``tragedy'' and almost certainly \n     unconstitutional.\n       Professor Stone concludes, ``Although Roosevelt explained \n     the order in terms of military necessity, there is little \n     doubt that domestic politics played a role in his thinking, \n     particularly since 1942 was an election year.'' And, of \n     course, the U.S. had been attacked and was now involved in \n     another world war.\n       Those civil libertarians who opposed interment and thought \n     that the Supreme Court would ultimately reverse Roosevelt's \n     order would be disappointed. Two related cases eventually \n     reached the court, and in both, the convictions were upheld.\n       Years later some of those directly involved would publicly \n     express regret for their decisions in these cases. The \n     famously liberal Justice William O. Douglas later confessed, \n     ``I have always regretted that I bowed to my elders.'' The \n     also noted liberal Chief Justice Earl Warren, who as attorney \n     general of California played a pivotal role in the process, \n     wrote in his memoirs in 1974 that internment ``was not in \n     keeping with our American concept of freedom and the rights \n     of citizens.''\n       On Feb. 19, 1976, as part of the national bicentennial, \n     President Gerald Ford issued a proclamation noting that the \n     anniversary of\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\n     Roosevelt's internment order was ``a sad day in American \n     history'' because it was ``wrong.'' Ford concluded by calling \n     upon the American people ``to affirm with me this promise: \n     that we have learned from the tragedy of that long ago \n     experience'' and ``resolve that this kind of action shall \n     never again be repeated.''\n       But fast forward four decades: another war, another \n     election. And many Americans seem perfectly willing to repeat \n     what was resolved never again to be repeated. Once again, \n     fear--dare I say--threatens to trump this country's better \n     instincts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8789-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING DANFORTH PEWTER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to celebrate the \nsuccess of another Vermont business, Danforth Pewter, which this year \ncelebrates 40 years of producing quality, hand-crafted pewter products. \nDanforth Pewter--owned and operated by Fred and Judi Danforth--opened \nfor business in 1975 in Woodstock, VT. What started as a family \nbusiness operating in a milk house in an old dairy barn has expanded to \na workshop and flagship store in Middlebury and a network of retail \nstores in Burlington, Waterbury, and Woodstock, VT, and in Colonial \nWilliamsburg, VA.\n  This rich history of Danforth Pewter, however, dates back more than \ntwo-and-a-half centuries, when Thomas Danforth II opened his pewter \nshop in Middletown, CT in 1755. Generations of Danforths followed in \nthe patriarch's footsteps until 1873. A century later, Fred Danforth \nand his wife, Judi, also an artist, rekindled the family tradition and, \nfollowing in the footsteps of his great-great-great-great-great-\ngrandfather, reopened what is today a thriving business with a \nreputation for quality that extends far beyond the Green Mountains of \nVermont. Fast forward to today, and the Danforth pewterer legacy lives \non. Using the same techniques to cast pewter today as were originally \nused by Thomas Danforth II is an even greater testament to the \nlongevity of fine craftsmanship and the quality of the goods produced \nat Danforth Pewter.\n  Every time Marcelle and I visit Danforth Pewter, we are impressed by \nthe time and effort that goes into each piece. We shared the quality of \nthis craftsmanship in 2008 when we shared palm stones crafted at \nDanforth Pewter with other delegates at the 2008 National Convention. \nWhenever we are in Middlebury, Marcelle and I try to stop in the store \nand see what new pieces are available. Our home in Vermont is dotted \nwith Danforth Pewter pieces, and many hold special memories for us. \nThese pieces are part of what makes our house in Vermont truly our \nhome.\n  The Burlington Free Press recently ran an article highlighting the \nlong history of Danforth Pewter, punctuated with images of some of the \ncompany's most historic pieces. I ask unanimous consent that this \nDecember 11, 2015, article entitled ``Inside the world of Danforth \nPewter' '' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 11, 2015]\n\n                  Inside the World of Danforth Pewter\n\n                           (By Fred Danforth)\n\n       In his wonderful book ``The Connecticut,'' Walter Hard \n     tells of the development of trade along the Connecticut River \n     by the American colonists. In one chapter he describes \n     itinerant peddlers with horse-drawn carts who were the first \n     to distribute the wares of the 18th-century artisans of the \n     Connecticut Valley.\n       Some of the wares on those carts were most likely pewter \n     mugs and plates made by Thomas Danforth and his six sons in \n     the late 1700s and early 1800s.\n       Thomas Danforth opened his pewter workshop in Middletown, \n     Connecticut, on the banks of the Connecticut River, in 1755 \n     and his sons, grandsons and great-grandsons continued \n     crafting pewter in their respective workshops until 1873, \n     when the last of the early American Danforth pewterers died. \n     Some of the pewter pieces made by these Colonial and early \n     American Danforths have made their way into the Smithsonian, \n     the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Winterthur Museum in \n     Delaware, the DeWitt-Wallace Museum in Colonial Williamsburg, \n     and many other American museums.\n\n\n                         Fred and Judi connect\n\n       In the middle of the 20th century, Judi Danforth, who was \n     then Judi Whipple, also grew up on the shores of the \n     Connecticut River, in Claremont. New Hampshire. Fred \n     Danforth, whose father was the family genealogist, came to \n     Vermont from Ohio to attend Middlebury College. When Fred and \n     Judi met in Middlebury, they discovered that they not only \n     liked each other a lot, but they had a common interest in \n     pewter. Judi had studied silversmithing and pewtering at the \n     school for American Craftsmen in Rochester, New York, and was \n     determined to become a pewterer.\n       Fred aspired to fine woodworking and knew that the four \n     pewter pieces on his family's mantle were made by his great-\n     great-great-great-great grandfather Thomas Danforth and his \n     family. With a little cajoling Fred shifted his creative \n     interest from wood to pewter. After a short apprenticeship in \n     the basic skills of pewtering and a brief stint working for \n     an entrepreneur in Nova Scotia, the two returned to Vermont \n     and found the perfect spot to follow their new passion in \n     Woodstock, and 102 years after the last of the early American \n     Danforths stopped working in pewter, the Danforth family \n     pewter trade came to life again, once more in the Connecticut \n     River Valley.\n       Using the rampant lion from Thomas Danforth's touchmark on \n     their first sign, Fred and Judi Danforth opened their pewter \n     shop in Woodstock, Vermont in 1975.\n       Fred says ``We were inspired by the burgeoning revival of \n     the American Crafts movement in Vermont in the 1970s. We were \n     brimming with design ideas and our goal was to make well-\n     designed appealing functional pieces that people could use \n     every day and enjoy for generations.'' The shop in Woodstock \n     was in the milk house of an old dairy barn. The makeshift \n     showroom was in their living room in a tired 1789 farm house.\n\n\n                            `Into the woods'\n\n       After two years of successfully attracting both locals and \n     visiting tourists to their fledgling business, they decided \n     to move closer to friends in Addison County to begin raising \n     their family and to pursue a new approach to their business.\n       ``We moved into the woods,'' Fred continues, ``some might \n     say back to the land, in Lincoln. This presented new \n     challenges for our business and we had to work hard to make \n     it succeed. In order to reach customers we began attending \n     more craft fairs and selectively selling our growing product \n     line to stores around Vermont including Frog Hollow. We \n     created our first touchmark based on the same rampant lion of \n     Thomas Danforth II.''\n       ``And this was when Judi became a sculptor. She began \n     carving wax into a whimsical range of buttons in the shapes \n     of animals and flowers. They were immediately popular on the \n     craft fair circuit, not to mention on the sweaters of our two \n     beautiful young daughters.'' The business grew in new \n     directions as the couple went to trade shows and sold their \n     buttons and pins and then ornaments to stores all over the \n     country.\n\n\n                          Expand to Middlebury\n\n       By 1988, they had 12 employees and had outgrown the \n     workshop in the Danforths' barn in Lincoln. They built a new \n     facility next to Woody Jackson's Holy Cow in Middlebury. Soon \n     thereafter Judi's carving skill won them the license to make \n     Winnie the Pooh pewter for Walt Disney, which led to another \n     period of growth in a new direction.\n       In the late 1990s, the company returned to its roots and \n     refocused its energies on Fred and Judi's original designs. \n     In 1997 Danforth Pewter was honored by the SBA when Fred and \n     Judi were the co-winners of the Vermont Small Business Person \n     of the Year Award.\n       In 2006, the company took another big step, putting their \n     flagship retail store in Middlebury into the same building as \n     the workshop. One set of observation windows lets guests see \n     100-year-old lathes being used by skilled artisans to make \n     oil lamps, candlesticks, baby cups and other holloware. \n     Another set of windows gives a look into the casting shop \n     where visitors can see molten pewter being carefully poured \n     into some of the hundreds of vulcanized rubber molds the \n     company uses to make jewelry, holiday ornaments and \n     figurines.\n\n\n                        Network of pewter stores\n\n       Today, the company employs around 60 people, and the \n     network of Danforth Pewter stores has grown to include a \n     boutique on Middlebury's Main St; stores in Burlington, \n     Waterbury, Woodstock, and Williamsburg, Virginia; a holiday \n     kiosk in the University Mall in South Burlington in November \n     and December; and several retail events around New England. \n     The company also has a thriving online business at \n     www.danforthpewter.com, as well as a national wholesale \n     business. In addition, Danforth makes custom designs, such as \n     the bottle stoppers for one of Whistlepig Whiskey's high-end \n     offerings, and holiday ornaments for Life is Good.\n       A lot has changed since Thomas Danforth II opened his \n     pewter workshop in 1755, but there are a lot of things that \n     he'd recognize if he walked into Danforth's Middlebury \n     workshop today. The process of casting pewter by pouring \n     molten pewter into a mold is a technique he used that's still \n     in use today.\n       Hopefully, he'd also recognize a passion for good design \n     and for quality craftsmanship.

Mr. President, I support this bipartisan budget package\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\nthat is an important step forward for our country.\n  With this deal, we have avoided the devastating sequester cuts--which \nis incredibly important for our economy, for our workers, and for our \nbusinesses.\n  We did not allow the government to shut down over divisive issues--\nlike taking away access to reproductive health care for millions of \nwomen.\n  We fought to protect investments that are vital to our families, \nchildren, seniors, veterans, women, college students, communities, and \nour environment.\n  By definition, no deal is ever perfect. No one will get everything \nthey want--especially in a divided government, but this agreement is \ngood for our country in many ways.\n  I will start with the extension of the clean energy investments \nincluded in this package.\n  Look at my State. We know what is at stake. Clean energy has proven \nto be a huge engine of economic growth in California.\n  So extending the wind and solar energy tax incentives will help \ncreate tens of thousands of clean energy jobs across the country that \nwill benefit American families and the environment, increase our energy \nindependence, and protect our children and grandchildren from dangerous \npollution.\n  Extending the wind and solar tax incentives will eliminate over 10 \ntimes more carbon emissions than lifting the oil export ban will \ncreate. Combined, these incentives are expected to reduce annual carbon \nemissions equal to the emissions from 66 coal-fired power plants or 50 \nmillion passenger cars.\n  Extending the Investment Tax Credit, ITC, for solar would create an \nestimated 61,000 jobs in 2017 alone and avoid losing 80,000 solar jobs.\n  And extending the Production Tax Credit, PTC, would allow the wind \nindustry to grow to over 100,000 jobs in 4 years and continue toward \nsupporting 500,000 jobs by 2030.\n  These provisions are a game changer--and I am thrilled they were \nincluded.\n  I also strongly support the 9/11 First Responders provision. In this \ncountry, we take care of the people who put their lives on the line for \nus. These men and women answered the call of duty when our Nation was \nunder attack.\n  I never understood why it took so long to do this, and it is a moral \noutrage that this program was allowed to expire in the first place. We \nshould never have left them in limbo for health care.\n  We would never ever leave our wounded soldiers on the battlefield, \nand we should have never ever have given these brave first responders \neven a moment of doubt that we would be there for them.\n  I want to praise Senator Gillibrand, Senator Schumer, and Jon Stewart \nfor putting this issue on the map--and getting these 9/11 heroes the \nhealth care they need--and deserve. And I want to say this: it was \nthen-Senator Hillary Clinton who, as a member of EPW, called attention \nto the dangerous, dangerous toxic air pollutants at Ground Zero, and I \npraise her for that work. She secured millions for a health screening \nprogram for Ground Zero workers and first responders.\n  I am also thrilled this deal renews the Land and Water Conservation \nFund, LWCF, for 3 years. The fund--our country's most successful \nconservation and recreation program--ensures that all Americans have \naccess to our beautiful outdoor spaces.\n  Since 1964, the fund has created recreation opportunities in every \nsingle State and protected national parks, national wildlife refuges, \nnational forests, and other Federal areas--and doing so has benefitted \nour economy. Outdoor recreation, conservation, and preservation pumps \nmore than $1 trillion into the U.S. economy every year and supports 1 \nout of every 15 jobs in the U.S.\n  There are a number of other critical provisions in this package.\n  Veterans--this bill demonstrates our dedication to our veterans by \nproviding $163 billion in funding for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. A majority of this funding will go directly to medical care \nand medical research for our veterans.\n  Education--this legislation will also provide billions of dollars in \nfunding to ensure more access to quality education for our students--\nincluding $22.5 billion for the Pell Grant Program--which when combined \nwith mandatory funding will increase the maximum grant to $5,915 and \nensure that more than 8 million low-income students can attend college \nin the next school year.\n  The bill also invests significant funding in title I grants and Head \nStart--which gives our youngest children more opportunities for \neducational success.\n  Afterschool--the bill boosts funding for afterschool programs by $15 \nmillion, expanding access to the critical programs for approximately \n15,000 students.\n  Fighting the opioid epidemic--the bill also includes robust funding \nto fight the growing use of drugs in this country and increase \nawareness of the dangers of prescription drug abuse by providing $3.8 \nbillion for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services.\n  Preserving our national parks--the bill provides $2.8 billion to \npreserve and protect our beautiful national parks.\n  Drought--I want to thank Senator Feinstein for including $271 million \nto help alleviate hazards caused by drought, floods, fires, windstorms, \nand other natural disasters. It also helps farmers and ranchers repair \ndamage to farmlands caused by these natural disasters.\n  Included in this package are also important tax provisions that will \nhelp our families, our communities and our environment.\n  The tax extenders package made permanent the child tax credit, CTC, \nearned-income tax credit, EITC, and American opportunity tax credit for \ncollege expenses.\n  This will increase the tax refunds of working families by several \nhundred dollars per year, depending on the size of the family.\n  Other important tax extenders made permanent are the deduction for \nState and local sales taxes, the deduction for donations of property \nfor conservation purposes, tax-free retirement plan distributions for \ncharitable donations, and the deduction for teachers' out-of-pocket \nexpenses, as well as parity for parking and transit subsidies. The bill \nalso extends the favorable tax treatment of forgiven mortgages through \n2016.\n  I am pleased that we were able to stop more than 100 poison pill \nriders.\n  We stopped Republicans from defunding Planned Parenthood and \ndepriving nearly 3 million Americans of health care.\n  We stopped them from undermining the Food and Drug Administration's \nability to protect Americans from the dangers of e-cigarettes.\n  We stopped them from restricting the authority of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, to administer and enforce the Affordable Care Act.\n  We stopped them from weakening the Department of Homeland Security's \nDACA program, which helps DREAMers succeed.\n  We stopped them from barring FEMA State and grant funds to sanctuary \ncities.\n  We stopped them from gutting the President's landmark Clean Power \nPlan and weakening the Endangered Species Act and destroying the Clean \nWater Act.\n  And we stopped them from eliminating the housing trust fund, which \nprovides affordable housing for families across the country.\n  I am proud that Democrats stood together and fought against these \ndangerous provisions that would seriously hurt the American people.\n  Now, there were several provisions that ended up in the legislation \nthat I do not support--measures that Republicans insisted on, such as \nlifting the oil export ban permanently, which I oppose.\n  I also do not support Republicans' decision to flat-fund the EPA--\neven though the EPA is incredibly popular with Americans.\n  And it doesn't provide the IRS with any new funds--which hurts our \nability to administer the Affordable Care Act, as well as crack down on \ntax cheats and frauds.\n  The package also provides inadequate support for family planning--\nespecially abroad.\n  At a time when we should be doing everything we can to prevent gun \nviolence, this legislation does not overturn a prohibition on \ngovernment-funded studies of gun violence.\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n  I am also disappointed that the House's visa waiver language was \naccepted--rather than Senator Feinstein's language that I supported.\n  But in the end, that is what a compromise is--and that is what it \nmeans to negotiate and to govern.\n  I want to praise Senator Reid, Leader Pelosi, Senator Mikulski, and \nall of my fellow Democrats who fought so hard to make this the best \nagreement we could reach. I also praise their Republican counterparts.\n  I believe this is a good deal for the American people. It is good for \nour families, our children, our economy, and our environment, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8791-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to move forward with the \nSenate language on the Toxic Substances Control Act, TSCA, which has \nbeen a difficult, multiyear odyssey.\n  I did this for two reasons. First, the bill has been vastly improved \nover the original bill, which in my opinion would have been harmful to \nour families because it overrode our State laws and set up an \nineffective and nonexistent way to regulate most toxic pollutants. \nSecondly, I have been assured that, as the House and Senate bills are \nmerged into one, the voices of those who have been most deeply \naffected--including nurses, breast cancer survivors, asbestos victims, \nand children--will be heard. I will have the opportunity to be in the \nroom at every step and express their views.\n  This is very important to me because the history of this bill has \nbeen so contentious. I want to assure my colleagues, my home State of \nCalifornia, and the people of this Nation that I will stay intimately \ninvolved as the bill moves forward, and I will share my views openly. I \nlook forward to the work ahead, and I am optimistic that we can reach a \nfair and just conclusion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8791-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF LIGHT AND LIGHT-BASED TECHNOLOGIES\n\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, as the year comes to a close, I would like \nto highlight a proclamation from the U.N. General Assembly recognizing \n2015 as the International Year of Light and Light-Based Technologies. \nThis global initiative is aimed at raising awareness of the vital role \nof light in our daily lives and its importance to 21st century \ntechnology and innovation. For centuries, light has transcended all \nboundaries from geography and gender, to age, culture, and race.\n  For centuries, light-based technologies have provided solutions to \nworldwide challenges in energy, agriculture, telecommunications, \nsecurity, and health. To start, light has revolutionized medicine \nthrough technologies such as x ray imaging, laser surgery, and cancer \ntreatments. Light has transformed international communication via the \nInternet, a tool we cannot imagine living without today. It has helped \nus improve safety through sensors in cars and aircraft, advanced \ninfrastructure monitoring, and weather prediction. Furthermore, light \nhas helped millions around the globe work, study, and play after dark \nthrough low-cost and sustainable light sources for families who do not \nhave access to grid electricity. From agriculture to forensics to \nvirtual reality, light and light-based technologies continue to fuel \ninnovations and improvements that touch nearly every aspect of lives \naround the world.\n  In fact, the science of light is becoming increasingly critical in \ngrowing our economy and keeping American manufacturing competitive on a \nglobal scale. The contribution of light-based technologies to our \neconomy starts with fundamental optics and photonics education and \nresearch. Look no further than the work being done in my home State at \nDelaware State University's Optical Science Center for Applied \nResearch, OSCAR, where researchers are developing new detectors for \nnight vision technologies, methods for determining the composition of \ncomplex materials, and technologies with applications in space \nexploration, to name just a few. These economic contributions continue \nwith investments in manufacturing to increase the development and \nproduction of new optics and photonics applications and technologies, a \nmarket that supports more than 7.4 million jobs and $3 trillion in \nannual revenue in the United States.\n  The transformative value of light-based technologies was reaffirmed \nearlier this summer with the establishment of the American Institute \nfor Manufacturing Integrated Photonics, AIM Photonics, as part of the \nNational Network for Manufacturing Innovation. Continued investment in \npublic-private partnerships like AIM Photonics accelerates research and \ndevelopment that leads to technologies like integrated photonic \ncomponents and circuits. This vital work helps ensure that \nbreakthroughs in related fields like biophotonics, high-resolution \nimaging, next generation wireless communications, and quantum computing \nwill not only occur, but also be built right here in America.\n  The International Year of Light is also a real opportunity to provide \nthe general public with a better understanding of the science of light; \npromote STEM education; and inspire the next generation of scientists, \nresearchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs. This past year, optics and \nphotonics organizations have held events around the United States such \nas the Light for a Better World symposium held in September in \nWashington, DC, that featured two Nobel prize winners as keynote \nspeakers, Dr. Eric Betzig and Dr. Shuji Nakamura. In October, the \nUniversity of Delaware also hosted Green Light: Prospects in Lighting \nDesign and Technology, which brought together artists and scientists \nfrom around the world, while other groups across the country have \nhosted similar symposia through local sections and student chapters of \norganizations. Events such as these provide public outreach on the \nimportance of optics and photonics, promote youth interest and \nengagement in science, and educate us all on the crucial role that \nlight-based technologies play in the U.S. economy and in everyday life.\n  Events like these have been happening not just here in the United \nStates, but all over the world throughout 2015. Across the globe, \nevents have been organized to learn more about the science of light and \nto celebrate the innovation and imagination that has fueled incredible \ndiscoveries and inventions. The storied history of innovation in light \ndates back to the first studies of optics 1,000 years ago and continues \ntoday with breakthroughs in the field of optical communications.\n  These activities would not be possible without the hard work and \ndedication of people in the optics and photonics field, both in \nindustry and in academia. This includes the optics and photonics based \nsocieties and organizations that have sponsored the initiative, \nincluding the Optical Society, the American Institute of Physics, the \nAmerican Physical Society, the European Physical Society, the German \nPhysical Society, the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical \nPhysics, the IEEE Photonics Society, the Institute of Physics, Light: \nScience and Applications, Lightsources.org, 1001 Inventions, and the \nInternational Society for Optics and Photonics. In fact, the \nInternational Year of Light has been endorsed by the International \nCouncil of Science, as well as several international scientific unions \nand professional societies, and has more than 100 partners from over 85 \ncountries.\n  By highlighting the critical role light plays in our everyday lives \nand its unique potential to improve the world in ways we cannot yet \nimagine, celebrating the International Year of Light provides a \nvaluable opportunity to inspire, educate, and connect all of those who \nare fighting to make the world even brighter. From scientific societies \nto educational institutions to trade groups, from nonprofit \norganizations to private sector partners, the global community has \nrecognized 2015 as the International Year of Light not only to \ncommemorate achievements past, but also to set the stage for \ntechnologies of the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8791-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8791-S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    RECOGNIZING THE CRAWFORD-SEBASTIAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it is my honor to congratulate the\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\nCrawford-Sebastian Community Development Council, CSCDC, on its 50th \nanniversary of providing critical help for the people of western \nArkansas. Since 1965, this community action agency has administered a \nwide range of Federal programs that help with housing, utilities, food \nand other basic needs.\n  This agency does not just process paperwork; it alleviates hunger, \nprovides shelter, and gives hope to more than 50,000 Arkansans \nannually.\n  I have always been struck by the great kindness and care that the \nstaff at the CSCDC provides. The team, including 1,600 volunteers, is \npassionate about helping people and improving the community. They \nconsistently look for new ways to improve their services, and I am \ngrateful for their tireless efforts to support the homeless, families \nfacing difficult times, and those who are seeking to improve their \nlives.\n  I have had many opportunities to see their work in person, including \nhelping a family celebrate their new home through the self-help housing \nprogram. The CSCDC is a leader in providing counseling for first-time \nand low-income home buyers and creating homes hand-in-hand with them \nthat will stand the test of time. It also quietly helps those in \ngreatest need each day with services such as utility assistance, \nemergency food, and a no-cost dental clinic.\n  This year, the CSCDC has proven that it intends to remain a leader in \ncommunity support for many years to come. This agency joined efforts to \ncreate the new Hope Campus in Fort Smith, AR, that brings together a \nnumber of nonprofits and services for the homeless in one place. It is \na place of hope, healing, and opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8792-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARK GOLLINGER\n\n  Mr. DAINES.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor Tangipahoa \nParish president Gordon Burgess. Gordon has selflessly served nearly 30 \nyears as Tangipahoa's first and only parish president.\n  A graduate of Southern Arkansas University, Burgess served 2 years in \nthe Nike Missile Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battery of the U.S. Army, as \nwell as 4 years on Active Reserve in the National Guard. Following his \nservice, Gordon owned and operated a successful oil service company for \nmore than 20 years before becoming Tangipahoa Parish president in 1986. \nGordon and his wife Margaret are both members of the First Baptist \nChurch in Independence, LA, where he serves as a deacon and she in the \nmusic ministry.\n  As a staunch fiscal conservative, Gordon has fought to reduce taxes \nand to live with a balanced budget by implementing his now famous ``pay \nas you go'' approach. When first elected Tangipahoa Parish president, \nGordon inherited a parish government nearly $12 million in the red. \nUnder his leadership, all of that debt has been paid off, and 19 \nseparate property taxes totaling over $96 million have been eliminated.\n  During his eight terms in office, Gordon strengthened Tangipahoa's \nhighway system, upgraded the drainage systems, built new governmental \nfacilities, and invested in a higher quality health system for his \nParish's citizens.\n  Gordon's public service extends well beyond Tangipahoa Parish to \nState and Federal levels. His experience and vision have led to an \nappointment on Louisiana's Commerce and Industry Board and the \nLouisiana Police Jury Executive Board. On the Federal level, he serves \nas vice president of the Zachary Taylor Parkway Association.\n  Gordon is also an honorary cochairman and committee member of \nAmerica's Wetland Storm Warning IV Committee. He is a member of the \nLouisiana Federal Property Advisory Board, a member of Parishes Against \nCoastal Erosion, the Amite Rotary Club, the Hammond Chamber of \nCommerce, as well as the Ponchatoula and Amite Area chambers. \nAdditionally he is a member of the Louisiana Cattlemen's Association.\n  I am pleased to hereby honor parish president Gordon Burgess on his \ncommitment to providing invaluable public service to the people of \nTangipahoa Parish and the State of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8792-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING HARLOW'S DONUTS AND BAKERY\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, behind each of the millions of \nsmall businesses in the United States, there is an entrepreneur who is \nwilling to put in the hard work necessary for success. In the heart of \nPineville, LA, Roy W. Burr, Sr., exemplified this commitment by \ndedicating over 30 years to growing and maintaining this week's Small \nBusiness of the Week, Harlow's Donut and Bakery.\n  Harlow's Donut and Bakery has been a staple in Pineville since \nopening its doors in 1972. When Roy W. Burr, Sr., took over in 1984, he \nwas determined to maintain the bakery's name and good reputation. With \nno prior experience in the food industry, Roy would regularly begin \nmaking donuts at 2:30 in the morning. In the decades since, three \ngenerations of Burrs have created an environment where locals could \nstart their mornings with hot coffee and a fresh pastry, while catching \nup with their friends and neighbors. Harlow's Bakery is widely \nrecognized as a staple in the community in large part due to the Burr \nfamily treating both their employees and customers as members of their \nextended family.\n  Over the years, Harlow's Donut and Bakery has been awarded statewide \nand national accolades. In 2011, Harlow's was featured as a Travelocity \nLocal Secret, Big Find and more recently was honored by the North \nRapides Business and Industry Alliance as a Small Business of the Month \nin March 2015.\n  This past November, Roy W. Burr, Sr., passed away after running \nHarlow's for over 30 years. In remembrance of Roy and his dedication to \nthe Pineville community, Harlow's Donut and Bakery is officially \nrecognized as Small Business of the Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8792-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8792-S8793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING WETLAND RESOURCES, LLC\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, restoring, protecting, and \npreserving our vulnerable coastal habitats remain among the most \nimportant priorities for those of us in Louisiana. Coastal erosion has \nreduced our Nation's largest marsh by more than 2,000 square miles \nsince 1930. We need to work toward effective solutions combating \ncoastal erosion because it affects our homes, businesses, and daily \nlives. That is why I would like to recognize Wetland Resources, LLC, of \nTickfaw, LA, as Small Business of the Week.\n  The threat of natural disaster will always remain for those of us \nliving in Louisiana, and it is well known that coastal restoration goes \nhand-in-hand with storm protection. In the 10 years since Hurricane \nKatrina, which flooded 80 percent of New Orleans and displaced \nthousands across the country, we as a State have made great strides to \nprotect our homes and communities, and our future is brighter than \never. But we are not done yet.\n  Husband and wife team Gary Shaffer and Demetra Kandelepas of Wetland \nResources have stepped up to play a major role in coastal restoration \nand in\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\n2009 began devising a way to rebuild and protect our coastline. \nShaffer, a biology professor at Southeastern Louisiana University in \nHammond, LA, and Kandelepas, an ecologist with a doctorate degree, have \nbeen growing hurricane-resistant plants, such as cypress and tupelo \ntrees, along Louisiana's receding coast. This creates a natural barrier \nof healthy flora more likely to sustain vulnerable coastal habitats \nduring strong storms. In order to reinvigorate the vegetation along \nLouisiana's coastline, Wetland Resources targets areas that are filled \nwith treated sewerage and wastewater from nearby cities. These areas \nare nutrient rich and serve as ideal incubators for newly planted \ncypress and tupelo trees. These species of trees can live for hundreds \nof years, and their root systems grow laterally, which connect with \nadjacent trees to create an effective barrier from storm surges and \ngale force winds.\n  Today, Shaffer and Kandelepas are developing new ways to plant and \nprotect their seeds. In addition to their most recent development, a \nbiodegradable protective casing for their seedlings that allows 4,000 \ntrees to be planted each day, Wetland Resources, LLC, has received \nnumerous awards.\n  Congratulations to Wetlands Resources, LLC, of Tickfaw, LA, this \nweek's Small Business of the Week.

A bill to promote transparency in the oversight of \ncybersecurity risks at publicly traded companies; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be introducing the \nCybersecurity Disclosure Act of 2015 with Senator Collins. In response \nto data breaches by various companies, which exposed the personal \ninformation of millions of customers, this bill asks each publicly \ntraded company to include, in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, \ndisclosures to investors, information on whether any member of the \nBoard of Directors is a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having \nthis expertise on the Board of Directors is not necessary because of \nother cybersecurity steps taken by the publicly traded company. The \nlegislation does not require companies to take any actions other than \nto provide this disclosure to its investors.\n  Many investors may be surprised to learn that board directors who \nparticipated in National Association of Corporate Directors roundtable \ndiscussions on cybersecurity late in 2013 admitted that ``the lack of \nadequate knowledge of information technology risk has made it \nchallenging for them to `effectively oversee management's cybersecurity \nactivities.' Participating board members also suggested that `without \nsound knowledge of--or adequate sensitivity to--the topic, directors \ncannot easily draw the line between oversight and management,' and that \nonce in the technical `weeds,' directors `find it difficult to assess \nthe appropriate level of [the board's] involvement in risk management.' \n''\n  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether \npublicly traded companies are not only prioritizing cybersecurity, but \nalso have the capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber \nrelated attacks. This bill aims to provide a better understanding of \nthese issues through improved SEC disclosure.\n  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking \nCommittee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my \nservice on the Armed Services Committee. It is through this dual \nBanking-Armed Services perspective that I see that our economic \nsecurity is indeed a matter of our national security, and this is \nparticularly the case as our economy becomes increasingly reliant on \ntechnology and the Internet.\n  For example, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, \nrecently appeared before the Armed Services Committee on September 29, \n2015, and testified that ``cyber threats to the U.S. national and \neconomic security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication \nand severity of impact.'' He further said that ``[b]ecause of our heavy \ndependence on the Internet, nearly all information communication \ntechnologies and I.T. networks and systems will be perpetually at \nrisk.''\n  With mounting cyber threats and concerns over the capabilities of \ncorporate directors, we all need to be more proactive in ensuring our \nNation's cybersecurity before there are additional serious breaches. \nThis legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by \nencouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to its \ninvestors and customers on whether and how their Boards of Directors \nare prioritizing cybersecurity.\n  I thank Harvard Law School Professor John Coates, MIT Professor Simon \nJohnson, Columbia Law School Professor John Coffee, and the Consumer \nFederation of America for their support, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin Senator Collins and me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 2419. A bill to improve quality and accountability for educator \npreparation programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we know that the quality of teachers and \nprincipals are two of the most important in-school factors related to \nstudent achievement. If we want to improve our schools, it is essential \nthat teachers, principals, and other educators have a comprehensive \nsystem that supports their professional growth and development, \nstarting on day one and continuing throughout their careers. Senator \nCasey and I introduced the Better Education Support and Training Act to \ncreate such a system, and many key provisions of this legislation were \nincluded in the Every Student Succeeds Act that passed the Senate with \nan overwhelming bipartisan vote and was signed into law last week.\n  However, our work is not done. We need to make sure that educator \npreparation programs help teachers, principals, librarians, and other \nschool leaders develop the skills and knowledge to be profession-ready. \nThere is a looming shortage of fully-prepared teachers. Earlier this \nmonth, the Washington Post reported that many high poverty schools \nstruggle to fill their teaching positions and rely on a ``rotating cast \nof substitutes.'' We must do better by our students and our schools.\n  Today, I am reintroducing the Educator Preparation Reform Act and am \npleased to be joined by Senator Casey in offering this approach to \nimproving how we prepare teachers, principals, and other educators so \nthat they can be effective right from the start.\n  The Educator Preparation Reform Act builds on the success of the \nTeacher Quality Partnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 \nreauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  Among the key changes this new bill makes is specific attention and \nemphasis on principals, with the addition of a residency program for \nnew principals. Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals \nat the helm. This bill better connects teacher preparation with \nprincipal preparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also \nallow partnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of \ninstructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other \nacademic support professionals.\n  The bill streamlines the accountability and reporting requirements \nfor teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key \nquality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for \nclinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of \nteaching, and teacher performance, including student learning outcomes. \nAll programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to \ncertification--will be asked to report on the same measures.\n  Under our legislation, states will be required to identify at-risk \nand low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance \nand a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close \nprograms that do not improve.\n  We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this \nlegislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation \nReform Act include: the Alliance for Excellent Education, American \nAssociation of Colleges for Teacher Education, American\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\nAssociation of State Colleges and Universities, American Council on \nEducation, Association of American Universities, Association of Jesuit \nColleges and Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant \nUniversities, Council for Christian Colleges and Universities, First \nFocus Campaign for Children, Higher Education Consortium for Special \nEducation, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals, National Association of \nIndependent Colleges and Universities, National Association of \nSecondary School Principals, National Association of State Directors of \nSpecial Education, National Center for Learning Disabilities, National \nEducation Association, National Disabilities Rights Network, Public \nAdvocacy for Kids, Rural School and Community Trust, and the Teacher \nEducation Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.\n  I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the \nupcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort and support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/17/senate-section/article/S8796-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 337--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF \nFEBRUARY 12, 2016, AS ``DARWIN DAY'' AND RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF \n                 SCIENCE IN THE BETTERMENT OF HUMANITY\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Res. 148\n\n       Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, \n     2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013, Congress \n     declared that it deplored the religious persecution by the \n     Government of Iran of the Baha'i community and would hold the \n     Government of Iran responsible for upholding the rights of \n     all Iranian nationals, including members of the Baha'i Faith;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom 2014 Report stated, ``The Baha'i community, \n     the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran, long has \n     been subject to particularly severe religious freedom \n     violations. The government views Baha'is, who number at least \n     300,000, as `heretics' and consequently they face repression \n     on the grounds of apostasy.'';\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom 2014 Report stated that ``[s]ince 1979, \n     authorities have killed or executed more than 200 Baha'i \n     leaders, and more than 10,000 have been dismissed from \n     government and university jobs'' and ``[m]ore than 700 \n     Baha'is have been arbitrarily arrested since 2005'';\n       Whereas the Department of State 2013 International \n     Religious Freedom Report stated that the Government of Iran \n     ``prohibits Baha'is from teaching and practicing their faith \n     and subjects them to many forms of discrimination not faced \n     by members of other religious groups'' and ``since the 1979 \n     Islamic Revolution, formally denies Baha'i students access to \n     higher education'';\n       Whereas the Department of State 2013 International \n     Religious Freedom Report stated, ``The government requires \n     Baha'is to register with the police,'' and ``The government \n     raided Baha'i homes and businesses and confiscated large \n     amounts of private and commercial property, as well as \n     religious materials.'';\n       Whereas the Department of State 2013 International \n     Religious Freedom Report stated, ``Baha'is are regularly \n     denied compensation for injury or criminal victimization and \n     the right to inherit property.'';\n       Whereas, on August 27, 2014, the United Nations Special \n     Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran issued a report (A/69/356), which stated, \n     ``The human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     remains of concern.

and\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, \n     and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) authorizes \n     the President and the Secretary of State to impose sanctions \n     on individuals ``responsible for or complicit in, or \n     responsible for ordering, controlling, or otherwise \n     directing, the commission of serious human rights abuses \n     against citizens of Iran or their family members on or after \n     June 12, 2009'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the Government of Iran's state-sponsored \n     persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued \n     violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Iran to immediately release \n     the 7 imprisoned Baha'i leaders, the 9 imprisoned Baha'i \n     educators, and all other prisoners held solely on account of \n     their religion;\n       (3) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in \n     cooperation with responsible nations, to immediately condemn \n     the Government of Iran's continued violation of human rights \n     and demand the immediate release of prisoners held solely on \n     account of their religion;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Megan Nicole Kanka, who was 7 years old, was abducted, \n     sexually assaulted, and murdered in 1994, in the State of New \n     Jersey by a violent predator living across the street from \n     her home. Unbeknownst to Megan Kanka and her family, he had \n     been convicted previously of a sex offense against a child.\n       (2) In 1996, Congress adopted Megan's Law (Public Law 104-\n     145) as a means to encourage States to protect children by \n     identifying the whereabouts of sex offenders and providing \n     the means to monitor their activities.\n       (3) In 2006, Congress passed the Adam Walsh Child \n     Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-248) to \n     protect children and the public at large by establishing a \n     comprehensive national system for the registration and \n     notification to the public and law enforcement officers of \n     convicted sex offenders.\n       (4) Law enforcement reports indicate that known child-sex \n     offenders are traveling internationally.\n       (5) The commercial sexual exploitation of minors in child \n     sex trafficking and pornography is a global phenomenon. The \n     International Labour Organization has estimated that \n     1,8000,000 children worldwide are victims of child sex \n     trafficking and pornography each year.\n       (6) Child sex tourism, where an individual travels to a \n     foreign country and engages in sexual activity with a child \n     in that country, is a form of child exploitation and, where \n     commercial, child sex trafficking.\n\n     SEC. 3.
