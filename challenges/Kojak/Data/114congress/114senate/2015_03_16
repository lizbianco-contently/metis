Madam President, Confucius said, ``Life is very simple, but \nwe insist on making it complicated.'' That is true.\n  Right now, the Republican Senate leadership is insisting on making a \ngood piece of legislation far more complicated than it should be. This \nhuman trafficking and child pornography bill before the Senate has wide \nbipartisan support. Unfortunately, it also includes a previously \nunreported abortion provision that has brought us to a screeching halt \nin this legislation.\n  But there is a quick and very easy solution to this dilemma: Take the \nabortion language out of the bill. The Republican leadership doesn't \nseem to be interested in a solution.\n  The Senate Republican leadership is anxious to shut down debate \nwithout fixing the problem. We can stand here all week and question how \nthe abortion language got in the legislation. Many believe it was by \nsleight of hand, but it doesn't matter. It is a fact that Republicans \nincluded abortion language in this bill that is completely unrelated to \nhuman trafficking, and by doing so Republicans turned a bipartisan bill \ninto a political fight.\n  Republican Congressman Erik Paulsen of Minnesota drafted the House \nversion of the same human trafficking bill. He wrote the bill. It \npassed the House. Even he believes that inclusion of the abortion \nprovision in the Senate bill is not appropriate.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       There is no reason it should be included in these bills. \n     This issue is far too important to tie it up with an \n     unrelated fight with politics as usual.\n\n  This is his bill, and he says we should take that language out. He is \na Republican.\n  The path forward is clear: Take the abortion language out of the bill \nand we can pass it right now. That is it.\n  But if hijacking the human trafficking bill with an unrelated \nabortion provision wasn't already bad enough--listen to this--the \nmajority leader is now holding Loretta Lynch's nomination hostage too. \nIt is hard to comprehend, but that is what is happening.\n  Just last Tuesday, the Republican leader gave his word that he would \nbring up a vote this week on President Obama's Attorney General \nnominee. President Obama's Attorney General is well qualified and no \none questions her qualifications.\n  Now Senator McConnell is saying the Senate will not confirm Loretta \nLynch until we pass the trafficking bill--abortion language and all.\n  Loretta Lynch was nominated by the President 128 days ago. Since that \ntime, Senate Republicans have found reason after reason after reason to \ndelay her confirmation. First, it was just wait until the next \nCongress. In fact, the Republican leader said last year:\n\n       Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate. \n     And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress \n     through regular order.\n\n  But when this Congress got underway, her nomination had to wait until \nafter the Keystone legislation. Everyone will remember it was a bill to \nconstruct a massive pipeline to import foreign oil, only to turn around \nand export it to other countries.\n  Then Ms. Lynch's nomination had to wait until after a new Defense \nSecretary was confirmed. Then Republicans on the Judiciary Committee \nneeded more time and said just one more week. Then she had to wait \nuntil after the February recess. As I said, it has been delay after \ndelay after delay, and now we are here in the middle of March and \nLoretta Lynch has yet to get a vote on the Senate floor.\n  Why can't we get this incredibly qualified woman confirmed? She has \nwaited 128 days. That is the longest any Attorney General has ever \nwaited in the last four decades.\n  As I have said, a vote on the Lynch nomination has nothing to do with \nthe trafficking bill and it certainly has nothing to do with abortion.\n  The majority leader can choose to keep the Senate stuck on this \nabortion provision, but he does so at the detriment of so many other \nbills that require the Senate's attention. The majority leader gave his \nword that we\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nwould consider the Lynch nomination through regular order, and that has \nnot happened. He gave his word that we would vote on confirmation this \nweek, but now he is hedging on that. There is no reason my friend, the \nmajority leader, cannot live up to his numerous commitments.\n  Loretta Lynch's nomination is on the Executive Calendar, meaning the \nSenate can consider her nomination and then immediately move back to \nthe trafficking bill. Any attempt to hold her nomination hostage \nbecause of the abortion provision is a sham.\n  This Congress is barely 2 months old. Yet this is just the latest on \na growing list of examples proving Republicans simply cannot govern.\n  The American people need a human trafficking bill, and the American \npeople need an Attorney General. Let's confirm Loretta Lynch as soon as \npossible.\n  Madam President, what is the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1512-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, tomorrow morning the Senate will be \ncasting a very important vote. We will be voting on a piece of \nlegislation called the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which \ncurrently has 12 Democratic cosponsors and virtually an equal number of \nRepublican cosponsors. In other words, this is generally bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  As further evidence of its bipartisan support, this bill passed \nunanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in February, and it \nenjoys the support of more than 200 victims' rights and law enforcement \norganizations. But as everyone in this Chamber knows, Senate Democrats \nhave said they will filibuster this bipartisan legislation that is \ndesigned to provide justice for victims of trafficking because it \ncontains a particular provision they have voted for on a number of \noccasions and, indeed, have chosen to cosponsor. It is unconscionable \nand shameful and more than that it is just simply baffling to me.\n  The reason it is so shameful is because there are children waiting \nfor our help. The average victim of human trafficking in the United \nStates is a young girl between the age of 12 and 14 years of age. \nChildren are being abused and literally sexually assaulted while \napparently some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \ndecided to try to make a political point. It is baffling because my \ncolleagues have voted for essentially this very same provision in one \nform or another time and time and time again.\n  Apparently, the Democratic leader, who is pressuring Members of his \ncaucus to filibuster this bill is--well, he says we need to take out \nthe language they object to, but I was standing on the floor just a few \ndays ago when--I guess it was Thursday afternoon--the majority leader, \nSenator McConnell, offered them an opportunity to have an up-or-down \nvote to strip that language out of the bill and they objected to it. So \nit is getting harder and harder to believe the sincerity of their \nprotests, and it is appearing more and more likely that what they want \nto do is have the Senate return to the same dysfunctional nature it was \nunder for the last 4 years by the previous majority.\n  I wish to pose several questions to our colleagues who insist on \nfilibustering this bipartisan piece of legislation. The first question \nI have is: Isn't it the case that only 3 months ago 50 Democrats voted \nfor the 2015 Defense authorization bill? Isn't that a bill a piece of \nauthorizing legislation much like the underlying justice for victims of \ntrafficking bill? If 50 Democrats voted for similar language with \nregard to the limitations on the use of funding just a few months ago, \nhow in the world can they filibuster this bill for including the same \nlanguage they voted for, more or less, just a few short months ago? In \nfact, it is true that in 2009 all of the Senate Democrats--in a \npartisan vote--voted to include this similar language as part of \nObamaCare. Groups such as NARAL, the National Abortion Rights Action \nLeague, protested that the language ``went far beyond even the Hyde \nAmendment.'' Yet 60 Democrats, including the then-majority leader--now \nminority leader--voted for that in the wee hours of Christmas Eve 2009.\n  Again, I ask our friends who are filibustering this bipartisan piece \nof legislation designed to help the victims of human trafficking: Isn't \nit true that in 2009, 58 Senate Democrats voted to reauthorize the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, which like Medicaid is subject to \nthe Hyde Amendment?\n  To each of those questions, the record would demonstrate they should \nbe answered with a resounding yes.\n  So time and time again, our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, who now find themselves in the inexplicable position of \nfilibustering a bill they are cosponsoring or which they have already \nvoted for in the Judiciary Committee and which contains very similar \nrestrictions on the use of the funding--how in the world have they \ndecided to make the stand, here and now, denying even the opportunity \nthey have been given by the majority leader to have an up-or-down vote \nto strip the language out that they object to?\n  Well, despite the hypocrisy of their position, the question this \nreally boils down to is this. This is the question, the only question \nthat really matters: To our colleagues who are filibustering this \nlegislation, Are you prepared to turn your back on the thousands of \npeople living every day in bondage and who are desperately clinging to \nthe hope that someone--someone--will lend them a helping hand? Are you \nprepared to abandon these children and these other victims of human \ntrafficking who deserve a roof over their head, someone to lean on, and \nsomehow, some way to get a fresh start in life?\n  Do our colleagues who are filibustering this legislation really want \nto play politics with such a sensitive and vulnerable part of our \npopulation over an issue that some advocates have called a phantom \nproblem? The reason why some advocates who support this legislation \nhave called the objection of the Democratic leader a phantom problem is \nbecause not only have they voted for similar provisions over and over \nand over again, this essentially has been the settled law of the land \nfor 39 years--since 1976. Just in case our colleagues think that the \nexamples I mentioned are exclusive, there are a number of other \nprovisions--32 Democrats voted for the so-called CR omnibus, the \ncontinuing resolution omnibus, in December. Thirty-two Democrats voted \nfor that which contained very similar language. And I mentioned several \nothers.\n  I want to conclude with the Washington Post editorial for today. I do \nnot always find myself in agreement with the Washington Post editorial \nboard, but this morning I think they encapsulated the Democratic \nfilibuster of the bipartisan antitrafficking bill perfectly. In urging \nthe Senate to pass this legislation, they wrote: ``[T]his week the \nquestion will be whether Senators can put the interests of scared, \nabused children ahead of the chance to score political points.'' I \ncould not agree more.\n  So tomorrow morning, an hour after we convene, we will have a vote \nthat will decide whether this legislation goes on to final passage. We \nneed six brave Democrats--six brave Democrats--to join all the \nRepublicans on this side to keep hope alive for these victims of human \ntrafficking. We need six Democrats who are willing to break away from \nthe tyranny of their party's own leadership here in the Senate and do \nwhat they know is the right thing to do. They know it in their heart, \nand they know it in their mind, and they know they have supported \nsimilar language in legislation time and time again.\n  We need six Democrats willing to break away from the mindless, \nheartless filibuster of this legislation. I hope they will examine \ntheir conscience. I\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\nhope they will ask themselves, Isn't this exactly the kind of vote that \nI came here to the U.S. Senate to cast? I hope they will pray on it, \nand I hope they will think long and hard before saying no to the abused \nchildren and the victims of human trafficking.\n  That is what this is all about. It is not based on any Hyde amendment \nlanguage in this legislation. It is based on a determination to render \nthis institution dysfunctional, not because of any principal policy \ndisagreement, because, as I point out, our colleagues on the other side \nhave voted for similar language time and time and time again.\n  Our colleagues on the other side realize that on November 4, the \nvoters rejected the then-majority and gave this side of the aisle the \nopportunity to serve in the majority because, frankly, they were sick \nand tired of the way that Washington operates and the dysfunction that \nprevailed here for so long. I had higher hopes that after the election \nwe would all learn something from what the voters were telling us on \nNovember 4 and thereafter and that we would take advantage of the \nopportunity to try to work together to find areas where we could agree, \nin a bipartisan way, to actually move the ball forward and help people \nwho need our help. If we cannot do that on an antihuman trafficking \nbill, what can we possibly work together on?\n  This whole phony issue of the Hyde amendment provision in this bill \nis a joke. It is a sick, sad joke, after time and time again voting for \nsimilar provisions in other legislation. As I pointed out, you have 12 \nDemocratic cosponsors of the legislation. Do you think they did not \nread the legislation? That is ridiculous. Do you think their staff did \nnot tell them what was in the legislation? Do you think before the \nJudiciary Committee voted unanimously to pass it out people did not \nknow what they were voting on? I do not believe that for a minute. I \nhave too much respect for our colleagues and their professionalism to \nthink they missed it.\n  Our colleagues have an important choice to make tomorrow morning. I \nhope they will say yes to these victims of human trafficking and no to \nthe kind of political gamesmanship that gives this institution a bad \nname.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1513-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1513-S1514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SENATE AGENDA AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I listened to the impassioned speech by \nmy colleague from Texas on the issue of human trafficking. There is no \ndispute here. This legislation is bipartisan. Democrats and Republicans \nare prepared to support the bill that has been offered on human \ntrafficking by Republican Senator Cornyn and Democratic Senator \nKlobuchar. There are amendments pending I think which improve the \nbill--one by Senator Leahy about runaway children. In fact, we are so \nprepared to do this that we have put together a comprehensive \nsubstitute amendment to what has just been described which could be \nquickly passed on the floor. I do not believe there would be more than \na handful of Senators voting no. I certainly would support the passage \nof the Leahy version.\n  What is the difference? Senator Cornyn has injected into this \nimportant issue a side issue, but not an inconsequential one, on the \nHyde amendment.\n  Henry Hyde was a Congressman from Illinois who served in the House of \nRepresentatives with me for a period of time. He authored the Hyde \namendment that said no Federal funds shall be used to pay for abortion \nprocedures except in very limited circumstances--rape, incest, and the \nlife of the mother. That has been put in appropriations bills every \nyear since--without question, without challenge.\n  What Senator Cornyn is trying to do is to make this permanent law, \nand make it part of a human trafficking bill. I do not doubt this is an \nimportant issue. I know it is because I have served in the House and \nthe Senate. But I do question whether we should make every bill that \ncomes along a vehicle or carrier for debating abortion or other really \ncontroversial issues.\n  This question of passing a human trafficking bill to protect the \nscores--thousands--of victims of human trafficking is one which would \npass in a heartbeat in the Senate if the Senator from Texas would \nremove this controversial section. Senator Leahy has offered that \nsubstitute. I hope we will have an opportunity to vote on it, and vote \non it soon.\n  As to whether this is a reflection of a dysfunctional Congress, well, \nmost of the people back in Illinois and Chicago whom I run into--\nparticularly this weekend--have raised that issue from time to time, \nand I can see where the argument could be made. We now have a Congress \ncontrolled by Republicans--the House and the Senate--and the White \nHouse, obviously, with a Democratic President. It is a tough political \nterrain under the best of circumstances, and we certainly have not been \nfacing the best of circumstances for a long time. There are just a lot \nof differences between the House and the Senate and the President and \nthe White House, and many of those are manifest.\n  What was the first bill the Republican majority in the Senate \ncalled--No. 1, Senate bill 1? The Keystone Pipeline--a bill to \nauthorize the construction of a pipeline owned by a Canadian company in \nthe United States. That was the highest priority for the Senate \nRepublicans. The President said at the outset: Do not try to preempt my \nauthority as President. I will veto it.\n  But they insisted. We went through several weeks--2 or 3 weeks--of \namendments, and we cooperated on the Democratic side. I think there \nmight have been 30 or more amendments offered during that period of \ntime. In the end, the bill passed with six or eight Democratic votes, \nwas sent to the President, and was vetoed.\n  So the first 3 weeks were spent on this politically controversial \nissue, for which, at the end of the day, the President's veto was \nsustained, and it was wiped off the slate.\n  Then we went into a rather bizarre chapter here where the House \nRepublicans insisted that before--before--they would fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--you know, the folks at the airport, \nthe people who are guarding our borders--before they would fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to guard us against terrorism, we had \nto vote on five separate riders relative to the President's immigration \nExecutive orders.\n  They held up this appropriation--giving partial funding to it week \nafter week after week--until we finally said: Enough is enough. Fund \nthis agency that keeps us safe. Stop playing political games with this \nissue. It went back and forth and back and forth. Another 3 weeks were \nwasted on this issue before finally--finally--on a bipartisan basis we \npassed this measure funding the Department of Homeland Security and \nsaid to the House of Representatives: Please, stop putting extraneous \nissues on important matters like funding our government.\n  I thought perhaps we turned the corner and moved in a more positive \nway, but we are mired now over this one, small provision in this bill \nwhich Senator Cornyn could remove in a heartbeat.\n  Then last week came a blockbuster issue. I did not realize a week ago \ntoday that still a week later I would be going on Chicago television \nbeing questioned about a letter signed by 47 Republican Senators which \nwas sent to the Ayatollah of Iran, a letter sent by 47 Republican \nSenators to the Ayatollah of Iran telling him and his government not to \nnegotiate with the President of the United States in an effort to stop \nIran from developing nuclear weapons. The author of this letter, \nSenator Cotton of Arkansas, and those who signed it, went to great \nlengths describing how they would, in fact, have the last word on \nanything negotiated by this President and that they planned on being \naround for a long, long time, urging the Ayatollah to not enter into \nnegotiations with the President of the United States of America.\n  There is no historic precedent for what just occurred--none. We have \nnever had 47 Senators of any party send a letter to a head of state and \nsay: Stop negotiating with the United States of America. And they did \nit. The press reaction across the United States has been overwhelmingly \nnegative to this action that was taken by these 47 Senators. I could go \nthrough the long list here of what newspapers across America have said \nabout that letter.\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\n  The Detroit Free Press said: ``A blot on the 114th U.S. Senate.''\n  The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: ``The senators who signed the letter \nshould be ashamed.''\n  The Salt Lake Tribune: ``Cringe-worthy buffoonery on the global \nstage'' is how they described that letter.\n  The Courier-Journal in Louisville, KY, asked the question: ``Has \nCongress gone crazy?'' when they reflected on this letter. The Courier-\nJournal went on to call those who signed it: ``Senate Saboteurs.'' \nThose are their words, not mine.\n  The Salt Lake Tribune said: ``. . . the foolish, dangerous and \narguably felonious attempt by the Obama Derangement Caucus of the \nSenate. . . .''\n  The Kansas City Star said: ``Was Iran letter traitorous or just \ntreacherous for GOP [Senators]. . . .''\n  The Los Angeles Times called it ``insulting.'' They said: ``The \nRepublican senators' meddling in that responsibility is outrageous.''\n  It goes on and on. I won't read them all. It doesn't get any better. \nIt gets worse. And to think that 47 Republican Senators would try to \npreempt any President of the United States.\n  Today in Geneva, Switzerland, former Senator and current Secretary of \nState John Kerry sits down at a negotiating table across from Iran. On \nour side of the table are major allies trying to stop the development \nof a nuclear weapon in Iran. They will struggle. Maybe they will never \nreach an agreement. But what the 47 Senators said in a letter to the \nAyatollah of Iran will not help.\n  What is the alternative? If these negotiations fail, the alternative \nis Iran develops a nuclear weapon and endangers not only Israel but the \nMiddle East and far beyond, and triggers an arms race in the Middle \nEast for nuclear weapons. That is an outrageous, unacceptable outcome. \nOr, military action. Military action by Israel, perhaps, as Prime \nMinister Netanyahu suggested 2 weeks ago; military action by the United \nStates. Is it worth our time to be negotiating to try to find a \npeaceful resolution, to try to find a way for Iran to stop developing \nnuclear weapons with verifiable inspections? We won't take them at \ntheir word. There have to be inspections. Or is it better, as these 47 \nRepublican Senators insisted, to walk away from the table? I think it \nis far better to continue these negotiations. I don't know if they will \nend up with a good agreement, but don't we owe it to our President, our \nSecretary of State, our government, our country, to at least see these \nnegotiations through and then to read the agreement before 47 Senators \nsend a letter condemning it and rejecting it? It was a sad day. But now \nlet's turn the corner.\n  The first thing we should do this week--the absolute first thing we \nshould do--is approve the President's nominee to be Attorney General. \nLoretta Lynch appeared before our Judiciary Committee. Senator Hatch \nwas there, and I think he may even concede what I am about to say: No \none laid a glove on this magnificent lady--a prosecutor with a spotless \nrecord; an African American with a life story about witnessing the \ncivil rights movement as it unfolded in this country in the 1960s; an \nextraordinarily good person--good family, good background, impeccable \ncredentials. There wasn't a single thing said about her that would stop \nanyone voting for her.\n  Now her nomination has been sitting for 128 days since it was \nannounced. They are trying to set a record on the Republican side: No \nnominee for Attorney General has languished that long in the last 30 \nyears. If they have a complaint about this lady, let them say so. Their \ncomplaint: She was chosen by President Barack Obama. That is not good \nenough.\n  This week, let us rise above the politics which have dominated the \nSenate since this session began. Let us do something constructive--\napprove this Attorney General, take this offensive section out of this \nbill, and move it for passage.

Madam President, today we will again resume consideration \nof the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This is an important \nbill to me. I have been working on it for many years. Without a doubt, \nthis legislation is incredibly important.\n  Right now in this country there are thousands of human beings--mainly \nyoung people--living as slaves. Women and children are stolen from \ntheir homes, stripped of their God-given rights, and robbed of their \nhuman dignity. These individuals live among us. They live in our \nneighborhoods and in our suburbs, our biggest cities and our smallest \ntowns. They live in a world of silence, fear, hopelessness, and \nunspeakable suffering.\n  The State Department estimates that up to 17,500 individuals are \ntrafficked to the United States every year. The majority of these are \nwomen and children. Some of them are forced into a life of unpaid \nservitude, many others into sex work. Worldwide, the International \nLabor Organization estimates that 4.5 million people are currently \nenslaved through sex trafficking. These numbers are staggering, but \nthey only illustrate the scope of the problem. The suffering of each \nindividual victim should not be lost in a sea of statistics. For \nvictims of human trafficking, the surreal horror of their lives bears \ntestimony to the gravity of the crime.\n  A number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have worked \ntirelessly to update our legal framework for fighting this scourge. I \nwish to commend them for their efforts, especially the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, the senior Senator from Minnesota, and the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. Their efforts represent exactly the sort of work \nthat should be the mission of this body: working across the aisle to \nproduce workable solutions to the most pressing problems facing our \nNation.\n  The majority leader also merits praise for his decision to take up \nthis bill and his unwavering support for it. Far too often, his \npredecessor focused the Senate's time and efforts on taking partisan \nmessaging votes and abusing the rules to score political points. By \nprioritizing the consideration of important bipartisan legislation such \nas this--and by restoring this body's traditions of fulsome debate, an \nopen amendment process, and regular order through the committee \nsystem--our new majority is putting the Senate back to work for the \nAmerican people. While the sailing has not always been totally smooth--\nit rarely is--the progress we have seen in restoring this institution \nto its proper role as a productive legislative body is both real and \nmeaningful.\n  Given the progress we have made thus far, the logjam that is \ncurrently impeding our progress on this important legislation is \nextremely disappointing. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave claimed that we somehow supposedly snuck a controversial abortion \nprovision into an otherwise uncontroversial bill.\n  This claim is unequivocally ridiculous. First, the language in \nquestion was by no means snuck into the bill. It was in the bill when \nit was introduced at the beginning of this Congress. It was in the bill \nwhen those of us on the Judiciary Committee took part in an extensive \nmarkup of the bill. It was in the bill when it passed unanimously out \nof committee. It was in the bill when we undertook its consideration \nhere on the floor. In fact, there were Democratic cosponsors of this \nbill.\n  Moreover, not only was this language in the bill from the beginning, \nbut it has also been the law of the land for nearly four decades. \nDemocrats in this body have supported countless other bills with \nsimilar language, including even ObamaCare.\n  Abortion is obviously a divisive and sensitive issue. While I am \nstrongly pro-life, I recognize that many of my friends passionately \ndisagree with me on this issue. As Members of this institution, it is \nincumbent upon us to respect the sincere beliefs of our colleagues with \nwhom we disagree and to work toward responsible governing arrangements.\n  The Hyde amendment represents such a sensible and appropriate \narrangement. It is predicated on the commonsense notion that while we \nmay vigorously disagree on whether life should be protected before \nbirth, we can broadly agree that taxpayer money should not be used--\nshould not be\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nused--to fund a procedure that many Americans--in fact a majority, \naccording to a number of polls--consider to be murder.\n  The responsible way for each of us to approach this bill, regardless \nof our view on abortion, is to embrace this long-standing, commonsense \ncompromise on abortion funding and focus on passing the underlying \nmeasure--a bill that is so critical to our efforts to fight human \ntrafficking and help alleviate the suffering of victims.\n  To hold up the passage of this bill to pick a fight over the Hyde \namendment represents an unambiguous dereliction of Senators' individual \nduties to responsibly legislate.\n  Unfortunately, that is exactly what my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have done. They are now threatening a filibuster unless we \nagree to their extreme pro-abortion position on this issue. There ought \nto be six of them who will stand up and vote with us and get this bill \npassed.\n  In response, the majority leader offered an eminently reasonable \ncompromise--an up-or-down vote on an amendment to strip out the \nlanguage to which they are suddenly objecting. But the minority leader \nobjected, demanding a guarantee that the provision be removed. By doing \nso, the minority leader is once again resorting to outrageous ``my way \nor the highway'' tactics that are the antithesis of how the Senate \nshould work. It is a move out of the same playbook that he used to give \nus a calendar full of messaging votes last year meant to produce \npolitical theater rather than meaningful legislation.\n  This ploy plainly demonstrates the desire of the minority leadership \nto muck up the majority's efforts to exercise reliable leadership, no \nmatter the cost to the victims of human trafficking. By resorting to \nthis sort of obstruction, they have demonstrated how desperately they \nwant to derail our efforts to legislate responsibly and instead resort \nto their tired and discredited war-on-women rhetoric to win cheap \npolitical points.\n  Let me repeat a point I have repeatedly made about this impasse--\nwords that the minority leader has tried to manipulate to support his \nshameful gambit. For all of my colleagues who are tempted by this \nirresponsible strategy: It would be pathetic to hold up this bill. This \nbill is absolutely critical to our families and our children.\n  I cannot believe the Senate has become so political that my \ncolleagues would raise this issue--this tangential, long-settled issue \nat this time--after the same transparently clear language passed \nunanimously out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  For my colleagues to hold up this bill in an effort to impose their \nextreme policy, to overturn the law of the land that has long enjoyed \nbipartisan support, to pick a false fight over abortion, or to try to \nembarrass the majority is itself embarrassing.\n  I urge my colleagues in the minority in the strongest possible terms \nto reconsider their position and allow the Senate, once again, to do \nthe people's business.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss what many believe is \nthe most dangerous threat to our national security, and that is a \nnuclear Iran.\n  Over the past few weeks, there have been a lot of discussions about \nthe Obama administration's ongoing negotiations with Iran and what the \nrole of Congress should be. I believe the debate this past week in \nCongress over how to best address this issue has distracted us from \nwhat I believe are the two key objectives in our effort to prevent Iran \nfrom achieving nuclear weapons capability. First, Iran must be \nprevented from getting the bomb, and second, we in the Senate must \ndecide the best way to guarantee that result.\n  For the past 10 years, I have been working hard to find the most \nacceptable and best way to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons \ncapability. Note that word ``capability.''\n  For me, it has long been not enough to just announce that we must not \nallow Iran to get a nuclear weapon. I am determined that Iran must not \nget the technical capability to manufacture such a weapon because a \nnuclear weapons-capable Iran is as dangerous as a nuclear-armed Iran \nbecause it throws up a cloud of ambiguity about its formal intentions.\n  There are many in the policy communities who find some mistaken sense \nof comfort from the intelligence agencies' current view that Iran has \nnot yet made a formal decision to develop a nuclear weapon. This is a \ndelusion. Iran's industrial-strength uranium enrichment enterprise has \ngone from 600 centrifuges 6 years ago when the international community \nfirst expressed alarm to 19,000 today. We know the Ayatollah is on a \nquest for 190,000 centrifuges as soon as international constraints are \nremoved.\n  Let's state the obvious: The Iranian pursuit of uranium enrichment is \nnot being created to manufacture medical isotopes and reactor fuel for \nproducing electricity; its purpose is to produce nuclear bombs.\n  Throughout my many years of involvement on this issue--as cochair of \nthe task force at the Bipartisan Policy Center along with former \nSenator Chuck Robb and a distinguished panel of experts and in the last \n4 years here in the Senate--I have called for using the full range of \ntools to prevent Iran from reaching its nuclear goal. These include \nnegotiations coupled with ever-increasing sanctions pressure and a \ncredible threat of the use of military force if the negotiations and \nsanctions fail to lead to Iran's commitment to cease its pursuit of \nnuclear weapons capability. This continues to be my view.\n  I do believe in diplomacy. I would very much like to see effective \nnegotiations take place, led by insightful diplomats, focused on the \nright results. I would like to see that lead to a settlement that \nbrings security and confidence. But we have every reason to fear this \nis not now happening.\n  I don't want to destroy the negotiations track, but I do want to \nrefocus it with the firm backing it requires to achieve the goal we \nneed to reach. I don't want to demand everything from the Iranians, but \nI do want to require enough to guarantee they give up on their nuclear \nweapons ambitions. I don't want to torpedo the administration's \ndiplomatic efforts, but I do want to require that Congress have the \nfinal say on whether the results of negotiations are acceptable and \nachieve the goals of preventing Iran's nuclear weapons capability.\n  For me and I trust for the Senate, this is our most important task of \nthe moment--to force the President to accept a congressional role. He \nhas said repeatedly that he will deny us that role when it comes to \napproving any agreement. We must not let that happen.\n  The reason I did not sign the open letter to Iran is not because I \ndisagreed with the goals of the letter. All Senate Republicans and, I \nbelieve, many Senate Democrats, are in agreement on the overall \nobjective of avoiding a bad deal with Iran. But the strategy we need to \naccomplish this essential goal is now in question, and we are divided \nnow in a way that makes this goal harder to achieve.\n  There are two bills pending that would require the President to \npresent any Iran deal to us for review and action, and this is the \ncourse I believe we should take. One, which I cosponsored, has been \nintroduced by both Senators Kirk and Menendez--a bipartisan effort. The \nother, coauthored by Senators Corker and Menendez--also bipartisan--I \nalso support. The latter bill, which would require Congress to approve \nany deal with Iran, is very close to achieving the support of 67 or \nmore Senators needed to overturn President Obama's promised veto of any \nlegislation on this topic.\n  Lack of bipartisan consensus at this moment on this issue is likely \nto lead to a fatally flawed deal that destroys more than a decade of \neffort to bring Iran to cease its goal of nuclear weapons capability.\n  We all know now that the Obama administration abandoned the core \nobjectives at the very outset, even before these talks began. Four U.N. \nSecurity\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\nCouncil resolutions; frequent and constant demands coming from this \nChamber; four Presidents--two Republicans and two Democrats--saying a \nnuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable; the firm position of AIPAC and \nother friends of Israel--all stated the necessity that Iran give up and \nshut down all its uranium-enriching centrifuges. Yet this goal was \njettisoned before the talks even started. The Obama administration \nspokesmen, including Secretary Kerry himself, have explained repeatedly \nthat it was just too hard to achieve. We must be more realistic, we are \ntold. The Iranians, we are told, can never be expected to agree to the \ndemands laid down years ago by the Security Council. That was then, \nthey said. This is now. Everything has changed. We have to set that \ngoal aside, and we have to reach some reasonable agreement with a \nreasonable process with a reasonable country. The word we need to \nquestion there is ``reasonable.''\n  Madam President, it appears my time is running out, but I notice that \nno other Member is here to speak, so I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor just 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  But even leaving that shocking capitulation aside, we can never \nexpect that the Iranians would negotiate under those conditions. We can \nnow focus on the key fatal flaw of this agreement. It has been \nsimmering for months, but it is now boiling over onto the front pages \nof our national attention thanks to the presentation by the Prime \nMinister of Israel, and that is the sunset clause.\n  We now see that even if Iran is constrained by this agreement and \neven if in the most unlikely of worlds Iran fully complies with the \nagreement, at the end of a decade or so, Iran will be fully liberated \nto pursue nuclear capabilities with no limitations or constraints \nwhatsoever--a free hand, a blank check to go forward, an Iran that will \nhave wealth, the technical expertise, industrial infrastructure, the \nwill, and, if given a sunset provision, the international acquiescence \nto do whatever they like to pursue their goal without any ability of us \nto stop it. They can do whatever they like.\n  Ten years--oh, that is a long time out. Ten years is tomorrow \nafternoon. It is a blink of the eye.\n  Such a sunset clause makes this entire enterprise unacceptable. Any \nagreement that contains a sunset clause must be rejected, and any \nagreement with Iran that does not impose permanent restraints on their \nnuclear ambitions is no agreement at all. We in the Senate have it \nwithin our ability and mandate to guarantee that happens, but to do so, \nwe need to reach consensus across the aisle. We need to work together \nas Republicans and Democrats for the future security of our Nation, and \nfor that matter, all nations.\n  There are a number of issues on which we don't agree. There are a \nnumber of things on which we have different thoughts about how to \nproceed. But this is an issue of such historic consequence and such \npotential harm that we must find a way to work together to ensure our \nability to undo what looks like is coming our way. So I plead with and \nI urge my colleagues--all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats--to \nrise above any political considerations and work together to ensure \nthat this Senate can prevent Iran from getting the bomb. History and \nfuture generations and our children and our grandchildren will judge \nwhat we do here now, and may that judgment be the right judgment for \nnot just the future of our Nation but for the future of the world.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, last week the majority leader announced \nthat he would finally schedule a vote for this week on the nomination \nof Loretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General. But as of today no \ndate has been set. The Senate majority leader is now threatening to \nfurther delay a vote on this highly qualified nominee until after the \nSenate has concluded its debate on the human trafficking bill.\n  Now, there is really no good reason for Senate Republicans to \ncontinue dragging their feet on scheduling a vote on Ms. Lynch's \nnomination. I have been here long enough to know we can debate \nlegislation and vote on nominations at the same time, and to say \notherwise is a hollow excuse. In fact, last Thursday we voted on four \nother executive nominations while we were on the human trafficking \nbill. We are actually going to vote on two more executive nominations \nthis evening while we are on the human trafficking bill.\n  All Senators who agree on the importance of ending human trafficking \nalso know it is important to confirm Loretta Lynch as our Nation's top \nlaw enforcement officer. She has a proven track record of prosecuting \nhuman trafficking and child rape crimes. This is not just somebody who \njust talks about it and says how much they are opposed to human \ntrafficking, as though anybody were in favor of human trafficking.\n  This not just someone who says she is opposed to child rape cases, as \nthough anybody here were going to say they are in favor of it. She has \nactually prosecuted them. Over the course of the last decade, the U.S. \nattorney's office that Ms. Lynch leads has indicted over 55 defendants \nin sex trafficking cases and rescued over 110 victims of sex \ntrafficking. We stand here on the floor talking about these issues. She \nactually does it.\n  So I think she and the American people have waited long enough. \nPresident Obama announced the nomination of Ms. Lynch 4 months ago. The \nJudiciary Committee reported her nomination with bipartisan support 18 \ndays ago. By tomorrow--we talk about whether we move fast or not. By \ntomorrow, her nomination will have been pending on the Senate floor \nlonger than all of the past five attorneys general combined.\n  Take a look at this. Here is Loretta Lynch. She has been pending on \nthe floor now for 18 days. This is, of course, with the months she had \nto wait before that. Now, Attorneys General Holder, Mukasey, Gonzales, \nAshcroft, and Reno had to wait a total of 18 days pending after their \nnominations came out--so five of them, one of her. She has had to wait \nas long as five of them had to wait.\n  We also pointed out the amount of time--I look at the amount of time \nit took--for the four men who preceded her. All four of those men went \nthrough so much faster than she has. We happened to have a vote out of \ncommittee. Janet Reno took 1 day. John Ashcroft, who I helped get \nthrough the committee, although I did not support him, took 2 days. \nAlberto Gonzales took 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days, and Eric Holder, \n5 days.\n  This delay is an embarrassment to the Senate. Her qualifications are \nbeyond reproach. But the Senate Republican leadership continues to \ndelay a vote on her confirmation despite her impeccable credentials. \nNow, when she is confirmed, we know that Loretta Lynch will be the \nfirst African-American woman to serve our country as Attorney General. \nBut instead of moving forward with this historic nomination, Senate \nRepublicans appear intent on making history for all of the wrong \nreasons.\n  As David Hawkings wrote in a Roll Call article dated March 12:\n\n       Lynch is on a course to be confirmed this month after the \n     longest wait ever for a nominee to be attorney general--and \n     very likely by the closest vote ever to put a new person in \n     charge of the Justice Department.\n\n  We want to send the signal that we are tough on crime. We want to \nsend the signal that we want to get these traffickers. We want to send \na signal that people who commit crimes, whether they are Republicans or \nDemocrats, should go to jail. Yet we refuse to confirm the person who \nhas actually done all of those things. It appears that some want to \nsimply refuse to allow a vote on her nomination, effectively shirking \nthe constitutional duty of the Senate to provide advice and consent.\n  One Republican Senator even tweeted on the weekend about the need to\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nblock her historic nomination. Then, in case you overlooked why he was \ndoing that, he included a link to a political fundraising Web site. We \nhave always kept law enforcement--the FBI Director, the Attorney \nGeneral, anybody in law enforcement--out of politics. For a Senator to \ntweet that we have to block this person, and oh, by the way, here is \nwhere you can contribute to a political campaign--that is wrong.\n  It seems likely the Senate will have to file a cloture motion to vote \nto overcome the filibuster of her nomination. That is unprecedented; it \nis unwarranted. No other Attorney General nomination in our history has \never been met with a filibuster. We have never needed to have a cloture \nvote on an Attorney General nomination. Yet it seems Republican \nleadership wants to make history for all the wrong reasons.\n\n  I mention this to give us an idea. President George Bush in the last \n2 years of his term--now a lameduck President--nominated Michael \nMukasey for Attorney General.\n  Michael Mukasey was being sent because the last Attorney General had \ndone a disastrous job--even though he had been voted for by, I think, \nall Republicans--people will accept the fact now that he politicized \nthe prosecutors' offices and everything else, and finally the Bush \nadministration had to get rid of him.\n  I had just become chairman again, as Democrats had taken back the \nSenate. I moved Attorney General Mukasey through even though I did not \nsupport him. I felt the President should have a vote on his Attorney \nGeneral. I moved him through in record time.\n  She has waited so much more time, multiple times longer than Mukasey.\n  This is especially troubling and unfair because Ms. Lynch's \nqualifications for the job are so extraordinary. And her life story is \nequally extraordinary. Born in Greensboro and raised in Durham, NC, \nLoretta Lynch is the daughter of a fourth-generation Baptist preacher \nand a school librarian. They instilled in her the American values of \nfairness and equality, even when those around them were not living up \nto those values. Ms. Lynch has spoken about riding on her father's \nshoulders to their church where students organized peaceful protests \nagainst racial segregation. The freedom songs and the church music that \nwent hand-in-hand with those protests undoubtedly made up the \nsoundtrack of her childhood. The Judiciary Committee was honored to \nhave her father, Rev. Lorenzo Lynch, with us not only at both days of \nher historic hearing in January but also with us when the committee \nconsidered his daughter's nomination in February.\n  When Loretta Lynch was a young child, Reverend Lynch bravely opened \nhis church's basement to the students and others who organized lunch \ncounter sit-ins in North Carolina. He taught his only daughter that \n``ideals are wonderful things, but unless you can share them with \nothers and make this world a better place, they're just words.'' The \nfact that she has dedicated the majority of her career to public \nservice reaffirms that she has lived those ideals of justice in the \nservice of others. And yet, Senate Republicans appear intent on \npreventing her from continuing her service--service that we should be \nhonored to have.\n  Two weekends ago, Ms. Lynch traveled to Selma to honor the 50th \nanniversary of the historic march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, \nwhere scores of courageous Americans were beaten and trampled on Bloody \nSunday because they refused to be silent about the need for equal \nprotection under the law. It was a weekend when both Democrats and \nRepublicans came together. President Obama stood there with President \nGeorge W. Bush beside him, who had signed the last Voting Rights Act. \nThey honored the civil rights activists of 50 years ago.\n  But I also felt it was a time to reaffirm our shared commitment to \nAmericans, as Americans, and the ideals of justice and equality that so \nmany of our predecessors have fought and bled for, from our Founding \nFathers to the foot soldiers for justice on that bridge in Selma.\n  Loretta Lynch embodies these ideals. She has devoted her career to \nmaking them a reality. It is time for Republicans and Democrats to come \ntogether to confirm this outstanding woman to be the next Attorney \nGeneral. It is time to stop delaying and making excuses for how she is \nbeing treated. It is time to vote.\n  This is reflecting badly on all law enforcement. I hear from so many \nin law enforcement saying: Why are you politicizing this nomination? \nRepublicans and Democrats have usually kept law enforcement out of \npolitics.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, earlier this month, two Florida men were \ncharged with human trafficking. They drugged a runaway 16-year-old \ngirl. Then they forced her to have sex with up to 10 men a day. They \nsold her to men in a gas station bathroom. They sold her on the street \nand they sold her in the back of a car.\n  She was 16 years old. She had run away from home. She was terribly \nvulnerable. They promised her food, then they beat her, drugged her, \nand sold her. When she escaped, they tracked her down, beat her, and \nsold her again.\n  All of us--I think we should have an agreement that Democrats and \nRepublicans alike must remember the many other survivors of this \nheinous crime.\n  We have been working for almost 1 year on bipartisan proposals to \nprotect these vulnerable children, count the survivors, and then punish \nthose who put them through this hell. This effort had strong bipartisan \nsupport until partisan politics was injected into the debate.\n  The fight against human trafficking should not be made into a \npartisan issue to score political points. That is unfortunately where \nwe are today. Everyone expected this legislation to move smoothly \nthrough the Senate, I know I did, just as it did through the House. \nInstead, Senate Republicans have turned away from a comprehensive \nsolution that can garner broad support.\n  I am deeply saddened by this partisan fight. It is both destructive \nand unnecessary. It is destructive because it threatens to derail \nimportant legislation that would make a difference in the lives of \nsurvivors--such as the 16-year-old girl in Florida.\n  This partisan fight is unnecessary because abortion politics have no \nplace in this debate. Congress has a long history of passing \nlegislation to address human trafficking. We have consistently done so \nwithout abortion politics being injected into the discussion.\n  I know we have passed the Violence Against Women Act. We included a \ntrafficking amendment of mine in that. While I was disappointed that a \nnumber of my Republicans colleagues voted against the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which had the sex trafficking\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\namendment in it, we still passed it by a bipartisan majority, as did \nthe House of Representatives, and the President signed it into law.\n  So I was pleased we were able to get that significant piece of \nlegislation passed, even though many in this body who say why aren't we \npassing this voted against the Violence Against Women Act with the \nsexual trafficking amendment.\n  But I wish to make clear to everyone that this partisan provision \nthat has now popped up is not something that survivors of human \ntrafficking are asking for. It is not something experts in the field \nwho work with them every day are asking for. We should look at these \nexperts who know what is going on and ask them what it is they want. \nThey do not want this.\n  In fact, those who are closest to the damage wreaked by this terrible \ncrime are asking all of us, Senate Republicans and Democrats, to take \nout this provision. They are asking us to put politics aside and to \nfocus on the needs of those who have lived through a hell we will never \nunderstand.\n  Holly Austin Smith, a survivor, was a girl who ran away at the age of \n14 and was bought and sold for sex. She put it this way when she \ntestified before our committee:\n\n       Politics should not govern the options available to victims \n     of sex trafficking--especially when such victims often have \n     had their basic human rights taken away by criminals who had \n     only their own agendas in mind.\n\n  So I think we have to stand with these human trafficking survivors. \nWe have to put aside our agendas. They are asking us to take out this \nunnecessary provision and move the bill forward to address their urgent \nneeds.\n  I support the rest of Senator Cornyn's bill, and that is why I \nincluded it in the comprehensive substitute amendment I filed last \nweek. Also included in my substitute is a vital component to prevent \nhuman trafficking by focusing on runaway and homeless youth.\n  If we are serious about helping to end this heinous crime, we should \nbe talking about all the good ideas to expand the protections of \ntrafficking victims. Don't try to score partisan points. We should all \ncome together to protect these vulnerable kids. That is why we are \nhere. I am confident that if we remember these children, Republicans \nand Democrats, we can move forward and return to the bipartisan path we \nhave always walked on this issue.\n  One of the reasons I have that amendment--talking about preventing is \none thing and we should prosecute those people who do this--but \nwouldn't it be that much better for the victims if we could prevent it \nfrom happening in the first place?\n  I have spoken before of the nightmares I still have from some of the \ncases I prosecuted when I was 26 years old and the chief prosecutor for \none-quarter of my State. I looked at these victims and the ages of my \nown children, and all I wanted to do was to get--and did--the people \nwho perpetrated these crimes, prosecute them, and convict them.\n  We should prosecute people who do this, but I also thought how much \nbetter it would have been if we had programs that would have given \nthese people somewhere they could turn to before they became victims, \nsome way to protect them so we wouldn't see it afterward.\n  I said on the floor the other night that in preparing for these \ntrials, the people I prosecuted, I wouldn't bring paperwork home in the \nevening to do it. I stayed in my office and prepared it. One, I didn't \nwant to take the chance that one of my then-young children might see \nsome of the photographs I was going to introduce into evidence--but I \nalso didn't want them to see their father crying and wonder why, \nbecause I always tried to tell them the truth. I was not about to tell \nthese young children the truth of what I was seeing.\n  Instead, I would tell the truth to the jury and the jury would \nconvict, but even the jury wishes it had never happened in the first \nplace.\n  The National Network for Youth sent a letter saying:\n\n       The National Network for Youth is writing this letter with \n     the hope that the U.S. Senate will remove the partisan piece \n     of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This \n     legislation is desperately needed and we cannot let this \n     moment pass us by because of the addition of partisan and \n     divisive provisions.\n\n  The National Network for Youth is saying: Let's go back to why both \nRepublicans and Democrats wanted this legislation--to stop trafficking, \nto help the victims of trafficking, and not to score political points.\n  Just as the majority of this body voted for the Leahy-Crapo bill, the \nViolence Against Women Act, which had a provision on sexual \ntrafficking, a majority voted for it, Republicans and Democrats--I wish \nthat others--I wish everybody in this body voted for it.\n  I understand that some who now strongly support the partisan part of \nthe trafficking bill voted against the Violence Against Women Act. Each \nSenator has the right to vote as he or she wants.\n  But I find it strange that they say: Let's go forward with this \npartisan provision, when only 1 year ago or so those same Senators who \nare now saying we should go forward with this voted against the \nViolence Against Women Act. The very same Senators voted against it.\n  Let's get out of politics. That was a good act. It had a very strong \nsex trafficking provision, which fortunately also was accepted by the \nHouse of Representatives and signed into law by the President. Senator \nCrapo and I set aside politics so we could pass that bill. That is what \nwe should do today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I appreciate the work my colleagues have done on this \ntrafficking bill. It is an important issue that deserves debate and a \nvote.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Madam President, I will say why I believe the Lynch nomination should \nnot go forward. I think it is for a very important reason and, \nunfortunately, it is one that I think Congress has to address.\n  In their wisdom, our Founders gave Congress certain powers as a \ncoequal branch of government, and one of those powers was the power to \nconfirm or not confirm nominees. Long before Ms. Lynch's nomination was \nannounced, I said I could not vote to confirm any candidate for \nAttorney General who supported the President's unlawful Executive \namnesty. That Executive amnesty presents big constitutional issues that \nwe have to talk about and understand, and it relates directly to the \npowers of the executive branch versus the legislative branch.\n  The Attorney General is the top law enforcement officer in this \ncountry, and anyone who occupies that office, must have fidelity to the \nlaws of the United States duly passed, and to the Constitution of the \nUnited States. It is that simple. The Senate cannot confirm any \nindividual, must never confirm an individual to such an office as \nthis--the one most responsible for maintaining fidelity to law--who \nwould support and advance a scheme that violates our Constitution and \neviscerates congressional authority. No person should be confirmed who \nwould do that.\n  Congress makes the laws, not the President, and Congress has \nrepeatedly rejected legislation to provide amnesty, work permits, and \nbenefits to those who have entered our country unlawfully. If you want \nto receive benefits in the United States, you should wait your turn and \ncome lawfully.\n  We rejected such proposals in 2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2014. \nPresident Obama's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive actions \nnullify the immigration laws we do have that are on the books--the \nImmigration and Nationality Act--and replaces them with the very \nmeasures Congress refused to enact. That is where we are. Even King \nGeorge III lacked the power to legislate without Parliament.\n  President Obama's Executive action provides illegal immigrants--those \nwho come into our country contrary to the immigration laws of the \nUnited States, which are generous indeed, allowing a million people a \nyear to come to our country--with work authorization, photo IDs, \ntrillions in Social Security\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nand Medicare benefits, and tax credits of up to $35,000 a year, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service. I think the IRS \nCommissioner has admitted that as well.\n  The President's action has even made chain migration and citizenship \na possibility, which he said repeatedly he couldn't do and wouldn't do. \nDespite those assurances, his action opens up these possibilities as \nwell, it appears. And, again, all of these measures were rejected by \nCongress.\n  I discussed these issues with Ms. Lynch. I asked her plainly whether \nshe supported the President's unilateral decision to make his own \nimmigration rules and laws. Here is the relevant portion of that \nhearing transcript, because I wanted to be clear about it. This was \nduring the Judiciary Committee hearing when she was there as part of \nher confirmation process.\n\n       Mr. Sessions: I have to have a clear answer to this \n     question: Ms. Lynch, do you believe the Executive action \n     announced by President Obama on November 20th is legal and \n     constitutional? Yes or no?\n       Ms. Lynch: As I've read the [Office of Legal Counsel] \n     opinion, I do believe it is, Senator.\n\n  Well, first, we need to understand something. I served 5 years as a \nFederal prosecutor in the Department of Justice, and this is the way it \nworks. The Office of Legal Counsel is a part of the Department of \nJustice. The Office of Legal Counsel is the one that has been credited \nwith writing this pathetic memorandum that justified the President's \nactions. But the Office of Legal Counsel works directly for the \nAttorney General. The Attorney General is really the one responsible \nfor forwarding to the President a memorandum that says the President \ncan do what he wanted to do.\n  The President said on over 20 different occasions over a period of \nyears, ``I am not an emperor,'' ``I do not have the power to do this,'' \n``this would be unconstitutional.'' He made similar statements over 20 \ndifferent times. Then he changed his mind as we got close to an \nelection, for reasons that I don't fully intend to speculate about at \nthis time, and then he asked that he be given the power to do this.\n  This puts great pressure on the Office of Legal Counsel, but that is \none of the historic roles they fulfill--to analyze these things. They \ntake an oath to the Constitution, and they are required to say no if \nthe President is asking for something he is not entitled to do. They \nare supposed to say no, and the Attorney General is supposed to say no.\n  The Attorney General could review the opinion of the Office of Legal \nCounsel and take it upon himself or herself to write their own opinion \nand submit it as the position of the Department of Justice and say the \nPresident can do this if he so desires. So that is the way the system \nworks.\n  But what I want to say, colleagues, is the Attorney General played a \nkey role in this Presidential overreach. It was the Attorney General's \noffice that approved this overreach. And this nominee says she believes \nthis is correct. She indicated her approval, and I am sure will defend \nit in every court around the country and advocate for it. Some say: \nWell, she works for the President. No, she works for the people of the \nUnited States of America. Her salary comes from the taxpayers of this \ncountry. Her duty, on occasion, is to say no to the President; to try \nto help him accomplish his goals, like a good corporate lawyer would, \nbut at some point you have to say: Mr. Corporate CEO, Mr. President of \nthe United States, this goes too far. You can't do this. But Ms. Lynch \nhas indicated she is unwilling to do that.\n  One of the most stunning features of the President's actions is the \nmass grant of work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants. \nThese immigrants will take jobs directly from American citizens and \ndirectly from legal immigrants who have come into the country. U.S. \nCivil Rights Commission member Peter Kirsanow has discussed this issue \nand written at length about how allowing illegal immigrants to take \njobs undermines the rights of U.S. workers--the legal rights of U.S. \nworkers--especially African-American workers and Hispanic workers \nsuffering from high unemployment today.\n  At her confirmation hearing, I, therefore, asked Ms. Lynch about what \nshe might do to protect the lawful rights of U.S. workers. Here is the \nsimple question I placed to the person who would be the next top law \nenforcement officer for America. And in my preamble to the question, I \nnoted Attorney General Holder had said that people who came to our \ncountry unlawfully and who are in our country unlawfully today have a \ncivil right and a human right to citizenship in America, contrary to \nall law. So I asked her what she thought about this.\n\n       Mr. Sessions: Who has more right to a job in this country; \n     a lawful immigrant who's here or [a] citizen or a person who \n     entered the country unlawfully?\n       Ms. Lynch: I believe that the right and the obligation to \n     work is one that's shared by everyone in this country \n     regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone \n     is here regardless of status, I would prefer they would be \n     participating in the workplace than not participating in the \n     workplace.\n\n  What a stunning and breathtaking statement that is for the top law \nenforcement officer in America--to say that a person has a right to \nwork in this country regardless of how they came here. So people who \nenter don't have to follow the steps that are required? They do not \nhave to establish that they have lawful justification to enter the \nUnited States and work in the United States anymore? If you can just \nget into the country unlawfully, then you have a right to work? And our \ncurrent Attorney General Holder says they have a civil right to \ncitizenship.\n  This is not law. I don't know what this is, but it is so far from law \nI don't know how to express my concern about it effectively. It is \nunprecedented for someone who is seeking the highest law enforcement \noffice in America to declare that someone who is in this country \nillegally has a right to a job. Make no mistake, we are at a dangerous \ntime in our Nation's history, particularly for our Republic's legal \nsystem and our Constitution.\n  I would like to quote now from Prof. Jonathan Turley, a Shapiro \nProfessor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University Law \nSchool, a nationally recognized constitutional scholar, and a self-\ndescribed supporter of President Obama and most of his policies. He has \nbeen called as an expert witness on various issues by Senator Leahy and \nother Democrats over the years. He described the current state of \naffairs as ``a constitutional tipping point.'' He is referring to the \nPresidential overreach. I would like to take a moment to read from the \ntestimony he delivered before the House of Representatives in February \nof last year--9 months before the President even announced this \namnesty, but after the first DACA amnesty. This is what he said:\n\n       The current passivity of Congress represents a crisis of \n     faith for members willing to see a president assume \n     legislative powers in exchange for insular policy gains. The \n     short-term insular victories achieved by this President will \n     come at a prohibitive cost if the current imbalance is not \n     corrected. Constitutional authority is easy to lose in the \n     transient shifts of politics. It is far more difficult to \n     regain. If a passion for the Constitution does not motivate \n     members, perhaps a sense of self-preservation will be enough \n     to unify members. President Obama will not be our last \n     president. However, these acquired powers will be passed to \n     his successors. When that occurs, members may loathe the day \n     that they remained silent as the power of government shifted \n     so radically to the Chief Executive. The powerful personality \n     that engendered this loyalty will be gone, but the powers \n     will remain. We are now at the constitutional tipping point \n     for our system. If balance is to be reestablished, it must \n     begin before this President leaves office and that will \n     likely require every possible means to reassert legislative \n     authority.\n\n  Now that is Professor Turley, a supporter of President Obama, and a \nfine constitutional scholar, who is warning the U.S. Congress of the \ndangers to its powers that have been eroded in the recent months. To \nstop it, he says that will require Congress to use ``every possible \nmeans to reassert its legislative authority.''\n  So stopping an Attorney General nominee--not voting to confirm an \nindividual as Attorney General--is that a legitimate power of Congress? \nWell, of course it is. Should we feel obligated and required to confirm \nsomeone who has announced they intend to pursue and advance legally \nthrough the powers of their office an unconstitutional overreach, \nbecause the President nominates that person? Is that our duty? Doesn't \nCongress have a right to say: Oh no, Mr. President, we understand how \nthis system works. You get to nominate, but you have overreached\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\nhere and we are not going to ratify. We are not going to consent or \napprove someone who is going to continue to promote these kinds of \nunlawful activities.\n  One glaring result of Congress's passivity is that executive branch \nnominees no longer feel the need to be responsive to congressional \noversight. We are not getting sufficient answers from them. That is for \nsure. I think Congress has too often been quiet and slept on its watch.\n  In the past, Members could perform their constitutional duty of \nadvice and consent, for example, by withholding consent until a nominee \nprovided information to which Congress was entitled. That is how \ncoequal branches of government are supposed to function. Congress has a \nduty to demand accurate information from the executive branch before \nproviding funds to that branch, and they have a right to insist on it. \nThey don't have to fund any branch of government they believe is \nunworthy.\n  When Ms. Lynch came before the committee, it quickly became apparent \nthat she had no intention of being frank and providing real answers. \nThat is a problem I think we have to confront.\n  I think the most telling example of this concern was illustrated by \nan answer I was given to a straightforward question I asked, which goes \nto the very core of this debate that we are having in America about the \nPresident's powers and what we should do about establishing a lawful \nsystem of immigration--one that we could be proud of, one that is \nsystemically and fairly applied day after day.\n  The question I asked her was simply this:\n\n       Do you believe that President Obama has exceeded his \n     executive authority in any way? If so, how?\n\n  She answered:\n\n       As United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New \n     York, I have not been charged with determining when and \n     whether the President has exceeded his executive authority.\n\n  But that was really not a good-faith answer or an attempt to answer \nthe question.\n  I will wrap up and just say, in conclusion, that we are dealing with \nhuge constitutional issues. I wish it weren't so. It is not anything \npersonal that causes me to complain about this nominee. But in truth, \nwe need to use the means this Congress has to defend its legitimate \nconstitutional rights, the power it has been given to legislate. And \nthe President's duties, as the chief law and executive officer of the \ncountry, are to execute the laws passed by Congress. One of the key \nplayers on his team is the Attorney General, and the Attorney General \nin this situation has taken a position contrary to the fundamental \nprinciples of the Constitution, as Professor Turley has delineated with \nforce and clarity.\n  That being the case, I think Congress has a duty to this institution, \nto the laws and Constitution of this country, and to the American \npeople not to confirm someone who is not committed to those principles \nand, indeed, has asserted boldly that she would continue in violation \nof them.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Death Master File\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I am going to defer to my colleague from \nConnecticut, since at 5 p.m. we will be discussing the nominees which I \nwill speak to. But before we do, I just want to point out two things to \nthe Senate.\n  First of all, the lead story of ``60 Minutes'' last night was about \nthe death master file which is put out by Social Security.\n  Interestingly, the story was from the extraordinary standpoint that a \nnumber of people are told they are dead when in fact they are very much \nalive and all of the horror they go through in trying to correct \nsomebody's having made a mistake--a clerical error--that in fact they \nwere dead by the alteration of one number or a name or just sheer \noverlook.\n  But there is another problem with the death master file, and we have \ntried and tried to get that from Social Security. Unless you have an \nimmediate use--a legitimate use for the death master file to be made \npublic, such as a life insurance company--they would have a legitimate \nuse to know who had died so they could stop the payments. Something \nelse the ``60 Minutes'' program pointed out was that Medicare did not \ncatch a lot of payments going out. But unless you have a legitimate \nuse, by suddenly putting on line the death master file, it opens up all \nof these Social Security numbers for criminals to come in and create a \nnew identity, file a tax return, and get a refund on a fictitious tax \nreturn.\n  I want to continue to encourage the Social Security Administration. \nThey claim they don't have the legal authority until we can give them \nthe legal authority they are looking for. We think they have it \nadministratively in their power not to put it out there. That is the \nright thing to do.\n\n\n                         Negotiations With Iran\n\n  As I yield to the very distinguished Senator from Connecticut, a \ntremendous member of our commerce committee, I want to say I was sad \nlast week--and am still sad this week--that nearly half of the Senators \nof the Senate sought to inject themselves by writing to the Ayatollah, \ntrying to derail the negotiations that are ongoing on matters of life \nand death. If they don't think Iran having a nuclear weapon is a matter \nof life and death, they have another thing coming. Trying to derail the \nnegotiations, while in fact the negotiations are going on at the very \nhour of the writing of that letter, and still are--and we won't know \nuntil the 24th of this month if in fact they are successful.\n  I will come back when we get into the executive session about the \nnominees. I look forward to hearing from the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I am proud to follow the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida, and I join him in his observations \nof the ``60 Minutes'' show, but equally, if not more importantly, in \nhis views on the letter that was sent to the rulers of Iran and its \ndivisive and destructive impact on a matter that should be above \npartisan politics. To inject a partisan political issue into, \nliterally, a matter of life and death, in my view, is unfortunate, \ninappropriate, and truly regrettable.\n\n\n                            Lynch Nomination\n\n  Equally unfortunate, regrettable, and inappropriate is to inject \npolitics into law enforcement. The nomination of the chief law \nenforcement officer in our Nation, the Attorney General--that position \ntruly ought to be above politics. In fact, as we know from the \nstructure of our government, it is generally regarded to be above \npolitics.\n  The President of the United States has his or her legal counsel to \nprovide advice to the President, but the Attorney General of the United \nStates enforces laws for this Nation--not for one party, not for one \nofficial, not on one issue, but on all issues for all people in the \nUnited States.\n  When my colleagues have said on the floor that the President deserves \nhis nominee, really it is the Nation that deserves a nominee to be \nconfirmed.\n  This nominee has been delayed longer than any in recent history. As \nmy colleagues have observed and as this chart illustrates, 129 days \nhave passed since Loretta Lynch's nomination. From announcement to \nconfirmation, her nomination has been delayed longer than any in recent \nhistory--in fact, longer than any in modern history, putting aside the \nMeese nomination, which was delayed because of an ongoing investigation \ninto alleged improprieties.\n  There is no investigation here. There is no question of impropriety. \nThere has been no hint of any reason to reject the Loretta Lynch \nnomination.\n  The American people could be forgiven for thinking that some of the \nMembers of this body are simply looking for an excuse to delay or deny \nher nomination.\n  First, it was in our hearing questions about her capacity and \nqualifications. Those reasons or potential excuses for delaying or \ndenying her nomination were quickly extinguished. Then it was the \nimmigration issue. That too, as an excuse for delaying or denying this \nnomination, has been dispensed. Now it is the antitrafficking bill.\n  No reason for delay could be more inappropriate, because the fact of \nthe matter is the threat to delay again her nomination is antithetical \nto the very goal of stopping human trafficking. If my colleagues really \nwant to end sex exploitation and human trafficking,\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\nthey should confirm the chief law enforcement official who is \nresponsible for fighting it. They should confirm the nominee who has \nindicated an anathema to this kind of abuse, who has shown her \ndetermination to fight it and to use all of the laws and potentially \nthis new law in the war against human trafficking.\n  The Senate is perfectly capable of filling this crucial position--the \ntop law enforcement job in the Nation--even as it debates \nantitrafficking legislation. In fact, it has shown itself capable of \ndoing so just last week when two nominees to Department of \nTransportation positions--important transportation positions, as I can \nsay personally, because they involve the safety and reliability of our \nsystem--even as it continued to debate the antitrafficking legislation.\n  Holding the Lynch nomination hostage--which is what is happening \nhere--is a disservice to the Department of Justice but even more so to \nour system of justice. It undermines the integrity and trust in the \nnonpolitical nature of justice in this Nation. It does so at a time \nwhen vigorous and effective leadership is more important and necessary \nthan ever.\n  The Nation could be forgiven for assuming, as increasingly appears to \nbe so, that the Lynch nomination is being held hostage or is simply a \ncynical excuse to prevent her from getting to work on protecting the \nAmerican public from human trafficking, which is so important.\n  There are legitimate points of debate between our sides on this \nissue. Those points of debate and differences need to be resolved, and \nI hope they will be. I trust they will be. I believe that they are \nresolvable and that extraneous or irrelevant provisions now in the bill \ncan be removed so that we can focus on stopping modern-day slavery, \nwhich is what the--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. If I may have another minute to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Which is what we should be doing here, and I believe \nwe will do it.\n  Loretta Lynch has a stellar record. She served with incredible \ndistinction during her time as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District \nof New York. I suggest to my colleagues that the best way to serve the \npurpose of stopping trafficking is to confirm her so she can get to \nwork on enforcing that new law.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, we have had competing claims about who \nis really at fault. I think the answer to that question is becoming \nunquestionably undeniable to any fair observer. Actions speak louder \nthan words and there is no denying the actions of the minority party, \nwhich, before this Congress, was the majority party in the Senate for 8 \nyears.\n  Even in the minority, they are up to their old tricks of blocking \namendments and grinding the Senate to a halt. Given the distortion of \nthe Senate rules during those 8 years, it is no wonder the American \npublic, and perhaps even some Senators, are confused about how the \nSenate rules are supposed to work. So I wish to take a few moments to \ntalk about a procedure in the Senate called the cloture motion.\n  With cloture, the Senate is actually voting on the question: Is it \nthe sense of the Senate that the debate shall be brought to a close? \nThe proper use of cloture is when the Senate has had time for debate \nand consideration of amendments and it seems as though the Senate is \ngetting bogged down. If a cloture vote fails, then that means the \nSenate has decided, as a body, to keep on considering a particular \npiece of legislation. This is a crucial point and one that was \nroutinely distorted under the previous majority, and they did it for \npartisan ends.\n  A vote against cloture is a vote to continue considering a bill until \nat least 60 Senators are satisfied they have had their say and are \nready to vote a bill up or down, yea or nay. It is not always clear \nwhen the Senate has reached that point, so the bill can sometimes \nrequire several cloture votes.\n  Under the previous majority leadership--and now that group happens to \nbe the Senate minority--we saw unprecedented abuses of Senate rules to \nblock Senators from participating in the deliberative process. This \nincluded the repeated abuse of the cloture rule. In order to shield his \nMembers from having to take tough votes, the previous majority leader \nroutinely moved to shut down all consideration of a bill even before \nany debate took place and even before any amendments could be \nconsidered.\n  As I stated, cloture is supposed to be used after the Senate has \nconsidered a measure for a period of time and a preponderance of the \nSenate thinks it has deliberated enough, and not do it to end \nconsideration of a bill before it has begun, as the previous majority \nleadership did for several years prior to this year.\n  Let's contrast how our majority leader, Senator McConnell, has been \nrunning the Senate. He has not tried to block minority amendments, as \nwas done to us when we were in the minority. In fact, we have already \nhad more than twice as many amendment votes as all of last year.\n  As the manager of this bill, I have been running an open amendment \nprocess, and I am not afraid to have votes on amendments of all kinds. \nIn fact, if you are fortunate enough to be elected to represent your \nState as a U.S. Senator, it seems to me you have an obligation to the \npeople of your State to offer amendments on issues that are important \nto your State. The American people saw that we were serious about \nrestoring the Senate tradition of having an open amendment process with \nthe very first major bill we took up in this new Congress.\n  Supporters of the Keystone Pipeline bill had the 60 votes to end \ndebate, but we didn't try to ram through the bill without consideration \nof amendments. We had a full, open amendment process as we are supposed \nto have in the U.S. Senate, because it is a deliberative and amending \nbody. There were more than a few ``gotcha'' types of amendments from \nthe other side, but that is OK because that is how the Senate is \nsupposed to operate. There was also an opportunity, for the first time \nin a very long time, for Senators to get votes on substantive issues \nthat are important to the people of their individual States. That \nshould be a big deal for every Senator, but it was not a very big deal \nthe way the Senate was run previous to this year. When Senators are \nblocked from participating in the legislative process, the people they \nrepresent are disenfranchised. We were not elected to serve our party \nleadership, but to represent our State, and that is why it was so \ndisappointing under the previous majority to see Senators repeatedly \nvoting in lockstep with their party leadership to block amendments and \nend debate before it started. I think it is pretty clear from the last \nelection that that strategy backfired in a very major way. Yet the same \nleaders, now in the minority, are up to their old tricks.\n  The previous Senate leadership routinely used a tactic called filling \nthe tree, where a former majority leader used his right of first \nrecognition to call up his amendments and thus block out amendments \nfrom other Senators of both political parties.\n  When the Senate is considering a number of amendments at once, it \nthen requires unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in \norder to call up a new amendment, and that is a way to prevent other \nSenators from then offering their amendments. If you don't get \nunanimous consent to take down an amendment to make room for your \namendment, you don't get the chance to offer your amendment, and \nusually that was blocked, and that is why there were only 18 rollcall \nvotes on amendments all last year, compared to this year. The last time \nI counted, so far this year we had 43 votes.\n  Elections are supposed to have consequences, and the consequences of \nthe last election are that the new majority decided the Senate ought to \noperate as a deliberative and amending body where every Senator can \nparticipate, so Majority Leader McConnell has not filled the amendment \ntree.\n  We have substantive amendments pending as we speak. Nevertheless, the \nminority leadership has been objecting to even setting aside the \npending amendment or proceeding to a vote on pending amendments just as \nwhen they used the procedure of filling the amendment tree.\n  After reporting the human trafficking bill out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee unanimously, they have decided there is one \nprovision they don't\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nlike, so after 3 days of consideration last week the bill has not moved \nforward. It looks as though the same trick is going on right now. Since \nthere is an open amendment process--and that is the way Senator \nMcConnell runs the Senate--we have naturally suggested that they offer \nan amendment if they don't like something in this bill. They have \nrefused to do so, and instead are holding up the entire bill from being \namended and finally passed.\n  So after opening the bill up to amendments and having considered the \nbill for a week, the majority leader has now filed cloture. I want to \nbe clear what this means. Again, a vote against cloture is a vote to \ncontinue debate and consider amendments. I have voted against ending \ndebate many times in recent years out of principle when Senators were \nbeing denied their right to offer amendments. No one can say this is \nthe case right now on this human trafficking bill. We have had a week \nof debate, and it is the minority party that is blocking amendments.\n  Remember that many Members of the now minority party, when they were \nin the majority, were adamant that a vote against cloture is a \nfilibuster and that it is illegitimate to filibuster. I say to my \ncolleagues, if they truly believe filibusters are wrong and it was not \njust cynical political posturing, then you had better vote for cloture \ntomorrow.\n  I will also note that a couple of Senators sent out a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter at the beginning of this Congress calling again for \nwhat they term the ``talking filibuster.'' By this, those Senators mean \nthat if you vote against ending debate, you should be prepared to talk \nnonstop on the Senate floor. Under their proposal, as soon as there are \nno Senators talking on the Senate floor, the Senate would move to a \nfinal vote. The problem with this idea under the previous leadership \nwas that amendments were routinely blocked so it meant Senators would \nhave to talk nonstop to preserve their right to offer an amendment with \nno guarantee they would ever get the chance. That is not the issue this \ntime.\n  We have allowed an open amendment process, and it is the minority \nparty that is blocking amendments. So I would say to all the advocates \nof the so-called talking filibuster, if you do vote against cloture, \nyou are saying you want to debate this bill more before a vote is \ntaken. In that case, you better put your money where your mouth is.\n  To all of my colleagues who support this so-called filibuster and \nvote against this cloture motion, I expect to see you come down to the \nSenate floor and talk nonstop. You can use the time to explain to the \nAmerican people why you object to moving forward with this very \nimportant bipartisan legislation to combat sex trafficking. Then when \nyou are ready to move forward with the vote, let us know.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1522-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1522-S1523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF CARLOS A.

BROWN TO BE AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF COMMERCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Carlos \nA. Monje, Jr., of Louisiana, to be an Assistant Secretary of \nTransportation; and Manson K. Brown, of the District of Columbia, to be \nan Assistant Secretary of Commerce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, there \nwill be 30 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the confirmation \nof both nominees, but first of all, I want to render a courtesy to the \nSenator from Connecticut--if he needs to complete his statement, I will \nyield to him and he can ask it in the form of a question.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from \nFlorida, whose model I am seeking to follow not only in expertise but \nalso in graciousness and generosity.\n  It appears to me that we are in the midst of yet again considering \nnominations, so I would ask the Senator from Florida whether in his \nview his speaking now and our voting now on these nominations will \ndetract in any way from the Senate's consideration of the trafficking \nbill and whether our voting on Loretta Lynch would in any way detract \nfrom our consideration of the trafficking bill.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, my response to the Senator is that, just \nas with the two nominees we will favorably consider today, which have \nbeen bipartisan, with the great support of Senator Thune, the chairman \nof the Commerce Committee--those are not going to interfere with the \ntrafficking bill. So, too, the President's choice--which came \noverwhelmingly out of the Committee on the Judiciary--for Attorney \nGeneral likewise would not in any way hinder the trafficking bill if, \nin fact, we could get up the nominee, because the votes would obviously \nbe there. So my answer to the Senator is that clearly it would not \nhinder the trafficking bill.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the confirmation of two public \nservants into leadership roles at NOAA--the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration--and the Department of Transportation. One \nis Admiral Manson Brown. Admiral Brown has served our country with \ndistinction for over 30 years, most recently as an officer in the U.S. \nCoast Guard. What made him successful in the Coast Guard is going to be \nput to great use as Assistant Secretary for Environmental Observation \nand Prediction at NOAA. Hurricane season is right around the corner. \nHis position is going to provide crucial guidance and accountability if \nthat big storm starts swirling in a counterclockwise fashion headed to \nthe mainland. So I, this Senator from Florida, am particularly \nappreciative of Senator Thune for helping expedite this confirmation.\n  This role will also oversee continued efforts to modernize NOAA. Now \nwe are frequently launching up-to-date best technology weather \nsatellites. NASA builds them, NASA launches them, and NOAA operates \nthem. They are critical in giving us the refined capability to \ndetermine the ferociousness of a storm and its track.\n  As a highly regarded officer, Admiral Brown has honed significant \nexpertise in his leadership in the Coast Guard maritime stewardship, \nsafety, and national security. He is an engineer.\n  In our Senate Commerce Committee, we hold Admiral Brown in such high \nregard that we have reported his nomination favorably twice--once last \nCongress and again during our very first markup--and it was unanimous.\n  The second nominee is Mr. Carlos Monje, an Assistant Secretary for \nPolicy. He will play a major, important role in shaping national \ntransportation policy and priorities.\n  The Department of Transportation, for example, plays a critical role \nin helping ensure safety in the airspace as well as protecting \nconsumers.\n  Last Friday, since I did not go back to my State, I went with the FAA \nAdministrator to the Next Generation air traffic control modernization \nto see progress that is being made in the FAA research and development \ncenter at the Atlantic City Airport. NextGen capitalizes on existing \ntechnologies, such as the GPS capability provided by the Department of \nDefense satellite network, and what it will do is make our air traffic \ncontrol system safer and more efficient.\n  How that works is right now we have a series of radars, and if it is \nan up-to-date radar, it will go around every 20 seconds. So you know \nwhere the airplane was, but you don't know where it is for the next 20 \nseconds--until the radar comes back around. If it is where it should \nbe, it is in the path that was filed by the crew.\n  The next generation of air traffic control will track that aircraft \nfrom satellites, so there will be a continuous feed of data from the \naircraft to the satellites, back to the controllers on the ground. \nBecause of that, they can space aircraft closer, and they can give them \na direct route into the airport instead of a lot of the circular \npatterns they have because of the delay in the continuous tracking. As \na result, they\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\ncan save a lot of money for the airlines because they can be more fuel \nefficient, instead of the present step system--if you own an airliner \nand you are going into an airport, you are going to go through a series \nof steps. Air traffic control is going to tell you to descend to such-\nand-such at such-and-such heading, and you are going to go there. All \nof this continuous conversation is going on and having to be \nacknowledged by the cockpit crew until they tell you to descend to the \nnext step down.\n  What the new Next Generation system will do is it will eliminate that \nstep system because there will be a continuous feed. It will eliminate \na lot of the human conversation, some of which gets misunderstood, \nbecause all of that continuous communication will be between the air \ntraffic controller and the aircraft via communication of satellite. As \na result, they will be able to give an aircraft a direct route--not \nthrough steps, not all that conversation--of descent into the airport, \nsaving a lot of potential mistakes in human communication as well as \nsaving a lot of fuel instead of having to power up and power down as \nthe aircraft goes through each of those steps.\n  Implementing the Next Generation air traffic control modernization is \ngoing to be just one of the many transportation policy challenges that \nwe will face and that we are developing and that we have already \nimplemented on a trial basis in a couple of airports and in some \nairplanes.\n  The Department of Transportation also plays a critical role in \nensuring vehicle safety through its National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration. And, of course, you have been reading the stories \nthere--brakes that don't work, ignition switches that accidentally turn \noff when jostled by key chains, and now deadly airbag failures that \ncause the steering wheel containing an airbag to be a lethal weapon \nbecause it is faulty and it shreds metal in the explosion. We have had \nfive deaths in this country alone that have already been reported.\n  So these nominees are assuming extremely important roles in the U.S. \nGovernment. I think the way Senator Thune has handled these nominees as \nour chairman in the Commerce Committee has been admirable, and I thank \nhim for the bipartisanship he has shown. We commend to the Senate these \ntwo nominees who will be voted on at 5:30.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, will the kind Senator from Iowa yield for \none request? I neglected to say something earlier.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. He is very \nkind.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Landrieu, is in the Gallery in order to \nsee the confirmation vote of Carlos Monje, who is from her State of \nLouisiana.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley are printed in today's Record during \nconsideration of S. 178.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back all of our remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MICHAEL COLEGROVE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize a great Kentuckian \nwho has recently received a great honor. Dr. Michael Colegrove, who has \nbeen employed with the University of the Cumberlands in various \ncapacities over the last 40 years and is currently the vice president \nfor student services and the director of leadership studies, recently \nreceived the Tri-County 2015 Leader of the Year award from the \nLeadership Tri-County organization in Kentucky.\n  Leadership Tri-County focuses on civic, business, and community \nleadership in Laurel, Knox, and Whitley Counties in southeastern \nKentucky. A nonprofit organization founded in 1987, it identifies \npotential, emerging, and current leaders from the three counties and \nnurtures their continued development.\n  Dr. Colegrove graduated from Cumberland College, currently known as \nthe University of the Cumberlands, in 1971. In addition to working for \nthe school for 40 years, he spent 30 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and \nretired with the rank of colonel in 2003. Dr. Colegrove earned a master \nof arts from Eastern Kentucky University and a doctor of philosophy \nfrom Vanderbilt University. He is also a graduate of the U.S. War \nCollege.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  Dr. Colegrove is the author of six books. His first book, ``Climbing \nthe Pyramid: The How To's of Leadership,'' was published in 2004. It \ncame about because of the need for a textbook for a leadership seminar \nconducted by the University of the Cumberlands. He has also volunteered \nwith the American Red Cross and the Kiwanis Club.\n  Dr. Colegrove and his wife Donna live in Williamsburg, KY, and have a \ndaughter Kimberly who resides in Indiana with her husband Matthew and \ntheir two sons Jackson and William. I am sure Dr. Colegrove's family \nmembers are very proud of him and all that he has accomplished. I know \nmy colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Michael Colegrove on his \nreceipt of the Tri-County 2015 Leader of the Year award.\n  An area newspaper, the Times Tribune, published an article about Dr. \nColegrove receiving his award. I ask unanimous consent that a portion \nof said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, Feb. 25, 2015]\n\n                   U of C's Colegrove honored at LTC\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       The influence he has made on his colleagues was evident--\n     first with the University of the Cumberlands' marching band's \n     Honor Guard presenting the flags, and then by the two tables \n     of students and co-workers seated at the Corbin Technology \n     Center on Monday evening.\n       His dedication is the quality that earned University of the \n     Cumberlands' Dr. Michael Colegrove the 2015 Leader of the \n     Year award from the Leadership Tri-County organization during \n     their yearly awards banquet.\n       Colegrove can be described with many words: author, Sunday \n     School teacher, deacon, military veteran, and long-time \n     employee at the Williamsburg college that focuses on helping \n     students achieve success through faith and discipline.\n       Hon. Eugene Siler Jr., a Williamsburg native who serves as \n     the Sixth Judicial Circuit Judge for the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals, introduced Colegrove and described him as ``as \n     organized as anybody you'll ever see.''\n       As a personal friend and member of the Sunday School class \n     that Colegrove teaches, Siler said Colegrove had achieved \n     success through his faith and dedication to family, his job, \n     and his role as a Christian.\n       ``He's a great person,'' Siler said.\n       Colegrove's record speaks for itself. He earned a \n     bachelor's degree from then-Cumberland College, his master of \n     arts degree from Eastern Kentucky University and his doctor \n     of philosophy from Vanderbilt University. He also graduated \n     from the United States Army War College and served in the \n     Army Reserves for 30 years, retiring with the rank of \n     colonel.\n       He has been involved with a number of civic organizations \n     ranging from the American Red Cross to serving as lieutenant \n     governor for the Kiwanis Club for the Kentucky-Tennessee \n     Region 6.\n       But Colegrove's humility has remained intact throughout his \n     many achievements.\n       ``I am a man most blessed,'' he told the crowd. ``I had the \n     opportunity at the University of the Cumberlands to teach \n     faith with discipline with my colleagues and co-workers. I \n     had the opportunity to serve the students, and I have two \n     mentors.''\n       His mentors were the past two presidents of the \n     Williamsburg institution--Drs. Jim Taylor and Jim Boswell. \n     Both men saw extensive growth of the college over their \n     tenure as president, which Colegrove credited to their vision \n     for the future.\n       His involvement with Leadership Tri-County, he said, has \n     also taught him lessons--one being a book about leadership \n     and the other being one of life's simplest but sometimes most \n     difficult qualities--the art of listening.\n       The book, Colegrove said, had five major areas to consider.\n       ``Challenge the process,'' he said, ``then inspire and \n     share the vision. You have to have a vision. Enable others to \n     act, and model the way you want.''\n       The last aspect of that, he added, was to ``encourage the \n     heart.''\n       Listening, he said, came not from his years of experience \n     in the military or the collegiate arena, but more so from his \n     own family.\n       ``I don't know if Kimberly (Colegrove's only child) \n     remembers this or not, but she was talking to me and I guess \n     I drifted off in my own thoughts,'' he said. ``She squared me \n     up--which in the Army is when you take someone's face in your \n     hands. She turned my head so I was looking her straight in \n     the eyes and she kept on talking. She showed me that I needed \n     to listen to her.''\n       Oddly enough, Colegrove's second lesson came from \n     Kimberly's son, William.\n       ``William Joyce made this in a Sunday School class,'' \n     Colegrove explained while he took out a handmade set of ears. \n     ``It's a paper plate cut in two with a piece of pipe cleaner \n     connecting it. The paper plate has two ears drawn on it and I \n     guess the pipe cleaner is to do this.''\n       Putting the piece across his head, Colegrove demonstrated \n     how the ``listening ears'' worked. Amid the laughter of the \n     crowd, he reminded everyone that ``listening is an empowering \n     ability.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1524-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE AVIATION MUSEUM OF KENTUCKY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and congratulate \nthe Aviation Museum of Kentucky, the official aviation museum of the \nCommonwealth, on the occasion of its 20th anniversary. The museum, \nlocated at 4316 Hangar Drive at the Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, \nKY, first opened its doors on April 15, 1995.\n  The Aviation Museum of Kentucky has welcomed guests from all 50 \nStates and from over 80 foreign countries. It serves as an educational \nand cultural resource for my State and for the Nation, focusing on \naviation history and the important roles many Kentuckians have played \nin it.\n  The museum's exhibits attract approximately 10,000 students each year \nto learn about the science of flight. Through the study of aviation, \nstudents learn about math, physics, geography, and more. They also \nlearn about the history of aviation.\n  The museum educates young people about potential careers in aviation \nand the importance of the aviation industry, which supports thousands \nof jobs in Kentucky. Pilots, mechanics, engineers, flight controllers, \nmeteorologists, and more are all spotlighted.\n  The Aviation Museum of Kentucky holds summer camps to give 10- to 15-\nyear-old Kentuckians a hands-on introduction to flight. To date, they \nhave engaged with over 5,000 youth to help them explore aviation, \naerospace, and the possibility of productive and fulfilling careers in \nthe field. Students learn from professional educators and go aloft with \nlicensed instructors. And thanks to the museum's scholarship program, \nnearly one-third of all campers attend at no charge.\n  In 1996, the Aviation Museum established the Kentucky Aviation Hall \nof Fame to recognize famous Kentuckians in aviation. To date, 45 \nKentuckians have been honored. The Hall of Fame pays homage to \nKentuckians like Matthew Sellers of Carter County, who gave us \nretractable landing gear; Solomon Van Meter of Lexington, who gave us \nthe lifesaving pack parachute; and Noel Parrish of Versailles, who flew \nwith the legendary Tuskegee Airmen.\n  The museum also hosts historic aviation events, giving the public the \nchance to see in person restored and vintage aircraft. Thousands each \nyear come to view them. And the museum hosts quarterly lectures with \nspeakers from around the world who come to share their stories.\n  The Aviation Museum of Kentucky was founded by the Kentucky Aviation \nRoundtable, a group of aviation enthusiasts that was first organized in \n1978 in Lexington. The group worked for nearly two decades to see the \ndream of an aviation museum become reality, and now the Aviation Museum \nof Kentucky is a great asset to the State, to the industry, and to the \nNation.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Aviation \nMuseum of Kentucky and the many fine Kentuckians who run and support \nit. I am proud of all they have achieved in 20 years, and I look \nforward to many more years of excellence from this unique Kentucky \ninstitution. I wish the Aviation Museum of Kentucky many more years of \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1524-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1524-S1525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING REVEREND WILLIE T. BARROW\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week Chicago--and America--lost a \ncivil rights leader and an icon. Rev. Willie T. Barrow passed away at \nthe age of 90. Known as the ``Little Warrior,'' Reverend Barrow stood \nup to anyone who would deny equality.\n  In 1936, 10 years before the Montgomery bus boycott, 12-year-old \nWillie Barrow challenged the segregated Texas school system that \nrefused to bus African-American kids to school. In a recent interview, \nReverend Barrow described it this way. One day, Barrow had enough and \nconfronted the bus driver and school officials. ``You got plenty \nroom,'' Barrow said she told the bus driver and school officials. ``Why \nyou want me to get off? Because I'm black? We got to change that.''\n  She was right. And from that moment, she dedicated her life to \nfighting\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\nfor social justice and standing up for the most vulnerable in our \nsociety.\n  In 1945, she came to Chicago and worked as a youth minister and a \nfield organizer with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. At the height of the \ncivil rights movement, she followed Dr. King to Atlanta, where she \norganized meetings, rallies and transportation for volunteers who came \nto participate in the marches and sit-ins. She also helped organize the \n1963 march on Washington.\n  Reverend Barrow didn't just fight for racial equality, she fought for \nwomen's rights, labor rights and gay rights too. While she helped Rev. \nJesse Jackson start Operation Breadbasket on the South Side of Chicago, \nshe was fighting sexism within the civil rights movement. During \nmeetings, some even asked Reverend Jackson why he brought his \nsecretary.\n  But as Operation Breadbasket evolved into the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, \nReverend Barrow became the first woman to lead the organization. As the \nchairman of the board and CEO, Reverend Barrow brought women together \nfrom the Chicago Network--an organization comprised of Chicago's most \ndistinguished professional women--to talk about their leadership roles \nand the underrepresentation of women on corporate boards.\n  Around Chicago, she was known as ``godmother'' for the work she did \nwith many young community activists--including Barack Obama. She took \non causes ranging from AIDS awareness to traveling on missions of peace \nto Vietnam, Russia, Nicaragua, Cuba and South Africa when Nelson \nMandela was released from prison.\n  Last Sunday, 70,000 people gathered in Selma, AL, to remember and \ncelebrate the civil rights leaders who marched 50 years ago. Sadly, \nReverend Barrow couldn't be there. But 50 years ago, Reverend Barrow \nwas on the front lines, marching alongside Dr. King and future \nCongressman John Lewis.\n  Years ago, I made the trip to Selma and stood on the Edmund Pettus \nBridge where Reverend Barrow marched and John Lewis was beaten \nunconscious and nearly killed by Alabama State troopers. It was \nprofoundly moving to see the places where leaders like these risked \ntheir lives to redeem the promises of America for all of us. And it's \nbecause of civil rights leaders like Reverend Barrow that our Nation \nhas made progress in the pursuit of social justice. But we know that \nbridges run both ways. We can move ahead, or we can turn back. Without \nthe courage, the leadership, and the determination of Rev. Willie T. \nBarrow, the fight to move forward just got a little harder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1525-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ASSAULT ON PRESS FREEDOM IN TURKEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times on the Senate \nfloor in defense of press freedom because it is a fundamental \ncornerstone of a democratic society. Today I want to briefly draw the \nSenate's attention to the situation in Turkey, one of the many \ncountries in the world where this basic right is under threat by \nofficials in the government who seek to silence their critics.\n  Recently, in the latest assault on press freedom, Turkish police \narrested and detained nearly two dozen members of the news media, \nincluding Ekrem Dumanli and Hidayet Karaca, two prominent journalists \nwho are well known to be affiliated with Fethullah Gulen, a vocal \ncritic of President Erdogan. The sweeping charges levied against them \nwere not only intended to stop their criticism, but to intimidate \nanyone who is critical of the Turkish Government. While Mr. Dumanli has \nsince been released, Mr. Karaca remains in prison.\n  This case reflects a broader pattern of repression in Turkey, where \ntargeted reprisals against outspoken critics have become a common \npractice for that government. In fact, Reporters Without Borders ranked \nTurkey 154 out of 180 nations for press freedom in its 2014 World Press \nFreedom Index, and Turkey has consistently been among the top jailers \nof journalists, along with China and Iran. This latest censorship \ncontinues the abuse of the Turkish penal code and further erodes what \nremains of press freedom in Turkey.\n  Not only are these actions inconsistent with the norms and values \nexpected of Turkey, a NATO ally; they violate Turkey's own commitments \nunder international law, foment further dissent, and serve to affirm \nthe allegations being made against the Erdogan administration. I am \ndisappointed with the backsliding from democracy that we have seen in \nTurkey, and I am concerned that it will weaken our important strategic \npartnership in the region. I join the many government officials, \nadvocates, journalists and others who have called for a prompt \nresolution of these cases, and an end to the Turkish Government's \njailing of people for exercising their right to free expression. The \ninternational community and people of good will everywhere expect \nbetter from the government of that great nation. The people of Turkey \ndeserve better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1525-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1525-S1526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       150TH ANNIVERSARY OF BURLINGTON, VERMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, next week I will join many Vermonters to \ncelebrate the 150th anniversary of the Burlington Police Department, \nwhich was established in early 1865 with the appointment of the city's \nfirst constable, Luman A. Drew. For the sake of historical perspective: \nMr. Drew was chosen for this high post after his service in the pursuit \nand capture of a group of Confederate cavalrymen who had raided nearby \nSt. Albans, robbing its banks and burning its buildings before fleeing \ntoward Canada.\n  For many months now, Burlington Detective Jeffrey Beerworth has been \ncompiling that bit of history and other stories in his research of the \ndepartment's history, and his vignettes are both entertaining and \ninformative. They are particularly interesting to me, as I reflect on \nmy work as a prosecutor with law enforcement agencies in Burlington and \nother communities as State's attorney for Chittenden County earlier in \nmy career. Most importantly, they show us how the role of law \nenforcement officers has evolved over the years. I imagine that First \nConstable Drew could not have foreseen police wearing body cameras in \n2015, nor would he recognize the challenges that heroin and other drugs \npose to our society. Back in his day, First Constable Drew's main \nconcerns were horse theft and public drunkenness.\n  A visit to the Burlington Police Department website today offers a \nglimpse of the many investigative units, programs and community \noutreach services that fall under today's rubric of police work. I am \nproud of the efforts of Police Chief Michael Schirling and his team in \nconnecting one-on-one with the residents of Burlington. Community \npolicing is alive and well in Vermont's largest city, and other \ndepartments around the country could learn much from what Burlington \nhas done. The Junior Community Police Academy creates relationships \namong police officers and the city's youths, who someday may become \nofficers themselves. In partnering with the Howard Center, officers \nwork with the Street Outreach Team to support those with psychiatric \nand substance abuse issues, or those who cope with homelessness or \nother behavioral challenges. These cases traditionally account for a \nlarge percentage of police calls, yet this innovative program allows \nfor trained professionals to address social service needs and allow \npolice officers to focus on public safety.\n  The Daily Activity Log of the Burlington Police Department offers a \nglimpse of the range and volume of calls to which today's officers must \nrespond. In a recent 2-day period, 223 records were logged, ranging \nfrom the minor to the tragic. Of course, there are many that are \nrecorded simply as ``traffic stops,'' but we know that every traffic \nstop has the potential for the unknown. That is why I have worked hard \nover many years to support these officers by providing Federal funds \nfor bulletproof vests. Officers need this protection and deserve \nnothing less.\n  Chief Schirling has laid out a series of upcoming events to mark the \ndepartment's 150 years of service. These will include a community \nbarbecue and open house, along with his monthly ``Coffees with the \nChief.'' This is all in keeping with his vision of community policing, \nand this celebration will be shared by all who benefit from the work of \na highly professional and dedicated police force.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\n  On this historic occasion, I thank Chief Schirling and the entire \nBurlington Police Department for their continued service and \ndedication, upholding a long and valued tradition. The Queen City is \nmost fortunate for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1526-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LICKING COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CENTENNIAL\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN.

Mr. President, it is with great admiration \nthat I wish to recognize the laudable achievements of Protectors of \nAnimals, a wonderful and innovative no-kill rescue and shelter \norganization based in East Hartford, CT. I am proud to highlight the \noccasion of their 40th Anniversary, and I wish to convey my deepest \ncongratulations to them on this auspicious occasion.\n  Protectors of Animals was founded in 1975 by a group of dedicated \nindividuals brought together by their shared love for animals and \ncommitment to animal welfare. Two of these individuals, Dru Harder and \nPhyllis Pavel, truly started off at the grassroots level, knocking on \ndoors in their community in Portland, CT, in order to raise awareness \nand funds for their local pound.\n  Over the years, Protectors of Animals' passion and tireless fight \nagainst animal cruelty has led them to great successes and enabled them \nto save countless abandoned and abused animals from being euthanized. \nThey have also aided more than 14,000 cats and 7,000 dogs in finding \ncaring homes across our State.\n  The dedicated staff and volunteers at Protectors of Animals not only \ngive animals shelter but help them to heal from past trauma and allow \nthem to recreate caring relationships with humans that are built on \ntrust. It is no surprise that this work has garnered deep and abiding \nsupport from animal lovers around Connecticut. This joint effort, \nbacked by genuine values of humaneness and caring, has allowed them to \nmeet the highest standards of accountability, as well as program and \ncost effectiveness. Protectors of Animals has been recognized by the \nIndependent Charities of America with that organization's ``Best in \nAmerica'' seal of approval, which is offered to a select few of the \nhighest performing nonprofits in our Nation.\n  Having personally supported Protectors of Animals over the years, I \ncan attest to the devotion, commitment, and enthusiasm of everyone \ninvolved with their organization. I know how hard their founders, board \nof directors, staff, and volunteers have worked to support these goals. \nFor its legacy of safeguarding animals and combating cruelty, I am \nproud to congratulate and celebrate Protectors of Animals on its 40th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1526-5", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1526-S1527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO WAYNE MASON\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, It is a great honor for me to pay \ntribute to a great Georgian and a great friend, Wayne Mason. It is \nWayne's 75th birthday, and for a minute I want to share with the Senate \nthe greatest example I know of how much difference one man can make. I \nwould not be where I am today and Gwinnett County--one of America's \nmost dynamic counties--would not be what it is today were it not for \nthe support and leadership of Wayne Mason.\n  Wayne is generous in giving back to his community and passionate in \nhis love of country. A successful real estate developer, Wayne has said \nhe lives for the deal and will die seeking his final one. Wayne began a \nlife of hard work and deal-making as a boy by plowing his family's \ngardens with a one-eyed mule, and he honed his marketing skills by \nselling eggs and Christmas wreaths. A clever young man, Wayne \nunderstood what was needed in a budding community and he opened many of \nthe entities needed to develop one--including a bonding company, \nceramic tile store, funeral home, liquor store and a bank. Between 1959 \nand 1972, he built 1,800 homes in the growing community of Snellville, \nGA, and by that time, he was a millionaire.\n  Wayne didn't stop building his community credentials there. He became \nchairman of the Gwinnett County Commission in 1977 and served in that \ncapacity until 1981. Wayne's successful\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\ndevelopment and investment projects in Gwinnett County include names \nand places all metro Atlantans know such as Discover Mills and The \nVillages at Global Forum. He also served as a member of the Atlanta \nRegional Commission, which is the regional planning and \nintergovernmental coordination agency for much of the metro Atlanta \narea.\n  Another area he conquered in more recent years that is also essential \nfor a thriving community is higher education. It has also become a \nparticular passion and point of pride for Wayne in the form of Georgia \nGwinnett College, which he helped to make a reality. In 1994, Gwinnett \nCounty was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a 4-year \ncollege. So Wayne and a group of leaders in Gwinnett County purchased \n160 acres of land in Lawrenceville, GA, and designated it specifically \nfor the development of a college campus. Georgia Gwinnett College \nopened its doors in 2006 as the first 4-year college founded in Georgia \nin more than 100 years, and the first 4-year, public college created in \nthe U.S. in the 21st century. In less than 10 years, Georgia Gwinnett \nCollege's enrollment is approaching 11,000 students and Wayne still \nserves on the college foundation's board.\n  Wayne Mason is the foundation upon which Gwinnett County's success is \nbased. So I want to wish happy birthday to a great Georgian and \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1527-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING ELLEN GOLDEN AND DR.

Like all members of this prestigious group, \nEllen and Barbara have had a tremendous impact on the lives of family \nand friends in their communities and on women throughout the State of \nMaine. Indeed, to be considered for the Maine Women's Hall of Fame, \nnominees' achievements must have had significant statewide impact, must \nhave improved the lives of women in Maine, and must have made \ncontributions with enduring value for women. I am pleased to say that \nEllen and Barbara have not only met these criteria, they have far \nexceeded them.\n  Ellen Golden, from Woolwich, ME, is the senior vice president and \nfounder of the Women's Business Center at Coastal Enterprises, Inc., \nCEI. She has played a leading role in supporting women business owners \nand microenterprise growth through research, policy, and program \ndevelopment. She has also been at the forefront of expanding small \nbusiness opportunities for minorities and immigrants in Maine. Ellen's \nefforts through CEI and a number of other boards and civic \norganizations have provided financial and career possibilities that \nwould otherwise have been unavailable to many Mainers. Ellen's work \ntruly embodies the spirit of American opportunity.\n  Dr. Barbara Woodlee, from Vassalboro, ME, was the president of \nKennebec Valley Community College in Fairfield, ME for nearly 30 years. \nA trailblazer in her field, she served as the first woman president \nwithin the Maine Community College System. Throughout her presidency, \nBarbara strove to increase educational opportunities for Maine women by \ndeveloping programs, particularly in the health care field, that met \nthe needs of the many women who used the college to launch their \ncareers. Her efforts to open up opportunities for women to access \nhigher education, and the well-paying jobs that come with it, are \ncommendable. But it is not just women at the college who have benefited \nfrom her work; thanks to her, Maine community college students pay the \nlowest in-state tuition and fees in all of New England. She kept costs \nlow while facing difficult budget challenges--a task with which we here \nin Congress can sympathize.\n  Congratulations to both Ellen and Barbara for their induction into \nthe Maine Women's Hall of Fame. With this well-deserved honor, they \njoin the likes of Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who in 1950 \ncourageously stood here, on the Senate floor, to denounce McCarthyism. \nI thank Ellen and Barbara for all that they have done for Maine women \nand for our State as a whole. Maine is fortunate to have such tireless \nadvocates promoting education and fighting for economic \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1527-2", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CONGRATULATING THE WELLS RESERVE AND LAUDHOLM TRUST\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Wells \nNational Estuarine Research Reserve and Laudholm Trust on the \ncompletion of the final stage of their solar energy project. On March \n20, 2015, they will officially finish the project and be 100 percent \nenergy self-sufficient. They are the first nonprofit organization in \nMaine to reach this milestone.\n  The solar array project represents only the most recent environmental \nconservation landmark on the Wells Reserve. In fact, the land on which \nthe Wells Reserve sits has been a key link between the community and \nthe environment for not just decades but centuries. It was settled for \nfarming in 1643 and was the largest saltwater farm in York County at \none time, shipping its products to Boston weekly. By 1978, the farm was \nderelict, but devoted community members decided to join together to \nrevitalize it. Laudholm Trust was soon born from that initiative. \nOfficially established in 1982, the Laudholm Trust has been a vital \nsupporter of stewardship, research, and education efforts surrounding \nMaine's coastal communities, enabling the success of the Wells Reserve. \nDue in part to the Trust's efforts, the 2,250 acres of farmland were \ndesignated a National Estuarine Research Reserve in 1984.\n  The solar array project is an outstanding example of what can be \naccomplished when stakeholders at all levels work together. The \n$200,000 in funding to purchase the solar panels was made possible by \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, NOAA, the Mattina R. \nProctor Foundation, the Davis Conservation Foundation, the Town of \nWells, Efficiency Maine, and, of course, Wells Reserve and Laudholm \nmembers.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 741. A bill to authorize the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to establish a program of awarding grants to owners \nor operators of water systems to increase the resiliency or \nadaptability of the systems to any ongoing or forecasted changes to the \nhydrologic conditions of a region of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nWater Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act with colleagues \nthe Democratic Leader and the Ranking Member of the Senate Environment \nand Public Works Committee. The condition of our water infrastructure \nis in a state of crisis that is only exacerbated by the effects of \nclimate change. The longer we ignore the problem, the more it costs us. \nThe truth is that we are in a crisis that can be averted. There is no \nneed to lose revenue from disrupted business and flooded streets. Our \nwater infrastructure may be buried and out of sight and out of mind; \nbut today we must elevate these systems to the priority level they \ndeserve.\n  Each year within my home State of Maryland I witness stark reminders \nof what cities across the nation are facing. In July of last year, \nPrince George's County, Maryland, experienced a breakdown of its most \nessential public infrastructure when a water main serving 100,000 \npeople began to fail. Mandatory water restrictions were instituted, \nlimiting access to water for homes and businesses during an intense \nheat wave that saw the heat index repeatedly reach the triple digits. \nAt the National Harbor, one hotel evacuated three thousand guests and \nwas forced to cancel upcoming reservations. Included in the affected \narea is Joint Base Andrews, which publicized plans to shut down a long \nlist of services, including appointments at its medical center.\n  There are incidents like this happening across America. The reports \nare startling. They confirm what every water utility professional \nknows: we need massive reinvestment in our water infrastructure now and \nover the coming decades. The Nation's drinking water infrastructure--\nespecially the underground pipes that deliver safe drinking water to \nAmerica's homes and businesses--is aging. Like many of the roads, \nbridges, and other public assets on which the country relies, most of \nour buried drinking water infrastructure was built 50 or more years \nago, in the post-World War II era of rapid demographic change and \neconomic growth. Some of our systems are even older; in Baltimore, \nwhere I live, many of the pipes were installed in the 1800s. Some of \nthese ``pipes'' are wooden. We need investment to deal with changing \npopulation needs and changing hydrological conditions. We have no other \nchoice but to elevate it to a public safety priority and to take action \nnow.\n  The Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act aims to \nhelp local communities meet the challenges of upgrading water \ninfrastructure systems to meet the hydrological changes we are seeing \ntoday. The bill directs the EPA to establish a Water Infrastructure \nResiliency and Sustainability program. Grants will be awarded to \neligible water systems to make the necessary upgrades. Communities \nacross the country will be able to compete for Federal matching funds, \nwhich in turn will help finance projects to help communities overcome \nthese threats.\n  Improving water conservation, adjustments to current infrastructure \nsystems, and funding programs to stabilize communities' existing water \nsupply are all projects WIRS grants will fund. WIRS will never grant \nmore than 50 percent of any project's cost, ensuring cooperation \nbetween local communities and the federal government. The EPA will try \nto award funds that use new and innovative ideas as often as possible.\n  It is estimated that by 2020, the forecasted deficit for sustaining \nwater delivery and wastewater treatment infrastructure, will trigger a \n$206 billion increase in costs for businesses. In a worst case \nscenario, a lack of water infrastructure investment will cause the \nUnited States to lose nearly 700,000 jobs by 2020.\n  A healthy water infrastructure system is as important to America's \neconomy as paved roads and sturdy bridges. Water and wastewater \ninvestment has been shown to spur economic growth. The U.S. Conference \nof Mayors has found that for every dollar invested in water \ninfrastructure, the Gross Domestic Product is increased to more than \n$6. The Department of Commerce has found that that same dollar yields \nclose to $3 worth of economic output in other industries. Every job \ncreated in local water and sewer industries creates close to four jobs \nelsewhere in the national economy.\n  We know that a reactive mode causes us to lose billions in revenue in \nthe short-term. Let us instead take a proactive approach, making \nstrategic investments in innovative projects designed to meet the \ncurrent and future needs of our water systems. That is the purpose of \nthe Water Infrastructure Resiliency and Sustainability Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 741\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, defines a \n     sex trafficker as a person who ``knowingly. . .recruits, \n     entices, harbors, transports, provides, obtains, or maintains \n     by any means a person. . .knowing, or in reckless disregard \n     of the fact, that means of force, threats of force, fraud, \n     coercion. . .or any combination of such means will be used to \n     cause the person to engage in a commercial sex act, or that \n     the person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be \n     caused to engage in a commercial sex act'';\n       (2) while use of the word ``obtains'' in section 1591, \n     United States Code, has been interpreted, prior to the date \n     of enactment of this Act, to encompass those who purchase \n     illicit sexual acts from trafficking victims, some confusion \n     persists;\n       (3) in United States vs. Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066 (8th Cir. \n     2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth \n     Circuit ruled that section 1591 of title 18, United States \n     Code, applied to persons who purchase illicit sexual acts \n     with trafficking victims after the United States District \n     Court for the District of South Dakota erroneously granted \n     motions to acquit these buyers in two separate cases; and\n       (4) section 108 of this title amends section 1591 of title \n     18, United States Code, to add the words ``solicits or \n     patronizes'' to the sex trafficking statute making absolutely \n     clear for judges, juries, prosecutors, and law enforcement \n     officials that criminals who purchase sexual acts from human \n     trafficking victims may be arrested, prosecuted, and \n     convicted as sex trafficking offenders when this is merited \n     by the facts of a particular case.\n\n     SEC. 110. USING EXISTING TASK FORCES AND COMPONENTS TO TARGET \n                   OFFENDERS WHO EXPLOIT CHILDREN.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Attorney General shall ensure that--\n       (1) all task forces and working groups within the Innocence \n     Lost National Initiative engage in activities, programs, or \n     operations to increase the investigative capabilities of \n     State and local law enforcement officers in the detection, \n     investigation, and prosecution of persons who patronize, or \n     solicit children for sex; and\n       (2) all components and task forces with jurisdiction to \n     detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of child labor \n     trafficking engage in activities, programs, or operations to \n     increase the capacity of such components to deter and punish \n     child labor trafficking.\n\n     SEC. 111. TARGETING CHILD PREDATORS.\n\n       (a) Clarifying That Child Pornography Producers Are Human \n     Traffickers.--Section 2423(f) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``means (1) a'' and inserting the \n     following: ``means--\n       ``(1) a'';\n       (2) by striking ``United States; or (2) any'' and inserting \n     the following: ``United States;\n       ``(2) any''; and\n       (3) by striking the period at the end and inserting the \n     following: ``; or\n       ``(3) production of child pornography (as defined in \n     section 2256(8)).''.\n       (b) Holding Sex Traffickers Accountable.--Section 2423(g) \n     of title 18, United States Code, is amended by striking ``a \n     preponderance of the evidence'' and inserting ``clear and \n     convincing evidence''.\n\n     SEC. 112. MONITORING ALL HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AS VIOLENT \n                   CRIMINALS.\n\n       Section 3156(a)(4)(C) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting ``77,'' after ``chapter''.\n\n     SEC. 113.

HERO ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The illegal market for the production and distribution \n     of child abuse imagery is a growing threat to children in the \n     United States. International demand for this material creates \n     a powerful incentive for the rape, abuse, and torture of \n     children within the United States.\n       (2) The targeting of United States children by \n     transnational criminal networks is a threat to the homeland \n     security of the United States. This threat must be fought \n     with trained personnel and highly specialized counter-child-\n     exploitation strategies and technologies.\n       (3) The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n     of the Department of Homeland Security serves a critical \n     national security role in protecting the United States from \n     the growing international threat of child exploitation and \n     human trafficking.\n       (4) The Cyber Crimes Center of the United States \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement is a vital national \n     resource in the effort to combat international child \n     exploitation, providing advanced expertise and assistance in \n     investigations, computer forensics, and victim \n     identification.\n       (5) The returning military heroes of the United States \n     possess unique and valuable skills that can assist law \n     enforcement in combating global sexual and child \n     exploitation, and the Department of Homeland Security should \n     use this national resource to the maximum extent possible.\n       (6) Through the Human Exploitation Rescue Operative (HERO) \n     Child Rescue Corps program, the returning military heroes of \n     the United States are trained and hired to investigate crimes \n     of child exploitation in order to target predators and rescue \n     children from sexual abuse and slavery.\n       (b) Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Investigations \n     Unit, and Computer Forensics Unit.--\n       (1) In general.--Subtitle H of title VIII of the Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 890A.

Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Ayotte, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. \nGillibrand, and Ms. Baldwin) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by him to the bill S. 178, to provide justice for the victims \nof trafficking; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                 TITLE __--RAPE SURVIVOR CHILD CUSTODY\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Rape Survivor Child \n     Custody Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Covered formula grant.--The term ``covered formula \n     grant'' means a grant under--\n       (A) part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly \n     referred to as the ``STOP Violence Against Women Formula \n     Grant Program''); or\n       (B) section 41601 of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \n     (42 U.S.C. 14043g) (commonly referred to as the ``Sexual \n     Assault Services Program'').\n       (2) Termination.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``termination'' means, when used \n     with respect to parental rights, a complete and final \n     termination of the parent's right to custody of, guardianship \n     of, visitation with, access to, and inheritance from a child.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     be construed to require a State, in order to receive an \n     increase in the amount provided to the State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title, to have in place a \n     law that terminates any obligation of a person who fathered a \n     child through rape to support the child.\n\n     SEC. __03. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Men who father children through rape should be \n     prohibited from visiting or having custody of those children.\n       (2) Thousands of rape-related pregnancies occur annually in \n     the United States.\n       (3) A substantial number of women choose to raise their \n     child conceived through rape and, as a result, may face \n     custody battles with their rapists.\n       (4) Rape is one of the most under-prosecuted serious \n     crimes, with estimates of criminal conviction occurring in \n     less than 5 percent of rapes.\n       (5) The clear and convincing evidence standard is the most \n     common standard for termination of parental rights among the \n     50 States, territories, and the District of Columbia.\n       (6) The Supreme Court established that the clear and \n     convincing evidence standard satisfies due process for \n     allegations to terminate or restrict parental rights in \n     Santosky v. Kramer (455 U.S. 745 (1982)).\n       (7) Currently only 10 States have statutes allowing rape \n     survivors to petition for the termination of parental rights \n     of the rapist based on clear and convincing evidence that the \n     child was conceived through rape.\n       (8) A rapist pursuing parental or custody rights causes the \n     survivor to have continued interaction with the rapist, which \n     can have traumatic psychological effects on the survivor, and \n     can make it more difficult for her to recover.\n       (9) These traumatic effects on the mother can severely \n     negatively impact her ability to raise a healthy child.\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\n       (10) Rapists may use the threat of pursuing custody or \n     parental rights to coerce survivors into not prosecuting \n     rape, or otherwise harass, intimidate, or manipulate them.\n\n     SEC. __04. INCREASED FUNDING FOR FORMULA GRANTS AUTHORIZED.\n\n       The Attorney General shall increase the amount provided to \n     a State under the covered formula grants in accordance with \n     this title if the State has in place a law that allows the \n     mother of any child that was conceived through rape to seek \n     court-ordered termination of the parental rights of her \n     rapist with regard to that child, which the court is \n     authorized to grant upon clear and convincing evidence of \n     rape.\n\n     SEC. __05. APPLICATION.\n\n       A State seeking an increase in the amount provided to the \n     State under the covered formula grants shall include in the \n     application of the State for each covered formula grant such \n     information as the Attorney General may reasonably require, \n     including information about the law described in section \n     __04.\n\n     SEC. __06. GRANT INCREASE.\n\n       The amount of the increase provided to a State under the \n     covered formula grants under this title shall be equal to not \n     more than 10 percent of the average of the total amount of \n     funding provided to the State under the covered formula \n     grants under the 3 most recent awards to the State.\n\n     SEC. __07. PERIOD OF INCREASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title for a 2-year period.\n       (b) Limit.--The Attorney General may not provide an \n     increase in the amount provided to a State under the covered \n     formula grants under this title more than 4 times.\n\n     SEC. __08. ALLOCATION OF INCREASED FORMULA GRANT FUNDS.\n\n       The Attorney General shall allocate an increase in the \n     amount provided to a State under the covered formula grants \n     under this title such that--\n       (1) 25 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section __02(1)(A); and\n       (2) 75 percent the amount of the increase is provided under \n     the program described in section __02(1)(B).\n\n     SEC. __09.

Mr. President, I speak for the first time from the Senate \nfloor with a simple message: The world is growing ever more dangerous \nand our defense spending is wholly inadequate to confront the danger. \nTo be exact:\n\n       During the last four or five years the world has grown \n     gravely darker. . . . We have steadily disarmed, partly with \n     a sincere desire to give a lead to other countries, and \n     partly through the severe financial pressure of the time. But \n     a change must now be made. We must not continue longer on a \n     course in which we alone are growing weaker while every other \n     nation is growing stronger.\n\n  I wish I could take credit for those eloquent and ominous words, but \nI cannot. Winston Churchill sounded that warning in 1933, as Adolph \nHitler had taken power in Germany.\n  Tragically, Great Britain and the West did not heed this warning when \nthey might have strangled that monster in his crib.\n  Rather than let the locusts continue to eat away at the common \ndefense, the Axis Powers were stronger and the West weaker, \nconciliating with and appeasing them, hoping their appetite for \nconquest and death might be sated. As we all know, however, that \nappetite only grew until it launched the most terrible war in human \nhistory.\n  Today, perhaps more tragically because we ought to benefit from those \nlessons of history, the United States is again engaged in something of \na grand experiment of the kind we saw in the 1930s. As then, military \nstrength is seen in many quarters as a cause of military adventurism. \nStrength and confidence in the defense of our interests, alliances, and \nliberties is not seen to deter aggression but to provoke it.\n  Rather than confront our adversaries, our President apologizes for \nour supposed transgressions. The administration is harsh and unyielding \nto our friends, soothing and suffocating to our enemies. The President \nminimizes the threat we confront, in the face of territory seized, \nweapons of mass destruction used and proliferated, and innocents \nmurdered.\n  The concrete expression of this experiment is our collapsing defense \nbudget. For years, we have systematically underfunded our military, \nmarrying this philosophy of retreat with a misplaced understanding of \nour larger budgetary burdens. We have strained our fighting forces \ntoday to the breaking point, even as we have eaten away at our \ninvestments in future forces, creating our own ``locust years,'' as \nChurchill would have put it. Meanwhile, our long-term debt crisis looks \nhardly any better, even as we ask our troops to shoulder the burden of \ndeficit reduction, rather than shoulder the arms necessary to keep the \npeace.\n  The results of this experiment, it should come as no surprise, are \nlittle different from the results from the same experiment in the \n1930s. American weakness and leading from behind have produced nothing \nbut a more dangerous world. When we take stock of that world and our \nposition in it, there can be no doubt a change must now be made.\n  An alarm should be sounding in our ears. Our enemies, sensing \nweakness and hence opportunity, have become steadily more aggressive. \nOur allies, uncertain of our commitment and capability, have begun to \nconclude that they must look out for themselves, even where it is \nunhelpful to stability and order. Our military, suffering from years of \nneglect, has seen its relative strength decline to historic levels.\n  Let's start with the enemy who attacked us on September 11: radical \nIslamists. During his last campaign, the President was fond of saying \nAl Qaeda was ``on the run.'' In a fashion, I suppose this was true. Al \nQaeda was and is running wild around the world, now in control of more \nterritory than ever before. This global network of Islamic jihadists \ncontinues to plot attacks against America and the West. They sow the \nseeds of conflict in failed states and maintain active affiliates \nthroughout Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Greater Middle East, and \nSouth Asia.\n\n  Further, Al Qaeda in Iraq was let off the mat when the President \ndisregarded its commanders' best military judgment and withdrew all \ntroops from Iraq in 2011. Given a chance to regroup, it morphed into \nthe Islamic State, which now controls much of Syria and Iraq. The \nIslamic State cuts the heads off of Americans, burns alive hostages \nfrom allied countries, executes Christians, and enslaves women and \ngirls. The Islamic State aspires and actively plots to attack us here \nat home, whether by foreign plots or by recruiting a lone wolf in our \nmidst.\n  The President's suggestions, in other words, that the war on terror \nis over or ending, are far from true. Indeed, the Director of National \nIntelligence recently testified that ``when the final accounting is \ndone, 2014 will have been the most lethal year for global terrorism in \nthe 45 years such data has been compiled.'' Yet the President will not \neven speak our enemy's name.\n  The threat of radical Islamic terrorism brings us to Iran, the \nworld's worst state sponsor of terrorism. My objections to the ongoing \nnuclear negotiations are well known and need not be rehearsed at length \nhere. I will simply note that the deal foreshadowed by the President, \nallowing Iran to have uranium enrichment capabilities and accepting an \nexpiration date on any agreement--to quote Prime Minister Benjamin \nNetanyahu--``doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb; it paves Iran's \npath to the bomb.'' If you think, as I do, the Islamic State is \ndangerous, a nuclear-armed Islamic Republic is even more so.\n  Recall, after all, what Iran already does without the bomb. Iran is \nan outlaw regime that has been killing Americans for 35 years, from \nLebanon to Saudi Arabia, to Iraq. Unsurprisingly, Iran is only growing \nbolder and more aggressive as America retreats from the Middle East. \nAyatollah Khamenei continues to call for Israel's elimination. Iranian-\nbacked Shiite militias now control much of Iraq, led by Qassem \nSuleimani, the commander of the Quds Force, a man with the blood of \nhundreds of American solders on his hands.\n  Iran continues to prop up Bashar al-Assad's outlaw regime in Syria. \nIranian-aligned Shiite militants recently seized Sana'a, the capital of \nYemen. Hezbollah remains Iran's cat's paw in Lebanon. Put simply, Iran \ndominates or controls five capitals in its drive for regional hegemony. \nMoreover, Iran has rapidly increased the size and capability of its \nballistic missile arsenal, recently launching new a satellite. Just 2 \nweeks ago, Iran blew up a mock U.S. aircraft carrier in naval exercises \nand publicized it with great fanfare.\n  Iran does all of these things without the bomb. Just imagine what it \nwill do with the bomb. Imagine the United States further down the road \nof appeasement, largely defenseless against this tyranny.\n  You do not have to imagine much, though; simply look to North Korea. \nBecause of a naive and failed nuclear agreement, that outlaw state \nacquired nuclear weapons. Now America is largely handcuffed, watching \nas this rogue regime builds more bombs and missiles capable of striking \nthe U.S. homeland and endangering our allies.\n  But perhaps an even more obvious result of this experiment with \nretreat is the resurgence or Russia. The President aspired for a reset \nwith Russia and made one-sided concessions such as withdrawing \nballistic missile defenses from Poland and the Czech Republic.\n\n[[Page S1553]]\n\nSo Vladimir Putin saw these concessions as weakness and continues to \nviolate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The West refused \nto assist the new Ukranian President, so Putin invaded and stole \nCrimea. The Western response was modest sanctions. So Russian-supplied \nrebels shot a civilian airliner out of the sky in the heart of Europe. \nThe President dithers in providing defensive weapons to Ukraine, so \nPutin reignites the war, takes Debaltseve, and stages outside Mariupol. \nWhen bombs and bullets were called for, blankets were rushed to the \nfrontline.\n  That is just in Ukraine. Putin is also testing NATO's resolve. Russia \nhas tested a ballistic missile with multiple warheads, designed to \nthreaten our European allies in direct violation of the INF treaty. \nRussian bombers recently flew over the English Channel, disrupting \nBritish civil aviation. Estonia asserts that Russia kidnapped an \nEstonian security officer on its Russian border. And Russia continues \nto intimidate and harass other NATO partners such as Sweden, Moldova, \nand Georgia.\n  Finally, Russia's ability to continue its aggression will only grow \nbecause its defense spending has more than quadrupled over the last 15 \nyears. Moreover, the Russian military today is qualitatively better \nthan the old Soviet military, despite its smaller size, as Admiral Bill \nGortney, Commander of NORAD testified just last week.\n  Some say that falling oil prices will restrain Putin. In fact, \nRussia's Finance Minister recently announced 10 percent across-the-\nboard budget cuts to all departments of their government--except \ndefense. This should give us some insights into Putin's intentions and \nambitions.\n  Among major nation-state competitors, Russia's military buildup is \nexceeded only by China's. Over the same period of the last 15 years, \nChina's military spending has increased by 600 percent. Moreover, the \nbulk of the spending is directed quite clearly against the United \nStates as China pursues its anti-access and area denial strategy. This \nstrategy is designed to keep American forces outside the so-called \nfirst island chain and give China regional hegemony from the Korean \nPeninsula to the Indonesian archipelago. Thus, China is on a spending \nspree for more submarines, aircraft carriers, antiship ballistic \nmissiles, and other air and naval systems.\n  The impact of China's rapid military expansion is clear. China has \nchallenged Japan's control of the Senkaku Islands and purported to \nestablish an exclusive air defense zone over the East China Sea. By \nexpanding its activities in the Spratlys, China is precipitating a \nconfrontation with the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Taiwan. \nFurther, China's repressive actions against protesters in Hong Kong \nonly serve to undermine Taiwanese support of reunification, which \nitself could spark further Chinese aggression. All of this is to say \nnothing of China's cyber theft and economic espionage against American \ninterests or its atrocious record on human rights.\n  While America has retreated, not only have our enemies been on the \nmarch, our allies, anxious for years about American resolve, now worry \nincreasingly about American capabilities. With the enemy on their \nborders, many have begun to conclude they have no choice but to take \nmatters into their own hands, sometimes in ways unhelpful to our \ninterests.\n  Even our core NATO allies appear unsettled by our recent experiment \nwith retreat. The French intervened in Mali to confront Islamic \ninsurgents, but without adequate advance coordination, they quickly \nfound themselves in need of emergency logistical support from our Air \nForce.\n  Turkey just announced a new missile defense system that will not be \ninteroperable with NATO systems. Greece has a new governing coalition \nthat is hinting at greater cooperation with Russia.\n  The picture is no better outside NATO. Japan has significantly \nincreased its defense budget because of a rising China and may feel \ncompelled to reinterpret its post-war constitutional ban on overseas \n``collective self-defense.'' Saudi Arabia just entered a nuclear pact \nwith South Korea, likely a response to Iran's nuclear program. \nSimilarly, the Persian Gulf States have increased defense spending by \n44 percent in the last 2 years. While we should encourage our partners \nto carry their share of the defense load, the Sunni states are building \nup their defenses, not to help us, but because they fear we won't help \nthem against Iran.\n\n  We should never take our allies for granted, but we also shouldn't \ntake for granted the vast influence our security guarantees give us \nwith our allies' behavior. Germany and Japan are not nuclear powers \ntoday because of our nuclear umbrella. Israel didn't retaliate against \nHussein's Scud missile attacks in the gulf war, and thus we preserved \nthe war coalition because we asked them for restraint and committed \nsignificant resources to hunting down Scud launchers. This kind of \ninfluence has been essential for American security throughout the \npostwar period, yet it has begun to wane as our allies doubt our \ncommitment and our capabilities.\n  Make no mistake, our military capabilities have declined. In recent \nyears, we have dramatically underfunded our military to the detriment \nof our security. To fully understand the military aspect of our \nexperiment with retreat, some historical perspective is needed.\n  Defense spending reached its peak in 2008, when the base budget and \nwartime spending combined was $760 billion. Incredibly, the total \ndefense budget plummeted by $200 billion in the last year.\n  Today, defense spending is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a \nhistoric low rivaled only by the post-Cold War period. To give some \ncontext, during the Cold War, defense spending regularly accounted for \n60 percent of Federal spending. But if we don't end the experiment of \nretreat, this President will leave office with a mere 12 percent of all \nFederal dollars spent on defense.\n  The picture is no prettier when cast in the light of our economy. In \nthe early Cold War, defense spending was approximately 9 percent of \ngross domestic product. Today, it sits at a paltry 3.5 percent. But our \ndefense budget isn't just about numbers and arithmetic. It is about our \nability to accomplish the mission of defending our country from all \nthreats.\n  The consequences of these cuts are real, concrete, and immediate. As \nformer Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained, these cuts to \ndefense spending have put us on the path to the smallest Army since \nbefore World War II, the smallest Navy since World War, and the \nsmallest Air Force ever. Let's look more closely at each service.\n  Our Army has shrunk by nearly 100,000 troops. The Army has lost 13 \ncombat brigades, and only a third of the remaining brigades are fully \nready to meet America's threats. Further, investments in modernization \nhave fallen by 25 percent. If we continue on the current path, the Army \nwill lose another 70,000 soldiers, and every modernization program \ndesigned to preserve the Army's technological advantage will be \neviscerated.\n\n  The Navy, meanwhile, has had to cancel five ship deployments and \nsignificantly delay the deployment of a carrier strike group. The \nNavy's mission requires it to keep three carrier strike groups and \namphibious readiness groups prepared to respond to a major crisis \nwithin 30 years, but the Navy can only fulfill a third of its mission \nbecause of cuts to maintenance and training.\n  Similarly, the Air Force is less than one-third of its size 25 years \nago. Moreover, the Air Force depends upon modernization to preserve its \ntechnological edge, perhaps more than any other service, but current \nfunding levels could require cancellation of airborne-refueling tankers \nand surveillance aircraft, set back fighter and nuclear weapons \nmodernization, and shorten the life of tactical airlift and weapons \nrecovery programs.\n  Nor are these impacts just immediate; they will be felt long into the \nfuture. Key programs, once divested, will be difficult to restart. \nManufacturing competencies will be lost, the skilled-labor pool will \nshrink, and the defense manufacturing base will atrophy. Today's \nweapons systems and equipment will begin to age and break down. Our \ntroops won't be able to train, and their weapons and equipment won't be \nready to fight. In short, we will have a hollow force incapable of \ndefending our national security.\n\n[[Page S1554]]\n\n  What is to be done then? Our experiment with retreat must end. This \nCongress must again recognize that our national security is the first \npriority of this government. Our national security strategy must drive \nour military budget rather than the budget setting our strategy. The \nmilitary budget must reflect the threats we face rather than the budget \ndefining those threats.\n  In the face of these threats and after years of improvident defense \ncuts, we must significantly increase our defense spending. After \nhundreds of billions of dollars of these cuts, the base defense budget \nnext year is set to be only $498 billion. That is wholly inadequate. \nSecretary of Defense Ash Carter recently testified: ``I want to be \nclear about this--parts of our nation's defense strategy cannot be \nexecuted under sequestration.'' All four of the military service \nchiefs, in addition, have testified that these cuts put American lives \nat risk.\n  The President has proposed a modest increase to $534 billion, which \nis better than nothing. Senators John McCain and Jack Reed have called \nfor the full repeal of sequestration, which would raise the base \ndefense budget to $577 billion. I applaud and thank these veterans of \nboth the Senate and our military for this correct and clear-eyed \nrecommendation.\n  Yet I also want to highlight their support for the recommendation of \nthe National Defense Panel, which estimated that base defense spending \nfor fiscal year 2016 should be $611 billion at a minimum.\n  The National Defense Panel was a bipartisan group of eminent national \nsecurity experts convened by Congress to analyze the Quadrennial \nDefense Review. They unanimously concluded that then-Secretary of \nDefense Bob Gates' fiscal year 2012 budget was the proper starting \npoint to analyze our current defense needs--for at least two reasons.\n  First, Secretary Gates had already initiated significant defense cuts \nand reforms totaling $478 billion. It is hard to say, given those \nefforts, that his 2012 budget had left much fat in the Department of \nDefense.\n  Second, Secretary Gates and the Department assembled and submitted \nthis budget in late January 2010 and early 2011, or just months before \nthe Budget Control Act with its draconian defense cuts became law. That \nbudget, therefore, was the last time the Defense Department was able to \nsubmit a threat- and strategy-based budget, instead of the budget-based \nstrategies we have seen over the last 4 years.\n  This logic is compelling, even unassailable. Thus, I agree we should \nspend not merely $611 billion on the base defense budget next year but \nsubstantially more than that. After all, as we have seen earlier, and \nas the National Defense Panel has noted, the world has become much more \ndangerous since 2011. Islamic terrorism, Iranian aggression, Russian \nrevisionism, and Chinese interventionism have all worsened--to say \nnothing of other challenges. The $611 billion is necessary, but it is \nnot sufficient.\n  What then should our defense budget be next year? I will readily \nadmit we cannot be sure how much is needed above $611 billion. As the \nNational Defense Panel explained, ``because of the highly constrained \nand unstable budget environment under which the Department has been \nworking,'' the Quadrennial Review ``is not adequate as a comprehensive \nlong-term planning document.'' Thus, the panel recommends that Congress \n``should ask the Department for such a plan, which should be developed \nwithout undue emphasis on current budgetary restraints.''\n  I endorse this recommendation. In the meantime, though, even if we \ncan't specify a precise dollar amount, we can identify the critical \nneeds on which to spend the additional money.\n  First, our military faces a readiness crisis from budget cuts and a \ndecade of war. Our young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the \ngreatest weapons systems our country could ever have, but they need \ntraining--live-fire exercises, flight time, and so forth. Their \nweapons, equipment, and vehicles need maintenance and reset. If we \nfaced a major crisis today, our troops would no doubt suffer more \ncasualties and greater likelihood of mission failure. Of course, they \nknow all of this, and morale suffers because of it.\n\n  Second and related, our military is shrinking rapidly to historically \nsmall levels. This decline must be reversed. Our Navy probably needs \n350-plus ships, not a budget-dictated 260 ships. The Army needs to \nmaintain its pre-9/11 end strength of 490,000 Active-Duty soldiers, as \nthe Marine Corps needs 182,000 marines. The Air Force needs more \naircraft of virtually every type--bomber, fighter, airlift, and \nsurveillance. It is the deepest folly to reduce our military below its \n1990s size as the world has grown considerably more dangerous since \nthat quiet decade.\n  Third, we should increase research, development, and procurement \nfunds to ensure our military retains its historic technological \nadvantage, particularly as our adversaries gain more access to \nadvanced, low-cost technologies. This should start with the essential \ntools of command and control: cyber space, space, and intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance. The Air Force needs to modernize its \nbomber and mobility aircraft, in particular. The Navy needs to continue \nto improve its surface-ship and especially its submarine capabilities.\n  These critical priorities will no doubt be expensive, probably tens \nof billions of dollars more than the $611 billion baseline suggested by \nthe National Defense Panel. Because the massive cuts to our defense \nbudget resulted in part from record deficits, the question arises, \nhowever: Can we afford all of this?\n  The answer is yes--without question and without doubt, yes. The facts \nhere, as we have seen, are indisputable. The defense budget has been \nslashed by hundreds of billions of dollars over the last 6 years. The \ndefense budget is only 16 percent of all Federal spending, a historic \nlow and heading much lower if we don't act. And using the broadest \nmeasure of affordability and national priorities, defense spending as a \npercentage of our economy, last year we spent only 3.5 percent of our \nnational income on defense, which is approaching historic lows and may \nsurpass them by 2019.\n  Let us assume, for the sake of argument, that our military needs $700 \nbillion in the coming year, an immediate increase of $200 billion. To \nsome, that may sound staggering and unrealistic, yet it would still be \nbarely 4 percent of our economy--a full 1 percent lower than the 5 \npercent from which President Reagan started his buildup. If we \nincreased spending merely to that level--which both President Reagan \nand a Democratic House considered dangerously low--we would spend $885 \nbillion on defense next year.\n  Furthermore, trying to balance the budget through defense cuts is \nboth counterproductive and impossible. First, the threats we face will \neventually catch up with us, as they did on September 11, and we will \nhave no choice but to increase our defense budget. When we do, it will \ncost more to achieve the same end state of readiness and modernization \nthan it would have without the intervening cuts. This was the lesson we \nlearned in the 1980s after the severe cuts to defense in the 1970s.\n  Second, we need a healthy, growing economy to generate the government \nrevenue necessary to fund our military and balance the budget. In our \nglobalized world, our domestic prosperity depends heavily on the world \neconomy, which, of course, requires stability and order. Who provides \nthat stability and order? The U.S. military.\n  Finally, in the short term, ephemeral gains in deficit reduction from \ndefense cuts merely mask the genuine driver of our long-term debt \ncrisis: retirement and health care programs. The Budget Control Act \nultimately failed to control these programs--a failure not only of \npromises made to our citizens but also because the deficit-reduction \ndefault became annual discretionary funding, particularly the defense \nbudget. In the 4 years since, relative deficits have declined, \nalleviating the imperative to reform these programs yet doing nothing \nto solve their long-term insolvency and our debt crisis.\n  A better question to ask is: Can we afford to continue our experiment \nin retreat? I suggest we cannot. Imagine a world in which we continue \nour current trajectory, where America remains in retreat and our \nmilitary loses even more of its edge. What would such a world look \nlike?\n  It is not a pretty picture. Russia might soon possess the entire \nnorth shore of the Black Sea. An emboldened\n\n[[Page S1555]]\n\nPutin, sensing Western weakness for what it is, could be tempted to \nreplay his Ukrainian playbook in Estonia or Latvia, forcing NATO into \nwar or obsolescence.\n  China could escalate its island conflicts in the East and South China \nSeas. Without an adequate American response--or worse, with China \ndenying American forces access to those seas--countries as diverse as \nSouth Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines would feel compelled to \nconciliate or confront regional stability.\n  While North Korea already possesses nuclear weapons, Iran appears to \nbe on the path to a nuclear bomb, whether it breaks or upholds a \npotential nuclear agreement. Not only might Iran use its weapon, but \nits nuclear umbrella would also embolden its drive for regional \nhegemony. Moreover, Iran could provide its terrorist proxies with \nnuclear materials.\n  And does anyone doubt that Saudi Arabia and other Sunni states will \nfollow Iran down this path? Nuclear tripwires may soon ring the world's \nmost volatile region, increasing the risk of nuclear war, as well as \nthe possibility that Islamist insurgents might seize nuclear materials \nif they can topple the right government.\n  Islamic terrorists, meanwhile, will continue to rampage throughout \nSyria and Iraq, aspiring always for more attacks in Europe and on \nAmerican soil. Emboldened by America's retreat and by their own \nbattlefield successes, they will continue to attract thousands of \nhateful fighters from around the world, all eager for the chance to \nkill Americans.\n  All these are nightmare scenarios, but sadly not unrealistic ones. \nThe alternative, however, is not war. No leader--whether a President, a \ngeneral or platoon leader--wishes to put his troops in harm's way. War \nis an awful thing, and it takes an unimaginable toll on the men and \nwomen who fight it and their families.\n  But the best way to avoid war is to be willing and prepared to fight \na war in the first place. That is the alternative: military strength \nand moral confidence in the defense of America's national security. Our \nenemies and allies alike must know that aggressors will pay an \nunspeakable price for challenging the United States.\n  The best way to impose that price is global military dominance. When \nit comes to war, narrow margins are not enough, for they are nothing \nmore than an invitation to war. We must have such hegemonic strength \nthat no sane adversary would ever imagine challenging the United \nStates. ``Good enough'' is not and will never be good enough.\n\n  We can look to a very recent historic example to prove this point. \nJust 25 years ago, a dominant American military ended the Cold War \nwithout firing a shot. If we return to the dominance of that era, \naggressive despots such as Vladimir Putin, rising powers such as China, \nand state sponsors of terrorism such as Iran's Ayatollahs will think \nlong and hard before crossing us. And while we may not deter terrorist \ngroups such as the Islamic State, Al Qaeda, and Hezbollah, we will kill \ntheir adherents more effectively, while also sending a needed lesson to \ntheir sympathizers: Join and you too will die.\n  Bringing about this future by being prepared for war will no doubt \ntake a lot of money. But what could be a higher priority than a safe \nand prosperous America, leading a stable and orderly world? What better \nuse of precious taxpayer dollars? What more lessons from history do we \nneed?\n  I began with Churchill's prescient words from 1933. Alas, the West \ndid not take his advice, did not rearm and prepare to deter Nazi \nGermany. The predictable result was the German remilitarization of the \nRhineland and the long march to war. Now let me close with his \nregretful words from 1936:\n\n       The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing \n     and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. \n     In its place we are entering a period of consequences.\n\n  Churchill later called World War II the unnecessary war because it \ncould have been stopped so easily with Western strength and confidence \nin the 1930s. I know many of you in this Chamber stand with me, and I \nhumbly urge you all--Democrat and Republican alike--to join in \nrebuilding our common defense, so that we will not face our own \nunnecessary war, our own period of consequences.\n  I will now yield the floor, but I will never yield in the defense of \nAmerica's national security on any front or at any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, time is running out for us to extend the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, a program that began almost 20 \nyears ago in this body and the other body and that right now is taking \ncare of 10 million children--the children of parents who in most cases \nhave full-time jobs that don't offer insurance and full-time jobs that \ndon't pay enough so these families can buy insurance for their \nchildren.\n  We know that CHIP works. It works for parents, and it works for \nchildren. We know that if we don't act now, States will start rolling \nback the CHIP programs. Legislatures are adjourning almost as we speak. \nWe need to provide States with certainty so they can budget for CHIP \nnow and 4 years into the future.\n  Unfortunately, the deal currently being floated in the House would \nnot fund CHIP for a full 4 years. Instead, if reports are true, it \nwould permanently repeal the sustainable growth rate--the so-called \ndoctors fix--while failing to provide much needed certainty to \nchildren's health care. I want to take care of doctors. I want to make \nsure this is done right because it affects doctors. It affects doctors' \nability to deliver care. It affects those patients whom doctors serve. \nBut how do we leave here taking care of the doctors permanently and \nshortchanging children, only giving them 2 years of health insurance? \nIt is past time we fix SGR.\n  In 2001, when I was a member of the House, Congressman Bilirakis as \nthe Republican chair of the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee and I as the Democratic ranking member wrote the \nfirst SGR fix, so I have been fixing the SGR for a long time. But we \nshouldn't be focused in this body and that body on paying doctors at \nthe cost of shortchanging our children. Our priority must be passing a \nfull 4-year, clean extension of the current CHIP program, on which \n130,000 children in my State depend--again, sons and daughters of \nworking Oklahoma families and working Ohio families who are working in \njobs where they simply don't get insurance and don't get paid enough \nthat they can buy insurance. These 10 million children in our Nation \ndepend on this.\n  A 4-year extension of CHIP will provide Congress, the administration, \nand our States with the necessary time to collect relevant data and \ninformation to fully analyze and prepare for the future of kids \ncovered. Doing only 2 years is not just shortchanging these children \nand creating anxiety in their families, it is also truncating our \nability, compromising our ability to really understand how to fully \nintegrate CHIP into a health care system overall in the future. We \nshould be providing certainty and stability for these families, not the \ncliche of kicking the can down the road in favor of a short-term fix. A\n\n[[Page S1556]]\n\n4-year extension provides that certainty and will make a difference \ninto the next decade on how, in fact, we take care of low-income \nchildren.\n  In Ohio alone, CHIP provides insurance to 130,000 children. \nEnrollment is expected to grow over the next couple of years. I have \ntraveled across Ohio in the last few weeks and have met with parents \nand children, doctors and nurses, to discuss CHIP. I have been to \nCincinnati Children's Hospital and Toledo Children's Hospital, \nColumbus's Nationwide Children's Hospital and Cleveland's Rainbow \nChildren's Hospital. This morning, I was in Mahoning Valley in \nBoardman, a suburb of Youngstown, at the Akron Children's Hospital. \nMore than 6,000 children in Mahoning Valley rely on CHIP for care.\n  I met with Ericka Flaherty, a Youngstown parent whose children could \nlose comprehensive coverage if we don't extend CHIP now. Her son Chase \nwas born prematurely, born at 27 weeks. He was immediately diagnosed \nwith a number of chronic conditions, including a heart defect, chronic \nlung disease, and asthma. Chase spent more than 4 months in neonatal \ncare, and, thanks to outstanding doctors at Akron Children's Hospital, \nhe is alive and growing today. But he needs many routine medical \nvisits--visits his family simply can't afford. His parents work, but \nthey simply can't afford to treat his conditions, including visits to \nlung specialists, neurologists, an eye specialist, and the regular \nhospital checkup every 2 months. Without CHIP, Ericka would face \nsignificant financial hurdles in getting Chase the care he needs.\n  I also met with Jessica Miller of Lisbon, a community just south of \nMahoning County, during this roundtable. Her youngest son, Payton, was \ndiagnosed with a serious respiratory condition. He had to be life-\nflighted to Akron Children's Hospital to receive care when he couldn't \nbreathe. He has been diagnosed with type 1 juvenile diabetes. His \ngrandmother joined us. Jessica told me that she is so thankful for \nCHIP, that she gets Payton all the care he needs to treat these \nconditions--care she and her husband Justin would have a hard time \naffording otherwise. Justin is working as a paramedic. He was called \nout and couldn't be at our meeting today. Justin is full time in \nnursing school. They are making something of their lives. I don't want \nthem to be anxious about the health care of their children.\n\n  Throughout Ohio, I hear the same thing: Providing health insurance to \nchildren like Chase and Payton isn't just the right thing to do, it is \nthe smart thing to do. It means children do better in school. They feel \nbetter when they are in school. They miss fewer days in school because \nthey get preventive care because their health care needs are taken care \nof.\n  CHIP has been around 18, almost 20 years. It has always been \nbipartisan. If we follow these children later in life, we see they have \nhigher rates of going to college and higher earnings than non-CHIP kids \nwho don't have insurance. By all kinds of very quantifiable \nmeasurements, CHIP is not just good for those families, it is not just \nthe right thing to do to continue to fund CHIP over 4 years, it is also \nthe smart thing to do for our country.\n  Together with more than 40 of my colleagues, I introduced the \nProtecting & Retaining Our Children's Health Insurance Program--PRO-\nCHIP--Act, which is a clean 4-year extension of funding for CHIP. PRO-\nCHIP would protect the Pediatric Quality Measures Program and provide \nfunding to sustain this program through 2019.\n  It would also extend the Performance Incentive Program, which \nprovides bonus payments to States that help increase Medicaid \nenrollment among children, because if we provide insurance for low-\nincome children, they are going to do better, and society is going to \ndo better. They are less likely to end up in the emergency room for \nsomething much more serious. For instance, for a child without \ninsurance who has an earache, the mother and father think that it is \ngoing to cost a lot of money to go to the doctor and that maybe it will \njust get better, they wait a week. Into the second week, the pain is \nworse. The child can't sleep. The child cries. They eventually go to \nthe emergency room, which costs a lot more money than going to the \ndoctor's office, with the possibility that the child has had hearing \nloss. That is just one example of why we want to provide insurance and \nget them into the doctor early rather than waiting until later.\n  PRO-CHIP has been endorsed by every children's hospital in Ohio, the \nAssociation of Children's Hospitals, virtually every children's \nhospital, I believe, in the country, and other national groups--the \nMarch of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children's \nHospital Association, and Families USA, all of which want a clean CHIP. \nAll of them want a 4-year extension for all the reasons we talked \nabout.\n  More than 1,500 organizations from across the country--including more \nthan 75 groups from Ohio and a number from Oklahoma, the Presiding \nOfficer's State--have written to Congress asking us to ``take action as \nsoon as possible to provide a four-year funding extension for CHIP.''\n  Groups, including the Urban Institute, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment \nand Access Commission, and the Bipartisan Policy Center, have all noted \nthe importance of the current CHIP program.\n  The Urban Institute estimated that an additional 1.1 million children \nwill become uninsured if separate CHIP coverage were eliminated. Again, \nthese are sons and daughters of parents who have jobs--jobs that don't \nprovide insurance and jobs that don't pay enough that they can afford \ninsurance. This would be a 40-percent increase, if this were to happen, \nin the number of uninsured children in the United States relative to \nthe number projected under the ACA with the continuation of CHIP.\n  The Bipartisan Policy Center has called for extending CHIP for more \nthan just the 2 years, but note what they say when calling for a CHIP \nextension: ``Two years does not provide sufficient time for state and \nfederal elected officials and agencies to address major programmatic \nchanges sought by policymakers on both sides of the aisle and at both \nlevels of government.''\n  Support for CHIP has always been bipartisan. Senator Hatch, \nRepublican from Utah; Senator Kennedy, Democrat from Massachusetts; a \nnumber of us on the Energy and Commerce Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives back in 1997, Republicans and Democrats alike; and \nChairman Bilirakis and I and others helped to write this legislation \nwhich has been successful at bringing the uninsured rate for children \ndown by more than 50 percent. I am encouraged that Members of both \nparties have shown a willingness to come together. Senate Democrats \nwill have a hard time supporting any plan that doesn't extend CHIP for \na full 4 years.\n  I want to support the sustainable growth rate. I helped write the \noriginal one. I have supported it for 20 years. We shouldn't be doing \nit like this on a temporary 1- or 2-year basis. This is finally going \nto get done right, but we don't do that and then leave out the children \nby only providing 2 years.\n  Parents like Ericka and Jessica face enough uncertainty with their \nchildren's health. Most of us in this body are parents, and a number of \nus are grandparents. Most of us, because we dress like this and we are \nSenators and have good insurance provided by taxpayers--we may have \nanxiety about our children and our grandchildren's health, but we don't \nhave anxiety about their insurance and their ability to go to hospitals \nand doctors and specialists to get care. Certainly, we are anxious \nabout our children and all the things that could happen, but our \nanxiety doesn't reach into the whole sphere of worrying about how to \nprovide insurance for children.\n  Ericka and Jessica can't be anything but anxious when they hear that \nCHIP could end, and they understand that it should be 4 years. CHIP \ngives parents like them peace of mind that they will be able to get \ntheir children the care they need without bankrupting those families. \nWe need to make sure these parents continue to have that peace of mind \nwith a 4-year extension. The PRO-CHIP legislation we have introduced in \nthe Senate with almost four dozen cosponsors makes sure those kids \ndon't lose critical coverage by saying no to any deal that doesn't fund \nCHIP for the full 4 years.\n\n[[Page S1557]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/03/16/senate-section/article/S1557-1", "month": "03", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
