Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now observe a moment of silence for the victims of the Orlando \nattack.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senate will now observe a moment of silence for the victims of \nthe Orlando attack.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, above this Capitol, the American flag \nflies at half-staff--a symbol of national sorrow for lives taken far \ntoo soon, a symbol of national solidarity for families left behind \nplunged into despair.\n  ISIL claims that the terrorist who committed this horrific act is one \nof the ``soldiers of the caliphate.'' Our intelligence community will \nwork to establish whether this terrorist was directed or inspired by \nISIL. Either way, I will call him what he really is: a coward, a \nmurderer who claimed allegiance to a brutal group that crucifies \nchildren and beheads women.\n  This terrorist sought to spread fear and sadness and suffering. Yet, \neven amidst the horror, he couldn't destroy our common bonds of \nhumanity. Every act of compassion, every outstretched arm to a friend, \nevery calming word to a stranger--a response to his cruel ideology and \na reminder of who we are as Americans.\n  Let us recognize each act of heroism that night, and let us never \nforget the debts we owe to first responders--the men and women who rush \ntoward danger and put their lives on the line for victims they never \nmet.\n  Local law enforcement will continue working with the FBI to determine \nthe exact nature of this crime. We will soon find out more details. We \nwill learn, for instance, whether this attack was ISIL directed or \ninspired. Whether this terrorist was in communication with ISIL in \nRaqqa or simply following tactics set forth in Dabiq, ISIL's online \nmagazine, it leads to a larger point. It is no longer an open, \nanalytical question whether the followers of ISIL and other Islamic \nterrorist groups will attempt to strike us here in the West--they have, \nand they will continue to do so.\n  We need to do what we can to fight back so we can prevent more of \nthese atrocities. That is exactly why, for instance, the Senate needs \nto be briefed on the President's counter-ISIL campaign. Understanding \nthe President's plan with respect to ISIL is critical, especially given \nthat the war in Iraq and Syria will outlive the life of his \nadministration. That is why we have been asking the administration for \nbriefings on his strategy for a very long time. I expect this will now \nhappen very soon.\n  We will also be receiving a briefing on the Orlando attack this \nWednesday, but today is a day for sorrow and remembrance. We saw the \nface of evil this weekend, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with \nfellow Americans this afternoon. We grieve for the victims, and we say \nthis to their families and to\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\nOrlando: You are not alone.

Madam President, on one final matter, I wish to say a \nfew words about a colleague we lost this past weekend.\n  George Voinovich was the oldest of six children and, until his late \nteens, an aspiring doctor. Then he realized he didn't get along with \nthe scientists, so he joined the Boy Scouts. He got involved in student \ngovernment, and he told his friends that one day he would become mayor \nand Governor.\n  He was right. This is the guy voters chose to turn around Cleveland \nafter a wrenching fiscal crisis. Mayor Voinovich came to office with a \nsimple motto: ``Together We Can Do It.'' And together they did. Debts \nwere paid down, jobs were added, and slowly the buckle of the Rust Belt \nbecame comeback city.\n  His success propelled him to the Governor's mansion, where he served \ntwo terms, and then to the U.S. Senate, where he served another two \nterms. Here in the Senate, he was at the forefront of a number of \nimportant policy debates. He was an advocate for more efficient and \neffective government. He was an advocate for an ``all of the above'' \nenergy approach. And this son of Eastern European immigrants cited his \nwork to help spearhead two rounds of NATO expansion as one of his \nproudest achievements. ``[When NATO's Secretary General] officially \nannounced the decision to invite Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, Slovakia, and Slovenia,'' he recalled, ``this was truly one of \nthe most thrilling days of my tenure as a Senator.'' Senator Voinovich \nhad a storied political career that took him from Cleveland, to \nColumbus, to Washington, and around the world. All along, he kept \nhimself guided by his Catholic faith and anchored by his family.\n  He ultimately retired to spend more time with the people who really \nmattered. At the top of that list was the woman who made him whole. If \nyou don't think storybook romances can start at a Cleveland Young \nRepublicans Club, then you didn't know George and Janet Voinovich. \nGeorge and Janet were best friends, they were political confidantes, \nand they were deeply in love. Here in Washington, you could find them \nstrolling to the Capitol for work or to St. Joe's for mass. When Janet \ncame to visit the office, George would greet her with a kiss and a hug. \nWhen the Voinoviches flew back to Cleveland, which was most weekends, \nthey would hold hands and say a prayer across the aisle to prepare for \ntakeoff. And when it was wheels down, Janet would put Ohio's senior \nSenator to work on their modest home in Cleveland. They purchased that \nhouse in the 1970s in the same working-class neighborhood where George \nwas raised. They spent the rest of their lives together in the same \nhouse, but they never got around to installing an air-conditioner. \n``Too expensive,'' George said.\n  George Voinovich was known for many things in his decades of public \nservice. He was honest, he was plainspoken, he was loyal to those who \nworked for him, and, yes, he was frugal. Janet may not have appreciated \nit when the heat waves hit, but these are qualities that served him \nwell in office.\n  When asked about his legacy, Senator Voinovich said he just wanted to \nknow he had touched people's lives and made things better. The mark of \nhis impact across his city and across his State is clear enough to see. \nThere is the Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio \nUniversity, the Voinovich Trade Center in Columbus, the Voinovich \natrium at Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the George V. \nVoinovich Bridge. The bridge named for a man known for building bridges \nof his own went dark in his honor last night.\n  The city of Cleveland, the State of Ohio, and the citizens of our \ncountry have lost an outstanding public servant. Many of us have lost a \ngood friend. The Senate marks his passing with sorrow. We will keep \nJanet and the rest of the Voinovich family in our thoughts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3814-1"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, before I start my remarks on the subject \nof the day, I wish to speak about another subject of the day, as \nSenator McConnell has indicated, George Voinovich. He was a fine man. \nHe died yesterday morning. He was a colleague and a friend. He passed \naway at his home in Cleveland, which Senator McConnell talked about. He \nwas one of the most experienced public servants with whom I have \nserved. His career in public service began 53 years ago as Ohio's \nassistant attorney general. From there, he served as a member of the \nOhio House of Representatives, county auditor, county commissioner, \nLieutenant Governor, mayor of Cleveland, Governor of Ohio, and then in \n1999 he brought his wealth of experience to the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Voinovich was well regarded for his preparation and hard \nwork. He was courageous. George was one of the few Senate Republicans \nto speak out against the unpaid-for Bush tax cuts because he thought \nthey were wrong. He questioned the strategy of the war in Iraq, which \nhe also thought was wrong. George Voinovich was right on both of those \nissues, and the other Republicans were wrong.\n  Senator Voinovich voted to repeal don't ask, don't tell and bucked \nthe rest of his party by voting for background checks on all firearm \npurchases at gun shows. Again, he was right, and his colleagues were \nwrong.\n  Today the Senate mourns the Voinovich family.\n  I send my personal condolences to George's wife of 54 years, Janet; \ntheir children, George, Betsy, and Peter; and their seven \ngrandchildren. He was a great Senator. He will be missed by his loved \nones, the people of Ohio, and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3814-3"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3814-S3815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MASS SHOOTING IN ORLANDO\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, everyone is in a state of shock and \nsadness today, following the worst mass shooting in modern American \nhistory.\n  The facts continue to develop--I had a long conversation with the FBI \nthis morning--but we do know this much. A shooter pledging allegiance \nto ISIS opened fire at an LGBT locality in Orlando, FL, killing 49 \npeople and leaving dozens seriously injured. This was an act of terror \nin every sense of the word. This was an attack on the LGBT community \nand all of America.\n  My heart goes out to the victims, their families, especially those \nwho were killed and wounded, and to the many first responders who were \non the scene where one police officer was wounded.\n  I hope every Member of the House and Senate had time for quiet \nreflection yesterday to ask what we could have done to prevent this \ntragedy. I had time to think about it. I am heartsick. I am basically \nsick by our inaction. It is shameful that the U.S. Senate has done \nnothing--nothing--to stop these mass shootings. Is this what we want \nfor America? I don't think so.\n  Do we want to live in a country where someone who has sworn \nallegiance to ISIS can walk into a store, buy assault weapons and \nexplosives, and murder dozens of Americans in a club or at a school? I \ndon't think we do. Is that a country where we want to live? Because \nthat is the country where we live now, thanks to the National Rifle \nAssociation and their cowardly supporters in Congress.\n  Last December, the senior Senator from California proposed \nlegislation that would prevent FBI terror suspects from purchasing \nfirearms and explosives. All but one Republican voted against the \nFeinstein amendment. That means that as of today, FBI terror suspects \ncan walk into a gun store and legally purchase assault weapons and \nexplosives. It is beyond me how these same Republicans go home knowing \nthey voted to let FBI terror suspects continue to buy assault weapons.\n  Senate Republicans have voted against expanding background checks, \nlimits on the size of ammunition clips, and the assault weapons ban. \nHow can these same Republicans campaign for reelection in good \nconscience, knowing\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\nthey voted to block every sensible bill to address gun violence? Not \nsome of them, all of them.\n  For example, how can the junior Senator from Florida--who all of a \nsudden has an interest in running for reelection--how can he speak of \nrunning for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy \nassault weapons and explosives? That is how he voted. The junior \nSenator has voted against every gun safety measure. He was quoted as \nsaying: Well, with what happened yesterday, I might reconsider. He \nbetter reconsider his gun votes. He voted against background checks, \nassault weapons ban, and against legislation limiting the size of \nammunition clips.\n  I ask again: Is this what we want for America? Mass shooting after \nmass shooting, and each new attack, it seems, is worse than the \nprevious one.\n  We still have much to learn about the Orlando shooting, but we know \none thing for sure. Congress is failing to do anything to prevent these \nmass killings--anything. Why? Because of Republican obstruction. \nBecause of Republican obstruction, we are doing nothing. We are failing \nevery one of the people killed on Sunday, their families, the whole \nState of Florida--the whole country. We are failing the families. We \nare failing everyone who has died in these mass shootings--and there \nare thousands of them--and those who have lost loved ones to mass \nshootings--thousands of them, I repeat; the injured, tens of thousands.\n  As President Obama said yesterday, ``To actively do nothing is a \ndecision as well.'' And my Republican colleagues have made that \ndecision: doing nothing.\n  It is time again to try to stop the plague of gun violence. We have a \nresponsibility as lawmakers to do what we can to prevent these \nshootings, to enact commonsense reforms--nothing radical--that have \nproven to stop these attacks and save lives.\n  We should start by closing the loophole that allows terrorists to \nlegally purchase weapons and explosives. Remember, everyone, we voted \non this. Everyone in this Chamber should be able to agree that a \nsuspected terrorist shouldn't have guns. Is it more than common sense? \nI don't think so.\n  We should do something to expand background checks, ensuring that \nterror suspects and criminals don't slip through the cracks, and we \nshould do something to limit the size of weapon magazines and clips. \nThere is no reason for gun stores to sell these clips that are that \nbig, magazines or drums designed for the mass killing of human beings. \nThat is what they are made for--no other purpose. People don't hunt \nwith them.\n  Our Nation can no longer ignore the fact that every day Americans are \nbeing gunned down in cold blood. We can no longer ignore the will of \nthe people. We shouldn't, at least. We can no longer ignore the will of \nthe people.\n  The overwhelming majority of voters support these proposals. \nAccording to a December poll by one of the foremost polling agencies in \nAmerica, nearly 90 percent of Americans are in favor of expanded \nbackground checks. It doesn't matter what State you go to. This was a \nnationwide poll. In Nevada, Massachusetts, Iowa--it doesn't matter \nwhere you go. More than 80 percent of Americans want to close so-called \nterror loopholes, preventing people on terror watch lists from \npurchasing firearms. I see my friend from Florida behind me. Of course \nthey care, as much as anyone, if not more, today.\n  Yet, in spite of the public's demand for action, Senate Republicans \ncontinue to cower--cower--before the NRA and the Gun Owners of America. \nThe NRA is bad--really bad--but Gun Owners of America is even worse \nthan bad. These two organizations are competing, seeing just how \nextreme they can be in pushing for more guns and fewer protections. And \nI know, after the statement I am making today, they will send out these \nfundraising calls: Reid is trying to take away our guns. Send us some \nmoney.\n  These two organizations are competing to see how extreme they can be \nin pushing for more guns and fewer protections. Congressional \nRepublicans are content just to go along. Republicans are so terrified \nof the extreme right that they refuse to pass legislation supported by \nthe vast majority of their own constituents. The NRA and the Gun Owners \nof America mean more to them than the people they represent.\n  Do you know what terrifies the American people? It is not the NRA. It \nis not the Gun Owners of America. Mass shootings scare the American \npeople. Innocent victims being gunned down at nightclubs and holiday \nparties and schools and movie theaters, that is what scares the \nAmerican people.\n  Republicans need to find the backbone to stand up to groups like the \nNRA and Gun Owners of America. Senate Republicans are stalling \nimportant mental health legislation because they are afraid to talk \nabout gun safety measures. Not only are they stalling, but Senate \nRepublicans--led by the assistant Republican leader--are even \nthreatening to include a provision that weakens the FBI's current \nbackground check system--which isn't much, to be honest with you--and \nto weaken it more would be speaking volumes.\n  We don't need to hear any more of the gun lobby's talking points \nabout how more guns are the answer to what is going on in America or \nhiring security guards will solve our Nation's scourge of gun violence. \nThe Pulse nightclub in Orlando had security, and there was reportedly \nan armed, off-duty police officer on the scene, but even that didn't \nprevent this tragedy.\n  Instead of pushing for more guns, maybe it is time to make it harder \nfor terrorists and criminals to get guns. It is time for Congress to do \nsomething to stop the mass slaughter that is being carried out in our \ncommunities. How else can we describe it? Are 50 dead people--49 plus \nthe killer--49 dead people--is that enough to get our attention? The \n50-odd who were injured, and somebody may be paralyzed, is that enough \nto get our attention?\n  It is time for Congress to do something--something--to stop this mass \nslaughter that is being carried out in our communities. Going forward, \nDemocrats are going to continue to support and continue to push these \nsolutions to our Nation's gun violence epidemic, and we are going to, \nas soon as we can, force a vote on this terror loophole. We are going \nto do this as soon as possible. There is no excuse for allowing \nsuspected terrorists to buy guns.\n  There is much we can do but not if Republicans aren't serious about \naddressing these problems, and historically it has been proven they do \nnot care.\n  I hope Republicans will find the courage, like George Voinovich, to \nhelp us pass meaningful legislation to protect the American people. By \nthe way, George Voinovich was a good Republican.\n  Madam President, will the Chair announce the business for the rest of \nthe day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3814-4"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, I have just returned from the command \ncenter of the emergency operations center, a temporary one that has \nbeen set up in the middle of South Orange Avenue, very close to the \nPulse nightclub, not far from the hospital where so many of the victims \nhave been taken, where 9 of the victims died in the care of the \ndoctors, and where there are up to 50 people, some of whom are still \nfighting for their lives.\n  Needless to say, Orlando is shocked. We didn't know a place that \nsometimes\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nis called the happiest place on Earth could be one of the saddest \nplaces on Earth. Indeed, the morning's Orlando Sentinel, the entire \nfront page is dedicated to a statement by the paper entitled ``Our \nCommunity Will Heal.'' Will our community heal? Well, certainly, in \nwhat we see with the long lines snaking around the block at the blood \ndonation center, where it is literally going around what would be the \nlength of 2 blocks, and where there are people standing in the hot Sun \nwith umbrellas to donate blood, that says something about how the \ncommunity will heal. Indeed, when we had our office in Orlando opened \non Sunday, the kinds of calls expressing grief and shock and just \ndisbelief, along with the messages of comfort, has been quite a \ncontrast to the 95 percent of the hundreds and hundreds of calls the \nOrlando office has received today. Ninety-five percent of those calls \nhave been hateful.\n  What does that say about us as a nation? Will we, in fact, heal? What \ndoes it say about us as a nation deep inside? Have we lost the \nteachings in almost all the major religions--clearly in the Holy \nScriptures of the Old Testament and clearly in the New Testament, as \nwell as in the Koran. You will recognize these words if I say it in the \nold English: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Putting \nit in modern English, it means to treat others as you would want to be \ntreated. Yet what we find is that in our society today there are folks \nwho want to divide instead of unify, and this killer is a good example.\n\n  I have spent two days with the FBI. I have been on the phone. I have \ntalked to the Secretary of Homeland Security. I have talked to our \nintelligence community. It is this Senator's opinion that once the dots \nare completely connected--and they are being rapidly connected. The FBI \nis doing a great job. They are the lead in Orlando.\n  By the way, talking about something good, what about the cooperation \nand coordination, which has been almost seamless, among local, State, \nand Federal Government officials, all represented down there in the \ncommand center, all being represented as a number of us went in front \nof the assembled cameras? It seems that is a good thing. That is unity. \nThat is how we do things in America.\n  Yet, as the dots are being connected, we will find out that, yes, \nthis shooter was ISIS-inspired--and that is a whole set of issues--and \nhow are we going to protect ourselves in the future? But we are also \ngoing to find that this shooter was inspired by hatred, and we are \ngoing to find that this hatred was directed, as his father already said \nin interviews, toward the gay community.\n  So here again, we have another terrible tragedy. I have had a number \nof calls from my fellow Senators. One of those calls came from Richard \nBlumenthal. He is from Connecticut. He has reason to be sensitive about \nthis because of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20 \nchildren and some 6 adults were gunned down needlessly. Maybe that was \na mental case. Maybe part of this one in Orlando is a mental case. But \nit is driven by hatred, maybe through ISIS, a hatred of America and of \na free society being willing to be able to speak what you want without \nfear of persecution, or maybe it is a hatred about a group of people. \nIt is exactly the opposite of what is taught in all of the Scriptures.\n  So as we heal in Orlando, it will take a while. You can imagine those \nfamilies of the ones who have been lost. You can imagine the families \ndown in the Orlando Health hospital right now, grieving, hoping, and \npraying that those victims fighting for their lives are going to make \nit.\n  So America, we are going to have to dig down deep and find out who we \nreally are. You know, I really know who we are. We are a people with a \ncharacter that is compassionate, generous, kind, and respectful. We as \nAmericans are ladies and gentlemen. We can express ourselves as has \nbeen the tradition on the floor of this Senate in the heat of political \ndebate. We can sharply differ, but we can be respectful of the other \nfellow's point of view. That is America, and until we finally come to \nthe conclusion and insist that this aberrant behavior be stopped--until \nthat happens--we will still be grieving.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida. His State \nhas suffered an unspeakable tragedy. It is something that unfortunately \nbrings together two terrible biases--one against the LGBT community and \nthe other a religiously based radical attack inspired by ISIS at that \nnightclub. They all came together. To the Senator and to everyone from \nFlorida, our deepest, deepest sympathies go to you.\n  It was, of course, something that was understood in Massachusetts. He \nmentioned the Tsarnaev brothers as an inspiration to him. They struck \non Patriots Day in 2013 in the United States. Mohamed Atta and the \nother nine hijackers were in Boston when they hijacked the two planes \nfrom Logan International Airport. So we know those people are out \nthere. We know that their hate-filled message is intended to kill \ninnocent Americans, and we saw it once again. Unfortunately, the target \nwas a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\n  But for us, I think we have to learn from this. This man had been \ninvestigated as a terrorist suspect, and yet we are blocked--the \nSenator from Florida and I and others--from passing a law that would \nprevent anyone on a terror watch list from buying a gun in these United \nStates. It is not against the law. The National Rifle Association has \nenough power here on the floor of the Senate to prohibit someone who is \non a terror watch list from buying guns in the United States of \nAmerica. We need another vote on that issue here in the Senate. We need \nto give the protections to the American people for them to know that \nsomeone on a terror watch list cannot buy a gun in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We also have to ban these military-style assault weapons, like the \nAR-15, which are the guns of choice for those who seek to inflict mass \ncasualties on civilians. These are not weapons that belong on the \nstreets of our country. They belong in combat overseas, not in our \ncommunities. They don't belong in Newtown, they don't belong in San \nBernardino, and they don't belong in Orlando. They don't belong in our \nstreets or in our schools or in a civilized society, yet we cannot ban \nthese weapons from being sold in the United States of America.\n  We have to prevent any known or suspected terrorist from buying \nfirearms, and we have to make it impossible, as well, for them to buy \nthese assault weapons. This is our challenge now.\n  Once again, we are warned. Once again, we are told what the weapon of \nchoice is. Once again, we know that they are going to target us if we \nmake it easy for them to access these weapons. How many warnings do we \nneed?\n  The NRA really should stand for ``not relevant anymore'' in American \npolitics. They should not control the agenda here on the floor of the \nSenate. We should be able to ban people on the terror watch list from \nbuying guns. We should be able to ban these assault weapons from being \nsold at all inside of our country. The Senate leadership should stop \nbanning a vote here on the Senate floor on ensuring that we do the \nresearch at the CDC on this relationship between mental health and the \nuse of guns within our society.\n  The bill that I have introduced calls for $10 million a year for the \nnext 6 years. We can't even get the money to research gun violence in \nthe United States of America.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. We can change. We can learn these \nlessons, but we can't wait any longer to put those commonsense gun laws \non the books. We cannot wait any longer to make our streets safer.\n  So let's close the gun show loophole that allows anyone to go into \none of these Kmarts full of killing machines and buy a gun without a \nbackground check. Let's close the loophole that allows domestic abusers \nto buy guns. Let's close the loophole that allows straw purchasers to \nbuy guns and flood our streets with them. Let's repeal the Protection \nof Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and take away the gun manufacturers' \nimmunity from civil liability. PLCAA should stand for ``protecting \nlives, creating arms accountability,'' not protecting these arms \nmanufacturers from liability if these guns are used to kill innocent \npeople in our society.\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\n  So in the coming days and weeks, you can be assured that the National \nRifle Association will be opposed to even these limited commonsense gun \nmeasures. The NRA has had a stranglehold over Congress for far too \nlong. It is time to end its reign of power. It is time to end its \nviselike grip on the safety and security of our Nation. Those in \nCongress who do not support these commonsense measures are siding with \nthose forces that make it easier for these massacres to happen. That is \nthe bottom line of where we are. Now is the time to stand up for the \nfamilies of Columbine, of Newtown, of Aurora, of Chattanooga, of \nCharleston, of San Bernardino, and now of Orlando, and of all of the \ncities across our country, which are saying: Enough is enough.\n  I was so proud on Saturday to march in the Boston Gay Pride Parade. \nIt was a joyous occasion where love, community, and social justice were \nall celebrated with a passion and a real sense of progress. But as I \nwoke up the next morning, I saw again how an individual armed with guns \nand fueled by extremist ideology can fuel violence and terror.\n  We are a nation of hope, not hatred. After this tragedy, after this \ndeplorable attack, let's denounce hate in all of its forms. Let's stand \nwith the LGBT community and raise our voices with dignity, equality, \nand love. Let's say no to the rhetoric of hate that demonizes our \nfriends and neighbors because of their faith, sexual orientation, or \nbecause of their country of origin. Let's recommit to justice and \nmoving progress forward.\n  The American people are begging, pleading for this institution to \nenact commonsense gun safety measures. My hope is that the Senate can \nsucceed where it has recently failed and muster the political will and \ncourage to deliver badly needed reform of our gun laws. Let's work \ntogether to do this and to help prevent yet another mass shooting in \nour country.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, it is good to see the Presiding Officer \nthis afternoon.\n  This past weekend, Saturday, my wife and I went to New York City at \nthe invitation of one of our sons. We visited the 9/11 Memorial in New \nYork, literally erected on the site of the World Trade Center. I must \nconfess it was emotionally charging, very saddening, and at the same \ntime uplifting and inspiring.\n  I never imagined that within the space of less than 24 hours we would \nsee dozens of our young have their lives taken from them.\n  I remember walking through the 9/11 Memorial--and for those who have \nnot been, I urge you to go. For those who have, you probably remember \ngoing through parts of the memorial and literally seeing the faces of \n3,000 men, women, and some children whose lives were snuffed out that \nday some 15 years ago. Every one of them had moms and dads. They had \ngrandparents. A number of them had children, spouses, brothers, \nsisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces. Those families struggle even \ntoday with their loss.\n  The young people who died Saturday night, Sunday morning in a \nnightclub in Orlando, like those many folks whose faces we saw on \nSaturday, also have moms and dads, grandmoms, granddads, brothers, \nsisters, and cousins. Their families are mourning today just like \nothers did 15 years ago.\n  What I want to do is preface my remarks by reaching out across the \nmiles to the families who are mourning, trying to deal with their \nlosses, and let them know that we want to take you in our loving \nembrace. To the best of our ability, we also want to make sure we \ncontinue to take steps in this country to ensure we reduce the \nlikelihood that these kinds of attacks are going to occur and that when \nthey do, if they do, we are better prepared to deal with them.\n  The killer, the man who took the lives of 49 people, demonstrated an \nact of hatred--in part, an act of terrorism but really an act of \nhatred. The question is, What do we do about it? Some would have us \nclose our borders, the ability to come here even on a short-term basis: \nIf you happen to be Muslim, we are going to keep you out. That is \nexactly what ISIS would like for us to do. There are 3.3 million \nMuslims in this country. The idea of somehow turning them against the \nrest of us, that is the kind of thing happening in some parts of \nEurope.\n  Unlike Europe, we are a country where we accept the people who come \nto our shores. We accept them. When you were a stranger in my land, did \nyou take me in? For us, for years, for decades, and for a couple of \ncenturies, the answer has been yes. That doesn't mean we shouldn't very \ncarefully check and test the backgrounds of the people who come here to \nmake sure they are who they say they are, that they are not on a \nterrorist watch list. We have a bunch of those. We want to make sure \nour agencies and our terrorist watch lists are coordinated. We want to \nmake sure our intelligence agencies are in close communication with one \nanother.\n  Part of the goal of ISIS is to make this a clash between the United \nStates and the Muslim population here, 3.3 million people, and around \nthe world. That is not what we should do. We should be smarter than \nthat.\n  One of the things we need to do is to continue the work that was \nbegun from last year--I have said it often, I am going to say it \nagain--to degrade and destroy those who would do us harm. Those who \nwould do us enormous harm are trying to set up a caliphate. They are \nsomehow using their religion, bastardizing their religion, and making \nit say things it doesn't even begin to say.\n  What we need to do is make sure they get no further. The progress \nthat has been made in terms of rolling them back was with the help of a \ncoalition that includes 15 nations--16 nations. We are taking back a \nlot of the land and about to--I hope--take Fallujah and Mosul and \ncontinue there.\n  When ISIS wannabes pop up in other countries, the idea is to work \nwith our coalition in the countries that ISIS is trying to get a \nfoothold in and make sure they are not successful. So it is a little \nlike Whac-a-Mole--but it is not a game--and it is one we want to make \nsure they don't get a chance to get started there.\n  If you look at the amount of money--ISIS used to make a lot of money \nselling oil. They take over oil refineries and oilfields, and they sell \nthe oil on the black market. We have greatly diminished their ability \nto do that and greatly diminished their ability to make money. In some \ncases, we have figured out where they are keeping their cash stored, \nand we have gone in and destroyed literally hundreds of millions of \ndollars in their currency that they were harboring.\n  There are a number of people coming from around the world to go to \nthat part of the world--Iraq, Syria--who want to be ISIS volunteers. It \nis greatly diminished from what it was. It is down from 2,000 a month \nthis time maybe last year to something that is just a fraction of that.\n  In the United States not that long ago, early this year, maybe six \npeople a month were going from the United States to the Middle East to \nbe part of ISIS, and they are down to maybe one per month. It is still \none too many, but we are headed in the right direction.\n  The people who are being radicalized here by ISIS, ISIS is not \nsending people here to radicalize them. ISIS is basically trying to do \nthis through social media, to use the Internet, and they are pretty \ngood at it, but one of the things that will make them not so effective \nis once we demonstrate--and I think we are on our way to doing that--\nthat ISIS is a losing team. The people who are apparently claiming \ncredit for it--or the killer in this case who killed all of our folks \nover the weekend, he was looking for a winning team. He is not a person \nwho had a lot of wins in his life, and he wanted to be a part of a \nwinning team. Our challenge is to make sure that anybody who is looking \nfor a winning team or thinks they can, through radicalization, attacks, \nand terrorism--we need to make sure they know they are barking up the \nwrong tree.\n  ISIS is a losing team. One of the ways we can do that is--the \nPresiding Officer along with me and a number of others on the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs have been all over this \nissue for years. It led to the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We continue to stay right on this issue, and we will probably \nbe doing that for as long as any of us are in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\n  Part of what we should be doing, aside from degrading and destroying \nISIS--if we are smart, one of the things we need to do is reach out to \nthe Muslim community in this country, unlike what has happened in \nplaces in Europe, where you have a lot of Muslim folks who are all \nsegregated. They are not part of the culture. They are not welcomed so \nmuch in those countries. One of the things about us in America is we \nare a melting pot. We have been a melting pot forever. When I was a \nstranger in your land, did you take me in? For years, we said the \nanswer is yes.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has asked for authorization to be \nable to create our community partnership, to reach out to Muslim \ncommunities across America, to meet with parents, with young people, \nnot so young people, face the community, and make it clear they are a \npart of this country, make sure they say to their own people, their own \nyoung people: Don't do this. Don't do what this guy did over the \nweekend in Orlando. That is not part of our religion. It is not part of \ntheir religion. Don't go there.\n  The third thing we can do and ought to be doing is to strengthen our \ndefenses at home.\n  We had an active shooter situation for hours into the wee hours of \nSaturday evening to Sunday morning, an active shooter situation. It is \nnot the first active shooter situation we have faced. They are not easy \nto deal with.\n  One of the things the Department of Homeland Security can do, is \ndoing, and ought to be doing more of, if given the resources, is doing \nactive shooter training in police agencies all over the United States. \nIf they ever face a situation such as this, they know what to do and \nthey are able to be effective and save lives.\n  The other thing I would mention in terms of resources, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, we put a fair amount of resources toward a \nfusion center. Sometimes people used to call them confusion centers, \nbut actually they are a fusion center. They give the ability to State \nand local law enforcement agencies to work with the Feds to better \nensure that information gathered locally works its way up the channel, \nup through the chain of command, to be shared nationally with other \nStates and with the Federal Government, and to make sure the converse \nis true, to the extent that we gather useful information at the \nnational level, international level, that we bring it down and we \nfunnel it back into individual States through fusion centers so they \nact on that actionable intelligence.\n  We need to work with energy in this regard. We need to work with a \nsense of urgency. We need to make sure, as we go through the \nappropriations process in the Senate in the days and weeks ahead, that \nwe are putting resources, financial resources, where they need to go.\n  A number of folks have asked me in interviews yesterday and today: \nWhat should we be doing about gun control? How does all of this relate \nto gun control? The answer is, I am not sure how this is going to \naffect the way we view guns. I believe in the Second Amendment right. I \nam sure the Presiding Officer does, a former Army colonel, retired \ncolonel. I am a retired Navy captain, a Vietnam veteran. My dad was a \nchief petty officer in World War II and served for a long time as a \nchief petty officer in the Reserves after that. My dad was a hunter. He \ncame from a family of hunters and taught me to be a hunter and a \nfisherman. One of the proudest possessions I own is a shotgun my \ngrandfather gave me before he died. When I was in the Navy, I used to \ngo back on leave from Southeast Asia, go visit my parents near \nClearwater, FL, and stay in a guest bedroom. In the guest bedroom, \nunder my bed where I slept, were guns. I opened the closet in the \nguestroom for my clothes, and there were guns. My father, in addition \nto being a hunter, actually bought and sold guns. He would basically \nsell them to people he knew. He felt they were not people who were \nmentally unstable or people who were felons, but he believed in the \nSecond Amendment right. My dad also believed in common sense.\n  My dad is now deceased, but if he were alive and he heard that people \nwho are on terrorism watch lists can literally buy weapons, including \nassault weapons, automatic weapons, he would say: That doesn't make any \nsense. If he found out we could go to a gun show, and a person who is \nmentally unstable, has a history of mental illness, and maybe someone \nwho is a convicted felon could actually walk into a gun show and go to \na federally registered gun dealer, be denied the ability to purchase an \nassault weapon, and then go to the next table over with someone who is \nnot a federally registered gun dealer and purchase the same weapon they \nhad just been denied, in terms of what makes sense and doesn't make \nsense to my dad and frankly to me--his son--those situations don't make \na whole lot of sense. Those are areas we ought to agree on.\n  One of our colleagues, as the Presiding Officer knows, Senator Enzi \nfrom Wyoming, likes to talk about the 80-20 rule. It is a great rule. \nIt says there is about 80 percent of the stuff we agree on and maybe 20 \npercent of an issue we don't agree on. What we should do is focus on \nthe 80 percent we agree on. My hope is--most Americans get it, in terms \nof making sure that folks who are on the terrorist watch list don't \nhave access to buy weapons. They get it. I think they also get the idea \nthat this gun show loophole is something that ought to be closed as \nwell.\n  I close by saying, in a sense, this is a test of our character as a \nnation. I said earlier our tradition has always been that we welcome \npeople from disparate places, in some cases people fleeing oppression, \nlack of freedom, lack of religious opportunities and freedom of \nworship. That is the way we operate as a country.\n  You don't open and read the Constitution--it doesn't say Matthew 25 \nbecause we decided we are not going to establish a religion here. If we \ndid, Matthew 25 says: When I was hungry, did you feed me? When I was \nthirsty, did you give me to drink? When I was naked, did you clothe me? \nWhen I was a stranger in your land, did you take me in?\n  I think we have a moral obligation to the least of these, including \nthose who are fleeing oppression in other places looking for an \nopportunity for a new life. I think we have a moral obligation to \nwelcome them, but we have a moral obligation to those who live here, to \nmake sure that as we welcome people from other places, we do not \nimperil them by those who arrive from other shores.\n  The last thing I would say is, we need the kind of leadership in this \nbody that seeks to really do what it says right over the Presiding \nOfficer's head, where the Presiding Officer is sitting. The Latin \nwords--I don't know a lot of Latin words but ``e pluribus unum''--from \nmany, one. Those are words that we would be wise to remember from this \nday as we go forward.\n  I think that is pretty much what I wanted to say. As this week goes \non, I ask that my colleagues and I find out as much as we can, learn as \nmuch as we can, find out what went right and what went wrong, and do \nmore of what went right. And at the end of the day, let's make sure we \nare true to the values on which this country was built.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank our colleague \nfor his words. I certainly join him in mourning the horrible, tragic \nloss of life this weekend in Orlando. Certainly I am committed, along \nwith all our colleagues, to fighting terror wherever it exists and \nwhomever it targets. This was absolutely horrible.\n  Mr. President, I also rise today in support of a really important \npiece of bipartisan legislation that I have been working on with \nSenator Shaheen. I have introduced it to reauthorize the Small Business \nInnovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Programs--\ntwo vital small business programs in the Federal Government. We have an \nopportunity to accomplish this--to fully reauthorize and improve these \nprograms--in the context of this Defense authorization bill that is on \nthe floor now. I am very hopeful we are going to do that as part of a \nmanagers' package to the bill.\n  These two programs--the Small Business Innovation Research and the \nSmall Business Technology Transfer Programs--are really vital and \nuseful to the success of small businesses directly responsible for \ncreating thousands, tens of thousands of new jobs.\n  By funding small businesses and entrepreneurs in the critical early \nstages\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nof R&D;, these programs allow firms to drive the innovation sector of \nthe economy with new ideas and technologies. Very rarely have \ngovernment programs had such a clear and measurable, positive and \nstimulating effect on the economy.\n  SBIR and STTR are also crucial to Federal agencies as they solve many \nof our biggest science and technology challenges. Giving small, \ninnovative firms access to already appropriated Federal R&D; funding is \na win-win--a win for the small business sector and just as importantly \na win for the taxpayer and those agencies.\n  These programs exist to foster innovation, to facilitate public-\nprivate partnerships, to give firms the funding they need to help 11 \nFederal departments and agencies meet their R&D; needs. These programs \nnot only create jobs, but they also lead to a path for \ncommercialization for many of these businesses, which is absolutely key \nto their success.\n  These programs have been front and center in improving our Nation's \ncapacity to innovate. Over the course of the SBIR Program history from \n1982 to 2014--the last year for which we have numbers--Federal agencies \nhave made more than 152,000 SBIR awards to small businesses to develop \ninnovative technologies, and the total dollar amount awarded--again out \nof existing R&D; budgets--is $42 billion.\n  In 2014 alone, SBIR gave nearly 5,500 Phase I and Phase II awards \nworth about $2.2 billion, and the SBA is currently reporting an average \nof 5,000 awards per year. These awards are directly responsible for \nsome of the most popular technologies that are available to the public \ntoday.\n  For instance, through an SBIR award from the Air Force, we have \ncreated a technology known as LASIK, originally to correct vision for \npilots, but that is a widely used technology to correct vision for all \nAmericans. That was an SBIR success.\n  Military armor has been a regular success of the SBIR Programs. \nArmorWorks is a great example. That created over 350,000 top-of-the-\nline body armor plates worn by U.S. service men and women in the United \nStates.\n  Liftware Spoon--a spoon that stabilizes hand tremors for patients \nwith Parkinson's disease and essential tremor--again is a clear, \nidentifiable, and important SBIR success story.\n  HydroMARK decreases patient discomfort with a minimally invasive \nbreast biopsy procedure. With the HydroMARK, a mammogram is no longer \nnecessary and the surgeon or radiologist can use an ultrasound to \nlocate the tumor. This is a huge innovation that has dramatically \nimproved thousands of women's lives and, again, directly out of SBIR.\n  Bioseal reduces lung collapse rates after lung biopsies.\n  iRobot's Roomba is something I can relate to. It is moving around at \nhome when I am there on the weekend. This is the popular autonomous \nrobotic vacuum cleaner that has reached major commercial success, \nselling over 10 million units. That is directly out of SBIR.\n  These programs we are talking about, which have been so successful, \nare set to expire September 30 of 2017. As many of my colleagues can \nattest, it was a tumultuous process to complete the last \nreauthorization, so we are starting early now so we don't go through \nthat tumultuous process again. Back then--the last reauthorization--\nparticipating agencies and firms had to endure a process that took over \n3 years and 14 short-term extensions. In a bipartisan effort with \nSenator Shaheen, we have been working for the last year to avoid all \nthat and to do this ahead of time so we don't have all of that tumult \nand uncertainty, which saps the effectiveness of the program for a \nsignificant period of time.\n  Reauthorizing these programs this year will ensure stability, foster \nan environment of innovative entrepreneurship, and avoid that \nuncertainty by directing more than $200 billion annually to this R&D; \nfunding to the Nation's small business firms.\n  As chair of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I have made this a \nreal priority. Senator Shaheen, as ranking member, has done the same. \nSo I thank all of our committee members who are solidly behind this \neffort. I also thank so many other Members of the Senate who have been \ncooperative.\n  In the context of this Defense bill, we have cleared our \nreauthorization amendment with the Senate Committee on Armed Services, \nand I want to specifically thank Senators McCain and Reed for their \nleadership. We have cleared it with the Commerce Committee because \nagencies under the jurisdiction of that committee are involved. We have \ncleared it with the HELP Committee. They have the same tangential \nrelationship. We are the authorizing committee, but some agencies \ninvolved are under their jurisdiction. We have cleared it with everyone \nin sight, so that means we have a real opportunity to have this in the \nmanagers' package--which it is, as I speak--and to pass it through the \nDefense bill as a full reauthorization.\n  I am also proud to share that not only will our reauthorization \nannually direct more than $2 billion of Federal R&D; to small firms that \nare most likely to create jobs and commercialize their projects, but it \nwill also establish the Regional SBIR State Collaborative Initiative \nPilot Program to help low-participation States attract R&D; funding for \ntheir businesses.\n  All of this reauthorization is a true consensus effort, so I am \ngrateful to the more than 50 organizations that strongly support it--\namong them the Small Business Technology Council, the National Small \nBusiness Association and the Defense Alliance, and 47 more. It is a \ntrue consensus effort. They all support the effort, as does the \nleadership of SAS; Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions; and the \nCommerce Committee. So it is an important opportunity that we shouldn't \nlet fall through our grasp.\n  Again, I want to stress that reauthorizing this program is an \neffective way to meet national needs while jump-starting entrepreneurs, \ngrowing our economy, and creating jobs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \nconsensus amendment and help ensure that small businesses across the \ncountry can operate with long-term certainty and stability, which this \namendment will provide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, the atrocity that occurred this past \nweekend in Orlando, FL, was an attack on every American, and my deepest \ncondolences are with the victims and the families of this appalling \nattack. I am grateful for our law enforcement and the first responders \nwho bravely put their lives on the line to save others.\n  This attack--the deadliest in American history since 9/11--was \ncarried out by a gunman who pledged allegiance to ISIS. There are 49 \nfamilies who received phone calls this weekend--phone calls we all hope \nwe never receive. There are 49 families who are arranging for funerals \nthis week. They never dreamed they would be put in this position--the \ntragedy, the sorrow of the mothers, the fathers, the aunts, the uncles, \nthe brothers, the sisters, the grandparents, the cousins, and friends \nwho will all be attending funerals this week.\n  Additionally, there are more than 50 families dealing with family \nmembers who were injured, some gravely, who are fighting for their \nlives as I speak.\n  Montana is a long ways away from Orlando, but I can tell you that \nlast night across our State there were vigils in Great Falls, Helena, \nMissoula, Bozeman, Butte, and Billings, MT. We stand united with \nOrlando.\n  This threat of ISIS is continuing to grow each and every day. We need \na strong strategy to destroy the growing threat of Islamic extremism--\nIslamic extremism on our soil as well. President Obama, what is that \nstrategy?\n  We need to aggressively go after radical jihadists who seek to \ndestroy our way of life and disturb the peace in our communities. The \nsenseless hate of ISIS and radical Islam will not defeat us but, \nrather, strengthen our resolve and commitment to freedom.\n  We need to remember that this was an act of terror on American soil, \nthat this is a threat we face from radical Islam and ISIS, and that the \nworst response would be to politicize this and use this tragedy to \nrestrict our constitutional rights and freedoms.\n  We cannot allow dangerous terrorists to hide in our communities. We \nneed to seek them out and ensure they aren't\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\nable to inflict harm on our neighbors, our friends, and our families.\n  May God comfort those who have been profoundly affected by this \ntragedy, and may God protect our men and women who are defending our \ncountry both here and abroad every day. We are a strong nation, and \ntogether we will protect our country and ensure victory over the \nterrorists who want to take away our very way of life here in America.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the junior Senator from Montana. I appreciate his coming to \nthe floor today.\n  I rise today with a heavy heart. Since I first heard the horrible \nnews about the senseless act of terrorism in Orlando, the victims, the \npartners, and the families have been at the center of my thoughts and \nprayers. But thoughts and prayers are not enough. It is long past time \nfor the Senate to come together and have a conversation about what \nsteps need to be taken to put an end to this violence and hatred. We \ncannot continue to be crippled by inaction. The Senate needs to come \ntogether to strengthen our national security.\n  After attacks like Orlando, we hear folks say ``Never again,'' but \nactions really do speak louder than words. It is time that we work \ntogether to try to prevent these senseless acts of terror and violence. \nThat conversation begins with our national security and what needs to \nbe done to keep our families and our communities safe.\n  There are actions we can take right now to bolster our national \nsecurity. There is no question that we must pass legislation that keeps \nguns out of the hands of terrorists. We absolutely do need to secure \nour borders. And we need to continue to crack down on insider threats \nby reforming our security clearance process.\n  Intolerance and hate have no place in this country, and as elected \nleaders, we have a responsibility to ensure that every American can \nlive their life each day free from fear.\n\n\n                           Veterans First Act\n\n  Mr. President, this Nation has made a sacred promise to the men and \nwomen who have served in our Armed Forces. These folks answered a call \nto duty, and they made selfless sacrifices to protect the freedoms we \nall enjoy. These heroes stood up for us, and now it is time for the \nSenate to stand up for them.\n  Two years ago, when reports surfaced that veterans were dying while \nwaiting to receive care at the VA, the Senate acted swiftly, and we \npassed legislation to build the capacity of the VA to better meet the \nneeds of veterans now and into the future. Also included in that bill \nwas the Veterans Choice Program, which allowed more veterans to seek \ncare in their own community when they were unable to get timely care \nfrom the VA. Unfortunately, the Choice Program is broken. We have heard \nthis from veterans and community leaders, from veteran service \norganizations, from Republicans and from Democrats.\n  The intent of the Choice Program was a good one--to get veterans care \nmore quickly--but the rollout has been disastrous, causing far too many \nveterans to wait even longer for an appointment. But because of the \nleadership of Chairman Isakson and Ranking Member Blumenthal, the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee came together in May and approved the \nVeterans First Act, which includes provisions that I and Senator Burr \nauthored to fix the Choice Program. It also includes critical \nprovisions to hold the VA accountable, increase veterans access to care \nboth inside and outside the VA, and better deliver on the commitment \nthis Nation has made to the folks who have served.\n  Since this bill was unanimously passed out of committee back on May \n16, it has fallen victim to politics as usual, and a combination of \nanonymous holds and the majority leader's decision not to bring it to \nthe floor have put this bipartisan piece of legislation, this good \npiece of legislation for our veterans, in limbo. And now there are only \n21 days left until the Senate is set to recess for nearly 2 months.\n  I am concerned that the clock is running out and that this bipartisan \nbill will fall victim to the Senate's inaction. We cannot let business \nas usual here in Washington, DC, derail critically needed reforms. \nVeterans will not and should not accept excuses for the Senate not \nacting.\n  This is a good bill. It is a bill that gives the VA the flexibility \nto work directly with community providers to connect veterans to the \ncare they need so that the VA does not need to work through a \nmiddleman. This bill also provides the budget flexibility necessary to \nensure veterans are routed to care in a manner that makes the most \nsense for them. It imposes stricter rules to ensure the VA is \nreimbursing community providers in a more timely manner. It also \nincludes critical provisions that I helped author to ensure the VA is \nable to more quickly fill leadership vacancies at VA medical \nfacilities.\n  That is why today I am calling on the Senate to put politics aside, \nput personal agendas aside, and get this bill to the floor for debate \nand for an up-or-down vote. The millions of veterans who are still \nbeing forced to wait more than 30 days to schedule an appointment \ndeserve that vote. The veterans who are still kept on long wait lists \ndeserve that vote. And the folks who have sacrificed so much to protect \nand defend this country deserve that vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, early in the morning this past Sunday, the \nworst mass shooting in America's history took place. Forty-nine people \nwere killed and 53 more wounded at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, FL. \nWe don't know all the details, but we know that this was an act of \nterror and that it was an act of hate directed at the LGBT community.\n  I want to begin by expressing my condolences to the victims, to their \nfamilies and loved ones, and to the city of Orlando. I thank the first \nresponders who ran toward the sound of gunfire, who literally risked \ntheir lives to save the lives of others.\n  I express my support and solidarity with the LGBT community in \nOrlando and throughout the Nation. Many of the patrons at the Pulse \nnightclub were members of that community. They were simply enjoying a \nfun night out at an establishment that welcomed them.\n  June is Pride Month. It is a month where we should take pride in the \nadvances we have made toward equality since Stonewall in 1969. The LGBT \nmovement has come a long way in protecting Americans' right to love the \nperson they love. Yet this weekend's shooting is a sobering reminder \nthat this community still remains a target of vicious hatred.\n  As we mourn those we lost in Orlando, we must not lose our pride in \nwhat the LGBT movement has accomplished. We must stand in solidarity \nwith our fellow LGBT Americans who will not let the hate of a few \novercome the love of an entire community.\n  The shooter who perpetrated this horrific attack has been identified \nas a 29-year-old U.S. citizen who was living in St. Lucie County, FL. \nThe shooter reportedly entered the nightclub at about 2 a.m. on Sunday \nmorning, armed with an AR-15 assault rifle and a handgun. He opened \nfire on the patrons and engaged in a shoot-out with an off-duty Orlando \npolice officer who was working security at the nightclub. The shooter \napparently held a number of hostages in the nightclub for several \nhours, until a SWAT team swarmed the building, killing the gunman at \nabout 5 a.m.\n  Reportedly, the shooter called 911 to pledge allegiance to ISIS, even \nwhile the attack was under way. We do not yet know when and how this \ngunman may have been radicalized. Reportedly, he had been the subject \nof at least two FBI investigations in recent years regarding possible \nties to terrorist groups. The shooter reportedly bought the two guns he \nused on Sunday within the last several days. He was able to buy these \nguns legally, despite the past\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\ninvestigations into his potential terrorist ties.\n  Let's be clear. In America, our laws currently allow dangerous people \nto buy guns. That has to change. I respect the Second Amendment to our \nConstitution. That amendment protects the responsible use of guns for \nlawful purposes. But the Supreme Court has made it clear that it is \nconstitutional to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Our \nlawmakers are simply not doing enough to keep guns out of the hands of \ndangerous people.\n  Right now, the FBI cannot stop a known or suspected terrorist from \nwalking into a gunshop and walking out with an AR-15, an assault \nweapon. The GAO found that between 2004 and 2014, suspected terrorists \nbought guns lawfully at least 2,043 times from American gun dealers.\n  What are we thinking? Last December, when the Senate took up this \nmeasure, we failed on the floor of the Senate to pass legislation to \nclose this terror gap loophole. The gap remains open, and we have \nfailed to close the gaping loopholes in our own background check system \nthat allow terrorists, criminals, and others to get guns without a \nbackground check from gun shows or over the Internet. Why do we make it \nso easy for people that we suspect of being involved in terrorism to \nbuy guns--assault weapons, military-style guns?\n  Last December, this Senate failed again to pass Manchin-Toomey, a \nbill that would close many of these loopholes. This was a bipartisan \nbill, yet we couldn't pass it on the floor of the Senate.\n  We know our weak gun laws make us vulnerable, but we have not acted \nto strengthen them. In fact, almost every week we see efforts in \nCongress to further weaken gun laws in America.\n  Hundreds of men, women, and children are shot every day in America, \nand on average 91 of those victims die. It is an epidemic of gun \nviolence that has devastated families and communities in every State. \nNo community has been hit harder than the city of Chicago--the city I \nam honored to represent and the city I love and a city where this past \nweekend, 44 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. More than 1,650 people \nhave been shot so far this year in Chicago, with at least 282 victims \ndying from their wounds.\n  The tragedy of Orlando is that it all happened in a few hours. The \ntragedy of gun violence in Chicago is that it happens almost every day.\n  Across the Nation, we have seen Americans gunned down in nightclubs, \nelementary schools, churches, temples, movie theaters, health care \nclinics, malls, colleges, and our homes and our neighborhoods.\n  We need to wake up and act to reduce this violence. Thoughts and \nprayers are important but not sufficient. We need votes and laws to \nkeep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Can't we agree on that? \nThe responsibility lies right here. We have that responsibility and \nthat opportunity.\n  This weekend's act of hate and terror in Orlando has been condemned \nby Americans of all backgrounds and all faiths, and Orlando has \nreceived an extraordinary outpouring of support and solidarity from all \nacross the United States and around the world.\n  We do stand united against ISIS and its efforts to promote mass \nshootings and acts of terror. We stand in support of the LGBT \ncommunity--the latest target of this terrorist attack. This solidarity \nis important. Our efforts to defeat ISIS and keep America safe from \nhate and terror are strengthened when our Nation and the world stand \nunited. We must not let the actions of a hateful few divide us and \nprevent us from working together to combat this evil.\n  We also must not let this act of hate and terror lead to hostility \nagainst the Muslim community in America. The American Muslim community \nhas stood with all Americans in condemning Sunday's mass shooting. \nAmerican Muslim leaders immediately spoke out and condemned the attack. \nMuslim Floridians donated blood and money to help the victims and \nsurvivors.\n  In the coming days, there will be those who say we should respond to \nthis attack by discriminating against innocent American Muslims and \nimmigrants. But the solution to hate is not more hate; it is unity.\n  In Orlando, they understand this. In a news conference after the \nshooting, a representative of Equality Florida recognized the unity \nbetween the LGBT and Muslim communities, stating that his organization \n``stands in solidarity with the Muslim and Islamic community in \nopposition to the intolerance, discrimination, and hate crimes that \nboth of our communities experience.''\n  That was a statement by the representative of Equality Florida about \nMuslims in Florida itself. It is unfortunate that the presumptive \nRepublican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump, does not understand \nthis. In response to the Orlando attack, Mr. Trump wasted no time \ncalling again for a ban on all Muslims immigrating to the United \nStates.\n  General Michael Hayden is no softy, no liberal. He was Director of \nthe CIA, and the National Security Agency under President George W. \nBush. Here is what General Hayden said of Mr. Trump's response to the \nattack: ``Prejudiced, simplistic, and frankly inaccurate.'' General \nHayden has pointed out that banning all Muslim immigration would not \nmake us safer and actually helps ISIS recruit those who hate the United \nStates.\n  As we mourn those we have lost, we must also roll up our sleeves and \nget to work. We must pursue smart, commonsense reforms to keep \ndangerous, hateful people from getting their hands on dangerous \nweapons. America just suffered its deadliest mass shooting event in \nhistory--worse than San Bernardino, worse than Newtown, worse than \nVirginia Tech. If there was ever a time for Congress to do its job and \nkeep guns out of dangerous hands, this is it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, first and foremost, I wish to send my \nheartfelt sympathy to those who have lost loved ones in Orlando, FL, in \nOrange County, yesterday in a tragic event. I want to express my great \nappreciation to the people of Orlando who volunteered their blood, \ntheir families, and their houses to help support those victims; to the \nEMTs who rushed into harm's way to save lives--and they did save \nlives--and to the hospital trauma team that did an amazing job of \nresponding instantaneously to a tragedy beyond anybody's comprehension.\n  We are very sad in America today by the terrible attack that took \nplace and those who would perpetrate it. I, for one, am going to roll \nup my sleeves and work to see to it that wherever radical Islamic \nterrorism is, I want to root it out and I want to destroy it. You \ncannot accept or tolerate what happened yesterday, and we must redouble \nour effort to follow it wherever it leads us and to wipe it out and to \neradicate it. I, as one Senator, will promise to do that.\n\n\n              Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mr. President, I am one of those guys who usually is very supportive \nof going to cloture and going on motions to proceed on just about \nanything because I think the Senate is the most deliberative body in \nthe world and we ought to do that. But tomorrow, shortly after 11 \no'clock, I am going to vote no on the motion to proceed to the \nCommerce-Justice-Science bill. I want to memorialize why on the floor \nof the Senate tonight so everybody is clear and understands.\n  There is report language in the Commerce-Justice-Science portion of \nthe appropriations bill that directly interjects this Congress, this \nSenate, and the U.S. House of Representatives into a tristate water \ncompact misunderstanding among the States of Georgia, Alabama, and \nFlorida that has gone on for 27 years.\n  I know that is of no interest to the Presiding Officer from Indiana, \nnor to the Senator who just preceded me from Chicago, IL, nor anybody \nelse, but what is of interest to you would be any time that Congress \ndecided to interject its nose in your business. Tomorrow, if the motion \nto proceed brings it to the floor, it will be injecting 100 Senators \ninto an issue among 6 Senators. That is not the right way to do it. In \nfact, the tristate water compact, which has been off and on in \nnegotiations for 26 years,\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\nis at its closest point of being finally decided in a court of law. The \njudge and the special master recently notified us that they will hear \nthe final case on the tristate water compact in Georgia, Alabama, and \nFlorida this November. So the issue is going to be resolved.\n  We have no place as a Senate or as a Congress to inject ourselves \ninto a case that is pending litigation in the courts between States on \nissues that are purely theirs--except for the fact that over the years, \nfor nefarious reasons and unpleasant reasons, sometimes Congress has \nfrom time to time thwarted water control manuals, thwarted the \nauthority of the Corps of Engineers from doing its job, all over \nlitigation of the ACF and AC basins in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama.\n  I want to bring a resolution. I want all the States to have an \nadequate supply of water. I want us to be cooperative and work \ntogether, and I want us to do it the right way. The right way is to not \ninterject ourselves at the last minute in an appropriations bill with \nnefarious language that can't be touched that is in the report language \nbut, instead, to pull that language out, as I will try to do with an \namendment on the floor. If I am unsuccessful, I will try to do an \namendment that counteracts that language, to see to it that Congress \ndoes not stick its nose in a place that it does not belong.\n  I like to be cooperative. I like to move forward. I don't want to \nslow down progress. But I was sent here to represent 10.4 million \npeople in the State of Georgia and, by golly, I am going to do it. If \nsomebody is trying to inject themselves beyond the appropriate place, I \nam going to do everything I can to stop them. The way I will start that \ntomorrow will be to vote no on the motion to proceed to go to the \nCommerce-Justice-Science bill.\n  I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Mass Shooting in Orlando\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about the \nhorror of Orlando, and I know so many Members of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle have been thinking about those who lost their lives \nand talking about this horror that once again has impacted everyone \nfrom one end of America to the other.\n  I won't speak for a long time tonight other than to say--which I \nthink is plainly evident from the evidence we have right now at this \npoint in the investigation--that this was first an act of terror and it \nwas also an act of hate. I think both are significant because of the \nimpact they have on our country over time.\n  I think there is a strong belief that the first thing we must do is \nto express not just condolence but solidarity with the people of \nOrlando, the people of Florida, and to do what we can to help them and \nhelp those communities and families who lost so much in such a short \ntimeframe. At last count, there are 50 dead and more than 50 injured. \nThere will be some who say that beyond that, there is not much we can \ndo, that we should just stay where we are now and not change the laws. \nI don't agree with that, and I won't dwell on a long list tonight, but \nI hope at some point we can begin to reengage on a number of issues and \nat least have a full debate and also a series of votes on a couple of \nmeasures which I think are common sense. These are issues that we voted \non I believe most recently in 2013, and I was hoping we would vote on \nthem after that.\n  One of the votes had to do with a ban on military-style weapons. I \nthink it would be appropriate to at least debate and vote on it. I \nwould vote in favor of it, and some would not. We should certainly have \na vote on the size of the clips, or the magazines. To put it plainly, \nhow many bullets should one person have in their possession or as part \nof the weapon at any one time? Should someone be allowed to go into any \nkind of establishment and start shooting, thereby releasing rounds and \nrounds of ammunition and hundreds and hundreds of bullets? Should that \nbe permitted to anyone at any time or anywhere? I don't think so.\n  If someone is on the terror watch list and that person has been \ndeemed so dangerous that we have labeled him or her as a terrorist or \npotential terrorist and he or she can't get on an airplane, certainly \nthat person should not have a weapon. That seems to make sense. If they \nare too dangerous to get on a plane because of their tendency to commit \nacts of violence or engage in terror, they shouldn't be able to have a \nfirearm. I think it would make sense to have a debate and vote on that \nissue.\n  Another issue is background checks. That was one measure where there \nwas a lot of consensus or substantial bipartisan support, but it didn't \npass in 2013. I hope we can have another vote on that.\n  If a person is not able to get through a background check due to a \nwhole variety of reasons, such as having a criminal record or \notherwise, you have to ask yourself, should someone with a criminal \nrecord have access to a firearm?\n  Mr. President, today I have introduced the Hate Crimes Prevention \nAct, S. 3053. That is a new proposal to do what some States have done \nalready. I think it is essential to add this to the other pieces of \nlegislation that have been talked about and some that I just itemized.\n  This bill, first of all, would define what a misdemeanor hate crime \nis because the intent of the bill is to say: If you are convicted of a \nmisdemeanor hate crime, you shouldn't have access to a firearm. This \ncategory of misdemeanors would be under Federal, State, or tribal law \nthat are found to be motivated, at least in part, by hate or bias \nagainst the victim's race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \nsexual orientation, gender identity, or disability. In essence, these \neight categories are what some would call, to use the more legal \njargon, the protected classes. That is how we would define a \nmisdemeanor hate crime.\n  This bill, upon passage, would keep firearms out of the hands of \nthose convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes. It would prohibit the \npurchase, possession, or shipment of a firearm by anyone convicted of a \nmisdemeanor hate crime. That is the basics of the bill. Obviously it \ndoesn't have direct application to what happened in Orlando; however, \nupon further investigation, we may find that it does. Part of the \nreason for this is because there has been a rise not only in hate \ncrimes but in hate groups across the country, with hundreds more in \njust the last couple of years, and literally thousands more, if not \nmore, hate crimes have been committed.\n  Those issues I mentioned are among the many things we need to \naddress. I also think that in addition to taking these steps on \ncommonsense gun measures, we have to make sure law enforcement has the \nresources it needs to take on the challenge of not just criminal \nactivity but increasingly almost terroristic activity within our \ncommunities--the so-called lone wolf terrorist, the homegrown \nterrorist, the individual who is self-radicalized, which seems to be \npart of the horror of Orlando. We have to make sure that if law \nenforcement professionals tell us they need more money in the COPS \nProgram, we should appropriate more money. If the law enforcement \nprofessionals say: Please fund that program that has worked for so many \nyears, such as the Byrne Justice assistance grants, we should make sure \nthey have those appropriations. If you are tough on law enforcement--\nthat is nice to say, but it is better to prove it by how you vote.\n  Finally, of course, we have to continue to focus on what is a major \ncomponent, of course, of Orlando and San Bernardino and so many other \nplaces, and that is violent extremism in communities across the \ncountry. We have to make sure we are working with local law enforcement \nand Federal authorities not only to give them the resources they need \nbut to be able to coordinate and do our best to unearth plots before \nthey transpire and to be able to take this fight directly to a \nterrorist, many of whom are in our midst here in the United States.\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\n  We have a lot to do. It is not simply a question of what we do on a \nseries of commonsense gun measures, it is also a question of what we \nare going to do to help our law enforcement and to work as hard as we \ncan in a bipartisan way to debate and vote on measures that will keep \nour country safe and protect our homeland.\n  Unfortunately, we are seeing more and more of a rise in these \nindividuals who are, as I mentioned before, self-radicalized and \nsometimes categorized as a lone wolf. We have to make sure we are doing \neverything possible to identify them, apprehend them, and make sure we \nare thwarting these plots ahead of time. It may not work in every \ninstance, but we have to take every measure possible. I think part of \nthat is doing what I hope we can do as a matter of preventive steps. If \nsomeone is engaging in hate and taking action against others, even if \nit only rises to the level of a misdemeanor, they shouldn't have access \nto a firearm. We want to nip this in the bud, stop it long before that \nhate continues and develops into the kind of hate that leads to a much \ngreater and more lethal attack on Americans.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I would like to pay tribute to a \ngreat American veteran, public servant, leader, and Texan, Mr. Roland \n``Ken'' Towery. Ken passed away on May 4, 2016, at the age of 93. Ken \npersonified integrity, sacrifice, and hard work as a member of the \nGreatest Generation. He will be sorely missed by the family he leaves \nbehind, those whose lives he touched, and a grateful Nation.\n  Ken was born in 1923 in Smithville, MS, but quickly moved to Texas a \nyear later. Ken grew up on his family's farm in Willacy County. When \nKen was 14, they moved to farm land on the Medina River near San \nAntonio. The day Ken turned 18, he enlisted in the Army. He was later \nasked about why he enlisted, and he said, ``I wanted to see the world \nand signed up asking for service as far away from home as the Army \ncould send me.'' A few short months later, Ken sailed to the \nPhilippines on the USS Republic. He received basic and advanced \nindividual training on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay; he served as a \ncrew member for the 75mm antiaircraft guns with Battery C, 60th Coast \nArtillery.\n  In the initial months of America's involvement in World War II, the \n60th Coast Artillery joined with the 59th Coast Artillery to defend the \nBataan Peninsula, blocking the Japanese Navy from Manila Bay. Ken and \nhis fellow soldiers fought gallantly; many, including Ken, were awarded \nthe Purple Heart for injuries received in defense of the island. In May \nof 1942, the island fell to the Japanese, and Ken was captured.\n  For the duration of World War II, Ken was a prisoner of war in \nManchuria. As a POW, he worked in the MKK factory making equipment to \nbe exported. Ken eventually acquired an extra duty serving prisoners \ntheir meals, more commonly referred to as ``slop,'' filling a role \nreferred to as the ``chow dipper.'' Serving as a chow dipper was often \na short-lived and precarious position because they were subject to \nfights and disagreements from prisoners who were unhappy about their \nmeager rations. This changed when Ken became the chow dipper. He \nemployed the lesson that his parents taught him to ``do unto others.'' \nHe remedied disagreements by first filling his own bowl and placing it \nbeside the serving bucket. Any man who was unsatisfied with his serving \nwas invited to replace his serving with Ken's. This small action \ndemonstrated Ken's dedication to fairness and firmly established his \nrole as a leader amongst his fellow prisoners.\n  In 1945, Ken returned home, where he faced a steep recovery from \nmultiple parasitic diseases common amongst former prisoners of war. \nAdditionally, Ken returned with a serious case of tuberculosis, which \nforced him to spend the bulk of the next decade in isolation wards of \nTB sanitariums. As he battled TB, Ken studied at Southwest Texas Junior \nCollege and was later admitted to Texas A&M; University to study soil \nbiology. It was during this time that Ken met his future wife, Louise \nIda Cook, from Knippa, TX.\n  After their wedding, Ken continued college until another bout with \ntuberculosis occurred and ended his formal education. After his \nhospitalization, Ken cleaned poultry houses to make a living. In 1950, \nthe Cuero Record, Ken's local newspaper, announced they were looking \nfor a reporter. Ken applied for the position but lacked one critical \nskill: the ability to use a typewriter. Louise taught Ken to type, \nhelping him to land the job.\n  Ken's hard work led him to investigate allegations regarding \nbusinessmen who were abusing the State's veteran's land program and \nState officials who chose to ignore the issue. This later became known \nas the Veteran's Land Scandal. As a result of his research and \nreporting, 20 people were indicted, and the Texas land commissioner was \nremoved from office and imprisoned. In 1955, Ken was awarded the \nPulitzer Prize for his work.\n  Soon after, Ken, Louise, and their two children moved to Austin, \nwhere Ken worked as a political reporter for the Austin American \nStatesman. His insight into politics was noticed by recently elected \nU.S. Senator John Tower, who asked Ken to serve as his press secretary. \nHe quickly climbed the ladder and became Senator Tower's chief of \nstaff.\n  After leaving Tower's staff, Ken remained influential in Republican \npolitics for more than 20 years, during which time he managed several \nreelection campaigns, including Richard Nixon's 1968 campaign in Texas.\n  Ken's political impacts extended beyond the United States. He also \nserved the U.S. Information Agency as deputy director and assistant \ndirector. While there, he played a major behind-the-scenes role in the \nfight against communism and the demise of the Soviet Union. He said the \nyears spent at USIA ``were among the most gratifying `employed' years \nof my life . . . I could go home at night feeling like I had struck a \nblow for liberty, for mankind . . . There was the feeling that our \nlabors were directed towards the interest of the nation as a whole.''\n  Ken then returned to Texas, where he started a political consulting \nbusiness in 1976. In 1981, President Regan appointed him to the board \nof directors of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and he served \nas the elected chairman of the board twice. Ken eventually returned to \nthe newspaper business in the 1990s when he purchased three small town \npublications: The Floyd County Hesperian, the Lockney Beacon, and the \nCrosby County News-Chronicle.\n  Of all his many accomplishments, this humble man will rest in the \nTexas State Cemetery beneath the headstone that reads ``The Chow \nDipper.'' Ken Towery's story of perseverance, work ethic, and fortitude \nshould inspire us all. I offer my thanks and appreciation to this great \nand humble man who epitomizes the American spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3823-2"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3823-S3824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HOUSE PASSAGE OF S. 337, THE FOIA IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Freedom of Information Act, our \nNation's premier transparency law, is on the eve of its 50th \nanniversary, July 4, 2016. It is fitting that FOIA shares its birthday \nwith our Republic itself. Our democracy is built upon the principle \nthat a government of, by, and for the people cannot be one that is \nhidden from them. Today we recommit ourselves to this ideal by sending \nto the President the FOIA Improvement Act. This bill, which I \ncoauthored with Senator Cornyn, ushers in the most significant reforms \nto FOIA since its enactment 50\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nyears ago. With the House's unanimous passage of our legislation today, \nwe ensure FOIA will remain strong for another 50 years.\n  First and foremost, the FOIA Improvement Act codifies a ``presumption \nof openness,'' putting the force of law behind the notion that \nsunshine, not secrecy, is the default setting of our government. This \nis the same language President Obama laid out in his historic \nmemorandum in 2009 and which now applies to government agencies. This \npolicy was first put into place by President Bill Clinton, but then it \nwas reversed by President George W. Bush. President Obama reinstated it \nas one of his first acts in office. However, self-imposed executive \norders provide the executive branch overly-broad latitude in adhering \nto its letter and spirit. We must remember, the executive branch \nuniquely conducts much of its business behind closed doors, which is \nwhy we need strong legislation ensuring accountability and \ntransparency. By codifying the ``presumption of openness,'' we ensure \nthat all future administrations operate under the presumption that \ngovernment information belongs in the hands of the people.\n  Furthermore, our bill provides the Office of Government Information \nServices--OGIS--an office Senator Cornyn and I created in the OPEN \nGovernment Act of 2007--additional authority to operate more \nindependently and communicate freely with Congress how FOIA is \noperating and what improvements can be made. And to bring FOIA into the \ndigital age, our bill creates a singular online portal through which \nthe American public can submit FOIA requests and requires the proactive \nonline disclosure of frequently requested records.\n  The reforms in our bill enjoy broad bipartisan support. The Senate \nhas unanimously voted for our FOIA Improvement Act twice. Last \nCongress, the Democratically controlled Senate unanimously passed this \nbill, but Republican leaders in the House failed to bring it up. \nSenator Cornyn and I promptly reintroduced our legislation, which \npassed the Senate earlier this year, and finally, the House has \nfollowed suit. The legislative branch has now spoken in one voice, \nreaffirming its commitment to the American people's right to know what \ntheir government is doing. I urge President Obama to swiftly sign our \nbill into law in time for FOIA's 50th anniversary.\n  The FOIA Improvement Act is undoubtedly a legislative achievement \nworth celebrating. However, we must not rest on our laurels. Just as we \nare about to bring more sunshine into the halls of power with this new \nlaw, the National Defense Authorization Act, S. 2943, being considered \nby the Senate, threatens to cast a shadow over our efforts.\n  Without ever consulting the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has \nexclusive jurisdiction over FOIA, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nincluded provisions in the NDAA that directly undermine central pillars \nof FOIA. One particularly egregious provision is so broadly drafted \nthat it could create a wholesale carveout of the Department of Defense \nfrom our Nation's transparency and accountability regime. If enacted \ninto law, this could empower the Pentagon to withhold a nearly \nlimitless amount of information from the American public. For example, \nthe Pentagon could withhold the legal justifications for drone strikes \nagainst U.S. citizens, preventing the American people from knowing the \nlegal basis upon which their government can employ lethal force against \nthem. It could withhold from disclosure documents memorializing \ncivilian killings by U.S. forces, depriving the American people of \nknowledge about the human cost of wars fought in their name. And if \nenacted, the Pentagon could withhold information about sexual assaults \nin the military, masking the true extent of sexual violence against \nsoldiers who risk their lives defending our country. I will continue to \noppose inclusion of this provision in the final NDAA.\n  Fifty years from now, on FOIA's centennial anniversary, the next \ngeneration will look back to this moment. They will gauge our \ncommitment to creating a government that is open to its people. With \ntoday's passage of the bipartisan FOIA Improvement Act, we have chosen \nto let the sunshine in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3823-3"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 2943\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, on June 10, 2016, the Congressional Budget \nOffice released a detailed cost estimate for S. 2943, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017. This measure was \nreported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on May 18, 2016, and \nincludes provisions that affect authorizations for appropriations, \nrevenues, and direct spending. As chairman of the Senate Committee on \nthe Budget, I will use this estimate for scorekeeping and budget \nenforcement purposes. Senators and their staff can access the full \nestimate on CBO's website, www.cbo.gov/publication/51683.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of CBO's cost \nestimate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n    S. 2943--National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017\n\n                            (June 10, 2016)\n\n       Summary: S. 2943 would authorize appropriations totaling an \n     estimated $603.9 billion for the military functions of the \n     Department of Defense (DoD), for certain activities of the \n     Department of Energy (DOE), and for other purposes. In \n     addition, S. 2943 would prescribe personnel strengths for \n     each active-duty and selected-reserve component of the U.S. \n     armed forces. CBO estimates that appropriation of the \n     authorized amounts would result in outlays of $587.8 billion \n     over the 2017-2021 period.\n       Of the amount authorized for 2017, $544.1 billion--if \n     appropriated--would count against that year's defense cap set \n     in the Budget Control Act (BCA), as amended. Another $0.2 \n     billion authorized for nondefense programs would count \n     against the nondefense cap and an additional $58.9 billion \n     authorized and designated for overseas contingency operations \n     would not be constrained by caps.\n       The bill also contains provisions that would affect the \n     costs of defense programs funded through discretionary \n     appropriations in 2018 and future years. Those provisions \n     mainly would affect force structure, compensation and \n     benefits, the military health system, and various procurement \n     programs. CBO has analyzed the costs of a select number of \n     those provisions and estimates that they would, on a net \n     basis, decrease the cost of those programs relative to \n     current law by about $14 billion over the 2018-2021 period. \n     The net costs of those provisions in 2018 and beyond are not \n     included in the total amount of outlays mentioned above \n     because funding for those activities would be covered by \n     specific authorizations in future years.\n       In addition, CBO estimates that enacting the bill would \n     increase direct spending by $10.9 billion over the 2017-2026 \n     period. S. 2943 would have an insignificant effect on \n     revenues. Because enacting the bill would affect direct \n     spending and revenues, pay-as-you-go procedures apply.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 2943 would increase net \n     direct spending and on-budget deficits by more than $5 \n     billion in each of the four consecutive 10-year periods \n     beginning in 2027.\n       S. 2943 contains intergovernmental and private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). CBO estimates that the aggregate costs of the \n     mandates would fall below the annual thresholds established \n     in UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates \n     ($77 million and $154 million in 2016, respectively, adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3824-1"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3824-S3825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JACK LIVINGSTON\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, today I wish to pay special tribute to Jack \nLivingston, a key member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nstaff for more than 12 years. Jack's lifelong commitment to our \nnational security began when he was just a young man and heeded the \ncall to service when he joined the Civil Air Patrol. Some years later, \nhe joined the Navy, followed by more than 7 years of distinguished \nservice at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His memory of being on \nthe floor of the Strategic Information and Operations Center at the FBI \nin the hours after 9/11, when so many others in Washington, DC, had \nhurried to safety, remained with him every day and became his driver \nand, in turn, a motivator for younger staff.\n  Jack subsequently joined the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nwhere he has served for the last 13 years. As general counsel for the \nmajority and minority, Jack not only helped shape national policy on \nkey intelligence matters, but he served as a personal and professional \nmentor to dozens of committee and congressional staff, on both sides of \nthe aisle. From the all-nighters before mark-up, reviewing amendments \nand writing and\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\nproofing countless sets of talking points, to somehow always assigning \nhimself a larger ``equal'' share of the work, Jack has led by example. \nHis meticulous nature and sound reasoning were essential as the \ncommittee produced reports or majority or minority views on significant \nmatters of national security, from Iraq WMD to interrogation and \ndetention. It did not matter how busy Jack was because he would always \nfind time to talk through an intelligence issue with a colleague, \nproofread a floor statement, or just listen. Many staff knocked on his \nopen door and were greeted without hesitation by a kind word or \ninvitation to sit down and discuss a question more in-depth.\n  Many of Jack's colleagues have had the privilege of working with him \nfor years. Ask them what words describe Jack best, and you will likely \nhear ``integrity,'' ``honesty,'' ``impeccable character,'' ``devoted \nfamily man,'' and ``all-around good guy''--and unique: while an ardent \nIndiana University and Bobby Knight fan, his California roots easily \nshowed themselves as he called his colleagues ``dude'' during debates. \nJack was often kidded about catching a joke; the deadpan expression on \nhis face was usually belied by a twinkle in his eye that said the joke \nwas really on you.\n  Jack is loyal to the core, and he understood well the importance of \nproviding accurate information and sound advice to members of the \ncommittee, a point on which I am sure my predecessors, Senators \nChambliss, Bond, and Roberts, would agree. Jack had the ability, all \ntoo rare in Congress, to put politics aside and focus on the mission \nand on what was best for the Nation. His colleagues knew they could \nengage in spirited but never personal debates. Jack always stuck to the \nfacts and his arguments were based on logic, not emotion. As a result, \nmembers of the committee--Republican, Democrat, and Independent--sought \nhis counsel on a wide range of issues.\n  As the minority and majority general counsel, Jack enjoyed some major \nsuccesses in national security legislation. From the Protect America \nAct to the FISA Amendments Act, Jack worked tirelessly to secure the \nbest result for our terrorist surveillance capabilities. Jack was \npassionate about this issue and understood it better than pretty much \nanyone else. The committee's FISA audit was a hallmark of Jack's early \ntenure on the committee and provided the impetus for many improvements \nin the conduct of national security investigations and for later \nlegislation in which Jack played significant roles. Jack led the \ncommittee's passage of the Cyber Information Sharing Act of 2015, the \nproduct of years of bipartisan work and compromise on an issue that has \ntaken on new urgency with the increase in cyber threats, and of \nnumerous intelligence authorization acts that secured critical \nauthorities and capabilities for our intelligence professionals.\n  It is often said that behind every great man, there is a greater \nwoman, and in Jack's case, that is certainly true--and I have no doubt \nJack would agree. Jack's tireless service was made possible, not just \nbecause of his own character, but because he was confident in the love \nand support of his wife, Julie, and their children, John, James, and \nSarah. For their own sacrifices and for their willingness to share Jack \nwith the committee, we are indebted to them.\n  Jack has earned our respect and admiration, and we will miss his \nsound counsel and friendship, but his legacy will remain a part of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3824-2"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DENNIS X. McCORMACK\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I extend my sincere appreciation \nand gratitude to Dennis X. McCormack for his tireless contributions to \nbettering the lives of Colorado's veterans.\n  Dennis could have relaxed after retiring. He had earned it after 26 \nyears in the military as an Army chief warrant officer, CW5, helicopter \npilot from Fort Bragg's XVIII Airborne Corps and 12 more years in the \nprivate sector.\n  Instead, Dennis was committed to service. Before retirement, he was \ngiving his time, expertise, and passion to veterans, military families, \nand soldiers facing deployment and the difficulties of day-to-day life.\n  Every day, the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces make \nincalculable contributions to our society. Dennis recognized a \nresponsibility to support those contributions and made his own.\n  He served with many organizations such as the Suicide Prevention \nPartnership of the Pikes Peak Region, LifeQuest Transitions, the Home \nFront Cares, Inc., Sentinels of Freedom--Colorado Springs Chapter, and \nSouth East Armed Forces YMCA, Colorado Springs.\n  He served as a peer mentor for Colorado's El Paso County Veterans \nTrauma Court, a program he helped found. He also served in the first \ngroup of AW2 advocates for the Army Wounded Warrior Program and was an \norganizer of the Colorado injured military support group.\n  I had the distinct honor of meeting Dennis in 2011, and I have worked \nwith him in the intervening years. His deep dedication to veterans was \nclear, and that passion inspires my work on behalf of our Nation's \nveterans.\n  He has received the American Red Cross Hometown Hero Community \nService Award, the President's Award from Homefront Cares, and the Joe \nHenjum ``Service Above Self'' Award from the Rotary Club of Colorado \nSprings. These speak to his integrity, character, and commitment to the \ncommunity.\n  Dennis demonstrates the best of Colorado, and his tireless service \nhas helped make our State one of the best places for our \nservicemembers, veterans, and their families to live. I add my \nrecognition of his service, knowing that his work contributes to a \nstronger and a safer nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3825-1"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3825-S3826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JON YUSPA\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate a \nNevadan who has gone above and beyond in his endeavors for our veteran \ncommunity, Jon Yuspa. Jon formed and continues to lead Honor Flight \nNevada, a nonprofit organization committed to honoring the brave men \nand women who so valiantly defended our freedom.\n  In 2011, Jon formed Honor Flight Nevada to honor Nevada's World War \nII veterans and transport them to Washington, DC, to visit the \nmemorials dedicated to honor their service and sacrifices. Since its \nformation, Honor Flight Nevada has expanded its trips to include Korean \nand Vietnam veteran visits. Over the past 5 years, Jon and the Honor \nFlight Nevada team have raised over $500,000 to transport more than 200 \nU.S. veterans to Washington, DC. The trips are completely funded and \npaid for at no cost to the veterans through private donations to Honor \nFlight Nevada. From the National World War II Memorial, to the Korean \nWar Veterans Memorial, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, all the way to \nArlington National Cemetery, every veteran has the chance to see the \nmemorials that stand as a testimony to the great sacrifices they have \nmade.\n  Even more remarkable, Honor Flight Nevada is the only Honor Flight \norganization to offer trips specifically for Vietnam veterans to visit \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial. To witness these veterans honor their \nlost comrades at their memorials is truly a special experience. During \nthe trip, veterans are showered with gratitude and applause in \nairports, on bus rides, at hotels, and en route to their memorials, all \nexecuted through the coordination and planning from the Honor Flight \nNevada team. I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to everyone \nworking on behalf of our veterans with Honor Flight Nevada, including \nthose with Southwest Airlines and the Reno-Tahoe International Airport \nwho have contributed so much to this organization. It is through the \nhard work and collaboration of this entire team that these trips are \npossible.\n  Recently, Jon's work has been acknowledged with two prestigious \nawards. In April, Jon received the President's Award from Southwest \nAirlines, as well as the 2016 Jefferson Award for Nevada from the \nJefferson Awards Foundation. These accolades are a tremendous honor, \nand without a doubt, Jon's work warrants this and so much more in \nrecognition. I have personally attended a veterans send-off at the \nReno-Tahoe International Airport\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\nand have also met our heroes in our Nation's Capital as they observed \nthe World War II Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery. I can attest \nto the positive impact that accompanies their journey. This truly is a \nlife-changing experience for those who deserve only the greatest \ngratitude for their service.\n  I most recently had the opportunity to see Jon's work firsthand in \nMay at the internment of Bob Wheeler at Arlington National Cemetery. \nBob was an important member of the Nevada family and will never be \nforgotten. Jon's work in bringing some of the Nevada family to honor \nBob's sacrifice was admirable. No words can adequately thank Jon for \nall that he has done.\n  Jon has truly impacted the lives of heroes across the State of \nNevada. Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in \ncongratulating Jon on his achievements and in recognizing the entire \nHonor Flight Nevada family for their work. Honor Flight Nevada's \nmission is noble, and I thank everyone for their commitment and \ncompassion to Nevada's veterans. I wish Jon and all of the Honor Flight \nNevada team the best of luck in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3825-2"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING ANNIE MILLER'S SON'S SWAMP & MARSH TOUR\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, known as the ``Sportsman's \nParadise,'' Louisiana is blessed with an abundance of natural \nresources, and millions of folks come from across the country and the \nworld to see our unique ecosystems in person. The tourism industry \nplays a major role in our State's economy, bringing in billions of \ndollars each year. Much of that positive growth is due to our local \nsmall businesses, including this week's Small Business of the Week, \nAnnie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour of Houma, LA.\n  Annie and Eddie Miller founded Annie Miller's Swamp and Marsh Tours \nin 1979, which became Louisiana's very first swamp-boat company. Known \nas Alligator Annie, Annie and Eddie escorted tourists through the \nLouisiana swamps, showing them everything from the beautiful marshlands \nto backwater canals and even allowing guests to feed wild alligators. \nAnnie took her role as Louisiana's trailblazer of nature-based tourism \nvery seriously and made sure each guest was well-educated in the \neffects of coastal erosion by the time the tour had concluded. Her \nefforts over the years led to the local government preserving sections \nof the marsh and bayous in Terrebonne Parish for the local alligators.\n  Over the years, Annie Miller's Swamp and Marsh Tours experienced \nmajor successes, and it wasn't long before Annie and Eddie's son Jimmy \nBonvillain joined the family business. Upon Annie's passing in 2004, \nJimmy renamed the family business to Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh \nTour and continues to welcome visitors year-round.\n  Louisiana's small businesses in the tourism industry are constantly \nfinding new and entertaining ways to attract visitors to our State. \nWith its focus on both the beauty and importance of preserving our \nwildlife and natural resources, Annie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour \ncertainly found its successful hook decades ago. Congratulations to \nAnnie Miller's Son's Swamp & Marsh Tour for being selected as this \nweek's Small Business of the Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/13/senate-section/article/S3826-1"}, {"day": "13", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LOUISIANA LEMONADE DAY\n\n Mr. VITTER.

This week I would like to recognize Lucas Firmin \nPools of Baton Rouge, LA, as Small Business of the Week for their \nongoing commitment to supporting the local economy and bringing high-\nquality construction work to local YMCAs, family homes, and local \nresidential communities across Louisiana.\n  Established in 2008, Lucas Firmin Pools is run by Baton Rouge natives \nLucas and Jenny Firmin.

Lucas's wife, Jenny, is a certified pool operator with a strong \nbackground in water balance and chemistry and also manages the \ncompany's service and maintenance requests. The company's mission is to \nconstruct high-quality pools for both residential and commercial \nbuildings in and around Baton Rouge. In the Firmins' 8 years as small \nbusiness owners, they have developed a strong reputation for providing \nexcellent customer service, which has led to the company's ongoing \ngrowth and success. Recently, Lucas Firmin Pools completed the pool \nfacility at the local Baton Rouge YMCA.\n  Today Lucas and Jenny work with local professional designers, \narchitects, and homeowners across the State in order to construct \npools, fountains, and water features for families, apartment complexes, \ncommercial buildings, and more.

Additionally, Jarquin and Blanks \nhave earned several awards and commendations for their important work \nfrom State and Federal agencies and Louisiana and national business \norganizations. Most recently, they were recognized as the Veteran Small \nBusiness Champion by the Louisiana Economic Development and the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration.
