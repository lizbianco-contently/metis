The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American people can get their news in \nvarious fashions, whether it is a blog, the nightly news or in a \nnewspaper. They are very concerned. They are concerned about the threat \nof global terrorism. And why shouldn't they be? Look at what they see.\n  We see ISIS has murdered tens of thousands of people. One need only \nto look back at those thousands of Yazidi people who are trapped in the \nmountains in Iraq. We saw it play on day after day. These people were \nfleeing for their lives and many of them didn't make it.\n  We have watched not only tens of thousands murdered, but we have \nwatched them behead people. Just a few days ago we watched them put a \nman in a cage, set the cage on fire, and burn him alive. They are so \nvoid of any respectability; they are so uncivilized. They filmed 22 \nminutes of that man suffering the utmost torture until he died--22 \nminutes of torture.\n  We look around the world, and in Paris 20 people are dead of a \nterrorist attack. People are dead in Belgium thwarting that terrorist \nattack. In Ottawa, Canada, at the Parliament terrorists attacked. In \nSydney, Australia, there was an attack in a restaurant.\n  It seems that no matter what the day is, there is another act of \nterror that we have to be aware of. We have watched, with some dismay, \nat the terror that is coming. ISIS has bragged that they are coming our \nway.\n  We have our national security agencies, including the Department of \nHomeland Security, which has protected us from attacks to this point. \nNow we are 18 days away from having no money for the Department of \nHomeland Security--18 days. But that is a false number because we are \nout of session for about 10 of those 18 days. So really, after this \nweek, we are down to less than 1 week to protect our homeland.\n  Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security, was on national TV \nyesterday warning the American people of what we face. He went through \nwhat his agency does, what they do to protect our homeland. That agency \nwas established during the Presidency of George W. Bush. It happened \nafter 9/11. We consolidated 22 different agencies into something that \nis more workable. Jeh Johnson has done a very, very good job.\n  There is border protection, the Coast Guard, and they have \nresponsibilities for preventing cyber attacks. There is rarely a day \nthat goes by when there isn't some cyber attack. Which one is big that \nday? We had Sony play out, and we had Anthem just a few days ago.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  Republicans are hellbent on playing chicken with our national \nsecurity.\n  Jeh Johnson said yesterday he would have to furlough as many as \n30,000 people if the Republicans decided to do a continuing resolution, \nwhich would be at last year's numbers. It would prevent the Department \nof Homeland Security from funding any new grants. These are grants that \nhelp our country, grants for dogs sniffing out all kinds of bad things. \nThese grants fund counterterrorism task force units. A very big one is \nwaiting to be established in Arizona.\n  In Las Vegas we have an urban area security initiative. We have 50 \nmillion people who come to Las Vegas each year. We need help to make \nsure local agencies can respond where they have to.\n  Why are we concerned about these grants? We are concerned because it \nis what helps local government be ready for these attacks when and if \nthey come.\n  But the Republicans have come to the conclusion that they are far \nmore afraid of these people--some of whom were here last week--the \nDREAMers. They dreamed of having a country they could relate to. They \ncame to America as babies. It was the only country they even knew. It \nwas a country where they saluted the flag for many years, and President \nObama gave them respectability.\n  A woman who was here and I talked about last week is a young woman \nfrom Las Vegas. Her name is Blanca Gamez. She is a wonderful, wonderful \nwoman. She has two degrees, and she is going to law school next year. \nShe works, and she pays taxes. But it appears that the Republicans are \nmore afraid of her than they are of ISIS--these people who behead \npeople and they burn people in cages.\n  We cannot allow this to go on the way it is headed. These grants help \nlocal firefighters. The DHS directives target criminals instead of \nfamilies. Republicans, I guess, want us to target these families rather \nthan criminals.\n  Why are Republicans putting our country at risk?\n  This isn't some liberal cabal that is talking about this. Let's take, \nfor example, one of the most conservative publications in America, the \nWall Street Journal. They wrote a featured opinion piece today about \nRepublican Members of Congress.\n  The Wall Street Journal says the Republicans' reckless strategy is \ndoomed to fail. Even the very conservative editors of that newspaper \nsaid today that Republicans' reckless scheme is destined for--what is \nin their words--``a spectacular crack-up.'' These are a few things of \nwhat they say in the article.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the February 9, \n2015, opinion article from the Wall Street Journal entitled: ``Can the \nGOP Change?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Wall Street Journal Editorial, Feb. 8, 2015]\n\n                          Can the GOP Change?\n\n       The immigration defeat reveals a larger problem in \n     Congress.\n       Republicans in Congress are off to a less than flying start \n     after a month in power, dividing their own conference more \n     than Democrats. Take the response to President Obama's \n     immigration order, which seems headed for failure if not a \n     more spectacular crack-up.\n       That decree last November awarded work permits and de facto \n     legal status to millions of undocumented aliens and dismayed \n     members of both parties, whatever their immigration views. A \n     Congressional resolution to vindicate the rule of law and the \n     Constitution's limits on executive power was defensible, and \n     even necessary, but this message has long ago been lost in \n     translation.\n       The Republican leadership funded the rest of the government \n     in December's budget deal but isolated the Department of \n     Homeland Security that enforces immigration law. DHS funding \n     runs out this month, and the GOP has now marched itself into \n     another box canyon.\n       The specific White House abuse was claiming prosecutorial \n     discretion to exempt whole classes of aliens from \n     deportation, dumping the historical norm of case-by-case \n     scrutiny. A GOP sniper shot at this legal overreach would \n     have forced Democrats to go on record, picked up a few \n     supporters, and perhaps even imposed some accountability on \n     Mr. Obama.\n       But that wasn't enough for immigration restrictionists, who \n     wanted a larger brawl, and they browbeat GOP leaders into \n     adding needless policy amendments. The House reached back to \n     rescind Mr. Obama's enforcement memos from 2011 that \n     instructed Homeland Security to prioritize deportations of \n     illegals with criminal backgrounds. That is legitimate \n     prosecutorial discretion, and in opposing it Republicans are \n     undermining their crime-fighting credentials.\n       The House even adopted a provision to roll back Mr. Obama's \n     2012 order deferring deportation for young adults brought to \n     the U.S. illegally as children by their parents--the so-\n     called dreamers. The GOP lost 26 of its own Members on that \n     one, passing it with only 218 votes.\n       The overall $40 billion DHS spending bill passed with these \n     riders, 236-191, but with 10 Republicans joining all but two \n     Democrats in opposition. This lack of GOP unity reduced the \n     chances that Senate Democrats would feel any political \n     pressure to go along.\n       And, lo, on Thursday the House bill failed for the third \n     time to gain the 60 votes needed to overcome the third \n     Democratic filibuster in three days. Swing-state Democrats \n     like Indiana's Joe Donnelly and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp \n     aren't worried because they have more than enough material to \n     portray Republicans as the immigration extremists.\n       Whatever their view of Mr. Obama's order, why would \n     Democrats vote to deport people who were brought here as kids \n     through no fault of their own? Mr. Obama issued a veto threat \n     to legislation that will never get to his desk, and he must \n     be delighted that Republicans are fighting with each other \n     rather than with him.\n       Restrictionists like Sens. Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions are \n     offering their familiar advice to fight harder and hold firm \n     against ``executive amnesty,'' but as usual their strategy \n     for victory is nowhere to be found. So Republicans are now \n     heading toward the same cul de sac that they did on the \n     ObamaCare government shutdown.\n       If Homeland Security funding lapses on Feb. 27, the agency \n     will be pushed into a partial shutdown even as the terrorist \n     threat is at the forefront of public attention with the \n     Charlie Hebdo and Islamic State murders. Imagine if the \n     Transportation Security Administration, a unit of DHS, fails \n     to intercept an Islamic State agent en route to Detroit.\n       So Republicans are facing what is likely to be another \n     embarrassing political retreat and more intra-party \n     recriminations. The GOP's restrictionist wing will blame the \n     leadership for a failure they share responsibility for, and \n     the rest of America will wonder anew about the gang that \n     couldn't shoot straight.\n       The restrictionist caucus can protest all it wants, but it \n     can't change 54 Senate votes into 60 without persuading some \n     Democrats. It's time to find another strategy. Our advice on \n     immigration is to promote discrete bills that solve specific \n     problems such as green cards for math-science-tech graduates, \n     more H-1B visas, a guest-worker program for agriculture, \n     targeted enforcement and legal status for the dreamers. \n     Democrats would be hard-pressed to oppose them and it would \n     put the onus back on Mr. Obama. But if that's too much for \n     the GOP, then move on from immigration to something else.\n       It's not too soon to say that the fate of the GOP majority \n     is on the line. Precious weeks are wasting, and the \n     combination of weak House leadership and a rump minority \n     unwilling to compromise is playing into Democratic hands. \n     This is no way to run a Congressional majority, and the only \n     winners of GOP dysfunction will be Mr. Obama, Nancy Pelosi \n     and Hillary Clinton.\n  Mr. REID. I will read parts of the article:\n\n       If Homeland Security funding lapses on Feb. 27, the agency \n     will be pushed into a partial shutdown even as the terrorist \n     threat is at the forefront of public attention with the \n     Charlie Hebdo and Islamic State murders. Imagine if the \n     Transportation Security Administration, a unit of DHS, fails \n     to intercept an Islamic State agent en route to Detroit.\n       So Republicans are facing what is likely to be another \n     embarrassing political retreat and more intra-party \n     recriminations. The GOP's restrictionist wing will blame the \n     leadership for a failure they share responsibility for, and \n     the rest of America will wonder anew about the gang that \n     couldn't shoot straight.\n\n  This is about as serious as anything could be. We need to fund this \nagency which is so vitally important to our country. We need to pass a \nclean bill--the bipartisan bill that Speaker Boehner and the majority \nleader agreed to in November--and give the American people the \nprotection they deserve. Anything less is not good, is a disaster for \nour country, and really is very, very bad to protect our homeland.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst).

Madam President, last Wednesday, President Obama made a \nstatement that is troubling to me. I think those of us who believe in \nExecutive leadership and honest leadership, where leaders talk directly \nto the people about the serious problems we face, have to be troubled \nby this trend with this administration. Sometimes it makes me fear for \nthe future of the Republic. He accused Republicans of ``defunding the \nvery operations that are involved in making sure we've got strong \nborder security.'' He said Republicans are blocking funding of that. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  The House of Representatives--the Republican House--has passed a bill \nwith $40 billion, funding fully, as basically the President requested, \nall the agencies in the Department of Homeland Security. It has one \nlittle catch to it; it bars the President from taking money from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security that is supposed to be used to enforce \nthe law and using that to grant amnesty and to undermine the law. The \nHouse bill is not in any way undermining the security of the United \nStates of America, the ability for Homeland Security to protect us from \nterrorists. In fact, it strengthens that ability because it keeps the \nmoney there and uses it for those purposes, whereas right now the \nPresident is spending over $100 million to create a structure across \nthe river that would hire 1,000 new people in Homeland Security to \nprocess amnesty applications for people who violated the law and to \ngive them the right to have earned income tax credit benefits, a Social \nSecurity card, the ability to take any job in the American economy that \nmaybe an unemployed American would like to have or a recent immigrant \nwith a green card would like to have. No, this person who entered the \ncountry now unlawfully gets to take that job under this policy. \nCongress did not fund that. But it funded the laws of the agency. The \nPresident, as he said himself 20 times, had no power to do this.\n  So what is happening now in the Senate, colleagues? Our Democratic \ncolleagues now unanimously, it appears, are blocking even moving to the \nbill that funds Homeland Security. So I ask, with all sincerity, how \ncan it be said that the Republicans are failing to fund the operations \nmaking sure we have strong border security? How can that be made a \nstatement by the President of the United States?\n  I think we need to keep talking about that. We should not allow these \nmodern-age politicians to go to the American people with false stories \nabout what is happening. The Democratic Members of this Senate are \nsystematically blocking the bill we would like to see come to the floor \nthat fully funds Homeland Security. They have been given the right, as \nSenator McConnell has repeatedly stated--which Senator Reid never did--\nthey have been given the right to offer any amendments they would like \nthat are relevant and germane to the bill. So I would say this is a \nmost serious thing with me, and I believe the American people need to \nunderstand it.\n  The House bill will not deny a single penny of funding for legitimate \nlawful operations of Homeland Security. It will be spent on enforcing \nthe law, enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act that was \nactually passed by Congress.\n  What the President is attempting to do is to create and execute a law \nCongress rejected. He asked the House to pass this law and the House \nsaid, no, they did not agree with this policy and rejected it. So he is \nexecuting it anyway.\n  Senate Republicans have attempted to move the bill to the floor three \ntimes, and each time it has been blocked by our Democratic colleagues \nbecause the bill does not fund the President's unlawful Executive \namnesty that he admitted 20 separate times he did not have the power to \ndo.\n  Congress, colleagues, is supposed to spend the taxpayers' money \nwisely. Congress should not fund any program, no matter how much the \nPresident wants it, that they believe is bad policy. More importantly, \nmore clearly, no Senator should vote to fund a Presidential policy that \nviolates the law, that violates the Constitution, that distorts the \nrelationship between the Congress, which makes laws, and the President, \nwho is supposed to execute only the laws Congress makes. So that is \nwhere we are at this point.\n  The President is not entitled to spend taxpayer money to implement a \nsystem of immigration that Congress has rejected. An article in \nyesterday's Washington Times is further indication of where we are in \nthis world of politics. It was reported that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is spending taxpayer money to set up hotlines for illegal \nimmigrants to call in to with any complaints they may have about \nimmigration law enforcement officers if they think the officers have \nviolated their ``rights'' under President Obama's Executive amnesty--\nnot violating their rights under law--but the President has told them \nthis and sent out this message to the stakeholder groups.\n  Now who are the stakeholder groups? I suppose they are the activist \ngroups. That is how they refer to them: stakeholders. So they send out \nthis message: If you are not happy with the way the Federal agency is \nexecuting my policy but indeed those agencies are attempting to enforce \nthe law as written, then you have a ``right'' to call in to this \nhotline, and I will get on them, and I will see that they do it.\n  So how do the officers feel about this? National Border Patrol \nCouncil vice president Shawn Moran said this in a response. First, let \nme tell you, the Border Patrol officers in the USCIS--the Citizenship \nand Immigration Services officers--have opposed the President's \nExecutive amnesty. Their association has laid out how it will make the \nproblem worse, it will increase the risk of terrorist attacks, and \notherwise further degrade the integrity of our legal system. They have \nbeen clear about this. We ought to listen to them. They enforce that \nlaw repeatedly. That is their duty. They have opposed bills that they \nthink may look good on the surface but once they have read them and \nfound out the bill will not work effectively, they speak out against \nthat, which is very helpful, and I am glad they do.\n  Well, this is what Mr. Moran said:\n\n       Instead of supporting our agents, this administration had \n     decided it is more important to find new ways to solicit \n     complaints and invite ridicule against them.\n\n  The American people have to know that the Obama administration's \ndereliction of duty relating to our immigration system did not begin \nwith this recent decree. From the day he took office, the President has \nrelentlessly and systematically, colleagues, friends, the American \npeople, dismantled immigration enforcement. It is far more serious than \nyou would imagine.\n  My office has compiled a 49-page baseline timeline of nearly 200 \nspecific entries and events that occurred since 2009 detailing how the \nlaw of the United States has been undermined by directives and orders \nfrom the President of the United States. It is step by step. This one \nperson alone, the President, has acted against the will of the American \npeople and undermined the law in America.\n  Just briefly, I will mention the first event that came to my mind. \nWhen he took office in early 2009, I believe in the State of \nWashington, the officers, doing their duty, enforcing the law that says \na business cannot hire somebody unlawfully in America, investigated a \nbusiness in Washington, discovered quite a number of people unlawfully \nin America, and were to commence action against the business for \nviolating plain law that is still on the books and has not been \nrepealed. And what happened? Immediately, the President intervened. He \ntold them: No. Do not do this. And he told the activist groups--the La \nRazas and the other activist groups that were engaged in pushing him on \nthis issue--essentially, he told them: Look, I am going to honor the \npromise I made to you during the campaign--that is the way I would \ninterpret it--not to allow this kind of lawful activity to happen in \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\n  So from day one, the law officers of our country got a clear message. \nWhat was the message? If you go out and enforce the law, you will get \nin trouble. If you do not say anything and do not do anything and stay \nback and lay back and not enforce the law, everything will be OK. That \nbegan the situation.\n  Here are just some of the highlights that I circled and looked at.\n  This was the Bellingham, WA, case I just mentioned, detaining 28 \nillegal immigrants who were using false, fake Social Security \ndocuments.\n  On January 29, 2009, in April of 2009, and June of 2009, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano delays the E-Verify \ndeadlines. E-Verify is a system by which businesses are supposed to \ncheck a person's Social Security Number to find out if it is valid \nbefore they hire them. Many times we know people have used false Social \nSecurity Numbers to get work. She delayed that. Then she delayed it \nagain in April, and delayed it again in June.\n  In June of 2010, the ICE union--the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officers--they are three basic groups: the ICE group, there \nis the Border Patrol group, and the Citizenship and Immigration \nServices group that processes the paperwork. The ICE union cast a \nunanimous vote of ``no confidence'' in the agency Homeland Security \nleadership, including ICE Director John Morton and Assistant Director \nPhyllis Coven, citing ``the growing dissatisfaction and concern among \nICE employees'' that they ``have abandoned the Agency's''--ICE's--\n``core mission of enforcing United States Immigration Laws and \nproviding for public safety, and have instead directed their attention \nto campaigning for programs and policies related to amnesty.''\n  He said the policy of this government--not what we as sworn officers \nare supposed to be enforcing, but the policy of our leaders is to spend \nall their time campaigning for policies related to amnesty and \nundermining enforcement.\n  ICE officers went so far, colleagues, as to file a lawsuit in Federal \ncourt contending they were being ordered to violate the law by their \nsupervisors. A judge expressed sympathy for them but eventually decided \nthey didn't have standing to proceed with the case, but I think it is \nstill on appeal.\n  In 2011, at a roundtable with amnesty advocates, President Obama \nadmitted his deportation statistics were misleading. Indeed, they have \nbeen. They claim they have increased deportation, but that is totally \nincorrect. They finally had to admit it.\n  In February of 2012 President Obama slashed the budget for the 287(g) \nProgram, a program that I helped advocate for and moved forward when I \ncame to the Senate 10 years ago. It simply says the Federal Government \nwill work with State and local law enforcement officers to train them \nin the things they can legally do to help the Federal officers enforce \nthe law. It is a perfectly sensible program, and it is very popular. A \nnumber of States have taken quite a step toward it. It was working in \nan effective way, and they canceled it after he took office.\n  They announced the delay in the biometric entry-exit visa system in \nFebruary of last year. An inspector general audit revealed declines in \nworkplace enforcement of substantial amounts as a direct result of \nWhite House policies, and they admit the Obama administration \nmanipulated deportation data.\n  In March of last year a new report revealed that the ICE officers----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I want to briefly address the nominee we will be \nvoting on this afternoon and then turn to the matter the three of us \nwish to address.\n  Today the Senate is going to vote on the nomination of Michael \nBotticelli to be the next Director of National Drug Control Policy. I \nlook forward to working with our Nation's next drug czar just as I have \nwith previous drug czars.\n  Drug abuse is a serious problem in my home State. Kentucky is the \nfifth highest prescribing State when it comes to pain killers, and we \nhave the Nation's third highest drug overdose mortality rate, with many \ndeaths driven by prescription pain killers.\n  Heroin abuse is also a problem in the Bluegrass State. Heroin deaths \naccounted for 32 percent of the drug overdoses back in 2013, and they \ncontinue to climb. The epicenter of the heroin problem is located in \nthe northern region across the river from Cincinnati, although I am \nhearing more and more from constituents that drug abuse is rising in \nother parts of the Commonwealth as well.\n  All told, the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy reports that \nabout 1,000 Kentuckians lose their lives overdosing on drugs every \nyear, which is more than we lose in fatal car crashes.\n  There is another reason I am pleased to welcome prior drug czar Gil \nKerlikowski to tour Kentucky. We had him there a couple of years ago to \ntake a closeup look at the problems we face. He visited Louisville, \nLexington, London, and Pikeville--four communities, both urban and \nrural, across the State. He met with Kentuckians who worked to tackle \nthis issue from every single angle--public health officials, medical \nprofessionals, law enforcement officials, drug courts, members of the \nbusiness community, and Kentuckians involved with prevention. The drug \nczar's visit helped focus more Federal attention and Federal resources \non this issue, and in a time of strained budgets, the extra attention \nand those extra resources are particularly important.\n  I am also pleased to report that Mr. Botticelli plans to visit \nEastern Kentucky soon. He also plans, at my invitation, to visit \nNorthern Kentucky this spring. Visits such as these help ensure \ncontinued Federal focus on Kentucky's drug problem, and I look forward \nto working with the next drug czar to move closer to the day when drug \nabuse is no longer ravaging our families and our communities.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McConnell, Mr. Alexander, and Mr. Enzi pertaining \nto the introduction of S.J.

Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Michael \nBotticelli in our effort today to confirm him as Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy.\n  The State of Massachusetts, like too many other regions of this \nNation, is being ravaged by the scourge of prescription drug and heroin \naddiction that is breaking apart families and burying communities under \na mountain of despair. Massachusetts experienced 114 deaths in \nDecember, and that doesn't count our biggest cities, such as Boston and \nWorcester and Springfield.\n  Drug overdose deaths fueled by prescription pain killers now claim \nmore lives than car accidents nationwide. Approximately 100 Americans \ndie from an overdose every day.\n  As a Senator from Massachusetts, I have a deep appreciation and \nrespect for Michael Botticelli's accomplishments addressing addiction \nduring his nearly two decades serving in the Massachusetts Department \nof Public Health. He is a public health and drug policy pioneer, and he \nlived in my hometown of Malden, MA, while he did this job.\n  Immediately prior to joining the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy as Deputy Director, Mr. Botticelli was the director of the \nBureau of Substance Abuse Services at the Massachusetts\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nDepartment of Public Health. While he was there, he pioneered \ninnovative, effective approaches to substance abuse challenges. He was \nresponsible for launching a program that expanded treatment and \nrecovery opportunities in local community health centers, including a \nfocus on providing a continuum of care for those suffering with \nsubstance use disorders. Mr. Botticelli also expanded innovative and \nnationally recognized prevention strategies. He established and \nimplemented evidence-based jail diversion programs, reentry services \nfor those leaving State and county correctional facilities, and \noverdose prevention programs.\n  Although there is always more work to be done, it is because of Mr. \nBotticelli's efforts and the legacy he left behind that Massachusetts \nis in many ways a national leader in addressing the prescription and \nheroin abuse epidemic.\n  Mr. Botticelli has been very public about his personal history of \nstruggling with an alcohol use disorder as a young professional and \nseeking help that has led him into long-term recovery. He recently \ncelebrated 26 years of sobriety, and I applaud him for that.\n  Mr. Botticelli's personal life experiences have provided him a unique \nperspective on the epidemic facing our Nation. When he joined me at a \nrecent roundtable I convened in Boston about this crisis, he spoke \nabout it in human terms. He reminded us that there is a family, a loved \none, a friend, or a child behind each and every one of these \nstatistics. His openness about his own struggles and his path to \nrecovery helped shed much needed light on the issue of addiction, which \nhas lurked too long in the shadows of shame and stigma. I think his \nstory helps others to seek treatment and begin a life of recovery. He \ntruly is leading by his own personal example.\n  The drug problems facing our country have changed dramatically since \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy was created in 1988. Mr. \nBotticelli has an excellent understanding of the mission of this \noffice, the changing needs of the addiction community, and the urgency \nfor solutions to halting the rise of substance use disorders in this \ncountry. I believe he is going to make a superlative Director, bringing \nhis strong heart, keen mind, and Malden, MA, roots to the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy. I am honored to speak in support of his \nnomination on the floor today and look forward to working with him in \nthe years to come. I recommend in the strongest possible terms Michael \nBotticelli for the Office of Director of the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to speak about the Ukraine. Lord \nknows the President of the United States has enough on his plate, and \nhe is trying to make the right decisions about what to do in giving \nassistance to the Ukrainian people and to the Ukrainian army to hold \noff Vladimir Putin's troops that are masquerading as rebels but, in \nfact, are bringing in Russian equipment and Russian soldiers who put on \ndifferent uniforms. It is because of that that I think the wise choice \nwould be for the United States to give lethal armaments to the \nUkrainian people.\n  I was there in August. I spoke with all the members of the \ngovernment--the Prime Minister, the Defense Minister, the Foreign \nMinister, the head of their Defense Council. At the time, I was \nsurprised that they did not ask for lethal assistance but instead \nwanted up-to-the-minute intelligence, which was so important, and \ntraining. If my memory serves me correctly, in the Defense bill we \nprovided about $350 million for that assistance. But the question of \nlethal armaments so that they can withstand the Russian tanks--if we \nwant them to be successful--is exceptionally important in this \nSenator's mind and point of view.\n  There is another reason. Mrs. Merkel is in town today, and her \nposition is that she does not want Europe to provide lethal assistance. \nWell, Germany, of course, is not sharing a geographic line with the \nformer Soviet Union, now Russia, and Germany is not feeling the heat, \neven though a major component and member of NATO, like so many of the \nother NATO members farther to the east.\n  Some of the Baltic States--Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania--have \nsubstantial Russian populations. They are frightened of the realistic \npossibility of Putin, who has successfully taken a Russian-speaking \npart of Ukraine--namely, Crimea, which fell into his hand like a ripe \nplum--now moving on other parts of eastern Ukraine to establish a land \nbridge down to Crimea. What they fear is that suddenly the Russian army \nwill amass on their border and use as a pretext, as Putin has done in \neastern Ukraine, the coming in and rescuing and protecting of the \nRussian-speaking elements of those particular countries, particularly \nin the Baltics. There is a huge percentage of the population in Estonia \nthat is Russian, likewise in Latvia and also Lithuania.\n  I met with the President of Lithuania, a woman whom a lot of people \nrefer to in very admiring terms as a tough cookie, and that is apparent \nwhen you meet her. But the concerns about the Russian aggression are \nclearly there. They are very concerned that if eastern Ukraine falls, \nthey will be next.\n  I think that is another reason that these courageous people who, \nafter the break up of the Soviet Union, had so many years of corruption \nand bad government--now having thrown off the shackles of corruption, \nhaving a new government after all of those protests in the center of \nthe capital city of Ukraine--I think it is incumbent upon us to help \nthat little country defend itself against Russian aggression. When a \nRussian tank is bearing down on you, you need something that can \npenetrate the steel armor of that tank in order to stop that tank and \nall the other tanks from advancing.\n\n  I will stop right there and shift gears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S847-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Madam President, the clock is ticking at the Department \nof Homeland Security, and we are about to run out of money. We will run \nout of money at the end of this month. If we get into a situation where \nthe Department that is tasked with the protection of national security \nhere at home does not have the funding to protect our borders, to \nprotect the central location that directs our defense against cyber \nattacks, to protect us as we get on airplanes through TSA, and to \npatrol the waters of the coastal United States through our Coast \nGuard--if we don't have the money appropriated, then that, to this \nSenator, is inexcusable.\n  This is all over a dispute about immigration because some people want \nto have it their way and only their way, and therefore, they cannot \nstand that the President has the legal authority to issue an Executive \norder. That is not the way to protect ourselves against all of these \nadversaries.\n  When I came to Washington as a young Congressman many moons ago, it \nwas very clearly understood that partisan politics stopped at the \nwater's edge. When it came to matters of national security, there were \nno partisan politics. When it came to matters of foreign policy, there \nwere no partisan politics. Oh my, how times have changed.

Madam President, the third and last subject I wish to \naddress is the launch of a major spacecraft/satellite which will be for \nthe interest of the United States and the free world. Hopefully, that \nwill take place tomorrow evening around 6 p.m.\n  I was at the Cape last night thinking that the Discovery satellite \nwas going to be launched atop a Falcon rocket on pad 40 at the Cape \nCanaveral Air Force Station. All systems were go, save for the radar \nsystem on the eastern test range of the Air Force Operational Test and \nEvaluation Center. The radar system went down, and they obviously \ncannot launch a rocket if they can't track it precisely, just in case \nit were to err from its course and had to be destroyed. So it was \npostponed. It has now been rescheduled for tomorrow night at \napproximately 6 p.m.\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\n  Why is this important? It is important because there are three major \ninstruments. There are many more, but I will only mention three. No. 1, \nit will constantly aim an instrument at the Sun so when there is an \nadditional solar explosion, which is a nuclear explosion on the face of \nthe Sun, and all that additional radiation starts coming in what is \nknown as solar wind to the United States, we can prepare for that \nnuclear radiation and save our satellites, save certain electrical grid \nsystems, and warn pilots who are flying a route over the poles where \nthe magnetic field of the Earth does not protect and repel against the \nnuclear radiation coming from the Sun, which is extremely important to \ncommercial satellites, commercial systems on the ground, and is \nespecially important to our military warning satellites.\n  We are fortunate there is a satellite that was put up in the late \n1990s. Its acronym is ACE. It had a design life of 5 years, which would \nhave been the early 2000s. This little satellite keeps producing. It \nmeasures the solar wind, or nuclear radiation, coming from the Sun \nabout every 40 minutes. It was supposed to have been dead years ago. It \nis still perking.\n  This satellite will replace it and will warn us of a nuclear blast--\nnot every 40 minutes but much more rapidly, like every 1 or 2 minutes, \nwhich will give us the ability to save our systems on the ground and in \norbit. That is one instrument.\n  Now, since this payload will be at a neutrally buoyant point where \nthe Earth's gravitational pull stops and the Sun's gravitational pull \nstops--called the Lagrangian Point No. 1, or L-1, between the Earth and \nthe Sun--which is a little less than 1 million miles from the Earth, \nand because the gravitational pull of the Sun is much greater--it is \nabout 92 million miles from the Sun--it will stay there and constantly \nlook at the Sun in one direction, and in the other direction it looks \nat the Earth.\n  These are the other two instruments. One instrument will constantly \nmeasure the heat coming from the Sun that is being absorbed by the \nEarth, and that instrument then also measures the amount of heat that \nis reflected off of the Earth and radiated back out into space.\n  So if you want to measure exactly how the Earth is heating up, you \nget this very precise measurement of what is being absorbed minus what \nis being radiated back out into space, and you will know exactly how \nmuch heat the Earth is absorbing and how this planet is heating up.\n  The final instrument is one that was conceived of by then-Vice \nPresident Al Gore, who at my invitation was there yesterday. I don't \nknow if he is going to be able to stay over until tomorrow to see the \nlaunch.\n  What Al Gore knew was that 42 years ago was the last time we had a \nfull sunlit picture of the Earth. It was by the Apollo 17 astronauts on \nthe face of the moon. They got the Earth just at the exact time. They \nwere able to photograph one-half of the Earth, which was lit by the Sun \nbehind the astronauts on the moon. That was the last time we had a \nfull, live picture of the Earth.\n  We have had many other pictures, but what they are is a strip here \nand a snippet there, and they are all stitched together--even though \nthey were taken at different times--to make a composite of what the \nEarth looks like.\n  What the satellite Discovery will do, as its camera looks straight \nback at Earth, taking about 13 photographs in a 24-hour period, since \nthe satellite is between the Earth and the Sun, it is able to look back \nwith the telephoto lens and it will always see the sunlit side of the \nentire side of the Earth as it rotates on its axis every 24 hours and \nas it rotates around the Sun every 365 days. That will give us a new \nperspective of the overview effect of what this home that we call \nplanet Earth is and what it looks like on a daily basis every 2 hours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S848-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S848-S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, the Keystone legislation is likely to \nmove to the President's desk this week after the House takes it up, and \nhe will veto it. The votes are not there to override a veto, either in \nthe Senate or the House. Legislation has a natural lifecycle, and this \npiece of legislation is reaching the end of its lifecycle. This debate \nis almost over.\n  So where are we when it comes to American energy policy? The debate \nthat occurred on Keystone was no doubt an important one, but it was \nexactly upside down. Congress and the media treated the Keystone bill \nas if it would settle American energy policy once and for all, when in \nfact it was and is a tiny sliver of debate. American energy policy is \nnot defined by one project or one piece of infrastructure, however \ncontentious it may be.\n  In order to have a real energy conversation, we have to agree on the \nfacts, and this body cannot be the only place where there is a lack of \nconsensus on the basic facts. That is why Senator Whitehouse's \namendment, my amendment, Senator Hoeven's amendment, and those of many \nothers were so important.\n  Last month's climate votes were illuminating and encouraging. First, \nSenator Whitehouse's language, which simply stated that climate change \nwas not a hoax, received a nearly unanimous vote. Believe it or not, \nthat is progress. My amendment, which stated that climate change is \nreal, caused by humans, and has real and significant impacts, received \na bare majority of the votes, with five Republicans supporting it. \nSenator Hoeven's amendment had similar language, as well as some pro-\nKeystone language, and it attracted a dozen or so Republican votes.\n  What is the significance of all of this? It is very simple. Without \nacknowledging the problem, we cannot even begin to work on it. The wall \nof denial has begun to crack. So now we have a majority--and depending \non how it is phrased, even a potential supermajority--in the Senate \nsaying that climate change is real.\n  Now, most every serious person in public life either admits the basic \nfacts of climate change or is on their way to getting there, and that \nis a good thing. Now the question is: What should we do? Given our \nregional differences, ideological differences, and the partisan divide, \nwhat comes next?\n  Later this year or next, we will see efforts to repeal a number of \nimportant environmental rules, especially the administration's clean \npower plan, which will regulate carbon pollution from existing and new \npowerplants, but that too is highly unlikely to result in anything \nother than a Presidential veto.\n  So are there any areas for potential common ground?\n  I think we saw real glimmers of hope and possibility during the \nKeystone debate. Several of my Republican colleagues made the argument \nduring the debate on Keystone that while climate change is a real \nproblem, we must be aware of how energy costs influence economic \nactivity.\n  I could not agree more. We don't hear this often from folks on my \nside of the debate, but price matters. No climate policy is a real \nsolution unless it strengthens both the national and global economies. \nAs we pursue clean energy, we must understand its impacts on \nconsumers--especially individuals and families in lower income \ncommunities--as well as businesses. We miss an opportunity to find \ncommon ground if we move too quickly past the questions of cost and the \nsocial and economic context in which this transition is going to occur.\n  We can contend with these challenges in Congress through a \nlegislative solution. We can create incentives, create market-based \nmechanisms, look at regional differences, and fund R to help develop \nnew and less-expensive solutions. EPA certainly has the authority and \nthe obligation under the law to regulate carbon and other greenhouse \ngases. I support the President's Clean Power Plan because carbon \npollution is real and it ought to be regulated under the Clean Air Act. \nIf we want to be more comprehensive and if we want to be more nuanced \nand more flexible and more responsive to communities, we need a bill. \nStructured properly, a bill has the advantage of creating economically \nefficient solutions that can reduce carbon pollution from a much wider \nrange of sources. That is why a well-designed fee on carbon is critical \nfor our economy and our environment.\n  I understand the politics are nearly impossible right now, but if we \nthink\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nabout our ability as legislators to remunerate communities struggling \nduring a transition, to ameliorate certain economic challenges, we may \nagree that legislating provides us the tools to achieve greater \npollution reductions at a much lower social and economic cost. So once \nthe Clean Power Plan is established, once it is litigated, and once it \nis full-on reality, I believe there may be room for compromise.\n  One more point on the issue of price. We have to do our calculations \non an all-in basis. That includes tax expenditures, environmental \ndamage, health impacts, and other so-called externalities. There is \nplenty of good research which indicates that clean energy technology is \nalready competitive with fossil fuel technology when all costs are \nadded in. Additionally, the cost of solar, wind, and energy efficiency \nis dropping precipitously and in many places is competing successfully \nin the free market, even before we consider the costs of pollution.\n  We will have a couple of battles that are unavoidable--on the Clean \nPower Plan and likely another run at Keystone--but there are a couple \nof areas that in my view don't have to be a battle. They are energy \nefficiency and energy research.\n  We ought to start with the Shaheen-Portman energy efficiency \nlegislation. I have little doubt that Democrats would support this as a \nstand-alone bill. Energy efficiency is just common sense, and the \nenergy experts remind us of an idea our mothers and fathers taught us \ngrowing up: waste not, want not. In other words, the straightest line \ntoward saving money for people, businesses, and institutions is to help \nthem adopt the latest energy efficiency practices and technologies.\n  Even this has unfortunately become a partisan issue in the last \nseveral Congresses with people worried that light bulb efficiency \nstandards were part of some Orwellian plot. But that is not what these \nDepartment of Energy standards do, and it is not what Shaheen-Portman \ndoes.\n  At its core, energy efficiency is simply this: Use less but get the \nsame result. Using less means paying less. Getting the same result \nmeans not having to sacrifice our way of life. The idea is not to ask \npeople to do without, the idea is to just get more for our money. It is \nan old-school, conservative idea. Of course the Shaheen-Portman bill \ndoesn't cost the taxpayers a dime, and projections are that it will \ncreate nearly 200,000 jobs.\n  I also think there is a lot of room for good bipartisan work in \nadvanced technology research in the energy space--the kind the \nDepartment of Energy did for the State of Hawaii in developing a grid \nsystem that can accommodate unprecedented levels of intermittent \nrenewable energy, the kind that made major advances in hydraulic \nfracturing, the kind that has helped the price of solar panels drop 80 \npercent since 2008, the kind that is making breakthroughs in battery \nstorage, which has fallen in price by 40 percent since 2010, and the \nkind that is working on carbon capture and sequestration.\n  America must lead on energy, and that requires us to do the kind of \nbasic research that private companies can eventually use. A relatively \nsmall increase in research funding--both on the fossil and renewable \nside--has been shown to make an enormous impact on our economy. \nInvestments in renewable and fossil fuel electricity generation, \ndistribution, and transmission systems, grid stability and security, \nand fuel systems will enable America to lead in energy for decades to \ncome.\n  These are the kinds of investments we would see in a comprehensive \nenergy bill. I was so encouraged last week that the chairwoman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senator from Alaska, has \nindicated her desire to pursue comprehensive legislation this Congress. \nThe Senator from Alaska is a very skilled bipartisan legislator, and I \nam looking forward to working with her on these issues. I am especially \nencouraged by her openness to climate provisions as part of that bill, \nsomething she mentioned as recently as last week. Just as she has \nlistened to the concerns I and others have raised about climate change \nduring the Keystone debate, so should we listen to her call for \nreliable, affordable, clean, and diverse energy supplies.\n  Several energy proposals contained within the President's fiscal year \nbudget could become a part of a bipartisan bill, including ideas to \nmore fully promote carbon capture and sequestration technologies and \nprotect coal workers and their communities as we transition. The \nconcerns of communities that have coal-based economies are real and \nlegitimate and I believe any true climate solution must prioritize \nsolutions for every American. The President recognized that and \nproposed $55 million next year to help affected communities diversify \ntheir economies, offer job training, and ensure a good transition.\n  This will require compromise. It will require those of us on the left \nto concede that fossil fuels aren't going to disappear instantaneously, \nand it will require those on the right to recognize that investing in \nclean energy technologies doesn't necessarily mean picking winners and \nlosers. We have wind energy in nearly all States--in fact, more in \nRepublican than in Democratic States--and we have tea party members \neverywhere who love the freedom and liberty that distributed \ngeneration--rooftop solar--offers. We also have clean energy \nprogressives, including myself, who understand that we have to deal \nwith the energy system we have, not the one we wish we had.\n  The areas I have mentioned are not the only opportunities for \nbipartisan compromise, but we do need to start a dialogue, either on \nthe floor, in committees or in informal discussions, about what we can \nactually do. As we consider a policy solution, let's ask the following \nquestions: Can it be enacted into law? Will it advance American energy \nsecurity? Will it strengthen the economy and provide economic growth? \nWill it reduce pollution?\n  There are a few areas where we are going to fight--there is no \navoiding it--and that is OK. But there is, for the first time since I \narrived, a glimmer of hope that we may be able to find common ground on \nsome of these issues and begin a serious discussion about tackling \nAmerican energy policy and climate change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is the first time I have come to \nthe floor to speak on this issue while the Senator from Iowa has been \npresiding. Over the last 2 years, since the mass tragedy in my State, \nin Sandy Hook, CT, I have come to the floor once every week or so to \ngive voice to victims of gun violence all across this country. I have \ntold the story of the beautiful 6- and 7-year-olds as well as the \nteachers and professionals who were killed that day.\n  The fact is that every day across this country there are two to three \nSandy Hooks that happen. There are 86 people killed by guns every day \nin this country, 2,600 a month, and over 30,000 a year. The statistics, \nunfortunately, have not compelled this body to action. We have done \nnothing--zero--about this national tragedy since Sandy Hook. That is a \nstain upon the conscience of this body that is impossible to erase. My \nhope is that by coming to the floor and speaking about who these people \nactually are, maybe it will prompt us to have a conversation about how \nwe can make sure these numbers aren't eliminated; they are never going \nto go away but to make sure they are lower, that they are less than \nthese numbers, the highest in the developed world.\n  Let me speak first about an extraordinary young man, 44 years old, \nwho was killed on January 20--just about 2 weeks ago--in Boston, MA. \nHis name was Dr. Michael Davidson. He was shot by a gunman who walked \ninto Brigham and Women's Hospital. The gunman was the relative of \nsomeone who had been under the care of Dr. Davidson who clearly had \nsome major illness that prompted him to think he could solve his grief \nby shooting the doctor who had cared for his loved one. Dr. Davidson \nwas known at Brigham and Women's Hospital for his gentle way\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\nwith patients and their families and his willingness to operate on the \nmost delicate hearts. He used to lie awake at night worrying about his \npatients. He was always receiving letters about the great care he \nprovided. He wanted to be a cardiovascular surgeon from the time he was \na little boy, which is a pretty exceptional thing. As renowned as he \nwas as a physician, what he truly will be remembered for was for being \na father to three children, and he and his wife were waiting for their \nfourth to arrive, due this April.\n  At his funeral nearly 1,000 people were there to hear his wife say:\n\n       By now, you've all heard that my husband, Michael Davidson, \n     was a superb physician. Perhaps, most importantly, he cared \n     immensely for his patients and their families. That is why \n     the fact that a patient's family member would take Michael \n     away from us makes it all the more devastating.\n\n  A brilliant surgeon and a wonderful father taken away from us at age \n44 in Boston, MA.\n  Everyone by now has heard the story from December 20, where two New \nYork City police officers were killed by a mentally ill man who drove \nto New York with the intention of killing police officers. Wenjian Liu \nhad been in this country almost 20 years to the day--an American dream \nstory personified. His family came to this country from China to seek a \nbetter life. He came here on Christmas Eve, 1994. He wanted to be a \npolice officer because he wanted to give back to his community. Liu \nonce said:\n\n       I know that being a cop is dangerous but I must do it. If I \n     don't do it and you don't do it, then who is going to do it?\n\n  It is that kind of commitment that was shown by him that day by the \nvery fact that he was in the car. He wasn't scheduled to work, but he \nvolunteered to work a fill-in shift when a fellow officer was late. \nThat is just how he was.\n  Rafael Ramos, otherwise known as Ralph Ramos, was in that car as \nwell. He wanted to be a police officer so badly that when he was \npreparing to join the police academy, he took a petition door to door \nthroughout his whole neighborhood asking for his neighbors to testify \nto his character. He is remembered as a good police officer but also as \nsomeone who shoveled all the sidewalks in his neighborhood, took his \ntwo boys to a nearby park over and over to play basketball, always with \na smile on his face. He was hours away from becoming a lay chaplain. \nOne of his dreams was to go into the ministry. He is remembered by \nfriends and family as someone committed to his family, committed to his \njob, but also committed to his faith.\n\n  These two police officers were killed by a man named Ismaaiyl \nBrinsley. He was a deeply mentally ill man, someone who had tried to \ncommit suicide and who had become completely isolated from his family \nand from his peers. When I read his story, it struck me as not \ncompletely dissimilar from the story in Newtown, CT, Adam Lanza. Adam \nLanza was a deeply troubled, deeply mentally ill young man who became \nisolated from his peers and from his family. We can't completely \nunderstand what caused him to do what he did that day, nor what Mr. \nBrinsley was thinking in his head when he drove to New York to carry \nout those heinous murders.\n  What we know is we have largely abandoned the mentally ill in this \ncountry. We lock them up in prisons rather than treating their \nunderlying illnesses. Over the course of the last half a decade, 4,000 \ninpatient psychiatric beds have been closed all across this country, \nforcing more of the mentally ill out on the streets and into prison and \ninto crisis. You know, the Federal law authorizing the funding we send \nto mental health work in this country--SAMHSA, that is the agency--has \nnot been reauthorized in a decade. We haven't even debated mental \nhealth policy on the floor of this Senate for a decade. No wonder we \nhave a system that is in crisis.\n  It means in the absence of Federal leadership, private organizations \nare stepping up to the plate. Sandy Hook promised--the group of parents \nof many of those children who were killed has taken up a cause called \nNo One Eats Alone. It is a wonderful cause in which students in high \nschool, middle school, and elementary school cafeterias are asked to \nseek out one or two children who often eat alone, who are socially \nisolated at school, and to reach out and do small things such as \nsitting with them during lunch to remove some sense of social isolation \nthat comes often with children who bring mental illness or learning \ndisabilities to school.\n  That effort is admirable, and it will make a difference. But it \nspeaks to the fact those groups have to step in and do things such as \nthe No One Eats Alone campaign because Congress isn't stepping up to \nthe plate and doing anything about these numbers: 31,000 a year, 2,600 \na month, 86 a day. You know what my feelings are on this. I don't think \nit is just about mental health programming and funding. I think it is \nridiculous 90 percent of Americans think you should have to go through \na background check in order to buy a gun, yet we still won't move \nforward with expanded background checks, and the majority of Americans \nthink that dangerous assault weapons should be for the police and for \nour military and not be able to get into the hands of young, troubled \nmen such as Adam Lanza to be used in mass murder.\n  In the absence over the next 2 years of our ability to come to an \nagreement on changing our gun laws so they reflect where the vast \nmajority of the American public is, let's at least take on the mental \nhealth crisis in this country. Let's at least decide we are going to \nplus-up resources for community mental health providers. We are going \nto rebuild inpatient capacity. We are going to recognize that as angry \nas we are at people such as Ismaaiyl Brinsley and of young men such as \nAdam Lanza, there is a story there of neglect that if we address we can \nlower these numbers even without changes over the next 2 years in our--\nI would argue--very backward national background check laws.\n  I thank you for listening and some of my colleagues for being on the \nfloor today. I know we have a number of people who want to speak. I \nwill continue to come to the floor so my colleagues can hear the \nstories of people such as Officer Ramos, Officer Liu, and heroes such \nas Dr. Michael Davidson so that maybe the voices of these victims can \nprompt us to action.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S850-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S850-S851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AUTHORIZATION ON USE OF MILITARY FORCE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, along with Senator Hatch, we have a \nconcern we want to share with this body. One of the reasons I do is \nbecause I had planned to go ahead and introduce the bill having to do \nwith the AUMF. In fact, I actually had introduced it a year ago, but I \nunderstand now we are coming into an agreement and Senator Hatch and I \nstand together to speak about the need for the new AUMF, authorization \nfor use of military force, against the terrorist organization known as \nISIS or ISIL, or whatever you want to call it, in order to answer any \nlegal question as to the authority the President has to defend the \nAmerican people and demonstrate our commitment to the global coalition \nin defeating this radical Islamic organization.\n  I have always contended the President had this authority anyway. In \nfact, I can remember a year ago he said he did. I now understand the \nPresident will be sending to Congress his own version of the AUMF this \nweek. I will read it with interest.\n  Over the past 6 months, ISIS, or ISIL, has expanded its control in \nIraq and Syria. They continue to recruit followers worldwide. We saw \njust the other day what happened when we had the King of Jordan here \nand we had the opportunity to be with him when he got the very sad news \nof what happened to his F-16 pilot being burned alive. I happened to be \nwith him in Syria just a month before that. I am talking about with the \nKing of Jordan.\n  We know firsthand what is going on. It is my hope the President's \nproposed AUMF will include all the authorities needed to execute his \nstrategy to stop ISIS and the President provides Congress with that \nstrategy as part of any approval for an AUMF.\n  The President's proposed AUMF should not contain restrictions on U.S. \nforces or time or geographic limitations. An AUMF should authorize the \nuse of all necessary and appropriate force anywhere where ISIS or any \nsuccessor organization is operating until we accomplish our strategy.\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\n  At the State of the Union speech last month, President Obama \nspecifically said--and I am quoting now:\n\n       I call on this Congress to show the world that we are \n     united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize \n     the use of force against ISIL. We need that authority.\n\n  That was a quote from his State of the Union Message. Quite frankly, \nhe had already stated before he had that authority. I am not going to \nargue about that. Let's just make sure to eliminate all doubts.\n  Subsequent official White House statements have called for a ``right-\nsized, modernized AUMF...it would send a powerful signal to the \ncitizens of this country, the citizens of our allies, and to our \nenemies.''\n  It was on January 23 that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nGeneral Dempsey said--and I am going to quote General Dempsey's entire \nquote because I think he is the No. 1 guy. He is the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, the one who should be the best qualified to make \nthese decisions.\n  He said:\n\n       I think in the crafting of the AUMF, all options should be \n     on the table, and then we can debate whether we want to use \n     them. But the authorization should be there...In particular, \n     it shouldn't constrain activities geographically, because \n     ISIL knows no boundaries, [and] doesn't recognize any \n     boundaries--in fact it's their intention to erase all \n     boundaries to their benefit. Constraints on time, or a \n     ``sunset clause,'' I just don't think it's necessary. I think \n     the nation should speak of its intent to confront this \n     radical ideological barbaric group and leave the option until \n     we can deal with it.\n\n  That is all a quote from General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. I think we need to listen to it. I don't think \nthe immediate need for an AUMF could be put more clearly or succinctly \nthan General Dempsey's words, and it is my hope he was intimately \ninvolved in the drafting of the administration's AUMF.\n  It is my understanding we will see this tomorrow. Again, I, along \nwith many colleagues--including my good friend from Utah--look forward \nto reading President Obama's AUMF. We have to get rid of this monster.\n  With that, I yield to my good friend from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S851-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S851-S852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGES\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  MR. HATCH. Madam President, today I rise with my friend, the senior \nSenator from Oklahoma, to discuss some of the most pressing national \nsecurity issues the Senate is poised to confront. These matters include \nthe confirmation of Ashton Carter as Secretary of Defense, whose \nnomination I strongly support; and Senator Ayotte's Guantanamo Bay \ndetainee transfer bill, of which I am a cosponsor. Indeed, I applaud \nthe expeditious consideration of Senator Ayotte's bill in the Armed \nServices Committee under the leadership of Senator McCain.\n  These moves come at a critically important time as we continue to \nwitness the spectacles of barbarism perpetrated by the so-called \nIslamic State, or ISIS--aid workers and journalists gruesomely \nbeheaded; Christians tortured and murdered for refusing to convert; and \nmost recently, a captured coalition pilot burned alive.\n  These acts are just a glimpse of the undiluted savagery unleashed by \nthis terrorist organization on the large swath of territory in Iraq and \nSyria that it controls. Even beyond its horrific human rights \nviolations, the Islamic State threatens to destabilize the entire \nMiddle East and it is attempting to undo all that was accomplished by \nour servicemembers in 8 years of blood and sacrifice in Iraq.\n  Most troubling of all, the Islamic State serves as a safe haven for \nterrorist training and planning, similar to Afghanistan prior to the \nSeptember 11 attacks. With the Islamic State's stated intention to \n``raise the flag of Allah in the White House'' and kill ``hundreds of \nmillions'' in a worldwide ``religious cleansing,'' there can be no \ndoubt this organization poses a clear and present danger to the \nnational security of the United States and to our allies, not only in \nthe Middle East but throughout the world. Accordingly, we must fight \nand defeat this dangerous terrorist organization.\n  It is therefore incumbent upon us as legislators to ensure we provide \nall the tools necessary for defeating the enemy. Personally, I agree \nwith the Obama administration's previous determination that the \nPresident has ample powers to conduct operations against the Islamic \nState under article II of the Constitution as well as the existing \nauthorizations for the use of military force passed by Congress in 2001 \nagainst Al Qaeda and the Taliban in 2002 for Iraq. Nevertheless, I \nagree with the President that Congress should authorize the use of \nforce against the Islamic State, not only to put to rest any legal \nquestions about the President's power to use force, but also to \ndemonstrate to the world America's resolve in this fight against \nterror.\n  If we are to pass a new authorization for use of military force, it \nis critically important to ensure that this new law is properly \ncrafted. It will define against whom and under what conditions our \nNation may direct its national might.\n  Therefore, Senator Inhofe and I feel compelled to propose general \nprinciples that we believe should guide this effort, especially since \nit appears the President will send his own draft to Congress shortly. \nSenator Inhofe and I are offering these thoughts with no intention to \nundermine careful consideration of the President's proposal by the \nSenate's national security committees.\n  Furthermore, we do not at all wish to complicate the efforts to reach \nconsensus by laying down demands. Far from it. Rather, our intent is to \nfacilitate the legislative process by outlining some of the elements we \nbelieve to be most crucial for ensuring the success of our \nservicemembers as they confront this great evil.\n  First, the authorization should clearly articulate that the executive \nbranch is authorized to use force--employed in accordance with the law \nof armed conflict--against the Islamic State.\n  Second, the authorization should be flexible enough to be utilized \nnot only against the Islamic State as it appears today, but also in \nwhatever form the organization takes going forward. This flexibility \nshould also include the authority to use force against organizations \nthat are associated with or materially supporting the Islamic State.\n  Finally, and most importantly, the authorization should not impose \nany artificial and unnecessary limitations--such as those based on \ntime, geography, and type of force--that could interfere with our \nstrategic objective of defeating the Islamic State.\n  Unfortunately, many have suggested including such artificial \nlimitations on the use of force in a future authorization. \nSpecifically, many have discussed prohibiting the use of ground forces \nas well as providing an expiration date for the authorization. These \nare restrictions the Islamic State could use to its advantage. If we \nare telling the Islamic State upfront we will not use ground forces, \nwill they not tailor their strategy around that fact? If we advertise \nwhen the authorization expires at an arbitrary date and time, will they \nnot hunker down and wait for that date? Why would we not only \nunilaterally impose limitations as to which types of tools and tactics \nour servicemembers can use, but then also broadcast those limitations \nto the enemy?\n  Indeed, we believe that Congress and the President should heed the \nadvice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin \nDempsey, who stated in an interview on January 23, 2015, that:\n\n       I think in the crafting of the AUMF, all options should be \n     on the table, and then we can debate whether we want to use \n     them. But the authorization should be there. . . . In \n     particular, it shouldn't constrain activities geographically, \n     because ISIL knows no boundaries [and] doesn't recognize any \n     boundaries--in fact it's their intention to erase all \n     boundaries to their benefit. . . . Constraints on time, or a \n     ``sunset clause,'' I just don't think it's necessary. I think \n     the nation should speak of its intent to confront this \n     radical ideological barbaric group and leave the option until \n     we can deal with it.\n\n  Senators Inhofe and I could not agree more. We hope the Congress will \nenact a new authorization based on the principles we are outlining here \ntoday. I want to thank him. I hope our colleagues will take this \nseriously and hopefully we can turn this mess around.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Millions of American families are \nstruggling with an unrelenting addiction to controlled substances. This \nis nothing new and that is the unfortunate part about it. But after \ndecades of taking the wrong path toward treating drug abuse, it appears \nthat we are finally in the midst of a fundamental shift in the way we \nare going to focus and approach this issue.\n  For years we simply considered drug abuse as a crime, to be dealt \nwith by police, prosecutors, and prisons. There is now, however, a near \nconsensus that addiction must be viewed as a public health issue. This \nrequires coordinated investments in prevention and treatment. Law \nenforcement agencies would rather not arrest the same offenders over \nand over without dealing with the underlying addiction. Treating that \naddiction--rather than just punishing the addict--is often the more \neffective, more humane, and less costly approach.\n  There is perhaps no greater advocate for this shift in thinking than \nMichael Botticelli. Throughout his career in public health he has \nworked to bridge gaps between law enforcement, health care, and \neducation providers. As acting director for the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy, ONDCP, he has made clear that we cannot ``incarcerate \naddiction out of people.'' While law enforcement will always play a \nvital role in protecting citizens from drug-related crime, Mr. \nBotticelli recognizes that addiction is a disease--one that can be \nsuccessfully prevented and treated using the same evidence-based \napproach we use for other public health challenges.\n  Mr. Botticelli's nomination was reported out of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously by voice vote last year and again last week. I am \npleased that he continued to receive strong, bipartisan support from \nthe full Senate here today. As director of ONDCP, Mr. Botticelli will \nhelp to coordinate drug-control activities across the Federal \nGovernment. This includes critical efforts such as administering \nfunding for Drug-Free Communities grants and High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Areas. It is no small task. Just last week, the President \nrequested over $12 billion for demand reduction programs. This \nrepresents the largest commitment to treating and preventing drug \naddiction in our Nation's history, and it is badly needed.\n  Much of the country is now confronting a rising challenge: addiction \nto heroin and powerful painkillers. My home State of Vermont has not \nbeen spared, and it has attracted much attention for its struggles with \nopioid abuse. In fact, the film ``The Hungry Heart'' provides a \npowerful portrayal of the damage this addiction has inflicted on \nVermont families. I was honored to host a screening of this moving film \nwith Michael Botticelli last May.\n  However in many ways, Vermont is ahead of the Nation. We in Vermont \nlong ago recognized the problem and began developing new approaches to \naddress it. Dedicated Vermonters working in the traditional roles of \nprevention, treatment, and law enforcement came together around common \ngoals and shared strategies. These community partnerships have produced \ninnovative and successful programs such as the Rapid Intervention \nCommunity Court in Burlington, and Project VISION in Rutland. Last \nyear, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing in Vermont on this issue. \nAs a lifelong Vermonter, what hit me is how everybody came together for \nthis hearing--Republicans, Democrats, Independents, law enforcement, \ndefense counsels, clergy, teachers, medical professionals, parents and \noften those who have been abusers. We all realize there is no single \nanswer, but we can do it better than we have for decades.\n  First responders are saving the lives of addicts throughout the State \nby carrying naloxone. This will save their life instead of some who \nwould die of an overdose. Evidence-based prevention and treatment \nservices have been extended to all corners of Vermont, and barriers to \nrecovery have been significantly reduced. That is the most important \npart.\n  These are all strategies that the ONDCP promotes. Mr. Botticelli \nunderstands that success requires an increased commitment to early \nintervention and education, treatment, and smart criminal justice \npolicies. While the scope of the challenge is immense, Mr. Botticelli \nhas us going in the right direction. Having listened to him, having \ntalked to him, I am really hopeful he will help get us ahead of \naddiction, and help end the misery it inflicts on individuals, \nfamilies, and our communities. I urge my fellow Senators to vote for \nhis immediate confirmation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support \nfor Michael Botticelli as nominee to be the Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy.\n  Mr. Botticelli has more than two decades of experience supporting \nthose who have been affected by substance use and abuse.\n  Prior to joining the Office of National Drug Control Policy in 2012, \nwhen he was confirmed as the Deputy Director, Mr. Botticelli served as \nthe director of the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services at the \nMassachusetts Department of Public Health.\n  While there, he expanded prevention, treatment, and recovery \nservices, and worked to implement evidence-based programs, including a \nyouth treatment system, early intervention and treatment programs, and \noverdose prevention programs.\n  During Mr. Botticelli's tenure as director of the Bureau of Substance \nAbuse Services, he confronted the issues of heroin and prescription \ndrug abuse head-on and worked to ensure that police officers in Quincy, \nMA were trained and equipped to resuscitate overdose victims using \nnaloxone, an emergency opioid overdose reversal medication.\n  Since October 2010, Quincy police officers have administered naloxone \n220 times, almost always resulting in successful overdose reversal. \nThis program has been replicated in communities throughout the country.\n  As chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, \nI had the opportunity to work closely with Mr. Botticelli during his \ntime as Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy.\n  Most recently, Mr. Botticelli testified at a hearing I chaired to \naddress America's addiction to prescription opioids and heroin, where \nhe emphasized the need for increased prescriber education to reduce \nprescription drug abuse and expanded access to naloxone nationwide.\n  In addition, Mr. Botticelli has committed to working with my office \nto address the import, manufacture, and distribution of dangerous \nsynthetic drugs, which take far too many lives, far too early. At a \nprevious hearing on the topic, he provided valuable insight into the \nthreat that synthetic drugs pose and it is my hope that we can continue \nto work together as the Senate considers legislation to address this \nthreat.\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\n  Mr. Botticelli has also been very clear about the fact that marijuana \nremains illegal under the Federal Controlled Substances Act, and has \ndone much to disavow the notion that marijuana is harmless.\n  As a person in recovery himself, Mr. Botticelli brings a unique \nperspective to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I believe \nthis perspective will enable him to successfully implement a national \ndrug control strategy that recognizes the need for both supply and \ndemand reduction and appropriately incorporates an effective public \nhealth approach that is coupled with law enforcement efforts.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with Mr. Botticelli as he leads \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy in implementing a whole of \ngovernment approach to combatting illegal and illicit drug use.\n  I believe Michael Botticelli will serve with distinction as the \nDirector of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, and I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

THE ``JOINT EMPLOYER'' STANDARD, AMERICAN SMALL \n                    BUSINESSES AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nmy remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee hearing last week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Who's the Boss? The ``Joint Employer'' Standard, American Small \n                    Businesses and Employment Growth\n\n       This morning we are having a hearing about who qualifies as \n     a joint employer in the National Labor Relations Board's \n     view.\n       This hearing this morning is about a pending National Labor \n     Relations Board decision that could destroy a small business \n     opportunity for more than 700,000 Americans. These men and \n     women are franchisees. They operate health clubs, barber \n     shops, auto parts shops, child care centers, neighborhood \n     restaurants, music stores, cleaning services, and much more. \n     They use the brand name of companies like Planet Fitness, \n     Merry Maids or Panera Bread. They may work 12 hours a day \n     serving customers, meeting a payroll, dealing with government \n     regulations, paying taxes, and trying to make a profit.\n       We live at a time when Democrats and Republicans bemoan the \n     fact that it's getting harder and harder to climb the \n     economic ladder of success in our country. Successfully \n     operating a franchise business is today one of the most \n     important ways to do that. Why would the pending decision by \n     the National Labor Relations Board threaten this very \n     American way of life, knocking the ladder out from under \n     hundreds of thousands of Americans? The board and its General \n     Counsel are pursuing a change to what is called the ``joint \n     employer'' standard. This standard, or test, has since 1984 \n     required that for a business to be considered a joint \n     employer, it must hold direct control over the terms and \n     conditions of a worker's employment--to decide that, the NLRB \n     looks at who hires and fires, sets work hours, picks \n     uniforms, issues directions to employees, determines \n     compensation, handles day to day supervision, and conducts \n     recordkeeping.\n       Under the changes the NLRB is now considering, it would \n     take just indirect control over the employees' terms and \n     conditions of employment, or even unexercised potential to \n     control working conditions, or where ``industrial realities'' \n     otherwise made it essential to meaningful collective \n     bargaining.\n       So what could this mean for these more than 700,000 \n     franchisees and employers? These franchise companies will \n     find it much more practical to own all their stores and \n     restaurants and day care centers themselves. There will be \n     many more company-owned outposts, rather than franchisee-\n     owned small businesses.\n       Franchisees tell me they expect ``franchisors would be \n     compelled to try to establish control over staffing decisions \n     and daily operations. . . . franchisees would lose their \n     independence and become de facto employees of the \n     franchisor.''\n       This case doesn't just affect franchisees, it will affect \n     every business that uses a subcontractor or contracts out for \n     any service.\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\n     That includes most of the 5.7 million businesses under NLRB \n     jurisdiction in America--because most businesses contract for \n     some service.\n       Consider a local bicycle shop that contracts out its \n     cleaning service under a cost plus provision, in which the \n     cleaner is paid for all of its expenses to a certain limit, \n     plus a profit. If this arrangement is interpreted to create \n     ``indirect control'' or have ``unexercised potential'' over \n     working conditions--they could trigger joint employer \n     obligations. Same thing with a local restaurant that \n     outsources all of its baked goods under a contract that \n     includes penalties for being late or delivering substandard \n     goods--it could be considered a joint employer of the bakery \n     employees.\n       What does it mean to be a joint employer?\n       First, you are required to engage in collective bargaining, \n     and are on the hook for all of the agreements made in \n     collective bargaining, such as salaries, healthcare coverage, \n     and pension obligations. It often takes weeks or months of an \n     employer's time and hefty legal costs to negotiate \n     agreements.\n       Being considered a joint employer also eliminates \n     protection from what are called ``secondary boycotts.'' \n     Current law does not allow a union to boycott companies that \n     do business with their employer in an attempt to apply to \n     pressure to their employer. If the secondary company is \n     instead deemed a joint employer, the union will be able to \n     picket and boycott.\n       Imagine being an employer and having these legal, financial \n     and time burdens placed upon you by a union representing \n     employees you have no real control over.\n       Let me give another example--we have several large auto \n     manufacturing plants in my home state of Tennessee. Let's say \n     one of those plants has a few thousand employees, but \n     thousands of other workers come in and out of the plant's \n     gates every day to provide goods and services the facility \n     needs to operate.\n       These workers are employed and directly controlled by \n     subcontractors that provide security, supply auto parts, and \n     staff the company lunch room. If the NLRB goes down this \n     road, the plant owner could be forced to sit at dozens of \n     different collective bargaining tables--and be responsible \n     for another employer's obligations.\n       So the manufacturer would likely take as much ``in house'' \n     as it can--and if that move comes at the cost of efficiency \n     and innovation the plant could be relocated elsewhere. This \n     example is especially concerning to me because more than \n     100,000 Tennesseans are employed in the auto manufacturing \n     industry.\n       As for the subcontractors, they would be losing huge \n     clients, which would in turn jeopardize more jobs and \n     threaten these businesses' futures.\n       Most business owners are people who wanted to run their own \n     business, be their own boss, and live their dream of \n     providing a much-needed service in their community.\n       This pending decision would ruin that dream for many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S854-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WEST JEFFERSON, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the town of West \nJefferson, NC. Today, February 9 is the 100th anniversary of the \ncharter of this historical town that has become a vibrant community \nattracting tourists, artists, entrepreneurs, retirees and young \nfamilies.\n  Development of rural farmland into a town resulted from extending a \nrailroad line into it. Construction of roadbeds and trestles for the \nsteel rails took place in 1914, and depots were created as loading \nspots. When people of this area learned that the railroad was coming, \nspeculators made investments in villages that would be affected. A new \nvillage was also created. The West Jefferson Land Company mapped a \nfarming area in a valley between two mountains and sold lots for \ncommercial and residential uses. Developers and their purchasers were \nready when the first train arrived. The West Jefferson depot was \ncentral and most prominent. As part of its official recognition by the \nState Legislature in 1915, the town acquired for its governance a mayor \nand aldermen.\n  Passenger service was added by the railroad company and enjoyed by \nmany. Then, as the years went by, personal automobiles, paved roads, \nfreight trucks and passenger buses created new transportation options. \nThere were no more large tracts of virgin timber to be harvested. \nRailroad operation declined in profitability and the end came in 1977. \nThe rails were taken up and trains became a romantic memory for the \npeople of West Jefferson. Trains remain today as images which we see in \nthe local history museum diorama and in some of the beautiful murals on \ndowntown buildings. Murals, galleries, studios and dynamic programs now \nidentify West Jefferson as an arts community, enhancing its image as a \ndesirable place in which to live.\n  The town of West Jefferson has received many accolades for its \nbusiness and family-friendly environment, low cost of living, lively \nrebirth of its downtown district, and many other aspects. I join the \nfine people of West Jefferson as its citizens and leaders celebrate \nthis historic 100th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S854-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO GENE BESS\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to honor Coach Gene Bess of \nThree Rivers College in Poplar Bluff, MO. As a coach for Three Rivers \nCollege, Gene has had an amazing career that has spanned four decades. \nDuring that time, he has maintained a winning percentage of 78 percent \nwith an average of 27 wins per year. He has not had a losing season \nsince becoming Three Rivers College's head coach in 1971.\n  Coach Bess has led the Three Rivers College Raiders to 17 tournament \nappearances in the National Junior College Athletic Association, NJCAA \ntournament, where his career record is 41-19. The Raiders have reached \nthe Final Four of the NJCAA tournament nine times, while winning \nnational championships in 1979 and 1992.\n  Gene has been recognized as the NJCAA Coach of the Year twice, the \nRegional Coach of the Year on 18 occasions, and the Midwest Community \nCollege Athletic Conference Coach of the Year 19 times. He is a member \nof the Poplar Bluff Sports Hall of Fame, the Missouri Sports Hall of \nFame, and the NJCAA Hall of Fame.\n  Coach Bess is one of the best basketball coaches to ever blow a \nwhistle in college basketball, and this month, he became the first \ncollege basketball coach ever to reach 1,200 victories. This is a \ntremendous feat for a coach in any sport, at any level.\n  Prior to his record-setting career at Three Rivers College, Coach \nBess had a very successful record at the high school level when \ncoaching at Lesterville, Anniston, and Oran. Over a 12-year period, \nthese Bess-era teams won over 250 games, ending in appropriate fashion \nwith his Oran team playing for the Missouri Class M State Championship. \nOran lost that game 76-74, yet the Bess legacy was only beginning.\n  The leadership and dedication that Gene Bess demonstrates as a \nbasketball coach, does not stop on the court. Instead, it translates \ninto his personal and public life. He has been married for nearly 54 \nyears and is a deacon at the First Baptist Church of Poplar Bluff. He \nand his wife Nelda have two children, Janell Hartmann and Brian, one of \nthe Raiders' assistant coaches, and four grandchildren. Faith and \nfamily always come before his work, and this is just one secret to his \nsuccess.\n  I ask that all of my colleagues join me in congratulating Coach Bess \nand the Three Rivers Raiders on this rare milestone of 1,200 victories, \na record that is unsurpassed at any level.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S854-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S854-S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HELENE GALEN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to \nrecognize my great friend and an extraordinary philanthropist in my \nState, Helene Galen, who was honored over the weekend with the Desert \nAIDS Project's ``100 Women Award.'' Helene's immense contributions \nthroughout California--especially in her beloved Coachella Valley--have \nleft a legacy that will benefit the people of our State for decades to \ncome.\n  She has worked tirelessly to fight child abuse through the Barbara \nSinatra Children's Center for almost 30 years. Her strong support for \nJewish Family Service of the Desert has provided critical social \nservices to seniors, children and families throughout the area. A \ndevoted advocate for people living with HIV and AIDS, she has been a \nleader of the Desert AIDS Project's ``100 Women'' program, which \nsupports women and children affected by HIV and AIDS with food, housing \nand life-saving health care.\n  Whenever Helene sees an unmet need, she doesn't wait for someone else \nto step up. She jumps in with all her heart and all her passion. She \nled the effort to build a new performing arts center and theater at \nRancho Mirage High School, which will ensure that generations of young \npeople can pursue\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\ntheir dreams. A longtime member of the University of Southern \nCalifornia School of Fine Arts' Board of Councilors, Helene and her \nlate husband, Louis, were the driving force behind the construction of \nUSC's Galen Center, an arena that opened in 2006 and has provided the \ncommunity an incredible venue for sporting events, concerts, and school \nactivities.\n  A former executive in the retail industry, Helene has used her \nfinancial savvy and management experience to benefit a host of \ncharities and institutions. She has served on the boards of the \nEisenhower Medical Center, the Palm Springs Art Museum, the McCallum \nTheatre, and the Palm Springs International Film Festival.\n  A devoted mother and grandmother, Helene truly embodies the saying in \nthe Jewish tradition, ``Whoever saves a life, it is as if that person \nhas saved the whole world.'' Without a doubt, Helene's work has saved \ncountless lives, and her impact will be felt in California for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S855-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE ENERGY INNOVATION LABORATORY\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Idaho National \nLab's Energy Innovation Laboratory, EIL, for the facility's selection \nas the 2014 Best Green Project in the Nation by the Engineering News-\nRecord.\n  The recent award is among the growing list of recognitions the EIL is \nreceiving for the innovative work at the lab. Engineering News-Record \nalso recognized EIL as the Best Overall Intermountain Project for the \nStates of Idaho, Utah and Montana. Additionally, EIL won the 2014 Go \nBeyond Award for the team's work to reduce the lab's environmental \nimpacts. The lab is also among fewer than 5 percent of U.S. Green \nBuilding Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, LEED, \nregistry research labs to be Platinum-certified.\n  EIL was completed in 2013 following the outstanding work of the EIL \nproject team, led by Reed Miller of Ormond Builders and Kath Williams, \nthe LEED coordinator, and in collaboration with INL's Project \nManagement Office, Supply Chain Management and Campus Development \nOffice. The new laboratory provides space for INL researchers to \ndevelop solutions to national energy challenges in advanced clean \nenergy and related environmental science while also consolidating some \nof INL's research and development. I commend all those on the project \nteam-including Ormond Builders Inc.; INL; Plan One/Architects; REL \nFacilities, LLC; Engineering System Solutions; and others--for their \ncollaborative and conscientious work to establish this exceptional \nresearch facility that is mindful of our environment.\n  Energy efficiencies at the facility have resulted in its energy use \nbeing nearly half that of other conventially-designed laboratories. In \naddition to its impressive energy savings, the facility's design also \nreduces its water usage. Nearly all of the construction waste was \nrecycled, reused or repurposed, and one-third of the facility was \nconstructed using recycled materials.\n  Idahoans are leading the way in developing technological and \nscientific advancements that are beneficial around the world. The \nexceptional research and development being conducted at the Idaho \nNational Laboratory is an asset to our State and Nation. I commend all \nthose on the EIL project team for their forward-thinking work. \nCongratulations on receiving this award. I look forward to continuing \nto follow your success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S855-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. OLIVIA J. HOOKER\n\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Dr. \nOlivia J. Hooker, a leader whose commitment to service has lifted the \nlives of many Americans. As the first African American woman to serve \nin Active Duty in the U.S. Coast Guard, and as a survivor of the Tulsa \nRace Riots and founder of the Tulsa Race Riot Commission, Dr. Hooker is \na pioneer and role model for all to follow. I am especially proud to \nrecognize Dr. Hooker on her centennial birthday.\n  During this momentous occasion, we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Olivia \nJ. Hooker, whose strength and spirit have enriched our society.\n  Dr. Hooker was born in Oklahoma in 1915. In 1921, her community in \nTulsa was destroyed in the worst race riot in United States history. \nThe Tulsa Race Riot caused over 300 fatalities, as well as the burning \nof over 1,000 homes and businesses.\n  Following the riot, Dr. Hooker helped found the Tulsa Race Riot \nCommission. The commission served to draft recommendations for \nrestitution. The advocacy of Dr. Hooker and her allies led them to \ntestify before the Oklahoma State Legislature and U.S. Congress.\n  Dr. Hooker attended The Ohio State University after her family moved \nto Columbus, OH. After earning a bachelor's degree, Dr. Hooker applied \nto join the Navy, but was denied because of her race. Dr. Hooker then \napplied to join the Coast Guard, and became the first African American \nfemale to serve there. In 1942, Federal legislation created the U.S. \nCoast Guard Women's Reserve--the program known as SPAR. Dr. Hooker \nseparated from the Coast Guard at the rank of petty officer 2nd class, \nwith a Good Conduct Medal.\n  Dr. Hooker went on to earn her master's degree from Teachers College \nat Columbia University, and then a doctorate in psychology from the \nUniversity of Rochester. Dr. Hooker had a long, remarkable career as a \nprofessor in New York.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Jon Ponder for \nhis tireless effort in giving others hope for a brighter future. Mr. \nPonder has dedicated many years to helping adults exiting various \nsegments of the judicial system successfully reenter the workforce and \ntheir local communities, as well as rekindle relationships with their \nfamilies. He has contributed greatly to the city of Las Vegas by \nfounding HOPE for Prisoners, Inc., HOPE, which gives ex-offenders the \nsupport necessary to reduce the likelihood of returning to prison.\n  Mr. Ponder stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted his \nlife to the betterment of others. He founded HOPE in January of 2012 \nand has since worked to create a strong program to successfully \nstreamline men and women back into society. The program has graduated \nover 800 people through its leadership workshop who have gone on to \nsuccessfully obtain full-time jobs. As founder and CEO, Mr. Ponder has \ncontributed greatly to the success of the program.\n  HOPE services 12 agencies and offers life-skills training, work-\nreadiness training, and job-development opportunities, encouraging \nthose in the program to work hard to become a positive, contributing \nmember of the community. Mr. Ponder has taken his own life experiences \nand used them in a positive manner to truly transform the lives of \nothers. His ambition to help others is invaluable. He recently received \nthe Leadership Award from the International Church of Las Vegas, a \nwell-deserved honor for all of his hard work.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Ponder for his selfless \ncontributions to the Las Vegas community and the individuals that have \nbenefited from HOPE. His service to Nevada places him among the \noutstanding men and women of the State.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMr. Ponder and his work for HOPE, a program with a mission that is both \nnoble and necessary. I am honored to acknowledge Mr. Ponder and his \ntireless efforts to give others a second chance in Nevada. Giving these \nmen and women the skills to allow them to change their circumstances is \nadmirable, and I wish the program the best of luck in all of its future \nendeavors.\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S856-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING HENRY LEE FIELDS\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate a Georgia first \nresponder, public servant and leader, Chief Henry Lee Fields, who \npassed away on December 28, 2014.\n Chief Fields was born to Eddie Lee and Dorothea Johnson Fields \non July 13, 1944, in Dougherty County, GA. He worked hard to graduate \nfrom Monroe High School in 1963, and attended Newark Community College \nbefore returning home in 1964 and working as an auto mechanic. He and \nhis wife Dorothy Fields had two daughters, Rosalind and Wynne, and he \nwas in the automotive field when he applied for a job at the fire \ndepartment and found his true calling.\n  Chief Fields worked his way up the ladder and, in 1991, became the \nfirst African-American to serve as chief of the Albany Fire Department \nin Albany, GA.\n  During that time, Chief Fields also served in the role of emergency \nmanagement director, and was confronted with two major floods that \ndevastated the area in 1994 and 1998.\n  Chief Fields retired in 2000 after touching many lives through his \nfire safety efforts and through his church, Jordan Grove Missionary \nBaptist, where he served in many roles.\n  The Albany Fire Department headquarters appropriately lowered their \nflags to half-mast during the memorial service for Chief Fields.\n  Henry Fields was an inspirational leader and his years of service to \nhis community will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S856-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. NORMAN FRANCIS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to honor Dr. Norman Francis, \npresident of Xavier University of Louisiana and grand marshall for the \n2015 Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club Coronation Ball.\n  Dr. Francis was born in Lafayette, LA, to the son of a barber and a \nstay-home mother who valued education and hard work. After Dr. Francis \ngraduated from St. Paul High School in 1948, he was awarded a \nscholarship to Xavier University, America's only historically black \nCatholic university, where he excelled academically. In 1953, he \nenrolled in Loyola University New Orleans from which he earned his \njuris doctorate in 1955. After this, he spent 2 years in the U.S. Army \nbefore returning to New Orleans.\n  In 1968, Dr. Francis was named president of Xavier University. He was \nthe first African American man to lead Xavier, and he is currently the \nlongest-sitting university president in the United States. As both a \nstudent and eventual administrator, Dr. Francis has been at Xavier for \nmore than five decades. He is credited with being the catalyst for \nnearly every new building constructed on the campus during the past \nfour decades.\n  Under Dr. Francis' leadership, Xavier continues to rank first \nnationally in the number of African American students earning \nundergraduate degrees in the biology and the life sciences, chemistry, \nphysics, and pharmacy. Since 1993, Xavier has also continued to rank \nfirst nationally for African American students being accepted into \nmedical schools.\n  Dr. Francis has received numerous honorary degrees from other \nuniversities and prestigious awards in recognition of his leadership in \nhigher education and for unselfish service to New Orleans and to our \nNation. In 2006, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by \nPresident George W. Bush. Dr. Francis served as chairman of the \nLouisiana Recovery Authority following the devastation from Hurricane \nKatrina and Rita, and he was a leader in the efforts to rebuild the \nlives of those affected by the storms. In the aftermath of these \nstorms, one publication called Dr. Francis a ``quiet hero.'' This is a \ngreat way to describe a man who has done so much for his university, \nhis community, his State, and his Nation.\n  I am pleased to join with the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club in \nhonoring grand marshall Dr. Norman Francis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S856-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 527.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny tax \ndeductions for corporate regulatory violations; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing, along with Senator \nGrassley, the Government Settlement Transparency and Reform Act. This \nbill aims to end the subsidization of illegal corporate behavior by \ntaxpayers by closing a loophole that allows corporations to reap tax \nbenefits from payments made to the government stemming from settling \ncorporate misdeeds.\n  Corporations accused of illegal activity routinely settle legal \ndisputes with the government out of court because it allows both the \ncompany and the government to avoid the time, expense, and uncertainty \nof going to trial. Under Federal law, money paid to settle corporate \ncivil or criminal penalties is not deductible. But under the tax code, \noffending companies may often write off any portion of a settlement \nthat is not paid directly to the government as a penalty or fine for \nviolation of the law. Corporations exploit this provision by later \ncharacterizing settlement penalties as restitution and a tax-deductible \nbusiness expense.\n  I think most would agree that, for example, a corporation should not \ncome to an agreement with the government to pay $500 million in \ncriminal or civil fines and then when they file their taxes count those \nvery fines as a business expense and take a tax windfall. Corporations \nthat do this are effectively using taxpayer dollars to subsidize their \nillegal behavior. In 2005, the Government Accountability Office found \nthat of the 34 companies and $1 billion in settlements they examined, \n20 companies took a tax deduction for some or all of the money it paid \nto the government. Those settlements were silent on whether that $1 \nbillion to the government counted as penalties or restitution. \nAccording to GAO, in two of those settlements, company representatives \nsaid they made a mistake in deducting civil penalty payments totaling \n$1.9 million and said they would amend their tax returns.\n  To address these practices, the Reed-Grassley bill would amend 162(f) \nof the tax code and require the government and the settling party to \nreach pre-filing agreements on how the settlement payments should be \ntreated for tax purposes. Our bill also clarifies the rules about what \nsettlement payments are punitive and therefore non-deductible. \nFurthermore, it increases transparency by requiring the government to \nfile a return at the time of settlement to accurately reflect the tax \ntreatment of the amounts that will be paid by the offending party.\n  Last Congress it was estimated that over a ten-year budget window \nthis legislation would raise $218 million in revenue.\n  With this legislation we can close this tax loophole that flies in \nthe face of sensible and fair tax policy. The tax code should not be \nused to subsidize illegal activity by corporations. Indeed, when a fine \nis levied, that fine should not be construed as a legitimate business \nexpense. Instead, it should be paid in full, with no tax deduction \ntaken.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley for working with me again on this \nlegislation. He has long championed closing this loophole. I urge our \ncolleagues to join us by cosponsoring this legislation and seeking its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 414. A bill to proide for conservation, enhanced recreation \nopportunities, and development of renewable energy in the California \nDesert Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the California \nDesert Conservation and Recreation Act, a piece of legislation that \nserves as an update to the historic California Desert Protection Act of \n1994.\n  This bill reflects our attempt to achieve consensus among the various \nuses of desert land and the many stakeholders involved. This bill is \nbipartisan and it charts a commonsense path forward for the California \ndesert.\n  It protects additional desert land. It helps manage my State's \nnatural resources. It balances competing interests. It includes \nprovisions on recreation and renewable energy development.\n  Overall, it ensures that the California desert will remain what it is \ntoday: a true American treasure.\n  This bill has been a long time in the making.\n  Only three months after I was sworn in as Senator, in January 1993, I \nintroduced the Desert Protection Act. I picked up where my predecessors \nleft off, and President Clinton signed the bill into law in October \n1994.\n  This law was the largest land conservation designation in the \ncontinental United States:\n  It protected or increased existing protection for 9.6 million acres \nof desert land.\n  It established the iconic national parks of Joshua Tree and Death \nValley, as well as the Mojave National Preserve.\n  It helped save habitats for endangered species.\n  It continues to attract millions of tourists to southern California--\na boon for the economy.\n  It has ensured that the beautiful landscapes will be enjoyed for \ngenerations.\n  I recently visited the desert to celebrate the 20-year anniversary of \nthat legislation becoming law. I was once again reminded how stunning \nthe special land is. Simply put, it is an icon of the American West.\n  I became even more convinced: now is the time to do even more.\n  This is why I am introducing new legislation--to build upon the \nlegacy of 1994.\n  The bill I am introducing today has a simple goal: to help manage \nCalifornia's desert resources with a well-planned approach that \nbalances conservation, recreation, energy production and other needs.\n  This bill is first and foremost a bipartisan bill. It brings so many \ngroups together:\n  Environmental groups; State and local governments; the off-road \ncommunity; cattle ranchers; mining interests; the Defense Department; \nenergy companies; California's public utility companies; and many \nothers.\n  To account for all the uses of the desert, this whole effort was \nbased on\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\nan attempt to find consensus. We have worked very hard over the years \nto build that consensus.\n  We have consulted these stakeholders over the past 6 years. We have \nhad thousands of hours of discussions. They have provided invaluable \ninput and I am grateful for all of them coming to the table.\n  The cornerstone of the legislation is the creation of two new \nnational monuments:\n  First is the Mojave Trails National Monument, which would encompass \n965,000 acres. Of that, 196,000 acres is Caetellus lands, the areas \nacquired or donated to the Federal Government between 1999 and 2004 \nwith the purpose of conserving land for the American public.\n  It should be noted that this donated land, which stretches from the \nMexican border to San Bernardino county, was the largest land donation \nto the U.S. Government in the continental United States. But recently, \nthe aim to conserve it was threatened by the development of some solar \nenergy projects. That is why this bill is necessary: to ensure that the \nintention of those generous donors, to protect this land in perpetuity, \nis actually realized.\n  The second monument designation is the Sand to Snow National \nMonument. This would be made up of 135,000 acres of land from the \ndesert floor in the Coachella Valley to the top of Mount San Gorgonio.\n  The Mojave Trails National Monument is essential as it contains \nimportant wildlife corridors and habitats. The Sand to Snow National \nMonument, likewise, would be one of the most environmentally diverse \nmonuments in the country, including habitat for 240 species of \nmigrating and breeding birds.\n  The bill has many other conservation provisions including: \ndesignating six BLM wilderness areas, covering 250,000 acres of land, \ndesignating 77 miles along 4 waterways as Wild and Scenic River; adding \nland to the Death Valley National Park, 39,000 acres, Mojave National \nPreserve, 22,000 acres, and Joshua Tree National Park, 4,500 acres.\n  Conserving pristine desert land such as this is most definitely in \nthe interests of our country. The California desert is a very special \nplace and it deserves to stay that way.\n  The bill also designates five existing BLM Off-Highway Vehicle Areas, \ncovering approximately 142,000 acres of desert, as permanent Off-\nHighway Vehicle, OHV, recreation areas.\n  As has been stated, the desert has many uses, and motorists have long \nused the area for recreation. These provisions give off-highway \nenthusiasts the certainty they need. Their use of the desert will be \nprotected as much as conservation areas are.\n  In fact, in this regard we have had success in recent years. \nCongressman Paul Cook and I brokered an agreement for the mixed use of \nJohnson Valley, which was the subject of debate between the Marine \nCorps and off-road vehicle enthusiasts. We brought the parties together \nand reached a compromise. We made clear what land was for off-roading, \nwhat land was for Marine Corps training only and what land was to be \nshared.\n  This model of compromise should be instructive. When the parties come \ntogether, as they have in the case of this bill, we can achieve an \nequitable and fair distribution of the land.\n  Another use of the desert land that we must take into account is \nrenewable energy.\n  Let me be clear: developing cleaner energy is important for \nCalifornia's economy and for our efforts to fight global warming.\n  But I also feel strongly that we must be very careful where these \nfacilities are located.\n  Balancing conservation, development and other uses is possible, we \njust need to come up with the right solutions. Thankfully, some of \nthese compromises are already in place.\n  In April 2009 there were 28 solar and wind energy proposals on lands \nproposed to be included in the Mojave Trails National Monument, \nincluding sites on former Catellus lands intended for permanent \nconservation.\n  I visited some of those sites at the time, including one particularly \nbeautiful area known as the Broadwell Valley, where thousands of acres \nof pristine lands were proposed for development. Seeing it first hand, \nI quickly came to the conclusion that those lands were simply not the \nright place for renewable energy development.\n  Since then, 26 of the 28 applications have been withdrawn. So what \nhappened in the nearly 6 years since then?\n  First, the Energy and Interior Departments developed new solar energy \nzones. These zones allow projects to be developed on lands least likely \nto harm plant and wildlife species, and allow projects to be completed \nfaster and with fewer conflicts. This is a smart compromise.\n  Second, California has worked closely with Federal agencies to \ndevelop the Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan. This blueprint \nwill help identify pristine lands that warrant protection and direct \nenergy projects elsewhere.\n  Today, none of the land proposed for renewable development or \ntransmission as part of these initiatives conflicts with the \nconservation proposed in this bill.\n  This is a fair balancing of priorities, and I think it provides a \nclear path forward.\n  The bill I am introducing also takes additional action to help \npromote responsible renewable energy development.\n  Specifically, the bill requires the Interior Department to exchange \napproximately 370,000 acres of small, isolated parcels of State land \nfor Federal land. By swapping state land that is often surrounded by \nwilderness and national parks for other federal land, these exchanges \nwill provide California with sites for renewable energy production, \nrecreation or other uses.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to take a good look at this \nlegislation. I hope they understand that the many stakeholders involved \nhave made their voices heard. The text of this legislation represents a \nconsensus effort.\n  Most importantly, I hope they recognize the simple fact that desert \nconservation has never been a partisan issue.\n  Over the years, legislators have come together across party lines to \npreserve this great piece of land.\n  Given our past success, I am hopeful this Congress will take this \nlegislation up and move it forward. It is the right thing to do, and \nthe California desert needs it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Blunt, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Isakson, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. \n        Burr, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Risch, Mr. Perdue, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n        Scott, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Thune, Mr. \n        Rubio, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Corker, Mr. Flake, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. \n        Heller, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Collins, Mr. Paul, Mr. \n        Cotton, Mrs. Capito, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Vitter, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n        Hoeven, Mr. Moran, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Graham, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gardner, Mrs. Ernst, Mr. Daines, \n        Mrs. Fischer, and Mr. Cruz):\n  S.J. Res. 8. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by the National Labor Relations Board relating to \nrepresentation case procedures; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, recently the Senate has had a lot of \ndiscussion about partisan overreach. We have talked about an \nadministration that seems to view democracy as what it can get away \nwith, not what it can work cooperatively to achieve. It is worrying for \nour country, and we keep seeing more examples of it.\n  Consider the administration's effort to weaken workers' rights. This \nadministration's appointees on the National Labor Relations Board \nreleased their so-called ambush rule back in December. It is designed \nwith one purpose in mind: to fatten the wallets of powerful political \nbosses by weakening the rights of middle-class workers.\n  Republicans believe a worker has a right to make her own informed \nchoices about joining a union. We don't think powerful political bosses \nshould attempt to make that decision for her, but that is just what \nthis rule aims to achieve. These bosses think they can enrich their own \ncoffers if they can deny workers real opportunities to\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nweigh the pros and cons of joining a union. For instance, in an era of \nstagnant wages, does a worker want to see her paycheck shrink so a \npolitical boss can attend more campaign fundraisers? Republicans think \nthat is a choice for the worker to make. Does a worker want to give up \nher right to demand better pay or a promotion that she deserves and \ncede those decisions to a distant political organization?\n  Republicans think she has a right to make those choices for herself \nand she has a right to make them in an informed way, but the \nadministration's ambush rule would dramatically weaken her ability to \ndo so. In many cases it wouldn't even allow her more than a handful of \ndays to weigh the pros and cons of such a costly and important \ndecision. It is really not fair. And it is not just me saying that; \nconsider the words of John F. Kennedy. Here is what he had to say about \nit. ``There should be at least a 30-day interval'' for union elections, \nhe said. He noted that these 30 days represent a safeguard against \n``rushing employees into an election where they are unfamiliar with the \nissues.'' Kennedy was right.\n  There is another important issue at stake here too. Just as \nRepublicans think a worker has a right to make her own informed \nchoices, Republicans also think her personal information is none of the \nbusiness of powerful political bosses. But the administration's ambush \nrule would allow those bosses to access things such as her email \naddress and cell number without--without--her permission. It also would \nallow those bosses to track her, to know exactly when and where she is \nworking--again, without her permission. She can't opt out and she can't \nunsubscribe. This is really chilling. This is really extreme.\n  What about the men and women who rise early every day to fulfill \ntheir dreams, the men and women who provide so many opportunities for \nothers to fulfill theirs? This ambush rule is also aimed at preventing \nsomeone with a small business of her own from even having a real \nconversation with her employees about the cost and the benefits of \njoining a union. The ambush rule would give extraordinary power to \npolitical bosses on the outside, while shutting her voice down--the one \nperson who probably knows more about and cares more about her employees \nthan anyone else. After years spent building a dream and caring about \nthe men and women who helped her get there, this rule is an insult--an \ninsult--to entrepreneurs like her.\n  Moreover, it is not the men and women on the assembly line who are \ndemanding the ambush rule. There is no demand for this coming up with \nthe workforce in America. So who is demanding it? It is the powerful \npolitical bosses who worry that more and more workers are making an \ninformed choice not to join a union. Those bosses are worried about \nwhat informed choices could mean for them--less money, less power.\n  So this far-reaching rule--the so-called Mt. Everest of regulations--\nis not the result of the administration seeking out the best policy; it \nis just another example of the administration seeing what it can get \naway with. It is a brazen attempt to enrich powerful political friends \nof the White House by weakening workers' rights. It is not fair for \nworkers, and it is not right for our country.\n  My good friends the Senators from Tennessee and Wyoming are here on \nthe floor to explain what Congress plans to do to stand up for basic \nfairness in the workplace. They are going to talk about this latest \nexample of partisan executive overreach--the kind of overreach that is \ncoming to define the Obama administration--and what Congress plans to \ndo next.\n  Madam President, I see the Senator from Tennessee is on his feet, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the recognition \nand the majority leader for his remarks and his leadership. I am also \nglad to be here with the Senator from Wyoming, who over the years has \nbeen the leading Republican Senator on the issue of ambush elections.\n  We are here today, as the majority leader said, to introduce a \nCongressional Review Act resolution to stop a new National Labor \nRelations Board rule. I would like to speak about that for a few \nminutes and then let the Senator from Wyoming continue.\n  Last December the NLRB issued a final rule that shortened the \ntimeline between when pro-union organizers ask an employer for a secret \nballot election and when the election actually takes place. I refer to \nthis as an ambush election because it forces a union election before an \nemployer has a chance to figure out what is going on. Even worse, it \njeopardizes employees' privacy by requiring employers to turn over \npersonal employee information--including email addresses, phone \nnumbers, shift hours, and locations--to union organizers.\n  The effect of this resolution will be to permit the majority leader \nto bring this resolution to the floor after the congressional recess. \nThere will be 10 hours of debate. The resolution cannot be amended, and \nit needs a majority vote to pass. The House of Representatives is \nfollowing a similar procedure. Both Houses must vote on it. If it \npasses both Houses, the President can sign or veto the resolution. If \nthe President decides to veto, it would take 67 votes to override. If \nthe NLRB's new ambush election rule is disapproved, the Board cannot \nissue a substantially similar rule without congressional approval.\n  Today, more than 95 percent of union elections occur within 56 days \nafter a petition is filed, but under this new rule elections could take \nplace in as few as 11 days after a petition is filed. This rule will \nharm employers and employees alike, and here is how.\n  If you are an employer who gets ambushed--in other words, a union \nelection happens before you really know what is going on--on day 1 you \nget a faxed copy of an election petition that has been filed at your \nlocal NLRB regional office stating that 30 percent of your employees \nsupport a union. The union may have already been quietly trying to \norganize for months without your knowledge. Your employees have been \nable to hear only the union's pitch.\n  By day 2 or 3 of this process, you must publicly post an election \nnotice in your workplace and post it online as well if you communicate \nwith your employees electronically.\n  By noon on day 7, you must file with the NLRB what is called a \nstatement of position. This is a comprehensive, written legal document \nin which an employer sets out legal positions and claims. Under this \nnew NLRB rule, you, the employer, waive your rights to use any legal \narguments not raised in the document. On day 7, you must also present \nthe union and the NLRB with a list of prospective voters as well as \ntheir job classifications, shift hours, and work locations.\n  On day 8, a pre-election hearing is held at the NLRB regional office, \nand an election date is set.\n  By day 10, the employer must present the union with a list of \nemployee names, personal email addresses, personal cell phone numbers, \nand home addresses.\n  Day 11 is the earliest day on which the NLRB could conduct the \nelection under the new rule. The union has the power to postpone an \nelection by an additional 10 days at this point, but the employer has \nno corresponding power.\n  Under this new NLRB rule, before the hearing on day 8 an employer \nwill have less than 1 week to figure out what an election petition is, \nfind legal representation--many employers don't have a labor lawyer as \na matter of course--determine legal positions on the relevant issues, \nlearn what statements and actions the law permits and prohibits, gather \ninformation required by the NLRB, communicate with employees about the \ndecision they are making, and correct any misstatements and falsehoods \nemployees may be hearing from union organizers. Making even the \nslightest mistake in the lead-up to an election can result in the NLRB \nsetting aside the results and ordering a rerun election or, worse, the \nBoard could require an employer to automatically bargain with the \nunion.\n  But it is the employees who stand to lose the most under this new \nrule. First, because of this ambush election, employees may only hear \nhalf the story about what unionizing may mean for them and for their \nworkplace. When a workplace is unionized--especially in a State that \ndoes not have a right-to-work law--employees have their dues money \ntaken out of every paycheck,\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nwhether they like it or not. Employees lose the ability to deal \ndirectly with their employer to address concerns, or ask for a \npromotion or raise, and instead have to work through the union.\n  Important considerations, such as which of their fellow employees \nwill be included in the bargaining unit, will no longer be determined \nbefore the election. As the two dissenting members of the NLRB put it: \nEmployees will be asked to ``vote now, understand later.''\n  Second, employees lose their privacy because the final rule we seek \nto overturn requires employers to hand over employees' personal email \naddresses, cell phone numbers, shift locations, and job \nclassifications, even if the employee has made it clear he does not \nwant to be contacted by union organizers.\n  This rule appears to be a solution in search of a problem. Only 4.3 \npercent of union elections occur more than 56 days after the petition \nis filed. The current median number of days between when the petition \nis filed and the election is held is just 38 days.\n  These figures are well within the NLRB's own goals for timely \nelections. Unions won 64 percent of elections in 2013. In recent years, \nthe union win rate has actually been going up. So what is the problem?\n  The majority leader said it very well when he referred to a 1959 \ndebate over amendments to the National Labor Relations Act. Then-\nSenator John F. Kennedy warned against rushing employees into a union \nelection. Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       There should be at least a 30-day interval between the \n     request for an election and the holding of the election...in \n     which both parties can present their viewpoints.\n       The 30-day waiting period is an additional safeguard \n     against rushing employees into an election where they are \n     unfamiliar with the issues.\n\n  It is clear to see this rule is wrong. That is why Senator Enzi, \nSenator McConnell, and I are asking the Senate to disapprove the rule \nand prohibit the National Labor Relations Board from issuing any \nsubstantially similar rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nAlexander, for his comments.\n  I don't think I have ever heard it put quite as concisely or the \ntimeline explained quite as well as he did. I hope people are paying \nattention. I hope people take a look at the journal and see exactly how \nshort a timeframe that is for both the employer and the employees.\n  So I rise to support the resolution of disapproval that would repeal \nthe National Labor Relations Board's ambush election rule.\n  I again thank my friend Senator Alexander for his leadership as the \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and for \nleading this effort to prevent yet more misguided Federal regulation \nthat will hurt American businesses and employees.\n  Unfortunately this isn't the first time we have had to fight this \nrule from the NLRB. When I led the Congressional Review Act resolution \nto stop this rule in 2012, I truly appreciated Senator Alexander's \nsupport and am proud to support him now. I didn't have the votes to \npass the resolution in 2012, but we have had some elections and some \nchanges in the Senate since then.\n  The rule the National Labor Relations Board has proposed would be a \ntremendous burden on employers, especially small businesses. If this \nrule goes into effect, it will mean employers will barely have time to \nmeet their preelection legal obligations. It will mean employees will \nbe rushed into an election without time to study and consider what the \nunionization would mean for them, for their workplace, and for their \ncommunity. Also, Big Labor will be able to force elections through in \norder to boost revenue from union dues and increase the influence of \nBig Labor.\n  Our economy is already grappling with Federal rules and regulations \nthat hold back businesses. This rule from the National Labor Relations \nBoard will be yet another break, slowing down our economy at a time \nwhen we need to encourage employers and businesses to grow. It would be \nespecially harmful to small businesses, which are the backbone of our \neconomy and the most important factor in maintaining our fragile \neconomic growth.\n  Small businesses that don't have human resource departments and more \nparticularly don't have in-house legal counsel already face a \nsignificant burden when they have to navigate union elections. This \nrule would only make it harder. This rule would hurt businesses for the \nsole purpose of helping unions that don't need it.\n  Union elections are supposed to be held in a timely and fair manner, \nwhich is what the current system achieves. The average time between \nfiling an election petition, as has been mentioned, and holding the \nvote is 38 days, and nearly all elections happen within 2 months.\n  That process allows employers to understand their rights and meet \ntheir legal obligations. It allows employees to educate themselves \nabout what unionization means for them personally and for their work, \nand it ensures that union elections will be a fair opportunity for \nworkers to decide whether to organize.\n  Under the current system there is a 25-day waiting period between the \nsetting of an election and the actual secret ballot election. That \nwindow of time is crucial. Employers use that time to understand their \nrights and restrictions in the process and to meet their legal \nobligations.\n  The union election process is not simple, nor is it straightforward \nfor employees. There are numerous places where a well-meaning employer \nworking to meet their obligations could misstep and face heavy \npenalties from the National Labor Relations Board.\n  Employers also use this time to communicate with their employees \nabout the decision they are making and to clear up misstatements, \nrumors or falsehoods that have been going around.\n  The time between petitioning for election and voting is also used for \nparties to study decisions by hearing officers or the National Labor \nRelations Board's regional director and ask for clarification or \nreview.\n  Under the National Labor Relations Board's rule, all the \nopportunities for anyone involved with the process to understand their \nlegal obligations, to exercise their rights, to study or debate the \narguments for or against unionization or even to learn about the issue \nwould be squeezed into as little as 14 days.\n  Is it fair for an employee to only have 10 days to learn how his or \nher vote will affect the rest of their time with that employer--we have \nto remember they are going to be working during that time probably--or \nhow much money membership in a union is going to cost them or what it \nmeans for their ability to negotiate directly with their employer for \nraises or other benefits or concerns or any of the countless other \nissues an employee might want to approach his or her employer about?\n  Under current law, both parties are able to raise issues about the \nelection at a preelection hearing, covering such issues as which \nemployees should be included in the bargaining unit and whether \nparticular employees are actually supervisors.\n  Under the new regulation, parties will be barred from raising these \nquestions until after the election. Employees will be forced to vote \nwithout knowing which other employees will actually be in the \nbargaining unit with them. This is important information that weighs \nheavily in most employees' votes.\n  Under current law, when either party raises preelection issues, they \nare allowed to submit evidence and testimony, and file post-hearing \nbriefs for the hearing officer to consider, and then they have 14 days \nin which to appeal decisions made with respect to that election.\n  Under the new regulation, the hearing officer is given the broad \ndiscretion to bar all evidence and testimony unrelated to the question \nof representation and all post-election briefs and no appeals or \nrequests for stays are allowed. This could be quite a disadvantage for \nemployees as well as employers.\n  What this all adds up to is an extremely small window of time for \nfiling\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\nthe petition to the actual election, little opportunity for employers \nto learn their rights or communicate with their employees their rights, \nand less opportunities for employees to research the union and the \nramifications of forming the union.\n  The NLRB is ensuring that the odds are stacked against the employees \nand the businesses. This vote is an opportunity to tell the National \nLabor Relations Board to reverse course.\n  I hope this resolution will convince the National Labor Relations \nBoard to pull back from this disastrous rule and encourage them to \nfocus on their statutory mission rather than overturning decades of \nsettled practice that ensures that this process is held in a timely \nmanner and that there is a fair opportunity for all sides to \nunderstand, to participate, and to exercise their rights.\n  The NLRB's purpose is to enforce the National Labor Relations Act, \nwhich is a carefully balanced law that has only rarely been changed. \nWhen changes have occurred, they have been the result of careful \nnegotiations, with input from stakeholders and thoughtful debate.\n  The NLRB is attempting a sneak attack through the rulemaking process. \nThis is an ambush on the National Labor Relations Act to set up ambush \nelections.\n  The National Labor Relations Board is an agency that has historically \nissued very few regulations. Most of the questions that come up under \nthe law are handled through the decisions of the Board. Board decisions \noften do change the enforcement of the law significantly, but they are \nissued in response to an actual dispute and a question of law.\n  In contrast, the ambush election is not a response to a real problem \nbecause the current election process for certifying whether employees \nwant to form a union is not broken. The rule was not carefully \nnegotiated by stakeholders, it was not made with careful debate, and \nthere was no attempt to reach a consensus.\n  In the late 1950s Congress worked to pass the Landrieu-Griffin Act, \nwhich protected the rights of both rank-and-file union members and \ntheir employees. This was a carefully constructed piece of legislation \nthat came out of a special committee to study the issue, that heard \nfrom more than 1,500 witnesses over 3 years. And Congress debated the \nissue of how long a period of time there should be between the request \nfor an election and the actual election coming up during those \nnegotiations.\n\n  My colleagues may be surprised to learn--although they wouldn't if \nthey were listening to the previous two speeches--that it was Senator \nJohn F. Kennedy who argued vigorously for a 30-day waiting period prior \nto the election. He said:\n\n       There should be at least a 30 day interval between a \n     request for an election and the holding of an election . . . \n     in which both parties can present their viewpoints. . . . The \n     30 day waiting period is an additional safeguard against \n     rushing employees into an election where they are unfamiliar \n     with the issues.\n\n  Again, that was a quote by Senator John F. Kennedy, speaking directly \nto the need for fairness to employees. The 30-day waiting period \nprovision he supported did not ultimately become part of the law, and \nobviously it is not a law today. Instead, the NLRB adopted the practice \nof a 25-day waiting period in almost every case.\n  This caution about the need for employees to have a chance to become \nfamiliar with the issues is just as true today. Employees who are not \naware of the organizing activity at their worksites and even those who \nare need to have an opportunity to learn about the union they may join. \nThey will want to research the union to ensure it has no signs of \ncorruption. They will want to know how other worksites have fared with \nthis union and whether they can believe the promises the union \norganizers may be extending. Employees should have every chance to \nunderstand the impact of unionization. Four decades ago Senators \nrecognized that employees deserved the opportunity to gather this and \nall other relevant information before casting their votes. \nUnfortunately, the NLRB is choosing to ignore this caution, and rank-\nand-file employees will suffer.\n  This situation is exactly what the Congressional Review Act was \nintended for. When an agency goes too far and tries to impose rules and \nregulations that are unnecessary or harmful--in this case, both--the \nCongressional Review Act gives Congress an expedited process for \nrepealing that regulation. It is a process that cannot be held up and \ncannot be stalled or put off to ensure that Congress can act when it \nneeds to stop an out-of-control agency.\n  By any measure, the current law and certification system for union \nelections ensures that the process is fair for all parties and that all \nparties have the opportunity to exercise their rights and to fully \nunderstand the implications. The National Labor Relations Board has not \nmade the case that elections are being held up or stalled. They cannot \nmake the case because the data doesn't support it. I want to repeat. \nThe National Labor Relations Board has not made the case that elections \nare being held up or stalled. They cannot make that case because the \ndata doesn't support it. There is no need for this rule, which is just \na handout to Big Labor, which relies on pushing unions forward before \nbusinesses and employees have a chance to study and understand the full \neffects.\n  This resolution will preserve the fairness and swift resolution of \nclaims which occur under current law. It will not disadvantage unions \nor roll back any rights. It is important to say that again because \nthere is going to be a lot of misinformation about what this resolution \ndoes. This resolution does not disadvantage unions or roll back any \nunion rights. What it does is it ensures that small business employers \nand employees in America are not unfairly disadvantaged by a burdensome \nprocess and that employees are not misled with insufficient or \nincorrect information during the union election process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Under a successful Congressional Review Act disapproval, \nthe agency in question is prohibited from issuing any substantially \nsimilar regulation. That means the National Labor Relations Board could \nnot just reissue this regulation again and again, as they have \ncurrently done.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution to ensure that \nthe National Labor Relations Board understands that this rule is a no-\ngo and that we will stand up to ensure a fair process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S864-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, this week we celebrate Salute to Veterans \nWeek to honor all those who have served our Nation in uniform and their \nfamilies who sacrificed so much for our country.\n  This week is a particularly appropriate time for us to reflect on the \nimportance of fulfilling our commitment to all veterans. Just as we \ninvest in and train our men and women during their military service, we \nmust make the same investments when they return to our communities, \nhang up their uniforms, and embark on the next phase of their lives. \nThis institution always seems to be willing to vote for money so we can \nsend people to war, but is a bit less generous in taking care of those \nveterans when they return home. That should stop.\n  This morning I visited Eastern Gateway Community College in \nYoungstown and met with local veterans, including community college \ngraduate Lisa Thomas. She graduated last May and is now pursuing a 4-\nyear degree--after getting a 2-year degree--at Franklin University \nusing her GI benefits.\n  Community colleges like Eastern Gateway are an important way we \nprovide our veterans with the necessary skills to find decent-paying \njobs. They serve as pipelines for veterans so they can attend 4-year \nuniversities.\n  The GI bill's education benefits are critical to investing in \nreturning servicemembers. They help the veterans who have returned from \nwar to learn new skills, and as a result these men and women have \nhelped to build our middle class and led to our Nation's dominance in \nthe second half of the 20th century and into this century. But \nveterans, as some find out unwittingly, have a limited amount of time \nbefore their GI benefits expire.\n  At crowded colleges, general education requirements and prerequisites \noften fill up quickly, and it can take several semesters for that \nveteran to secure a spot. Waiting for a spot in a required course is a \nluxury many veterans don't have because those veterans benefits could \nexpire. If student veterans are unable to finish their degrees before \nthese benefits expire, they may end up being forced to pay thousands of \ndollars in out-of-pocket tuition and fees. The veterans who served our \nNation without delay should not face delays in getting their education.\n  Many colleges and universities--Youngstown State, which is the same \nplace where the Eastern Gateway campus in Youngstown is located, is \nwhere many Eastern Gateway students complete their degrees. They offer \nveterans priority registration so they can get the courses they need \nbefore their benefits run out.\n  All of our colleges and universities--2-year, 4-year, public and \nprivate--need to follow Youngstown State's lead. If student athletes \nhave priority registration, we can surely extend that privilege to \nthose who have served our Nation. That is why in the coming\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nmonths I will introduce legislation to ensure that all veterans, all \nservicemembers, and their qualifying dependents can use their GI \nbenefits to their full potential and be guaranteed priority \nregistration. Our veterans have earned these benefits, and we must \nensure that all of our veterans, such as Lisa Thomas, are able to take \nfull advantage of those benefits for themselves and for their families. \nIt is our duty to ensure that when veterans return home, they have the \neducation and training and access to jobs they need to fulfill their \npotential. We have a duty to ensure that those returning from service \nto our Nation get the care they need when they come home.\n  As the first Ohioan to serve a full term on the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, I have worked to ease the VA backlog and put in \nplace a better system. The shortage of care providers has been \nespecially pressing for veterans struggling with a brain injury--the \nso-called invisible injuries.\n  When our country went into Iraq a dozen years ago, our leader said \nthat this will be a short war. Our country, our government, our \nadministration, and our Congress failed to scale up veterans hospitals \nand veterans care and increase the capacity, and we now find it is too \nsmall. That is the importance of making sure we do this right.\n  Nearly 300,000 veterans in this country struggle with post-traumatic \ndistress. Out of an estimated 300,000 traumatic brain injuries, there \nare 25,000 cases of mild traumatic brain injuries. These cases are hard \nto diagnose and document since there is often a lack of visible \nevidence.\n  Without proper care, each year some 8,000 veterans take their own \nlives--154 a week, 22 veterans a day commit suicide. What a tragedy. \nLast week I was proud to stand with my colleagues in this body in \nsupport of the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act. \nI look forward to President Obama signing that bill later this week. It \nis our duty to take an active role in increasing veterans' access to \nquality mental health care, and the Clay Hunt Act will help ensure that \nthose who put their lives on the line for us have a lifetime of their \nown upon returning home. We have a sacred trust between our government \nand those who protect us all.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/09/senate-section/article/S872-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
