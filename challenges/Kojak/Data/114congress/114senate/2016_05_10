Mr. President, yesterday we had another opportunity to \nmove the energy security and water infrastructure funding bill forward, \nand I was disappointed to see it stalled once again.\n  I wish to reiterate what Senator Alexander, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee, said. Advancing this funding bill is \nimportant--not only for policy but also for process. Members worked in \ncommittee and arrived at a bill they reported out unanimously. Many \nmore Members had their voices heard on the floor, where we processed 17 \namendments from both Democrats and Republicans.\n  Now, after much research, debate, and input from both sides, we are \nalmost ready to move this bill across the finish line. We have one \noutstanding issue to address. It is the amendment authored by Senator \nCotton, and we will have a vote on it no later than tomorrow. Senator \nCotton was rightly concerned about the administration's recent \nannouncement that it would purchase so-called heavy water from Iran, so \nhe filed an amendment that would keep the funds we are appropriating \nthrough this bill from being spent on future heavy water purchases from \nthat country.\n  Let me repeat that point. This amendment does not impact the current \nheavy water agreement. Instead, it aims at preventing future funds from \ngoing to Iran--funds that country could use to procure ballistic \nmissiles or air defenses that could be used against us or our allies.\n  I agree with Senator Cotton's objective, and I will be supporting his \namendment, which aims to keep Americans safe. But regardless of \nMembers' positions on this issue, we will each have an opportunity to \nhave our opinions count with a vote. Whether or not Senators support \nthe amendment, this is the way the process works.\n  The amendment is a restriction on the use of funds--clearly a matter \nrelated to the use of appropriated funds.\n  No matter how Senators choose to vote on this amendment, we all know \nthe importance of moving forward with this Energy and Water \nappropriations bill.\n  I leave colleagues with one last point offered by Senator Alexander \nyesterday. This energy security and water infrastructure funding bill \nis one that ``virtually every Senator in this body has some interest \nin,'' and passing it would help us ``set a good example for the other \n11 appropriations bills.''\n  We will soon have the opportunity to keep moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to talk today about judges, \nspecifically district court judges across our country. We have a number \nof judges in Pennsylvania who have not moved forward, and I want to \nspeak to that today.\n  I think it is a case of or a story about obstruction. It is as simple \nas that, and there is no excuse for this kind of obstruction. These \nnominees came from Senators of both parties, and that applies to \nPennsylvania, as well, and have had all their credentials vetted and \napproved by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Pennsylvania currently has four nominees to the district court, and \none seat on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals is vacant as well. All \nof these excellent nominees deserve immediate consideration and \nconfirmation.\n  The Pennsylvania judges were agreed to by my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Toomey. We worked together to arrive at a \nconsensus. Just by way of example, the two we are talking about today, \nin particular, Judge Susan Baxter and Judge Marilyn Horan, are \nPennsylvania judges who have sterling qualifications and credentials, \nwere selected on a bipartisan basis, as I mentioned, in our State, were \nunanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and they have \nbeen languishing now for months, even after Judiciary Committee \nconsideration.\n  We have two other Pennsylvania district court nominees, Judge John \nColville and Judge Milton Younge, who are still inexplicably stuck in \nthe Judiciary Committee, despite being equally qualified and nominated \nthe same day as Judge Baxter and Judge Horan.\n  So the old expression applies here: Justice delayed is justice \ndenied. That is what we are seeing when we have this kind of \nobstruction preventing the confirmation of judges who have come through \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  The American people have fundamental basic rights. I believe one of \nthose rights is to expect that their courts are working with a full \ncomplement of judges. President Obama has seen just 17 judges confirmed \nin the last 2 years of his Presidency so far--I know we are still in \nthe midst of those 2 years but 17 judges to date in the last 18 months, \nroughly--compared to 68 when Democrats controlled the Senate the last \nyears of President Bush's administration.\n  We have seen the same obstruction at all levels of the court system. \nFor example, we know the chief judge of the District of Columbia Court \nof Appeals, Judge Merrick Garland, has in fact been completely \nobstructed--not even getting a hearing, not even getting a vote of any \nkind. That might be the most glaring and egregious example of \nobstruction. So when it comes to Judge Garland and his consideration to \nbe a member of the Supreme Court, I hope our Republican colleagues \nwould simply do their job. That is what the Constitution tells us we \nmust do. The Constitution says advise and consent, not advise and \nconsent when you feel like it or when it is politically expedient.\n  One last point about the judiciary, in terms of how essential it is \nto our democracy, is that we pride ourselves as a nation having a \njudiciary which is independent--separate from the legislative branch, \nseparate from the executive branch--an independent and in fact coequal \nbranch of government, not an institution that is the instrument of one \nparty, especially the party in power.\n  So when it comes to Judge Garland, we simply ask Republican Senators \nto do their job: allow a hearing, conduct a hearing, ask a lot of \nquestions, and then have a vote on Judge Garland to be a Justice.\n  On district court nominees, it is as simple as agreeing to what has \nalready been agreed to; that all these candidates are of the highest \ncaliber and they are through the Judiciary Committee. All we need now \nis for folks in the Senate to come together and make a collective \ndecision to move these district court judges forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nsuggestion of an absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. CASEY. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Casey, for bringing to the attention of this body the fact that \nwe have not met our constitutional responsibility in the advice and \nconsent of appointments made by the President to the courts.\n  I think we all understand the challenge on the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, where the failure to hold a hearing on Judge Garland, \nbasically saying the President's term is no longer 4 years but 3 years \nin an election year, makes no sense at all. We have all been talking \nabout that, but as Senator Casey pointed out, this is now becoming a \nmatter for our district courts.\n  Let me share with my colleagues. This past week, I went by the U.S. \nDistrict Court in Greenbelt, MD, and had a chance to talk with some of \nthe judges who were there. They were telling me there is a serious \nurgency to fill the vacancies on the Maryland District Court. We have \ntwo vacancies on the Maryland District Court. One was appointed by the \nPresident in March of last year, Paula Xinis, to fill the vacancy. We \nhave a judicial emergency in Maryland. The President did his job in \nmaking the nomination in March of 2015. For reasons I don't quite \nunderstand, it took 6 months before the Judiciary Committee reported \nout that nomination, but they did. They reported it out in September \n2015, 6 months later. This is not a controversial appointment. It \npassed by voice vote out of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Paula Xinis is well qualified. She has clerked for judges. She has a \ndistinguished record in public service, public interest law as well as \nin private law. I could go through her full record. I have done it \nbefore, but Paula Xinis has now been waiting over a year for \nconsideration.\n  So I am sort of puzzled. Is the Republican leadership now telling us \nthat the term of a President is no longer 4 years but 2 years for the \nappointment of district court judges? This is a noncontroversial \nappointment that should have been confirmed well before now and is \nstill on the calendar. As my friend from Pennsylvania pointed out, when \nwe look at the number of actions this Congress has taken on President \nObama's appointments--17 confirmations by the Senate--compared to a \ncomparable number in 2008, when the Democrats controlled the Senate and \nit was in the last 2 years of President Bush's term, 68 nominations \nwere filled in that year.\n  Currently, we have 20 nominations on the Executive Calendar waiting \nfor action that have been approved by noncontroversial votes of the \nJudiciary Committee. The number of vacancies has increased in these 2 \nyears from 43 to 79.\n  I know the distinguished leader is on the floor. I am hopeful we will \nfind a\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\nway forward so we can act on some of these nominations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations: \nCalendar No. 307, Calendar No. 357, Calendar No. 358, Calendar No. 359, \nCalendar No. 362, Calendar No. 363, Calendar No. 364, Calendar No. 459, \nCalendar No. 460, Calendar No. 461, Calendar No. 508; further, that the \nSenate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on the \nnominations in the order listed; that the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate; that no further motions be made in order to the nominations; \nthat any related statements be printed in the Record; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as I had noted before we left for \nrecess, the way to look at these judicial appointments is to talk about \napples and apples, not apples and oranges.\n  At this point in President Bush's 8 years, he had 303 judicial \nnominations confirmed. President Obama so far has had 324. According to \nmy math, that is 21 more judges confirmed during the 8 years of \nPresident Obama to this point than during the 8 years of President Bush \nto this point.\n  That said, we are looking to see if we can set up another vote on a \njudicial nominee, but until that process is complete, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as I pointed out to my colleagues, the \nnumber of vacancies has increased during this term from 43 to 79. We \nhave judicial emergencies in our State and many States around the \nNation. So I am going to try a smaller number and see whether we can \nget agreement on that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nto consider the following nominations: Calendar No. 307, Xinis; \nCalendar No. 357, Martinotti; Calendar No. 358, Rossiter; Calendar No. \n359, Stanton; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  As I indicated a moment ago, the way to measure a President's success \nin getting judges confirmed is to compare two Presidencies--President \nBush, who was in office for 8 years, and President Obama, who will be \nin office for 8 years--to this point. At this point, President Obama \nhas received 21 more judicial confirmations than President Bush did to \nthis point. So he has been treated very fairly.\n  Therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 307, Paula Xinis, nominee for the District of Maryland; \nthat the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or debate on \nthe nomination; the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further \nmotions be in order to the nomination; that any related statements be \nprinted in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, there are today 81 vacancies in our Federal \ncourts, 29 of which are judicial emergencies.\n  I note, with respect, that the majority leader has compared the \nnumber of district court nominees confirmed under the previous \nPresident and the current President; but, in my view, what matters most \nis that there are 29 judicial emergencies in district courts across \nthis country and that there are 20 district court nominees who were \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee on unanimous voice votes that \ncontinue to await action on this floor--the one that I just sought a \nunanimous consent for, Paula Xinis of the District of Maryland, and 19 \nothers. At this point, 1\\1/2\\ years into this Congress, only 17 judges \nhave been confirmed to district courts in this United States, and last \nyear the Senate matched a record for confirming the fewest in more than \nhalf a century--11 for the entire year.\n  What I am most concerned about is its impact on the operations of the \ncourts of the United States. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I \nam frustrated and concerned. We have 24 nominees waiting for a hearing \nin the committee as well; 7 of these nominees are to courts of appeals, \nincluding AUSA Rebecca Ross Haywood, who has been nominated to serve on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the appellate court \ncovering my home State of Delaware.\n  Then, of course, there are ongoing concerns about the vacancy on the \nSupreme Court. It has been 55 days since President Obama nominated \nChief Judge Merrick Garland--a consensus candidate who was previously \nconfirmed to his seat on the DC Circuit by a bipartisan majority of the \nprevious Congress--to our Nation's highest Court.\n  Last week, a bipartisan group of former Solicitors General--Paul \nClement, Todd Olson, and Ken Starr, former SGs who have served in both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations--endorsed Judge Garland as \n``superbly qualified,'' having ``demonstrated the temperament, \nintellect, and experience to serve'' on the Supreme Court. I am gravely \nconcerned that we have sunk to a level in terms of the delays in \nconfirmation of qualified judicial nominees to the courts at all levels \nin our country, that we are having a significant ongoing and negative \nimpact on the functioning of our courts and access to justice in this \ncountry. Sadly, obstruction in this body has allowed too many of our \ncourts to grind to a halt on the important business of our Federal \njudicial system. I believe it is time we do our jobs. There are vetted, \nqualified Americans ready, willing, and able to serve in our Nation's \njustice system. We should embrace their willingness to serve and let \nthem get to work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, was there a unanimous consent request?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No further consents are pending.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                     Remembering Robert F. Bennett\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man who was truly \na giant in my home State of Utah and in this institution, the U.S. \nSenate.\n  He was a friend to everyone he met and someone whose life of service \nto the people of Utah we celebrate. At the same time, we mourn his \npassing: Senator Robert F. Bennett.\n  Senator Bennett loved the political arena. Though his heart was \nalways with his family in Utah, he spent many years working on Capitol \nHill in both the Senate and the House, and later as a congressional \nliaison for the Department of Transportation. He also spent many years \nin business, where his management abilities and his keen mind helped \nbuild a successful corporation and earn him awards such as Inc. \nMagazine's ``Entrepreneur of the Year.''\n  But Senator Bennett's true passion was for sound public policy, for \nthe development of good policy. He cared little about who wrote policy, \nand he cared even less for who would get the credit for good policy. So \nlong as wise politics were enacted into law, he was\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\nhappy. That was his objective, and it was a noble one at that.\n\n  This was apparent to me after a memorable conversation I had with him \nin 2010, just a few days before our State's Republican nominating \nconvention, at which we were both candidates. I was in the lobby of a \nlocal radio and television station, waiting to go on the air and \nwatching the national news on a large television screen. I don't \nremember the exact issue that was being discussed, but I remember the \ngeneral topic, and I will never forget what happened as I watched this \nbroadcast.\n  Senator Bennett walked into the lobby and, seeing me, simply strolled \nover to stand next to me. To be honest, I was anticipating the type of \nunderstandably awkward interaction that might occur between candidates \nnear the end of a heated political contest. Instead, with his \ncharismatic and characteristic charm and affability, he quickly put me \nat ease by nodding toward the screen and saying rather diplomatically, \n``You know, there's a pretty good chance that you will be the person \nwho has to deal with this issue.''\n  Having gracefully diffused the situation and diffused any tension \nthat might have otherwise been between us at that moment, he proceeded \nto share some words of wisdom and personal insights, imparting to me \nsome of the lessons he had learned from his own experience on that \nmatter. It was clear to me that he had not only thought long and hard \nabout it but that he was ultimately less concerned with who addressed \nthe issue, less concerned with who would get credit for fixing the \nproblem, and more concerned with ensuring that the problem was dealt \nwith thoughtfully, wisely, and in a manner most likely to result in a \ngood outcome for the American people. In Senator Bennett's view, there \nwas no such thing as a political opponent; there were only potential \npolitical allies.\n  Although Senator Bennett was a serious statesman, he was also one who \ndid not take himself too seriously. This is one of the many reasons \npeople everywhere were drawn to him. Many Utahns will remember his \nflair for self-deprecating humor emblazoned on his campaign billboards \nin 2004. Summarizing Senator Bennett's most distinctive qualities, one \nbillboard read: ``Bold. Brilliant. Beanpole.'' In a slight variation on \nthe same theme, another one of his billboards read: ``Big Heart. Big \nIdeas. Big Ears.'' And perhaps everyone's favorite declared: ``Better \nlooking than Abraham Lincoln,'' adding parenthetically, ``just \nbarely.'' In the political arena, where inflated egos loom large, Bob \nBennett was a breath of fresh air.\n  Senator Bennett's command of public policy was legendary. He could \nspeak extemporaneously and at length on everything from the Federal \nbudget, to Utah's changing demographics, to business trends, and he \ncould do so without any notes.\n  He was a master storyteller, one who had the uncanny ability to \nentertain and challenge his audience at the same time--the result of a \nlifetime of learning and profound thinking. He always maintained an \nopen mind, never unwilling to rethink policy issues in light of new \ninformation. These qualities are but a few of the reasons he was a \ntrusted colleague, and he was trusted by colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle of this Chamber.\n  Although much has been written about his public and his political \naccomplishments, there was a side to him that does not receive the \nattention it probably deserves. A day in the life of a U.S. Senator is \noften stressful and invariably unpredictable. Under such circumstances, \nthe likelihood of error is high, and as one of his staffers once told \nme, ``There were plenty of times that scheduling mistakes were made, \nand anger at us''--the staff--``certainly would have been justified.'' \nBut these same staffers also said that in 18 years in the U.S. Senate, \nthey never saw Bob Bennett get angry or even so much as raise his voice \nat any of his staff members. He was always kind, patient, and \nunderstanding with them, and they were committed and loyal to him in \nreturn. I am convinced that one of the reasons so many Members of the \nSenate trusted Bob Bennett so completely was that they saw how his own \nstaff treated him and how he returned that trust.\n  I have been the beneficiary of the staff that he built. Some of my \nvery best staffers were those whom I hired from Senator Bennett's \noffice, who not only helped me get my office up and running but helped \nkeep it running efficiently and effectively as the trained \nprofessionals they were, having been mentored by one of the greats of \nthis institution.\n  Senator Bennett was a man of the utmost integrity and was the same \ncalm, deliberate, and thoughtful person whether speaking in public or \nspeaking to close confidants. At 6 feet 6 inches, he towered over most \npeople, but that didn't prevent him from meeting people where they \nwere, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and exhibiting true \nunderstanding and true compassion for all with whom he interacted.\n  Whether he was talking with ranchers in Iron County or consulting a \ngrieving parent visiting him in his Salt Lake office or debating the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve during a Banking Committee hearing, Bob \nBennett treated everyone the same--with kindness, respect, and concern.\n  He often quoted President Reagan's famous aphorism that ``there is no \nlimit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who \ngets the credit.'' But Senator Bennett didn't just recite those words; \nhe lived them. They were part of who he was and what he did.\n  On more than one occasion, he worked for months on end to craft a \nlegislative solution to a difficult issue, only to discover at the last \nmoment that the price of its passage would be to give all the credit to \nsomeone else. Because his objective was--first and foremost--to make \nsure the right thing was done, this was a price Senator Bennett was \nalways willing to pay. This was an obstacle from which he never shied \naway. This was something that never deterred him from doing the right \nthing.\n  Since the election of 2010, I have been asked countless times about \nmy relationship with Senator Bennett. My answer invariably reminds me \nof the great privilege it is to serve the State of Utah in his seat. \nOur conversations were always meaningful and focused on innovative \napproaches to dealing with difficult and important policy issues. A \nconsummate statesman and a classic gentleman, he always made clear to \nme that good policy is always good politics in the end.\n  Senator Bennett's achievements were numerous, and he will be \nremembered for his tremendous impact on the State of Utah. However, I \nam certain that if he were to make a list of his greatest \naccomplishments, it would likely say nothing about his business \nsuccesses or his political endeavors. Rather, it would focus entirely \non his family--on his dear wife Joyce, the 6 children they raised \ntogether, and on their 20 grandchildren.\n  Senator Bennett truly was, in every way, a giant. He was a man of \nintegrity, a man whose word was truly his bond, and a man who left both \nthe State of Utah and his country better than he found them. He was a \nman who had a firm and unwavering commitment to his faith in God and \nwas true to that faith until the very end.\n  It is my hope and prayer that Senator Bennett's wife Joyce, his \nchildren, and his grandchildren are comforted at this difficult time, \nknowing that our State and our country are forever grateful for their \nhusband, father, and grandfather's exemplary life of service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Utah for \nhis generous remarks about our friend, Senator Bob Bennett. I had the \nopportunity to serve with Senator Bennett for a number of years. Those \nof us who are of a certain age, who were raised in the Star Wars \nperiod--sometimes I think about Bob Bennett as the Jedi Master, the \nObi-Wan Kenobi, one of the wise men of the Senate whom it has been my \npleasure to come to know and learn from. Certainly, we will miss him. \nWe send our very best wishes and condolences to Joyce and their entire \nfamily, along with 20 grandchildren. It is a huge, wonderful family of \nwhich I know he was very, very proud.\n\n\n Working Together in the Senate and Criminal Justice and Mental Health \n                                 Reform\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the Senate's work \nand what\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\nwe have been able to do and what we still have to do. In the past we \nknew there had been an experiment, principally under the leadership of \nthe former majority leader, now the minority leader, Senator Reid, of \nbasically not allowing the Senate to function and not allowing \nSenators, including Members of the majority party, to offer amendments, \nlest people be forced to vote on things they later would be held \naccountable for by the voters. What a concept that is.\n  In fact, we have seen a different approach at work under the \nleadership of Senator McConnell, the Senate majority leader in the \n114th Congress, over the last, roughly, year and a half. It is one \nwhere everyone gets to participate, and when people have a better idea, \nthey are allowed to offer that by way of an amendment and constructive \nproposal to improve legislation and to try to do what they can to build \nconsensus, to get legislation passed in the Senate and the House, and \nget it on the President's desk. We are going to have differences. Of \ncourse we are. But it is important that we try and that we not just \ncome here to make speeches and vote no on everything, but we actually \ntry to find some way of getting to yes, particularly where it doesn't \nviolate our principles and where we are able to make incremental \nprogress on the work we have been sent to do.\n  Fortunately, we have seen the Senate get back to work. We just \nrecently passed important legislation, such as the Energy Policy \nModernization Act--a bill that will update our country's energy \npolicies. This follows on the heels of a vote late last year where we \nlifted the antiquated ban on crude oil exports. It is something to give \nour domestic producers access to global prices for their products, \nsomething that encourages domestic production and helps us become less \ndependent on foreign imports and helps us help our friends and allies \naround the world who are sometimes dependent for their source of energy \non some pretty unsavory characters who can cut it off, using energy as \na weapon. But, particularly, it is important in terms of getting \nAmericans back to work.\n  While the unemployment rate continues to tick down to roughly about 5 \npercent, the untold story is the percentage of people actually \nparticipating in the workforce is at a 30-year low, and people have, \nunfortunately, given up looking for work in too many instances, making \nthat 5-percent unemployment statistic a little bit misleading. We \nlearned again last week, I think it was, that our economy grew at 0.5 \npercent.\n  I remember when we used to talk around here about the economy growing \nat 4 percent or 3 percent, at least. In other words, as population \nincreases, the only way more jobs get created is for our economy to \ncontinue to grow. There are not a lot of problems that America has that \ncouldn't be made better by a growing economy. Unfortunately, we have \nseen the negative consequences of some of the policies, particularly of \nthe executive branch when it comes to regulation, which have made that \nvery difficult. We have been making some progress in the Energy Policy \nModernization Act as part of that. It has passed consumer-friendly \nlegislation that will help people get access to energy help and provide \nthe incentives for them to conserve.\n  We have also done things such as pass a reauthorization of the \nFederal Aviation Act, the FAA. That may not seem like a big deal \nunless, of course, you fly in an airplane and care about safety. The \nlegislation we passed--I think the Senate has done that--has helped \nregulate the growing number of remotely run aircraft or drones to make \nsure those don't conflict with passenger planes, so those will be \nsafer. That is just another example.\n\n  We have also passed important legislation to deal with this \nprescription drug abuse crisis. Many call it the opioid abuse crisis, \nwhich happens too often. When people can't get access to the addictive \nprescription painkilling drugs they have been prescribed, they turn to \nthe cheaper forms of addictive drugs such as heroin. We were able to \npass the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act back in March, and I \nknow the House of Representatives--I believe this week--is taking up \nthis same legislation. My hope is that we can continue to work together \nto bring relief to those struggling with addictions and to help save \nthose who would otherwise suffer from a fatal overdose of drugs. We \nstill have a lot of work ahead of us.\n  We started the appropriations process last month, which I know has \nbeen an enormous frustration to a lot of people. I remember all too \nclearly, as the Presiding Officer does, the alternative, which was \ndoing it in a 12-step process. The regular appropriations process was \nto do an omnibus appropriations bill at the end of the year, which is a \nlousy way of doing business. We would have one bill that would spend \nroughly $1 trillion. That process lacked the transparency and \naccountability that necessarily goes into a step-by-step process, where \nwe move 12 separate appropriation bills across the floor. We all said \nwe wanted to do this. This basic work is done by the legislature so we \ncan pay the bills according to the limits we have agreed upon in terms \nof spending, but we keep running into roadblocks.\n  Last night we had a vote to try to get back on the Water and Energy \nappropriations bill. The obstacle appears to be that our friends on the \nother side of the aisle don't want to vote on the germane amendment \nthat was offered by the Senator from Arkansas. As a result of their \nobjections to proceeding in the normal way to consider germane \namendments like that one, the fact is, the majority leader had to file \nfor cloture on that bill in order to guarantee that there will be a \nvote on that amendment. Hopefully, once that is resolved, we will get \nback on final passage of that appropriations bill and then move on to \nthe Transportation, Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill. \nAfter that, I believe the plan is to move on to the VA-Military \nConstruction appropriations bill. In other words, it is not fancy work, \nbut it is our work, and it is something we should be doing in a \ntransparent and methodical sort of way.\n  These bills actually represent the fundamentals of legislating--the \nsort of blocking and tackling. They include resources to fund our \nmilitary, which is something we all say we are for. We need to keep our \ncommitments to our veterans, which is a sacred obligation, and we need \nto help provide the necessary infrastructure across our country. We \nneed to keep the folks who serve our country in diplomatic posts abroad \nand those who protect our borders here at home safe. I hope we can \ngrind our way through this so we can take up and pass all 12 \nappropriations bills. The people who have elected us deserve that and \nnot some end-of-the-year mad dash to the finish line, where everybody \ncomes away pretty much dissatisfied by the process.\n  Beyond the appropriations process, I also want to point out some \nimportant work being done at the committee level in the Senate. I serve \non the Judiciary Committee under the leadership of Chairman Chuck \nGrassley from Iowa. At the end of April, I was proud to join a number \nof my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to announce major proposals to \nreform our criminal justice system. Back when I went to law school, \nmore years ago than I would like to recount, we were told the criminal \nlaw was supposed to be used to punish people who violated the law, to \ndeter others who might be tempted to commit crimes in the future, and \nto rehabilitate people who made a mistake and ended up in prison. My \nexperience and observation has been we have largely forgotten the \nrehabilitation process.\n  Beginning in 2007, in Texas and other States, we began to provide \nincentives for low-risk offenders who were in prison who, if given the \nopportunity, would begin the process of turning their lives around. \nThey might be dealing with a drug or alcohol addiction or an education \ndeficit, such as the fellow I heard about when I was in a prison in \nEast Texas recently. The shop teacher at that prison said: I have guys \nin my shop class in this prison who can't even read a ruler. How in the \nworld are they supposed to get a job on the outside? How in the world \nare they supposed to turn their lives around once they get out of \nprison? We simply seem to forget that people who are in prison will \nusually get out of prison, and the only question is: How well equipped \nwill they be to work in civil society and to hopefully turn their lives \naround and become productive members of society.\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n  I am not naive enough to say or to think that everyone will take \nadvantage of those opportunities, but we know that many will take \nadvantage of those opportunities. That is not just conjecture, that is \nbased on the experience of States like Texas, Georgia, and North \nCarolina.\n  As former attorney general and long-time Federal district judge in \nNew York, Michael Mukasey, said: The gold standard in terms of criminal \njustice reform is the crime rate. I know there has been some discussion \nabout the incarceration rate, and some people want to talk about other \nthings, but he said the real question has to do with the crime rate. If \nthe crime rate is going down, you are doing something right. If the \ncrime rate is going up, you are doing something wrong. The good news is \nthe crime rates in places like Texas have gone down as a result of some \nof these programs which help to prepare those who are willing to take \nand accept this help so they can turn their lives around. It has also \nhelped us deal with the ballooning prison system cost. Indeed, in Texas \nalone we have been able to shut down three prisons as a result of \nreducing the population, slowing down and in many cases eliminating \nthis turnstile, where people go to prison, get out, commit other \ncrimes, and end up right back in prison again. This is an example of \ncriminal justice reform which I know the President is for.\n  There is another component of sentencing reform which I think very \nsensibly deals with some of the mandatory prison sentences that were \npassed many years ago with the best intentions but some of which have \nreally overshot the mark. The most important element, when it comes to \na criminal sentence, is the certainty of the sentence, not the length \nof the sentence. Again, Judge Mukasey, former Attorney General of the \nUnited States said: Many times people who commit crimes have impulse-\ncontrol problems, and they are not thinking about what is going to \nhappen to them 25 years from now or 50 years from now. They are \nthinking about what will happen to them next week, today, or later \ntomorrow. So I believe the certainty of punishment is a more important \nconsideration than the length of the punishment.\n  It may make some people feel good to say we are going to put somebody \naway for the rest of their lives, and in some instances that is the \nappropriate punishment, but when it involves a nonviolent offense and \nthey are stacking mandatory sentences in a way that is disproportionate \nto the offense that was committed, I think it is appropriate to \nconsider changing the mandatory minimum sentencing.\n  We also created a safety valve. Nobody who is currently in prison \ngets the benefit of the changes in the mandatory minimum sentences \nwithout appearing in front of the same Federal district judge who \nsentenced that person to prison in the first place. That Federal \ndistrict judge will be able to not only consider the circumstances of \nthe crime but the postconviction and postincarceration conduct as well \nas the comments and input of any victims of the crime. This way they \ncan determine--based on all of the circumstances--whether you ought to \nbe given the benefit of that reduced mandatory minimum sentence. It is \nnot a get-out-of-jail-free card. It gives that person a right to be \nconsidered by a Federal district judge as long as it does not involve a \nserious crime as defined by Federal law. We categorically excluded that \nto make sure this is focused primarily on nonviolent offenders, those \nwho are least likely to put the community at risk.\n  There is one other area that I think we have an opportunity to work \non and perhaps succeed with because there seems to be no real objection \nto the idea; that is, how to deal with people who have mental illness \nin our society. Back in the old days, people with mental illness used \nto be put in institutions. They were basically locked up and the key \nwas thrown away. Well, we know that didn't work very well. It was \nbasically warehousing people with mental illness. Someone had the idea \nto deinstitutionalize those with mental illness. That way they would \nget to live in the community and would then receive the sort of \nfollowup help, assistance, and care they needed in order to maximize \ntheir potential, whatever it might be. It was good in theory, but after \nthe deinstitutionalization took place, people ended up living in the \nstreets--the homeless whom all of us see. They are obviously mentally \nill, but they live on the streets or end up in our criminal justice \nsystem because they are not getting the treatment that might help them \nto become more adaptive and productive.\n  I told this story before, and I will repeat it briefly now. I have a \nfriend who is the sheriff of Bexar County, in San Antonio, TX. While at \na meeting recently here in Washington, DC, he said: How would you like \nto meet the largest mental health provider in America. I said: Sure. \nShe said: Let me introduce you to the sheriff of Los Angeles County. In \nother words, the person who runs the LA County jail. In addition to the \nhomeless who are living on our streets or crowding our emergency rooms \nwith a variety of illnesses--real and imagined--a large number of \npeople end up in our jails.\n  Thanks to great innovative programs like that in Bexar County, San \nAntonio, TX, and as a result of what Sheriff Pamerleau and others have \ndone, we began to address the problem at its root and are making sure \nthat people who need help are not just warehoused in jail but are \nactually diverted to a treatment facility. I have introduced \nlegislation which I think might help the situation, and that is called \nthe Mental Health and Safe Communities Act. The fact is, Adam Lanza's \nmother--Adam Lanza was the shooter at Sandy Hook who stole his mother's \ngun, killed his own mother, and then went on to murder those poor, \ninnocent children at Sandy Hook Elementary School--basically had two \nchoices: One is she could seek an involuntary, temporary commitment to \na mental institution, after which he gets out, he is angry at her, \ntheir relationship deteriorates even more, and she has nowhere else to \nturn or we could have a mechanism where she could go to a civil court \nand ask a judge to enter a court order requiring her son to undergo \noutpatient treatment, to make sure he saw a psychologist or mental \nhealth professional and was actually compliant with the doctor's orders \nin terms of taking his medication.\n  One of the biggest problems in the mental health area is that people \nwill simply start to feel better and then quit taking their medicine. \nAs a result, they end up becoming sicker and sicker and sicker. In Adam \nLanza's case--because his mother really didn't have any mechanism to \nmake him comply with his doctor's order to take his medication--he \nbasically became more and more mentally ill until this tragedy \noccurred. I am not saying this would have necessarily prevented that \ntragedy, but I think it would provide another tool that loved ones can \nuse, and I believe need, when a member of their family suffers from \nsymptoms of mental illness and simply refuses to deal with it and \ncomply with their doctor's orders.\n  This month is actually National Mental Health Awareness Month, and it \nis an appropriate time for us to talk not only about the solution--or \nat least something that will improve the status quo, when it comes to \nmental illness in our country--but it is also a time to educate people \nabout mental health issues and to highlight ongoing efforts and to \nsupport those who are struggling.\n  I dare to say that there is not a single family in America that is \nnot affected by this problem or, perhaps, if it is not an immediate \nfamily member, then it is somebody they know or somebody with whom they \nlive in the community. So we have a lot of work to do.\n  Criminal justice reform and mental health reform are two issues that \nare absolutely the opposite of partisan; they are nonpartisan issues. \nThere are issues where people have different points of view, and that \nis fine. Let's see where we can build consensus and what things we may \nhave to leave for future legislation. The basic point is that, even \nthough the media is obsessed with what is happening in the Presidential \nrace and the primaries on both sides, we have been able to continue to \ndo the people's work here. There is a lot to be done, and, frankly, \nthere is a lot more that we can do. But we have an opportunity to build \non nearly a year and a half of a strong bipartisan record of \naccomplishment, one\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\nthat has benefitted both those in the majority and the minority. \nFrankly, the focus shouldn't be on us--on who is up and who is down--\nbut on what we are able to do together to pass legislation that helps \nthe American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            The Administration's Policies in the Middle East\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, we all know that the Obama \nadministration's 8 years in office is beginning to wind down. As it \ndoes, as is natural for a President ending his time in office, the \nPresident and the members of his team are starting to focus on their \nlegacy and on how they want to be remembered.\n  Now with regard to this administration's policies in the Middle East, \nunfortunately for them, the legacy and narrative that is beginning to \ntake hold is one of not leveling with the American people--not one of \nhonesty. That should concern all of us--all of us in this body, whether \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  When the President of the United States is in open disagreement with \nthe Secretary of Defense and with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff on one of the most critical issues our Nation faces--whether to \nsend our sons and daughters into combat--it should be cause for \nsignificant concern for all of us in this body and across the country.\n  President Obama has repeatedly told the American people that U.S. \ntroops in the Middle East are not in combat. In 2010, he announced that \nwe were ``ending our combat mission in Iraq,'' and in 2014, he used the \nsame words to talk about Afghanistan. More recently, he said that our \nmission in Syria ``will not involve American combat troops fighting on \nforeign soil.''\n  Yet, just less than 2 weeks ago, in a Senate Armed Services Committee \nhearing, when Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, were asked if our troops in the \nMiddle East, Syria, and Iraq are engaged in combat, these two senior \nU.S. officials unequivocally said: Yes, they are. To the members of our \nmilitary serving overseas, particularly in the Middle East, Secretary \nCarter and General Dunford were stating the obvious. Indeed, there have \nbeen recent news reports in the Washington Post and in the Military \nTimes that describe up to 200 Marines at a place called Fire Base Bell \nin northern Iraq, firing artillery missions on a daily basis in support \nof Iraqi troops in order to kill ISIS terrorists. Our soldiers serving \nin the Middle East as part of the Joint Special Operations Command \nconduct regular counterterrorism missions to kill and capture \nterrorists in the Middle East. Of course, we see on a daily basis our \nbrave pilots from all the different services, who have dropped \napproximately 40,000 bombs in Iraq and Syria in close air support \nmissions, focused on destroying and killing ISIS members and their \ninfrastructure and their logistics bases.\n  Since 2014, almost 1,200 bombs and close air support missions have \nbeen conducted in Afghanistan. Just yesterday, we were informed of a \nsuccessful strike--again, a coalition strike with fighter aircraft--\nthat killed three ISIS leaders.\n  These missions have entailed risk. Some of the members of our \nmilitary have been killed and others have been wounded, but there is no \ndoubt that all of what I have just described is the very definition of \ncombat. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff have both stated this.\n  Indeed, in a lead editorial in the Military Times on Friday entitled \n``It's a combat mission, Mr. President,'' the editorial concluded by \nsaying:\n\n       When U.S. and allied troops are on Islamic State turf with \n     the mission of wiping it from existence, they are on a combat \n     mission. Calling it anything else is wrong.\n\n  To Secretary Carter's credit, at a hearing last week, he agreed and \nstated unequivocally that ``these [members of our military] are in \ncombat . . . and I think we need to say that clearly.''\n  This is the Secretary of Defense. Well, apparently the White House \ndidn't get the memo. Last week, when asked about a very brave Navy SEAL \nwho unfortunately was killed in a fierce firefight involving U.S. \nSpecial Operations forces, Kurdish commandos, and Islamic State \nfighters, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters that ``the \nrelatively small number of U.S. servicemembers that are involved in \nthese operations are not in combat but are in a dangerous place.''\n  That is the White House--``relatively small'' and ``not in combat.''\n  Why does President Obama and his White House continue to peddle the \nfiction that U.S. forces are not engaged in combat? That is a really \nimportant question that we need to be asking. Why? The whole world \nknows that we are. Why are they peddling this fiction to the American \npeople?\n  Perhaps the Commander in Chief is truly unaware that our military \nforces are in combat, and there are hundreds of them that are. If that \nis the case, that would be very troubling indeed. What is more likely \nis that the President has told the American people repeatedly that he \nwill end wars and won't send combat troops to the Middle East, and so \nthe word contortions coming from the White House are part of the \ntwisted attempt to salvage and protect the President's legacy. But by \nspinning the truth for political purposes, the President is coming \nperilously close to leaving a legacy of dishonesty when it comes to our \nmilitary involvement in the Middle East.\n  Much more worrisome, this dishonesty comes with a cost. First and \nforemost, it diminishes the service and sacrifice of our troops and \ntheir families. Again, in the Military Times editorial on this very \ntopic, on Friday it stated:\n\n       Calling it a training mission [in the Middle East] is cold \n     comfort to the parents, spouses and children of the deployed \n     troops. . . . The more the White House insists these troops \n     are not part of a combat mission, the more distrust it breeds \n     in the ranks [of our military] and among the public. It's \n     viewed as the sort of condescending semantics Washington \n     plays to deny the obvious. That can only serve to erode \n     support for the [important] mission.\n\n  Americans serving in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan know that they are \nin combat. The Commander in Chief needs to acknowledge this fact and \nthe bravery it entails and not disguise the true nature of their duty.\n  Second, the costs that come with this dishonesty is that it further \nundermines the administration's very tenuous foreign policy credibility \nregarding its stated goal of degrading and destroying ISIS. While this \nis the correct goal, a series of missteps in the Middle East, including \nthe President's failure to enforce his own redline when it was crossed \nby Bashar al-Assad in Syria has brought us to the point where our \nadversaries and our allies question U.S. credibility and resolve. \nIslamic State terrorists know that they are in combat against American \nforces. They see it every day. But when the President says otherwise, \nit signals a lack of conviction, making it harder for us to defeat \nthese terrorists.\n  Third, this dishonesty about the role of our troops allows \nPresidential candidates to duck a tough issue. For example, \nPresidential candidate Hillary Clinton has repeatedly said--\nunchallenged by anyone, including in the media--that she would continue \nthe President's policies of not sending combat troops to Syria and \nIraq. But the President is sending combat troops to Syria and Iraq.\n  Finally, and more broadly, by playing fast and loose with the facts \nabout our policies in the Middle East, the Obama administration is \nmaking it harder to gain congressional support for its policy. I \nstrongly believe that when the executive branch and the legislative \nbranch on national security and foreign policy issues are in agreement \nand working together, that is when we are strongest as a country. I \nhave been critical of this administration's policies in certain areas \nand supportive in others. If Congress feels like the administration is \nbeing played and the American public is not getting the courtesy of the \ntruth, support in this body for these important policies will crumble.\n  We saw an extreme example of this over the weekend in a remarkable \nNew York Times Magazine piece about the\n\n[[Page S2660]]\n\nPresident's Deputy National Security Advisor, who is credited with \nselling the Iran nuclear deal to Congress and the American people. We \nsee line after line in a very lengthy article about not leveling with \nthe American people on that deal, which we debated here on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Let me give you a couple of quotes from that article. One is just how \nthey sold the deal. Now I am quoting the article.\n\n       The way in which most Americans have heard the story of the \n     Iran deal presented--that the Obama administration began \n     seriously engaging with Iranian officials in 2013 in order to \n     take advantage of a new political reality in Iran, which came \n     about in 2013 because of elections that brought moderates to \n     power in that country--was largely manufactured [by the White \n     House] for the purpose of selling the deal.\n\n  So here we have White House officials saying they manufactured a \nstory to sell the nuclear deal to the Congress and the American people.\n  Another quote talked about a speech the President gave on the deal--a \nvery important speech--and it says:\n\n       While the President's statement and speech was technically \n     accurate--\n\n  This is about the timing of the negotiations--\n\n     it was also actively misleading.\n\n  So again a top White House official is pretty much admitting that he \nwas fabricating a narrative to get the American people and the Congress \nof the United States to ``sell'' and ``buy off'' on the Iran deal.\n  You know, reading this article, one gets the sense that to some of \nthe people in the White House, this is all a game. Facts don't matter, \nbut cleverness does. The quotes in the article from young White House \nofficials are almost gleeful when they recount how they sold the \nnuclear deal to ``clueless reporters''--any of the press listening, I \nhope you like that adjective--and Members of Congress and how the White \nHouse created an ``echo chamber'' and were the puppet masters, \nliterally putting words in the mouths of Members of Congress and \nreporters to sell this deal.\n  My colleagues should read this article. Again, it is like a game. \nBut, of course, this is not a game. All of this--American troops in \ncombat, whether the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism should \nobtain a nuclear weapon--this is not a game. This is a deadly serious \nreality.\n  I was reminded of this serious reality this past week when I spent \nmuch of my recess with the assessment and selection team of the Marine \nCorps' Special Operations Command. It wasn't clever 30-somethings with \nfine arts degrees out in the field, working on little sleep, but 20-\nsomethings of all backgrounds, from every corner of America, going \nthrough some of the most rigorous military training possible. Some of \nthese young marines will make the cut for Special Operations Command \nand others won't, but all are striving for the honor of defending their \nNation during challenging times. No doubt in due time many will be \nheading to the Middle East and other parts of the world, doing their \nduty to keep us safe.\n  The Obama administration owes these brave young Americans the truth, \nnot spin. The Obama administration owes Congress the truth, not spin. \nThe Obama administration certainly owes the American people the truth, \nnot spin. The sooner the President and his White House start leveling \nwith the American people about our roles and our policies in the Middle \nEast, the better it will be for all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, before I give my intended remarks and \nwhile the Senator from Alaska is still on the floor, let me just share \nwith him--although I probably would not have used some of the \npejorative terms, let me agree with him that this distinction that has \nbeen made between combat troops and noncombat troops in the Middle East \nis ridiculous.\n  We need a more fulsome discussion on the floor of the Senate as to \nthe scope of our deployment there. We just heard evidence last week \nthat we have U.S. troops on the ground in Yemen in addition to Iraq and \nSyria. Frankly, the appropriate forum to have that discussion is a \ndebate on an authorization of the use of military force to fight our \nenemies in the region.\n  So, while I might not share the way in which the sentiments were \nexpressed, I think that this conversation about brave men and women--\nAmerican soldiers--putting their lives on the line as we speak in the \nMiddle East is as important as it gets. The fact that we are not having \na broader discussion about this is deeply problematic. So I thank the \nSenator for raising the issue. I hope it is something on which we can \ncome together as we provide legal cover and perhaps restrictions on the \nuse of force in the region. So I thank the Senator for bringing up this \nimportant subject.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the 21,000 people a \nyear, 2,600 a month, 86 a day--these are rough numbers--who are killed \nby guns all across the country. A lot of the kids who grow up in \nneighborhoods like the North End of Hartford or the East End of \nBridgeport--it feels like a war zone because they fear for their life \nevery day as they are walking to school. The levels of PTSD--when \nvirtually every one of these kids knows someone very close to them who \nhas been shot, it rivals the diagnoses that come back from war zones \nabroad.\n  Today, in my campaign to try to bring the voices of victims to the \nfloor of the Senate, I want to talk about one aspect of this epidemic \nthat is all across the country; that is, the epidemic of young children \nbeing killed accidentally by guns. The numbers are really hard to \nbelieve, that in this country, in any one given year, there are \nsomewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 children and teens who die from guns \nin the United States. That does not even count all of the kids who \nsuffer nonfatal gun injuries; in 2010, the official number was about \n18,000. There is a lot of reporting that suggests that the numbers we \nknow are dramatically lower than what the actual numbers are, that \nthere are a lot of injuries that happen in the home because of guns \nthat are not reported as part of the official statistics.\n  Here are just a handful of headlines from recent papers, including \nthis New York Times headline: ``One Week in April, Four Toddlers Shot \nand Killed Themselves.''\n  On average, last year, in 2015, people were getting shot by toddlers \non a weekly basis. I think it is time that we start talking about this \nepidemic of young kids--as young as 1 or 2 years old--getting their \nhands on weapons and either killing themselves or killing their parents \nor their brothers or their sisters and that we start talking about the \nfact that this is not happening anywhere else in the world.\n  Here are the rates of gun deaths per 100,000--this is children and \nteens. We are going to take high-income countries. I mean, it is not \nclose. Canada, our neighbor, is the next highest with 0.75 per 100,000, \nbut 3.24 children and teens die from gun homicides, gun deaths--\naccidental, intentional--every year. Other countries barely register. \nThere is nothing unique about the nature of American children that \nexplains this away. The only thing that can explain this is the large \nnumber of unsafe weapons that are available to children. So I want to \ntalk for a little bit today about what is happening out there.\n  Here is the broader number. On average, every day 46 people are shot \nor killed by accident with a gun. In 2015 there were at least 278 \nunintentional shootings at the hands of young children and teenagers. \nSo these are young kids and teenagers unintentionally firing a weapon. \nWe know there are at least 278. The New York Times found that \nunintentional shootings occurred roughly twice as often as the records \nindicate because of idiosyncrasies in terms of how such deaths from \naccidental shootings are classified.\n  We know there are about 1.7 million children and youth under the age \nof 18 who are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. Some \n1.7 million kids are in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms. A \nHarvard survey showed that children who live in gun-owing households, \nby a rate of 70 percent--these are kids under the age of 10--70 percent \nof kids under the age of 10 who live in households that have a gun knew \nwhere their parents stored the guns, even when they were hidden, and 36 \npercent of those kids under 10 years old reported that they themselves \nhad handled the weapons. One\n\n[[Page S2661]]\n\nout of three kids under 10 had found the weapon and had handled the \ngun. One analysis found that 70 percent of unintentional child deaths \nfrom firearms could have been prevented if that firearm had simply been \nstored, locked, or unloaded.\n  So this is a part of the story of gun violence in this country that \ndoes not often get talked about, but given this one horrific week we \nhad in April, maybe we can have a conversation about what we can do to \ntry to reduce the number of accidental shootings that happen at the \nhands of little kids. My goal in these speeches is to tell you who \nthese victims are, so, as hard as it is, let me tell you a little bit \nabout some of the children who passed away in this week during April.\n  Holston Cole was a 3-year-old from Dallas, GA, who shot himself with \nhis father's loaded gun on April 26. The gun, according to his father, \nwas located in a backpack. Holston removed it from the backpack and \nthen accidentally fired the weapon. Autopsy results confirmed that the \nshot was both accidental and self-inflicted. After the gun fired, \nHolston's father called 911. I wouldn't recommend that you listen to \nthe recording. You will hear the father wailing: ``No, no! Stay with \nme, Holston. Can you hear me? Daddy loves you. Holston. Holston, \nplease. Please.''\n  This was a kid who was full of energy from morning until night, as \nhis relatives described. His pastor, who officiated Holston's funeral, \nremembered Holston as a boy who loved superheroes and sometimes \nwrestled cardboard boxes. He loved to play in small, inflatable bouncy \ncastles whenever he could.\n  Sha'Quille Kornegay was 2 years old when, on April 21, in Kansas \nCity, MO, she died after accidentally shooting herself in the head with \nher father's gun. She had been taking a nap with her father when she \nfound the gun under a pillow on the bed, where her father generally \nkept it. Her father woke up from the nap to Sha'Quille by his bed \nbleeding and crying, the gun at her feet. Sha'Quille's mother was \ndevastated by her daughter's loss and noted that the daughter's first \nword was ``daddy.'' She was buried in a pink coffin, her favorite doll \nby her side and a tiara strategically placed to hide the self-inflicted \ngunshot wound to her forehead.\n  Finally, and I promise I will stop, Kiyan Shelton, 2 years old, same \nweek, Indianapolis, IN, shot and killed himself with a handgun that he \nfound in his mother's purse. She had briefly stepped away when the \ntoddler climbed on to the kitchen counter and reached for his mother's \npurse, where her cell phone was ringing, and he found the weapon. He \nfired the weapon, and he was wounded in his shoulder. In critical \ncondition, he was quickly taken to a nearby hospital, but he died \nshortly thereafter.\n  A neighbor who lived across the street remembered that Kiyan had just \nlearned how to ride a bicycle. He was out on his little bike with \ntraining wheels. Everybody knew his mother used to keep watch of the \nstray dogs in the neighborhood, trying to keep her son safe. He was 2 \nyears old. He died because he was reaching for a ringing cell phone in \nhis mom's bag and shot himself.\n\n  There is a way to solve this. I know we are not supposed to have \nprops on the floor, but this is a cell phone. It opens and closes based \non my fingerprint. There is technology ready and available to make sure \nthat a weapon can only be fired by the owner of that weapon. Yet there \nis a pretty open conspiracy in the gun industry today to prevent that \ntechnology from becoming available to consumers. Smith & Wesson tried. \nThey tried to develop a smart weapon, but they were boycotted. They \nwere boycotted by the rest of the gun industry. When retailers have \ntried to sell smart guns in their stores, they have faced boycotts \nregularly and in some cases even threats of physical violence.\n  It doesn't make sense to most people. Why on Earth would the gun \nindustry not want--or the gun lobby not want safe guns to be an option, \nto be available? From what I understand, it is rooted in a law that was \npassed a decade ago by New Jersey that says if smart-gun technology is \ndeveloped, it will be mandatory. First, that is one State's law, so \nthere is no national conspiracy to mandate that every single gun be a \nsmart gun. But let's play this out. Let's say that technology was \ndeveloped so that you could ensure that no gun could be fired if it \nwasn't fired by you or another authorized user of the gun. I think it \nwould be logical for us to have a conversation as to whether that \nshould be mandatory. Maybe we won't develop technology that is fail-\nsafe enough. Maybe it will always make sense to have that as an option. \nBut when we figured out how to make cars safer, we required that \ntechnology to be built in as a part of the car.\n  I don't think we are to the point where we could discuss making that \ntechnology mandatory on guns, but I wouldn't suggest that it should be \nsomething we should rule out. To the extent that a retailer or a \ngunmaker wants to invest in understanding how to make a gun more fail-\nsafe, how to build in this kind of technology--whether it be your \nfingerprint or other biometrics, other guns connected to a wristband \nthat you may wear--they should be able to sell those. They should be \nable to make them without facing reprisals from the rest of the gun \nlobby and the gun industry.\n  Shouldn't we try to do something to prevent these deaths, one every \nweek last year? That is just people who were shot by toddlers, in \naddition to the dozens more children who accidentally injured or killed \nthemselves with a weapon.\n  I struggle to try to figure out the ways in which we can come \ntogether on this issue. I certainly understand there are difficult \ncompromises on issues like the prohibition of certain weapons. But \nsmart-gun technology is something on which we should be able to come \ntogether.\n  The President has taken steps on his own. He has started a process by \nwhich Federal agencies would help to stimulate research in smart-gun \ntechnology, maybe with the goal of a pilot program being developed at a \nlaw enforcement agency to try to buy some of these weapons. The \nPresident has taken steps on his own, but we could do something \ntogether, and we should because it is only a problem here. It is not a \nproblem anywhere else. To me, that has to tell us that we are doing it \nwrong and that there is something more we can do so that this reality--\nthat U.S. children and teens are 17 times more likely to die from a gun \nthan children in the 25 other high-income countries combined--isn't a \nreality for much longer. If there is anything we could do to stop there \nfrom being another Kiyan, another Sha'Quille, and another Holston, we \nshould do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today I rise for the 136th time in my \nseries of speeches on the continuing threat of global climate change. \nReal science--the peer-reviewed kind--continues to prove the \nestablished connection between carbon pollution and the startling \nchanges we see in our climate and oceans, changes that are so profound \nthat we will leave to our children and grandchildren a world very \ndifferent from the one we knew growing up. Nonetheless, powerful fossil \nfuel interests still willfully spread disinformation about climate \nscience. There are obvious similarities between the fossil fuel \nindustry's denial of its products' climate effects and the tobacco \nindustry's denial of its products' health effects. These similarities \nare sufficient that a proper inquiry should be made about pursuing a \ncivil lawsuit like the one the Justice Department brought and won \nagainst Big Tobacco.\n\n  I have made that suggestion and, wow, did that set off an outburst. \nThe rightwing climate denial outfits and the fossil fuel industry \nmouthpieces went into high gear. I think there were about 100 \nspontaneous reactions to my\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\nWashington Post op-ed and to a related question that I asked Attorney \nGeneral Lynch. This outburst was interesting. There was usually only a \ndegree or two of separation between the outlets and mouthpieces engaged \nin this outburst and the fossil fuel industry. Most of the arguments \nwere the same, with the same telling falsehoods, omissions, and \noversights. Among these misstatements, various outlets said that the \naim of any such investigation would be to ``silence climate \ndissidents'' and squelch ``independent thought''; indeed, that such an \ninquiry would be ``an affront to the scientific method.'' Any \ninvestigation of fraud would be an attack on science.\n  Well, maybe if most of your science is fraud, you see things that \nway, but the charge is just not true in any ordinary sense of the words \ninvolved. And the language was nearly hysterical. I was the Grand \nInquisitor Torquemada and mighty ExxonMobil was lonely Galileo; the \nState attorneys general were involved in a ``Soviet-style \ninvestigation'' and ``gangster government.'' Oh, it was big talk \nindeed.\n  It does raise this question: If the Wall Street Journal editorial \npage and the other fossil fuel industry mouthpieces were such resolute \nguardians of the scientific method, where were they when actual peer-\nreviewed climate scientists were investigated and harassed and bullied \nfor doing their jobs? We took a look, and here is what you see from the \nmouthpieces: possible civil investigation of the fossil fuel industry, \nmassive indignation, actual investigations of legitimate climate \nscientists, silent equanimity.\n  Here is some of the history. This February, the chairman of the House \nScience Committee issued a government subpoena to NOAA Administrator \nKathy Sullivan, seeking to investigate NOAA scientists' deliberative \nmaterials. And this was not the first time. The chairman issued a \nprevious government subpoena against NOAA scientists after the journal \nScience published a NOAA report debunking the fossil-fuel-funded \nclimate deniers' contention that global warming had paused. So the \njunior Senator from Rhode Island mentions a possible inquiry into \nfossil fuel industry fraud, and industry mouthpieces go ape. The \ncommittee chairman actually issues subpoenas against scientists and not \na peep.\n  In 2005, the former chairman of the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee thought to investigate the personal emails of a climate \nscientist after he published a study showing the rapid increase in \nglobal temperatures. This investigative effort was so rank that even \nfellow Republicans objected. Sherwood Boehlert, then a Republican \nCongressman from New York, expressed his ``strenuous objections'' to \nthe chairman's ``misguided and illegitimate investigation.'' Even with \nthat public warning of a misguided and illegitimate investigation \nagainst scientists, there was not a peep from the mouthpieces.\n  In 2010, Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli of Virginia launched an \ninvestigation against a University of Virginia faculty member--a \nclimate scientist, of course. The Attorney General served the \nUniversity of Virginia with a series of civil investigative demands to \nproduce documents related to the work of the offending UVA faculty \nmember. Well, to its credit, UVA refused, and won a multiyear legal \nbattle with the Attorney General that went all the way to the Virginia \nSupreme Court.\n  Again, attorneys general consider investigating the fossil fuel \nindustry, and all the mouthpieces go ape. An actual attorney general \nharasses an actual climate scientist to the point where the university \nhas to send its lawyers to defend him, and from the mouthpieces, there \nwas not a peep through all those years of litigation.\n  In 2011, as the Cuccinelli investigation was underway, an oil \nindustry front group called the American Tradition Institute, which is \nnow known as the Energy & Environment Legal Institute, doubled down and \nsought identical materials from UVA through a Freedom of Information \nAct request. Again, UVA objected, and in 2014 the Supreme Court of \nVirginia unanimously threw that out, too, based on--and I quote the \nSupreme Court of Virginia--``the concept of academic freedom and the \ninterest in protecting research.''\n  So you suggest an investigation of the industry, and the denial \napparatus goes ape. But here an industry front group actually went out \nto investigate climate scientists in a way that caused the Supreme \nCourt of Virginia to call in the concept of academic freedom against \nthem. And they are still at it. Despite the UVA loss in court, the \nEnergy & Environment Legal Institute has since filed FOIA requests \nagainst scientists at NASA, Texas A, Texas Tech, the University of \nAlabama in Huntsville, the University of Delaware, and the University \nof Arizona. That is some double standard.\n  In 2009, a hacker stole more than 1,000 emails and 3,000 other \ndocuments from climate scientists at the University of East Anglia in \nBritain who were working on a United Nations report on climate change. \nNaturally, the climate denial apparatus went to work to select passages \nfrom the emails to assert that the climate scientists manipulated data. \nThis turned out after multiple--yes--investigations to be false. Six \nofficial investigations ensued, clearing everyone of any wrongdoing: a \nthree-part Penn State University investigation, two separate reviews \ncommissioned by the University of East Anglia, a United Kingdom \nParliamentary report, an investigation by the NOAA inspector general's \noffice, and an investigation by the National Science Foundation's \ninspector general's office.\n  Throughout all of these investigations of the climate scientists, was \nthere a peep of concern out of these mouthpieces about investigative \nintrusion on science? Nope.\n  Here in this Chamber, a Senator, then the ranking member on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, our senior Senator from \nOklahoma, publicly called for a criminal investigation into American \nand British scientists who had worked on the U.N. report or had \ncommunications with the University of East Anglia's Climate Research \nUnit. The Senator claimed that scientific data ``was contrived and \nfabricated'' and that ``in an attempt to conceal the manipulation of \nclimate data, information disclosure laws may have been violated.'' He \neven named 17 key players in the controversy, including--wouldn't you \nknow it--that UVA scientist who had been the subject of harassment by \nthe attorney general. His staff report suggested that the scientists \nviolated fundamental ethical principles and ``may have violated Federal \nlaw.'' He called scientists at the Climate Research Unit ``scientists \nwho commit crimes.''\n  Wow. There you go--a Senator calling for criminal investigation of \nactual climate scientists. That must have set these mouthpieces \nsquawking about the intrusion of investigation into science; right? \nWell, actually, no. Again, there was not a peep of concern.\n  Mr. President, climate science constantly finds itself in the \ncrosshairs of a climate denial apparatus that has an ugly side. \nInsideClimate News reports climate scientists often face death threats, \nvituperation, claims of fraud, and other forms of intimidation. And \nscience is starting to look at that denial apparatus. Sound, peer-\nreviewed academic work shows how a carefully built apparatus of \ndisinformation has been misleading the public and policymakers about \nthe risks of carbon. That is scientific work. Sound, peer-reviewed \nacademic scientific work shows how disinformation campaigns, funded by \nfossil fuel interests, have sowed doubt about climate science and have \nbeen effective in shaping American public opinion.\n  A recent study by 16 scientists, including John Cook of the \nUniversity of Queensland, Naomi Oreskes of Harvard University, and \nPeter Doran of Louisiana State University, examined the discrepancy \nbetween what the public thinks and what scientists know about climate \nchange, and they found ``the consensus that humans are causing recent \nglobal warming is shared by 90-100 percent of publishing climate \nscientists.'' Why the gap in public recognition from what the \nscientists know? Because of a persistent effort ``manufacturing doubt \nabout the scientific consensus on climate change.''\n  Part of the work of this denial apparatus has been to harass and \ninvestigate climate scientists over and over and over again. So when \nthese mouthpieces with one or two degrees of separation from the fossil \nfuel industry\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\nhave an outburst about the sanctity of science from any investigation, \nwell, that deserves an eyebrow. And when the only time their concern \nfor scientific integrity appears is when an investigation might look at \nthe fossil fuel industry, but they are quiet as mice whenever actual \nclimate scientists are being investigated, well, that merits further \nskepticism.\n  There are a lot of reasons why the scientific integrity argument \ndoesn't apply to a fraud investigation of the fossil fuel industry and \nits front groups. Actually, there are too many reasons for me to go \ninto here and now in the allotted time. But here is the bottom line. \nNo. 1, the argument is a phony, designed to protect from investigation \nan industry that may well have engaged in deliberate fraud on a massive \nscale. No. 2, the clamor is phony, whipped up a hundredfold but through \nindustry mouthpieces. And, No. 3, the sincerity is completely phony \nbecause the mouthpieces have had nothing to say for years, when real \nclimate scientists were actually investigated. They only swung into \naction when the possibility emerged that the fossil fuel industry may \nhave to face investigation for fraud.\n  There is a wooden cross in faraway Antarctica memorializing the Scott \nexpedition to the South Pole. It is carved with the closing line from \nAlfred Lord Tennyson's ``Ulysses'': ``To strive, to seek, to find, and \nnot to yield.''\n  To the real physicists, chemists, oceanographers, meteorologists, \ngeologists, and climatologists actually engaged in climate science, let \nme say, you embody this spirit of discovery and perseverance. The real \nscientists have not shrunk in the face of fossil fuel threats, \ninvestigations, and intimidation. The fossil fuel campaign of denial \nhas not stymied the flow of new climate research nor dimmed the fervor \nwith which the real climate scientists pursue and share their \nknowledge. These men and women--hardworking and often unsung--deserve \nour praise, and, after some of the nonsense they have been put through, \nthey probably also deserve an apology. But right now they must be \nlooking on in wonderment--and, I hope, with some wry humor--at the \nsudden outburst of newfound concern from fossil fuel mouthpieces for \nthe so-called sanctity of the scientific process. Of all the people to \nmake that claim, this crew has the least business making it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                  Tribute to Mary Lorraine Wood Borman\n\n  Mr. COTTON. Madam President, today I would like to honor Mary \nLorraine Wood Borman, of Fayetteville, AR, as this week's Arkansan of \nthe Week for her commitment to the National Down Syndrome Society as a \nself-advocate ambassador for the great State of Arkansas. Her advocacy \nto improve the quality of life for those living with Down syndrome is \nnoteworthy, and she is a joy and inspiration to many across the State.\n  Outside her work as an activist, Mary is an involved and \nmultitalented junior at Fayetteville High School in Fayetteville, AR. \nNot only does she excel academically--as indicated by her track record \nas an honor roll student--but she is also a gifted athlete and has won \nawards in swimming events at the Arkansas State Special Olympics for 3 \nyears. Mary is also a talented dancer and actress, specializing in hip-\nhop, jazz, and the waltz.\n  I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Mary when she visited my \nWashington, DC, office while in town for the Buddy Walk, hosted each \nyear by the National Down Syndrome Society. Because of Mary's advocacy \nand compelling reasoning, I cosponsored the ABLE to Work Act of 2016 \nshortly after our meeting. This bill will help persons with \ndisabilities save additional amounts in their ABLE accounts.\n  Mary has big dreams, and I am confident she will achieve them. I look \nforward to keeping track of her many accomplishments in the future. \nArkansas is lucky to have someone like Mary Borman fighting to make our \nState a better place, and I applaud her for her work. Her story is a \ntestimony of our spirit as Arkansans, and I am certain it will inspire \nothers to take action on causes they believe in.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Admiral William Gortney\n\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I rise to recognize and commend ADM \nBill Gortney, who will retire on June 1 of this year after 39 years of \nexceptional leadership and service to our country. Most recently, \nAdmiral Gortney served as commander of the North American Aerospace \nDefense Command and U.S. Northern Command headquartered at Peterson Air \nForce Base in Colorado Springs, CO.\n  In his current capacity, Admiral Gortney is responsible for homeland \ndefense, defense support for civil authorities, and theater security \ncooperation with Mexico and the Bahamas. Additionally, as head of the \nbinational NORAD command with Canada, he is responsible for aerospace \nwarning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in the defense of \nNorth America. For those of you who have children, I think you may know \nwhat NORAD also does, which is, of course, the very famous Santa \ntracker every year on Christmas Eve. It has been a tremendous pleasure \nto work closely with Admiral Gortney since joining the Senate. In \nparticular, as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \nEast Asia and the Pacific, I have often sought his advice and counsel \nto gauge the threat of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile \nprogram to our homeland.\n  Born to William and Gloria Gortney in La Jolla, CA, Admiral Gortney \nis no stranger to military service. He is a second-generation naval \naviator. His father retired as a captain in the Navy in 1970, after 28 \nyears of service that included time in World War II, the Korean war, \nand Vietnam.\n  Admiral Gortney received his Wings of Gold in 1978 at Naval Air \nStation in Beeville, TX, and began an illustrious career as a naval \naviator under the call sign ``shortney.''\n  Admiral Gortney has completed numerous successful fleet and staff \nassignments both in the United States and abroad. His first opportunity \nfor command was on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt from 1994 to 1995. \nFrom there he amassed an impressive resume of command experience, \nincluding three command tours in the U.S. Central Command area of \noperations, providing support to maritime security operations and \ncombat operations of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. \nThese assignments included commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central \nCommand/U.S. 5th Fleet/Combined Maritime Forces, Bahrain; commander of \nCarrier Strike Group 10 on board the USS Harry S. Truman; and commander \nof Carrier Air Wing 7 on board the USS John F. Kennedy.\n  His first flight tour was as the deputy chief of staff for Global \nForce Management and Joint Operations, U.S. Fleet Forces Command, \nNorfolk, VA. More recently, he served as director of the Joint Staff, \nthen commanded U.S. Fleet Forces Command prior to taking command at \nNORAD and USNORTHCOM.\n  Admiral Gortney has flown over 5,360 mishap-free flight hours on the \nCorsair II and F/A-18 Hornet and completed 1,265 carrier-arrested \nlandings. His military decorations include: the Defense Distinguished \nService Medal, two awards; Navy Distinguished Service Medal, two \nawards; Defense Superior Service Medal; Legion of Merit, four awards; \nand Bronze Star, among many others.\n  From other nations, his military decorations include: the French \nNational Order of the Legion of Honor Award; the Bahrain Medal, First \nClass; the Secretary of the National Defense for Mexico Military Merit \n1st Class Medal; and Secretary of the Mexican Navy Naval Distinction \n2nd Class Medal.\n  Admiral Gortney's unique combination of operational experience, \ncharismatic leadership, and unyielding patriotism has served him well \nin a lifetime of military service. Today we honor his admirable service \nto our Nation and all the airmen, sailors, soldiers, marines, and \ncivilians who have served alongside him.\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\n  We offer our heartfelt appreciation to Bill, his wife Sherry, their \nchildren Stephanie and Billy, daughter-in-law Jackie, and grandchildren \nGavin and Grayson for all of their sacrifice and support to our \ncountry.\n  On behalf of the Senate and a grateful nation, I congratulate him on \na job well done and wish him the best as he begins a hard-earned \nretirement. I just wish that his retirement would land him in Colorado \nSprings, but I think he has other ideas.\n  Admiral Gortney, we thank you for your service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                        Remembering Bob Bennett\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning I joined many of my \ncolleagues in bidding a formal farewell to our colleague, Senator Bob \nBennett, who died last week. It was great to see Senators from both \nsides of the aisle at Senator Bennett's viewing and funeral service. It \nwas fitting. Bob Bennett was a proud conservative, he was an old-\nfashioned conservative, but he understood that the Senate only really \nworks when we talk to each other and reason things out. He was old \nschool. He understood that principled compromise is not a moral or \npolitical sin. It is an ideal we should strive for. It is how we solve \nbig problems in America. It is the only way the Senate can work.\n  I served with Bob Bennett for years on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. He was an honorable man, a dyed-in-the-wool fiscal \nconservative. He had an 84-percent lifetime approval rating from the \nAmerican Conservative Union, but he was a real-world conservative, not \nan ideologue. No vote demonstrated that more clearly than the vote he \ncast in 2008 to create the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as \nTARP.\n  I am not going to forget the day when Hank Paulson, Treasury \nSecretary under President George W. Bush, came to talk to us about the \neconomy. Lehman Brothers had just declared bankruptcy. Secretary \nPaulson told us that the entire U.S. financial system could collapse \nwithin days, maybe hours. He warned that such a collapse of the U.S. \nfinancial system would trigger a global economic cataclysm.\n  Bob Bennett knew that he was taking a supreme political risk, but Bob \nBennett voted to create the TARP program anyway. He risked his \npolitical career rather than risk the life savings of untold millions \nin America and around the world. He paid a price for it. In 2010 Bob \nBennett became the first incumbent Senator in Utah in 70 years to lose \nreelection after he was toppled in his party caucus.\n  Senator Bennett challenged orthodoxy on a lot of other issues as \nwell. Bob Bennett, a devout Mormon, supported embryonic stem cell \nresearch, with very careful restrictions. In 1996 he was one of only \nthree Senators from his party to vote against amending the U.S. \nConstitution to criminalize flag-burning. He said that he thought flag-\nburning was reprehensible--as we all do--but that it occurred far too \ninfrequently to warrant changing the Constitution. That amendment \nfailed in the Senate by one vote.\n  When the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform in 2006, \nSenator Bob Bennett of Utah was one of the many Members of his party to \nstand up and support it. Four years later, when the Senate voted on the \nDREAM Act--a key part of that earlier bill and one that I introduced 15 \nyears ago--the political winds on the right had shifted dramatically. \nThere were only three of my colleagues from across the aisle on the \nRepublican side who supported passing the DREAM Act in 2010. Bob \nBennett was one of them. I will never forget it. I will always be \ngrateful to him for that courageous vote. He understood that we needed \na realistic, humane way to deal with immigration in this Nation of \nimmigrants.\n  Robert Bennett was a member of one of his State's leading families. \nHis grandfather, Heber J. Grant, was the president of the Church of \nJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. His father, Wallace Bennett, served \nfour terms in the Senate.\n  Bob came to Washington in 1962 to work as an aide in his father's \noffice, when such arrangements were still allowed. In 1969 he took a \njob as a top congressional liaison for the U.S. Transportation \nDepartment under President Nixon. His short tenure at Transportation \nearned him an unlikely footnote in history. For decades, some \nconspiracy theorists speculated that he was Deep Throat--the Nixon \nadministration insider who helped steer the Washington Post's Bob \nWoodward and Carl Bernstein in reporting the Watergate scandal. That \ntheory was finally disproved with the death of former FBI Deputy \nDirector Mark Felt, who was, in fact, the real Deep Throat.\n  Bob Bennett did not need public service. He had already built a \nsuccessful career in business before he decided to run in 1992 for the \nseat his father once held. He took a pay cut to serve his State and our \nNation in the Senate.\n  Bob Bennett and I disagreed on many issues. When we did, he was \nalways principled and polite. I suspect that was a reflection of his \nupbringing, watching his father serve in the Senate, where Members of \ndiffering political parties could disagree without questioning the \nother Senator's motives.\n  In his last political race in 2010, Senator Bennett was targeted by \nthe force we now refer to as the tea party. After his loss, he spoke to \na reporter for the Salt Lake Tribune. He said, ``The political \natmosphere obviously has been toxic, and it is very clear that some of \nthe votes I have cast have added to that toxic environment.''\n  Then Bob Bennett said something that any Senator would be fortunate \nto be able to say at the end of his tenure. ``Looking back on them--\nwith one or two very minor exceptions--I wouldn't have cast any of them \nany differently even if I'd known at the time it would cost me my \ncareer because I have always done the best I can to cast the vote that \nI think is best for the state and best for the country.''\n\n  I extend my condolences to Senator Bennett's family--a wonderful, \nlarge family--that includes his brother and sister, his widow Joyce, \ntheir six children--Julie, Robert, James, Wendy, Heather, and Heidi--\nand 20 grandchildren. There are so many of Bob Bennett's former \nstaffers and friends who join me in paying this great tribute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3878\n\n  Mr. President, Congress is supposed to be working on an \nappropriations bill, and we were moving in that direction until the \nSenator from Arkansas sought to add an amendment to the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. This amendment was designed to undermine the \nhistoric agreement that the Obama administration reached with Iran for \nthe sole purpose of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n  The Senator who offered this amendment had led an unprecedented \nletter to Iranian hardliners in the middle of President Obama's \nnegotiations. He said to the hardliners in Iran--with a letter signed, \nI believe, by 46 other Republican letters--that they were wasting their \ntime negotiating with this President, that whatever he agreed to would \nbe undermined by Congress and particularly by the next President.\n  In all of the time I have followed the history of the Senate, I \ncannot remember a letter of that nature being sent by Senators of \neither political party to undermine a delicate negotiation involving \npeace in an important part of the world.\n  Now we are stuck until we deal with his amendment. Regardless of \nwhether you agree with the Iran agreement, adding this amendment to the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill would destroy all of the hard work \nthat Senators Alexander and Feinstein have put into drafting this \nbipartisan bill.\n  I wish to tell you why this amendment from the Senator from Arkansas \nis a poison pill. This amendment would prevent the Department of Energy \nfrom spending any fiscal year 2017 funds to purchase heavy water \nproduced in Iran.\n  The JCPOA agreement closed four pathways through which Iran could get \nto breakout time for a nuclear weapon in less than a year. It bought \nvaluable\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\ntime for Israel, for other nations in the Middle East, and for the \nUnited States before Iran could violate the agreement and build a \nnuclear weapon.\n  As part of this agreement, Iran agreed to limit the amount of heavy \nwater it would accumulate. Any heavy water in excess of 130 metric tons \nhad to be disposed of, moved out of Iran.\n  The Department of Energy has announced that its Isotope Program will \npurchase 32 metric tons of heavy water from Iran to fulfill a \nsignificant amount of the domestic heavy water needed in America for \nresearch and industrial applications. There is no American domestic \nsource for this heavy water. This transaction provides U.S. industry \nwith a critical product, and it enables Iran to rid itself of excess \nheavy water, ensuring this product will never be used for developing a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Heavy water is used in the development, production, and sale of \ncompounds used in biomedical and diagnostic research such as MRIs and \npharmaceutical development, as well as chemistry, physics, and \nenvironmental analysis.\n  A portion of this heavy water will be used at the Spallation Neutron \nSource, or SNS, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The \nheavy water will increase the intensity of the beam, which will--\naccording to Laboratory Director Thom Mason--benefit hundreds of \nresearch teams.\n  While the administration does not anticipate undertaking another \npurchase of heavy water from Iran, we should not give up--with this \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas--the ability to ensure \nthat this material, which potentially could be used in Iran's nuclear \nindustry, is instead put to use in the United States by our industry \nfor peaceful research and product development.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas really focuses on \none thing--to undermine this agreement with Iran. After we have seen \ntons of fissile material removed from Iran, 16,000 centrifuges \ndestroyed, and a major potentially dangerous reactor decommissioned, \nthis Senator from Arkansas believes it was a bad agreement and we ought \nto let the Iranians go about their business.\n  I couldn't disagree more. Taking this heavy water out of Iran makes \nthat region of the world safer for Israel and for the other countries \nin the region. For Iran to keep this heavy water is a temptation that \nwe should eliminate by defeating this amendment by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  His amendment will jeopardize an historic agreement that limits \nIran's ability to produce nuclear arms. That is an important protection \nfor the entire world. It would deny researchers and industries in our \ncountry a resource they need to make new scientific discoveries, \nmedical diagnoses, and probably save lives. That is more than enough \nreason to reject the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so.\n\n\n                               Zika Virus\n\n  Mr. President, 3 months ago, the President asked Congress for funding \nto help prepare for and combat the Zika virus. That very week I sat in \nan Appropriations Committee hearing with the representatives for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes \nof Health, who talked about how time sensitive that request was.\n  In the 13 weeks since that hearing, Republicans have put up \nroadblocks, set preconditions, and really mocked the administration for \narguing that there was urgency to fight the Zika virus--a virus which \nis dangerous for pregnant women, children, and many others.\n  What has happened in the 13 weeks while the President's request for \n$1.9 billion has languished before the Republican-controlled Congress?\n  Over 1,100 Americans in 43 States, Washington, DC, and U.S. \nterritories--including over 100 pregnant women--have contracted the \nZika virus. Six more have contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, an \nautoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis and death.\n  Recently, the first Zika-caused death was reported in Puerto Rico. In \nIllinois, 13 people have tested positive for Zika, with at least 3 \npregnant women. Over the last 13 weeks, while the Republican leadership \nin Congress has ignored the President's request for emergency funding, \nwe have learned even more about Zika and its danger. We now know it is \nlinked to serious neurological damage and birth defects. We now know it \ncan be sexually transmitted. Warmer weather is coming, and we know the \nspread of Zika will grow even worse. It seems as if everyone across the \nworld recognizes the urgency of this public health threat to the United \nStates except for the Republicans in Congress.\n  Last week, Major League Baseball announced it was canceling two \nscheduled ball games to be played in Puerto Rico because the players \nwere concerned about contracting the Zika virus.\n  I spoke with CDC Director Tom Frieden 2 weeks ago. He told me this is \nno way to seriously fight a public health danger. We need a multiyear \ncommitment so CDC, NIH, and public health departments can begin studies \nto understand the risks to others, improve our surveillance system, \nstudy how long these mosquitoes actually carry the virus, and develop a \nvaccine as quickly as possible.\n  The CDC takes this seriously. The Centers for Disease Control is the \nfrontline of defense of the United States of America when it comes to \npublic health danger. How seriously do they take the Zika virus? They \nhave dedicated 1,000 staff members to fighting it. They understand this \nis a public health emergency, and we have a limited opportunity to \ncatch up and try to stop its spread.\n  Last week I held a roundtable event in Chicago with local health \ndepartment officials, medical professionals, and vector control \nexperts. They are doing everything they can to prepare for Zika in \nhigh-risk areas--laying traps to collect mosquitoes for testing and \nramping up health communications to providers and the public. We are \nlucky because in our part of the United States there is no evidence of \nthe mosquito that is the carrier. However, travelers who have \ncontracted the virus in other places can bring it back to our region, \nand they can be the carriers for it to be spread to other people.\n  As a major transportation hub in Chicago and Illinois, we must be \nprepared to deal with these travelers carrying the Zika virus. I have \nthe highest confidence in our State and in local health officials, but \nthey need a helping hand.\n  Because congressional Republicans have refused to pass the emergency \nsupplemental Zika funding, the administration has been forced to divert \nresources from Illinois to States such as Florida, Texas, Louisiana, \nand Mississippi to fight Zika. We are taking public health resources \nout of other States to send them to the frontline States on the Zika \nvirus. I understand it, but it is totally unnecessary. If the \nRepublican leadership in Congress accepted their responsibility, took \nthis seriously, and realized lives were at stake, we would have \napproved the President's emergency request long ago.\n  My State of Illinois and the city of Chicago just lost a total of $2 \nmillion in CDC public health emergency preparedness grants--money \ndiverted from our State to deal with local public health challenges \nwith the Zika virus in frontline States.\n  The Illinois Public Health Director told me: ``We don't get to be \neight percent less prepared, even with eight percent less money'' from \nthe CDC.\n  Health departments across Illinois use these grants to prepare and \nrespond to outbreaks of all kinds, such as Ebola, Zika, and a new \nbacterial outbreak--Elizabethkingia. Already that has taken six \npeople's lives in my State. So we are removing the money to protect the \npeople in Illinois to go to the frontline of the Zika virus attack \nbecause the Republican majority in Congress will not approve the \nPresident's emergency supplemental request.\n  Robbing Peter to pay Paul is shortsighted. We need to ensure we \naren't diverting necessary Ebola money to use for the Zika virus. I \ndon't understand it. In the last election, many Republicans were making \na big issue about Ebola and its threat to the United States, and now \nthey are so sanguine and so calm as to take the money away from \nprotecting us from the spread of Ebola and spend it on Zika on a \ntemporary basis because\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nthey won't address the serious threat of both problems. The CDC, \nincidentally, is reporting new flare-ups of Ebola in Guinea after \nlearning that the virus can stay in a man's system for over a year. \nJust because it may not be front-page news anymore, the Ebola crisis, \nincidentally, is not over. Funding is still needed.\n  We have seen Zika coming for many months. We were warned, and we have \nhad the administration's detailed comprehensive plan sitting on the \ndesk of the Republican leaders in the House and Senate.\n  Right before Congress adjourned 2 weeks ago, Senate Democrats sent a \nletter to Republican leader Senator Mitch McConnell urging immediate \naction on the Zika supplemental, and we introduced a bill to provide \nthe necessary funding. We tried to bring it up. We were blocked by the \nRepublican leadership.\n  So what do Republicans think we should do--send a memo to mosquitoes \ntelling them not to buzz and bite until they get around to funding the \nPresident's emergency request?\n  I have news for them. The summer mosquito season is about to hit and \nhit hard in some parts of our country. Where this mosquito that carries \nthe Zika can be found, people will be in danger.\n  Researchers at NASA have forecasted that by midsummer, cities \nnationwide, such as St. Louis, Kansas City, New York City--not just \nsouthern cities like Miami and Houston--could possibly be a venue for \nthese Zika-carrying mosquitoes. They found that not just geography but \nrainfall, transportation hubs, and challenging socioeconomic conditions \ntranslate to less air conditioning and worse housing infrastructure. \nThey can all contribute to the presence of these mosquitoes. We are \nlearning more and more about Zika and the cases are growing.\n  As we near the summer travel season and we start hearing more about \nthe Rio Olympic Games, inaction and further delay will put many women--\nparticularly childbearing women--and their kids in danger.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues in both chambers: Work with us to \napprove this money this week before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on one additional \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are publications given to us on the \nfloor of the Senate. One of them is the Executive Calendar.\n  This Executive Calendar and parts of it may be characterized as a \npolitical obituary column because, you see, these are the nominees of \nthe Obama administration for important posts across America--the names \non here--and many of them have been sitting for months and some for \nover a year, and they are waiting for Senate action.\n  So far this Congress we have approved 17 Federal judges--2 circuit \ncourt judges, and 15 district court judges. There are 20 judicial \nnominees still sitting on this calendar. You think to yourself: Well, \nthey must be pretty controversial if they are still sitting on the \ncalendar.\n  Every single one of them was reported unanimously from the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. There were no dissenting votes, no objections. \nStill they just sit and sit and sit on the calendar.\n  Why? Well, we know we have a serious problem with not just these 20, \nbut there is the fact that we have 87 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary, many of them in an emergency situation.\n  Why? Why in the world would some of these nominees, some of whom have \nbeen supported by Republican Senators--why aren't they being called for \na vote, a routine vote on the floor of the Senate? It is part of the \nobstruction that the Republican Party has decided to make part of their \nleadership in the Senate. And, of course, exhibit A in that obstruction \nis the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court, occasioned by the untimely \ndeath of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n  It has been nearly 2 months since President Obama nominated Chief \nJudge Merrick Garland to fill the Scalia vacancy on the Supreme Court. \nIt has been 3 months since Justice Scalia passed away--3 months--and \nstill the Republican-led Senate has refused to consider President \nObama's nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. We ought to be doing \nthat right now.\n  Today we received all of the investigative materials and binders and \nquestionnaire answers from Judge Garland--boxes and boxes, thousands of \npages--available to be reviewed by the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nevery Member of the Senate. It is the Senate's constitutional \nobligation under article II, section 2, to provide advice and consent \nwhen the President submits such a nomination.\n  Mr. President, it is rare for a political figure or a publicly \nelected official to stand up and use the word ``never,'' but I am about \nto use it. We have never--never in the history of the U.S. Senate--\ndenied a Supreme Court nominee from a President a hearing or a vote--\nnever. For 100 years, these nominees have been sent through the Senate \nJudiciary Committee with a public hearing. And every pending nominee \nfor an open Supreme Court vacancy has been voted upon at some point by \nSenators.\n  We had a press conference today, and we talked about the precedent. \nSenator Franken of Minnesota noted the time when John Adams had lost \nthe Presidential election but filled a vacancy on the Supreme Court by \nnominating John Marshall to be a member of that Court. So here was John \nAdams, a defeated President, making a nomination to fill a vacancy on \nthe Supreme Court.\n  In the Senate, in those days, there were still Founding Fathers, men \nwho had actually written the Constitution. Five of them were Members of \nthe Senate when John Marshall's nomination came before them. If there \nwas ever a lameduck, it was John Adams, who had been defeated for \nreelection and had a few months more to serve but who made a nomination \nfor the Supreme Court and, by voice vote, the U.S. Senate approved him, \nincluding the five Founding Fathers who joined in that effort.\n  The argument being made on the Republican side is: Well, we can't \nfill this vacancy until after the election. We have to wait to see if \nPresident Trump will be chosen by the American people, and then he will \nget to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court. Interesting. I missed \nit. I read the Constitution and thought for sure that President Obama \nwas elected for 4 years in 2012. By the Republicans' math, it was 3 \nyears and 2 months. He's a lameduck and has no power left. Well, they \nare wrong. By a margin of 5 million votes, Barack Obama was reelected \nPresident over Mitt Romney. Now this decision by the Republicans to \nstop this President from exercising his constitutional authority is \njust wrong.\n  What about Judge Garland? Judge Garland is one of the most \nextraordinary nominees ever presented to this Senate. He is now the \nchief judge of the DC Circuit Court. That is the second highest court \nin the land. He is well respected. He has received the endorsement of \nmany different groups, and people who are conservative and liberal \nalike respect his judgment, as they should. He has done his job and \ndone it well, but the Republicans in the Senate refuse to do their job. \nThey say it is because they want the next President to fill that seat. \nI cannot even imagine the nominee that a President Donald Trump would \nsend to the Senate.\n  Last week, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, a man \nnamed Reince Priebus, announced that Mr. Trump was the presumptive \nnominee of the Republican Party. It is astonishing to me that Senate \nRepublicans would seriously want to put Donald Trump in charge of \nfilling Supreme Court vacancies. How would they explain that to their \nconstituents? Most of them are saying they are not even going to attend \nthe Republican convention for fear of what it will do to their \npolitical reputations, and yet they are trusting the judgment of Donald \nTrump to shape the highest Court of the United States of America?\n  Make no mistake. By failing to move on Merrick Garland's nomination \nnow in a timely and fair way, Republicans have cast their lot with Mr. \nTrump. That is a risky bet for the American people. The American people \nalso understand Merrick Garland is well qualified and rock solid. Every \nweek we see more praise for him.\n  Last week, nine former Solicitors General, Republicans and Democrats\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nalike, sent a public letter praising Judge Garland. The list of people \nwho signed this letter includes prominent Republicans and Democrats: \nKen Starr, Drew Days, Walter Dellinger, Ted Olson, and Paul Clement. We \nknow the Solicitor General serves as the Federal Government's chief \nadvocate before the U.S. Supreme Court. They know the Supreme Court as \nwell as anyone, and they know a good judge when they see one. Here is \nwhat they said about Judge Garland:\n\n       As a group, we have argued hundreds of cases before the \n     United States Supreme Court and the Federal Courts of \n     Appeals. Each of us has served as the United States \n     Government's top representative before the Supreme Court. And \n     while we have served in different administrations, we are \n     unified in our belief that Judge Garland is superbly \n     qualified to serve on the Supreme Court if he were confirmed. \n     We are confident that Judge Garland would bring his \n     brilliance, work ethic, and broad experience to the cases \n     that come before him.\n\n  That is very high praise, isn't it? Clearly, President Obama selected \na nominee highly regarded by advocates who know the Supreme Court \nbetter than most. Yet my Republican colleagues will not even give this \nsuperbly qualified nominee the dignity of a public hearing. They would \nrather keep a Supreme Court seat vacant for more than a year and allow \nthe Court to deadlock for a year with 4-to-4 votes on key cases and \nwait in hopes they can roll the dice with President Donald Trump and \nhis Supreme Court nominee. It is hard to fathom how this strategy is \nrespectful of the constitution or in the best interest of our Nation.\n  Not only are Senate Republicans failing to do their job in \nconsidering Judge Garland's nomination, they are obstructing 20 other \nwell-qualified judicial nominees who are currently pending on the \nSenate floor.\n  The Senate Republicans, as I have said, have held votes on only 17 \njudicial nominees this Congress. That is the lowest total in decades, \nfar fewer than the 68 judges the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed \nin the last 2 years of George W. Bush's administration. Republicans are \napparently content to leave vacancies on courts across the United \nStates and even on the Supreme Court of the United States. Is that why \nthey were elected, to leave vacancies on these courts? They cannot hide \nfrom the fact that there is a need in this country for competent \njurists to guide us in these Federal courts.\n  I hope a few more of my Republican colleagues will come to their \nsenses. Rather than saving judicial seats for Donald Trump to fill, \nthey should do their job and give President Obama's well-qualified \nnominees a hearing and a vote, and they should start with Merrick \nGarland.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from these Solicitors General.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 5, 2016.\n     Hon.

Our service took \n     place under both Republican and Democratic Presidents. We \n     write collectively in support of Judge Merrick Garland's \n     qualifications to serve as an Associate Justice of the United \n     States Supreme Court. We believe that Judge Garland has \n     demonstrated the temperament, intellect, and experience to \n     serve in this capacity.\n       Merrick Garland has a history of excellence in the Law. He \n     served in high ranking Justice Department posts, as a partner \n     at a major law firm, an Assistant United States Attorney, a \n     law clerk on the United States Supreme Court, a law clerk on \n     the Second Circuit for the legendary Judge Henry Friendly, \n     and, of course, for nearly the last two decades, as a Judge \n     on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. \n     He presently serves as the Chief Judge of that Circuit, where \n     he is known for his collegiality and is widely respected by \n     his colleagues and litigants who have come before him.\n       As a group, we have argued hundreds of cases before the \n     United States Supreme Court and the federal Courts of \n     Appeals. Each of us has served as the United States \n     Government's top representative before the Supreme Court. And \n     while we have served in different Administrations, we are \n     unified in our belief that Judge Garland is superbly \n     qualified to serve on the Supreme Court if he were confirmed.\n       We are confident that Judge Garland would bring his \n     brilliance, work ethic, and broad experience to the cases \n     that come before him.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the University \nof Mount Union Concert Choir as it continues its spring tour, which \nbegan Sunday, May 8, at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC.\n  Mount Union's concert choir prides itself as one of the oldest \ncollegiate choirs in the United States and has been part of the \nschool's history since 1896. Arts at the collegiate level can enrich \nthe student experience, giving music students and nonmusic students the \nopportunity to practice their vocal or instrumental skills and share \ntheir talents with both the campus and the local community. The group, \ncomprised of individuals from almost every academic department, is a \ntestament to the school's strong liberal arts mission.\n  The group is led by Dr. Grant Cook III, the director of choral \nactivities and an associate professor of music at Mount Union, an \naccomplished musician and conductor. His commitment\n\n[[Page S2668]]\n\nto the arts gives these vocalist the opportunity to do what they love \nand be part of a strong team of singers.\n  I am thrilled these young musicians have the opportunity to travel \nfrom Ohio to our Nation's Capital to kick off a tour that will take \nthem from the National Cathedral to Virginia to Pennsylvania to New \nJersey. This is an opportunity to see new parts of the country and show \nothers what their university and our State have to offer.\n  I wish all the students the best for a safe tour, including Tim \nAnderson, Alexandria Augustine, Angelica Bartholomew, Erin Bell, \nAnthony Bucci, Ali Caldwell, George Carr, Ian Donaldson, Sarah Donkin, \nCollin Edwards, Nick Embrogno, Caelyn Eppler, Abbie Fox, Connor Funk, \nElizabeth Galloway-Purcell, Bradley Geist, Victoria Ginty, Matt Gorman, \nJennifer Gotschall, Ben Hayes, Zach Henkels, Kyle Herman, Sarah \nHohenadel, Kenan Irish, Rachel Irwin, Zak Jaeb, Jacqueline Jepsen, \nAbigail Lantz, David Lenahan, Jason Lopez, Patrick McKitrick, Paige \nMorris, Marcus Morrison, Hunter Munroe, Megan Ostrofsky, Rebecca \nPasser, Jesse Reed, Natalie Ricciutti, Abbigail Robertson, Jacob \nRogers, Emily Siedel, Clinton Simmons III, Mary Anne Snyder, Chris \nTucker, Abigail Van Auken, Alex Waitinas, Haley Walls, Tony Walsh, \nJenna Waterman, Tommy Wines, Sarah Yannie, Martin Zapata, and Megan \nZwart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/senate-section/article/S2668-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SINCLAIR OIL CORPORATION\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of Sinclair Oil Corporation.\n  Spanning a remarkable century of operation, Sinclair Oil has been \nresolute amid good and hard times in our Nation and helped shape our \ngrowing country. Built by the ingenuity and drive of Harry Ford \nSinclair, Sinclair Oil employs more than 1,200 people nationwide. Harry \nF. Sinclair, who founded the company in 1916; Earl Holding, who \npurchased Sinclair Oil in 1976 and led the company for more than three \ndecades; and Ross B. Mathews, who currently serves as chief executive \nofficer of Sinclair, must be recognized for their innovation and \ndetermination in building Sinclair into an American pioneer. Their \ncommitment and the support of their families and exceptional employees \nhave enabled Sinclair to stand and succeed through the test of 100 \nyears.\n  Sinclair Oil Corporation is immensely diversified. Twenty-four States \nare home to 1,300 Sinclair stations. The company is engaged in the \nexploration, refining, and distribution of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, \nasphalt, and petrochemical feedstock. It also owns and operates cattle \nranches and several renowned hotels and resorts, including Sun Valley \nResort, The Grand America Hotel, and the Little America hotels and \ntravel centers. The resourcefulness, skill, and initiative of the \ncompany's leadership and staff drive it forward into a new century of \nopportunity. I commend them all for the strong legacy they have built.\n  I have been blessed to have the Holdings as friends over the years. \nThe Holdings were always very kind and supportive to my wife, Susan, \nand me, and I have valued the involvement Sinclair has had in shaping \nour communities, State, and Nation. America's success is built on the \nhard work and know-how of the men and women who have overcome \nchallenges and turned their ideas into successful businesses that boost \nour economy and generate jobs. Countless individuals have benefited \nfrom Sinclair Oil Corporation and the goods and services it provides. I \ncongratulate all those involved with the company on a century of \nachievements and wish them all the best for continued \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/senate-section/article/S2668-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2668-S2669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS SCHOOL OF LAW PROFESSORS\n\n Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, education is a critical to ensuring \na bright future for both individuals and our society at large. There is \nno more important or more noble profession than teaching. Many of us \nhave had teachers who changed our lives--myself included--educators who \ntaught us not only the facts and figures but also instilled in us a \nlove for learning and an interest in the world beyond the city limits \nof our hometowns.\n  As a U.S. Senator representing the great State of Kansas and as an \nalumnus of the University of Kansas School of Law, it is my privilege \nto celebrate the careers of three outstanding legal academics: Mike \nDavis, Sandra Craig McKenzie, and Martin Dickinson.\n  Mike Davis began teaching at the University of Kansas School of Law \nin 1971, but his academic life in Kansas began years earlier. Davis \nearned his bachelor's degree with honors from Kansas State University \nin Manhattan, KS. After completing his undergraduate education, Davis \nattended the University of Michigan Law School, where he was an editor \non the Michigan Law Review.\n  After earning his juris doctor and practicing law in the private \nsector, Davis went on to work with the Office of Economic Opportunity, \nculminating in becoming the associate director of planning and research \nfor the legal services program. Davis then became a legislative \nassistant for Representative Louis Stokes before returning to Kansas to \nbegin his career in teaching future lawyers.\n  Professor Davis joined the KU Law faculty in 1971 and has had an \nimpactful and storied career. He earned the ``Immel Award for Teaching \nExcellence'' and the title of Centennial Teaching Professor of Law. In \naddition to earning teaching accolades, Davis served as dean of KU Law \nSchool for 9 years and served as the interim dean from 2005 to 2006. \nOutside his teaching duties, he served as the American Bar Association \nstandards and accreditation committees chair and was of counsel to the \nKansas City firm of Stinson Morrison Hecker for 20 years.\n  Colleagues at the law school praised Professor Davis's dedication to \npromoting the university's law school program. Students were also \ngrateful for his commitment to maintaining a challenging and rewarding \nlearning environment. The Kansas community thanks Mike Davis for his \nservice, dedication, and contributions to the university's law school \nand the State of Kansas.\n  Sandra Craig McKenzie arrived at KU Law in 1979 and has been a \npositive presence in Kansas ever since.\n  McKenzie's legal life did not begin in our State, but she arrived in \nLawrence with high accolades. McKenzie earned a bachelor's degree from \nthe University of New Mexico and then went on to the University of New \nMexico's School of Law, where she graduated magna cum laude and was a \nmember of the New Mexico Law Review.\n  After the receipt of her juris doctor, McKenzie went on to serve as a \nlaw clerk to the Honorable Oliver Seth of the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Tenth Circuit and later spent 4 years working in tax and estate \nplanning in Albuquerque before turning her talents to teaching.\n  Sandra Craig McKenzie joined the KU Law faculty in 1979 as one of the \ninstitution's first female law professors. Professor McKenzie was KU \nLaw's Elder Law LL.M. program director and an esteemed contributor to \nthe elder law community, as well as a sought-after voice in Kansas \nlocal government law. McKenzie served as the law school's ombudsman and \nwas a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and the Order of the \nCoif.\n  Friends and colleagues say her tenure was marked by accessibility as \na teacher, dedication to women in the law, and leadership in making \nKU's law community a safe and equitable space for all students. The \nUniversity of Kansas was without question enriched by Sandra McKenzie's \ncommitted 36-year career at the school of law, and her many \ncontributions are appreciated throughout the university community.\n  Martin B. Dickinson is the longest serving faculty member at the \nUniversity of Kansas School of Law, where his distinguished 48-year \ntenure has earned him the highest regard from the university community. \nDickinson received a bachelor of arts degree from KU in 1960 and then \nwent on to receive a master of arts degree from Stanford University in \n1961 and his juris doctor from the University of Michigan in 1964, \nwhere he was editor-in-chief of the Michigan Law Review. After \nfinishing at Michigan, Dickinson became an associate at Holme, Roberts \n& Owen in Denver, where he practiced until joining KU Law.\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\n  Dickinson joined the KU Law faculty in 1967 and quickly rose through \nthe ranks, moving from assistant professor to associate professor in \njust 2 years. In 1971, Dickinson was named dean and professor of law at \nKU, a title he held until 1980. While serving as dean, Dickinson made \ngreat strides in strengthening the school's profile both in Kansas and \nnationally, creating new admission criteria, successfully appealing to \nthe Kansas Legislature to fund a new building for KU Law and recruiting \noutstanding new faculty. These accomplishments put the KU Law community \non a path toward growth and sustainability, and the university thanks \nhim for these contributions.\n  As his impressive decade as dean drew to a close, Dean Dickinson \nreturned his focus to teaching alongside an of cousel position at \nBarber, Emerson, Springer, Zinn & Murray in Lawrence, KS.\n  He also served on numerous State-level advisory committees related to \nproperty taxes, income tax, estate tax, and trust administration--all \nof which have made recommendations leading to important revisions of \nKansas law. Additonally, Dean Dickinson gained nationally recognized \nauthority in estate planning and taxation and became a coauthor of \nstandard publications in those fields.\n  In 1986, Professor Dickinson was named the Robert A. Schroeder \nDistinguished Professor of Law, KU Law's top honor. As a highly \nrespected teacher and mentor in the KU Law community, Dickinson also \nreceived other top awards, including: the ``Chancellor's Award for \nExcellence'' in 1988; the ``Moreau Student Counseling Award'' in 1988, \n1995, 1997, and 2009; the ``Immel Award for Teaching Excellence'' in \n1997; and a Kemper Fellowship for Teaching Excellence in 2002.\n  The Kansas Bar Association conferred the ``President's Award for \nOutstanding Service'' on Dickinson, as well as the Phil Lewis Medal of \nDistinction. He also received the ``ALI-ABA Harrison Tweed Award'' for \nexcellence in continuing legal education and is a fellow at the \nAmerican College of Trust and Estate Counsel, the American College of \nTax Counsel, and the American Bar Foundation.\n  Professor Dickinson retired from the University of Kansas School of \nLaw in 2015, as professor emeritus, leaving behind a rich legacy that \nhas deeply impacted the entire KU community. The university will \nremember Dean Dickinson as a highly respected teacher, mentor, and \nfriend.\n  In the fall 2015 edition of the KU Law magazine, Dickinson was quoted \nas saying, ``Over the last five decades, KU Law has demonstrated an \nimpressive capacity to respond to changes in Kansas, the nation, the \nworld and the legal profession while continuing to honor its rich \ntradition.''\n  It is without question that KU Law has been able to navigate these \nchanges because of Martin Dickinson's leadership, and KU's continuing \ntradition is no doubt marked by his impressive tenure at KU Law.\n  Professors Dickinson, McKenzie, and Davis were intrumental in my own \neducation and those of countless others. The products of their work, \nwithin academia and beyond, are vast, and my words today seek to \nreflect those contributions to the University of Kansas, the State \nitself, and the many communities to where their lessons were extended \nby way of their former students. As Professors Davis, McKenzie, and \nDickinson near retirement, let us say thank you and celebrate their \naccomplished careers and the impact they had on the University of \nKansas, their communities, and the State of Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/senate-section/article/S2669-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. VITTER, from the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship:\n       Special Report entitled ``Summary of Legislative and \n     Oversight Activities During the 113th Congress'' (Rept.
