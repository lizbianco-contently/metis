Mr. President, on another important matter, the issue \nbefore us today, there are an array of threats facing our country. As \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Committee recently observed, \n``[I]nstead of one great power rival, the United States now faces a \nseries of trans-regional, cross-functional, multi-domain, and long-term \nstrategic competitions.''\n  There are the conventional military challenges, such as adversaries \nwho have been developing and modernizing their missiles, airframes, \nships, and ground forces; there are the asymmetric threats, such as \ncyber warfare, propaganda, and espionage; and there are nations, such \nas China, Iran, and Russia, which represent both conventional and \nasymmetric threats at the very same time.\n  If we are going to keep Americans safe, we have to prepare for all of \nthese challenges. We have to modernize our defenses, keep up with \ntechnological advances, and recognize threats. Passing the National \nDefense Authorization Act before us would put our country on the path \nto doing these things. It is a reform bill that will encourage defense \ninnovation. It is a forward-looking bill that will upgrade our missile \ndefenses and modernize our military equipment. It is a responsible bill \nthat will ensure that America's men and women in uniform receive more \nof the resources they need to confront the challenges of today and the \nthreats of tomorrow.\n  As I have said before, we should use the remaining months of the \nObama administration to prepare the next administration, whether \nRepublican or Democratic, for the variety of challenges it will \ninherit. These are complex challenges without simple answers. Passing a \npro-reform, pro-innovation, pro-modernization defense bill such as this \none will leave us better equipped to solve them. It will leave us \nbetter equipped to keep Americans and our allies safe in the face of \never-evolving security challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3599-7"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3599-S3600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WELCOMING THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

It also marks \nthe fifth time an Indian Prime Minister has done so\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nsince the 1980s. It shows how far our relationship has come in recent \ndecades. Mutual misgivings have given way to mutual benefits in both \nthe economic and security spheres. We are now key trading partners. We \nare the two largest democracies in the world. Our relationship is an \nimportant one, and there are more benefits that can be shared from \nfuture cooperation.\n  Today's address by Prime Minister Modi provides an important \nopportunity for all involved--an opportunity to hear his perspective on \nIndia's economic growth and how he feels we can strengthen the \nstrategic partnership between our countries, an opportunity to learn \nmore about his ideas for pursuing areas of common ground and advancing \nshared interests, and an opportunity to better understand his view of \nthe challenges currently facing India and his outlook for overcoming \nthem.\n  We welcome Prime Minister Modi.

Mr. President, I join the Republican leader in welcoming \nthe Prime Minister from India to America.\n  Mr. President, in my office I have a wonderful memento of my first \nmeetings with Indians. I went to school at Utah State University in \nLogan, UT. It was so cold. My wife and I lived off campus, and we would \ndrive a couple miles up a hill to the Utah State campus. Along the way, \nI would see Indian students walking to school. They were engineering \nstudents and agricultural students at the college. I would give them \nrides. I did that for a couple of years.\n  When it came time for me to graduate, one of the Indians I had gotten \nto know asked if Landra and I would be willing to stay over an extra \nday and they would make us a traditional Indian feast. We did that. It \nwas a feast. They were dressed in their Indian garb. They had worked a \nlot on that food. It was the first Indian food we had eaten. We have \neaten a lot of it since. It was a wonderful, warm occasion that we will \nalways remember.\n  They gave us some presents, and with five children and moving quite a \nbit, most of those presents are history. I don't know what they were. \nBut one that I have always protected is a little bone-carved statue of \nGandhi that they gave me. He is in his regular clothes that we see him \nin. He has a staff in his hand like he had most of the time. It is \nfinely carved. You can pull that staff out even today. It is a miracle \nthat it made it through my five children, but I have done everything I \ncould to protect it. Now I have it in my office in a little glass \nenclosure, and I show my Indian guests that meaningful memento of mine.\n  The other reason I am going to have the opportunity in an hour or so \nto meet with the Prime Minister with Senator McConnell, the Speaker, \nand Leader Pelosi--I hope I have the opportunity to tell him of my \nfondness for Indians but especially those named Modi because the \nspokesperson's name from the group of Indians that I met was Modi. I \nhave come to the realization in recent years that that was his last \nname. Everybody called him Modi. He was an engineer. He moved to New \nJersey, and we kept in touch.\n  I am happy that the Prime Minister is going to be able to address our \nNation in the House of Representatives, and I am sure his people look \nforward to that.\n  Again, I tell everyone here about my warmness for India, this great \ndemocracy. The second largest Muslim population in the world is in \nIndia. So it is a friend that we have, and we must maintain that \nfriendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3600-2"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just left a meeting, a stunningly \nimportant meeting where every one of the guests were prominent, but the \ntwo I want to refer to briefly are Dr. Frieden, head of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Fauci, head of one of the \nhealth institutes at the National Institutes of Health, Infectious \nDiseases, among other things. What they told us was very frightening. \nAs we speak, there are three confirmed cases of babies born in the \nUnited States with the Zika virus. Of course, they are all very sick. \nThe life expectancy is not very long.\n  They said in unison how vitally important it is and has been for \nmonths to get them some money so they can do the research needed to \nstop the spread of this virus. They have borrowed money from malaria \nresearch, TB research--all terribly difficult problems we are having in \nthe world and the United States--to take care of the immediate funding \nfor research on Zika. They have taken huge amounts of money--more than \nhalf a billion dollars--out of the Ebola fund, which is still a very \nserious problem. There are active cases as we speak.\n  This is not an effort we can just walk away from. This money has been \nneeded for a long time, and it is sad that the Presidential request of \n$1.9 billion has been opposed.\n  The senior Senator from Florida was at the meeting today talking \nabout how every day there are new cases in Florida. Yesterday there \nwere five new ones. We needed to do something on that yesterday, not \nwait until the fall, as has been suggested by my Republican colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3600-3"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DONALD TRUMP AND FILLING THE SUPREME COURT VACANCY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are waiting with gleeful \nanticipation for Donald Trump to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. \nDonald Trump, who last week attacked a Federal judge because of his \nMexican heritage--even though the judge was born in Indiana--said that \nDistrict Judge Curiel shouldn't be allowed to preside on his case \nbecause of his ethnicity. Donald Trump, moments later, said that he \nwould feel the same way if the judge were Muslim.\n  This is the man--Donald Trump--for whom Senate Republicans are \nblocking a supremely qualified nominee for the Supreme Court, a man by \nthe name of Merrick Garland. This is the man--Donald Trump--for whom \nRepublicans are abdicating their constitutional responsibility. This is \nthe man--Donald Trump--whom Senate Republicans want to determine the \nmakeup of the Supreme Court for at least the next generation.\n  The Senate Republicans are united in blocking Judge Merrick Garland's \nnomination to the Supreme Court. Republicans are united in refusing to \nprovide their advice and consent to President Obama's nominee to the \nSupreme Court. The Republicans are united in doing it for Donald Trump. \nThey say so. They should be ashamed.\n  It is hard to imagine anything more humiliating than holding a \nSupreme Court seat open so that Donald Trump can fill that seat. Is \nthis why my Republican colleagues entered public service--to march in \nlockstep behind a man who spews hate and attacks the basic rule of law \nin America?\n  The Republican leader says: ``We know that Donald Trump will make the \nright kind of Supreme Court appointments.''\n  This is sad for the Republican Party. If my Republican colleagues \naren't embarrassed, they aren't thinking very well.\n  President Obama has nominated a moderate, experienced, brilliant \njurist to the Supreme Court, but instead of giving Judge Garland the \nimpartial treatment he deserves, Republicans are refusing to do their \njobs. And for what? So Donald Trump, a man who routinely insults \nRepublican Senators to their faces, among others, denigrates Senator \nMcCain's heroism, says people's heritage makes them unable to perform \ntheir jobs, and all the terrible stuff about women, handicapped \npeople--we want this man to appoint someone to the Supreme Court? The \nRepublicans should come to their senses. It is time to drop the charade \nand give Garland a fair hearing and a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3600-4"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3600-S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4549\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on another subject, Americans share many \ncommon values, and one of the most fundamental is this: If you make a \ncommitment, you should keep it. If you reach\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\nan agreement, abide by it. Simply put, a promise is a promise. \nUnfortunately, the pending amendment from the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee would undermine this basic tenet.\n  Last year, Democrats and Republicans made an agreement. Democrats \nwere committed to helping the middle class. Republicans were focused \nonly on the Pentagon. Ultimately, we reached a compromise that was \nbased on the principle of parity. We want to help the military, and \nthey should be helped, but there should also be help for programs that \nare also important for our national security that are not the Pentagon. \nWe provided additional resources to the Pentagon, as I said, but we \nalso provided the same level of help for the middle class. That \nincluded improving our security through efforts of domestic agencies \nlike the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and others. That was our agreement, but now some Republicans \nwant to break their word. Senate Republicans are demanding billions \nmore from the Pentagon but refuse to provide an extra penny for the \nmiddle class, and that is wrong. It is completely inconsistent with \nlast year's agreement, and it is blind to the many serious needs here \nat home that Republicans continue to ignore, and Zika is one. That is \nwhy I support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island, Jack Reed, along with the leader we have on the \nAppropriations Committee, Barbara Mikulski.\n  The Reed-Mikulski amendment would provide the same extra support for \nour middle class that Senator McCain is demanding for the Pentagon, and \nit recognizes that our security depends on more than just the Defense \nDepartment. The Reed amendment includes more funding to address the \ndangerous Zika virus and fight the scourge of opioids. It also would \nhelp mitigate lead contamination, which is long overdue, in Flint, MI.\n  This amendment strengthens domestic security through support of the \nFBI and the Department of Homeland Security. It will improve airport \nsecurity and community policing, and it will address the threat of \ncyber crime and terrorism.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from \nMaryland will create jobs and address our Nation's crumbling \ninfrastructure. It will not only improve our transportation system but \nmedical facilities for our veterans and our National Park System.\n  The Reed amendment is also an investment in our future. The \nlegislation will promote science and innovation through support for the \nNational Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, among \nothers, and it will support education.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important proposal which will \nmake America a better and stronger country.\n  The bottom line is this: A promise is a promise. The middle class \nneeds help at least as much as the Pentagon. Republicans should keep \ntheir promise to hard-working American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3600-5"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2943, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2943) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2017 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain amendment No. 4229, to address unfunded priorities \n     of the Armed Forces.\n       Reed/Mikulski amendment No. 4549 (to amendment No. 4229), \n     to authorize parity for defense and nondefense spending \n     pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4549\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment, which will \nprovide partial relief from the caps imposed by the Bipartisan Budget \nAct of 2015 on both the defense and nondefense portions of the budget \nfor fiscal year 2017. The chairman has offered an amendment that will \nprovide relief for the Department of Defense activities. My amendment \nwill provide a comparable amount of relief for activities that are \nbeyond the Department of Defense but critical to our national security \nand critical to our national economy.\n  It is long past time to replace the senseless sequester with a \nbalanced approach that keeps America safe and strong at home and \nabroad. Senator McCain and I both believe that sequestration has to be \neliminated. What I would suggest is that it has to be done in a \nbalanced way. It has to keep the intent of the Bipartisan Budget Act \nand the Budget Control Act by treating defense and nondefense spending \nequally.\n  Let me also be clear. The bill before us provides the amount outlined \nunder current law as well as the budget request of the Secretary of \nDefense who, along with the Service Secretaries and Chiefs, has \ntestified in support of this amount. They certainly would like more, \nbut they have testified that for this year these resources are at least \nadequate. Now they have also made it very clear that if we do go into \nsequestration in the next year, it would be absolutely devastating to \nthe Department of Defense. As a result, we share--the chairman and I--\nthe same commitment to ensuring that sequestration is eliminated and we \nmove to a more rational budget process.\n  These military professionals would like to have the certainty of \nyear-long funding at the committee level reported at least. That \ncertainly is extremely important. I don't think they want to roll the \ndice. They recognize that this lengthy fight for parity could last all \nthe way through this year. I believe what they would like to see us do \nis what they said in their testimony. We can operate under the budget \nas proposed by the President, as recognized in the underlying budget \ncommittee mark, and that will give us the certainty we need.\n  The bill reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee includes \n$523.9 billion in discretionary spending for defense base budget \nrequirements and $58.9 billion for overseas contingency operations, or \nOCO account. It includes $19.3 billion for Department of Energy-related \nactivities resulting in a top-line funding level of approximately $602 \nbillion for discretionary national defense spending.\n  While these funding levels adhere to the spending limits mandated by \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act, or BBA, concerns have rightly been raised \nthat the Department may require additional resources to carry out the \nmissions it has been assigned and to adequately maintain the readiness \nof our military forces. As my colleagues are aware, when the Senate \nconsidered the BBA last fall, it established the discretionary funding \nlevel for defense spending for fiscal year 2017. That agreement passed \nthis Chamber with support from Senators from both political parties. \nFurthermore, the BBA split the increase in discretionary spending \nevenly between the defense and nondefense categories.\n  It is important to remember that we have repeatedly made incremental \nchanges to the discretionary budget caps for both defense and \nnondefense accounts. We have done so in order to provide some budgetary \ncertainty to the Department of Defense and our domestic agencies. These \nspending caps were first revised with the American Taxpayer Relief Act \nof 2012, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and most recently with the \nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015.\n  In each instance, bipartisan majorities in Congress voted to increase \nthe spending caps and provide additional resources, evenly split \nbetween defense and nondefense accounts. Unfortunately, providing \nrelief to the budget caps for defense spending, as the underlying \namendment by the chairman proposes, while taking no action on \nnondefense spending, would renege on those bipartisan agreements and \nthe sense of common purpose that motivated us in the last several \nadjustments to the Sequestration Act.\n  In contrast, my amendment, would keep the pressure on for a permanent\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\nsolution to the budget caps and sequestration by treating defense and \nnondefense discretionary funding equally. We can't afford to miss any \nopportunity to make progress on this issue of sequestration relief. It \nalso reinforces and underscores the sense of the Senate passed by the \ncommittee that states ``sequestration relief should include both \ndefense and nondefense relief.'' Again, that is a concept that has \nmotivated all of us or the vast majority for many years.\n  Specifically, my amendment would revise the budget caps to allow for \nan additional $18 billion in nondefense and defense-focused domestic \nspending to match the additional $18 billion in defense spending.\n  The additional nondefense funds are intended primarily to help \naddress security challenges facing our Nation that do not fall within \nthe purview of the Department of Defense, including funds to implement \nthe integrated campaign plan to counter ISIL, enhance Federal cyber \nsecurity, and provide additional resources for border security, first \nresponders, counternarcotics, refugee assistance, Zika prevention and \ntreatment, and infrastructure security and vulnerabilities.\n  True national security involves more than just the activities of DOD, \nand so non-DOD departments and agencies should also receive relief from \nthe budget caps. The Pentagon simply cannot meet the complex set of \nnational security challenges we face without the help of other \ngovernment departments and agencies, including State, Justice, and \nHomeland Security.\n  There is a symbiotic relationship between the DOD and other civilian \ndepartments and agencies that contributes to our national security. It \nhas to be recognized that providing security for the American people \nrequires a truly whole-of-government approach that goes beyond just a \nstrong DOD.\n  The budget caps are based on a misnomer, that discretionary spending \nis divided into security and nonsecurity spending. But Members need to \nbe clear, essential national security functions are performed by \ngovernment departments and agencies other than the Department of \nDefense.\n  As retired Marine Corps General Mattis said, ``If you don't fund the \nState Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition.'' General \nMattis's point is perhaps best illustrated in the administration's nine \nlines of effort to counter ISIL. Of these nine lines of effort, only \ntwo fall squarely within the responsibilities of the Department of \nDefense and intelligence communities; i.e., traditional security \nactivities. The remaining seven elements of our counter-ISIL strategy \nfall primarily on the State Department and other civilian departments \nand agencies.\n\n  My amendment includes $1.9 billion to support this counter-ISIL \nstrategy, including supporting effective governance in Iraq. No amount \nof military assistance to the Government of Iraq will be effective in \ncountering the ISIL threat in Iraq if the Abadi government doesn't \ngovern in a more transparent and inclusive manner that gives Sunnis \nhope that they will participate politically in Iraq's future. We need \nour diplomatic and political experts at the State Department to engage \nwith Sunni, Shia, Kurd, and minority communities in Iraq to promote \nreconciliation in Iraq and build the political unity among the Iraqi \npeople needed to defeat ISIL. Those resources will come through the \nState Department, primarily.\n  Building partner capacity. The coalition is building the capabilities \nand capacity of our foreign partners in the region to wage a long-term \ncampaign against ISIL. While the efforts to build the capacity of the \nIraqi security forces and some of our other foreign partners are funded \nby the Department of Defense, the State Department and USAID are also \nresponsible for billions of dollars in similar activities and across a \nbroader spectrum of activities. Under the underlying amendment, none of \nthe State and USAID programs will receive additional funding for these \npurposes.\n  We have to disrupt ISIL, particularly their finances. Countering \nISIL's financing requires the State Department and Treasury Department \nto work with their foreign partners and the banking sector to ensure \nour counter-ISIL sanctions regime is implemented and enforced. These \nState- and Treasury-led efforts are nonsecurity in the very simple \ndichotomy that has been drawn under the budget caps. It is also notable \nthat the Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC, and the Office of \nTerrorism and Financial Intelligence, TFI, Treasury Department, are \nalso categorized as nonsecurity activities under the budget caps. The \nRepublican funding strategy not only means that our counter-ISIL \nefforts will be hampered, so, too, will our efforts to effectively \nimpose sanctions against Iran, Sudan, and individuals who support their \nillicit activities.\n  We also have to continue to expose ISIL's true nature. Our strategic \ncommunications campaign against ISIL requires a truly whole-of-\ngovernment effort, including the State Department, Voice of America, \nand USAID. The Republican approach to funding our strategic \ncommunications strategy is a part-of-government plan, not a whole-of-\ngovernment plan, since the additional funds that could be used by \nState, USAID, Voice of America, and other agencies would not be there.\n  We have to stop the flow of foreign fighters. Foreign fighters are \nthe lifeblood of ISIL. Without the efforts of our diplomats around the \nworld prodding our foreign partners to pass laws and more effectively \nenforce the laws on their books, the efforts of the coalition to stem \nthe flow of foreign fighters will never be successful.\n  Of course, we have to protect the homeland. While a small portion of \nthe Department of Homeland Security is considered security-related \nactivities under the budget caps, the vast majority of the Department \nfalls into the nonsecurity portion of the budget. Providing no relief \nfrom the budget caps to the Department of Homeland Security \nshortchanges efforts to secure our communities and borders against ISIL \nthreats.\n  Again, we have to provide support because of the huge humanitarian \ncrisis that causes instability worldwide, particularly in areas of \nconcern. Virtually none of the activities that support our humanitarian \nefforts in the region--in the Middle East and many other parts of the \nworld--are considered security activities. Military commanders \nroutinely state that the efforts of the State Department, the USAID, \nand the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to provide for refugees \nand other vulnerable populations overseas are critical to our broader \nsecurity efforts, and that is particularly true on the counter-ISIL \ncampaign.\n  The administration's two remaining lines of effort against ISIL--\nnamely, denying ISIL safe havens and enhancing intelligence \ncollection--are under the so-called defense or security accounts. \nHowever, the continued presence and activities of our diplomats \noverseas significantly enable both of these lines of effort. Therefore, \nour amendment would also authorize additional funds to provide for \nimproved Embassy security to help keep these personnel safe.\n  The importance of adequately funding other security-focused civilian \ndepartments and agencies was also underscored by the former commander \nof U.S. Northern Command ADM William Gortney when he testified before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year. Admiral Gortney \nstated:\n\n       Our trusted partnerships are our center of gravity and are \n     critical to our success across the spectrum of our missions. \n     Homeland partnerships . . . underscore every one of our \n     mission areas, and are best represented by the integration in \n     our headquarters of nearly 60 DOD and non-DOD federal \n     agencies, department representatives, and liaison officers. I \n     view homeland defense as a team effort, and I rely on \n     partnerships with my fellow combatant commands, the Services, \n     and our interagency partners to accomplish this mission.\n\n  Recognizing this reality, my amendment also includes additional \nfunding for critical domestic security efforts, including $2 billion \nfor cyber security. Cyber attacks are a real threat to our national \nsecurity. Cyber threats are increasing as our country and government \nbecome more digitally connected. There is no question the Federal \nGovernment must do a better job of protecting its systems. This \namendment provides an additional $2 billion to address our cyber \nsecurity vulnerabilities in nondefense agencies.\n  I was particularly struck in hearings we had with the Department of \nTransportation IG and Department of Housing IG. When asked to give \ntheir major\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\nconcerns, both indicated the potential for cyber attacks and cyber \nsecurity within their Departments. So this issue of cyber security \ncertainly transcends the Department of Defense, and funding cyber \nsecurity is a critical primary objective included in the amendment that \nI propose.\n  We are also asking for $1.4 billion for law enforcement and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. This money will help State and local \nlaw enforcement and first responder efforts. It will also allow the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to hire 2,000 new Customs and Border \nProtection officers and reduce wait times and improve security.\n  It is a good sign for our economy that more and more people have been \nusing air travel since the economic recovery started in 2009. We have \nseen, particularly at many of our larger airports, passengers \nexperiencing significant delays trying to clear security. For instance, \nBWI Airport is advising passengers to show up 2 hours early for \ndomestic flights in order to clear security. The flight to Providence \nis 1 hour 15 minutes, and I take it often. So it is possible that \npeople flying to Rhode Island will spend more time in the security \nlines than on the plane. We all know how much that affects the people \nwe represent.\n  It is also important we have an adequate number of Customs officers \nnot only at the southern border but all ports of entry across the \ncountry. T.F. Green Airport in my home State has a growing \ninternational service, but it has become a challenge for the existing \nnumber of Customs agents and inspectors to meet new demands for \nservice.\n  One of the areas we talked about extensively on both sides of the \naisle over the last several months has been the opioid epidemic. The \namendment I propose would provide resources in the amount of $1.1 \nbillion to help with this epidemic. In the United States, drug \noverdoses have exceeded car crashes as the No. 1 cause of injury death. \nTwo Americans die of drug overdoses every hour. In my State of Rhode \nIsland, there were more than 230 opioid overdose deaths in 2014. We \nacted earlier this year on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act \nto help deal with this issue, but so far the funding efforts have been \nblocked. So we have a situation where there is authority but no funds. \nI think we need both, and I think we have to continually ensure we have \nboth authorities and funds. It is critical that we provide real \nresources to States and local entities to confront this epidemic and to \nensure that people have access to the treatments they need.\n  Another issue which threatens our national security that is not a \ntraditional Department of Defense issue by any means is the threat of \nthe Zika virus. It is on every front page and on every news show at \nalmost every moment. This legislation would authorize $1.9 billion for \nZika prevention and treatment.\n  The threat of the Zika virus is a serious public health issue. It has \nbeen over 2 months since the administration asked for funds to speed up \nthe development of vaccines and for a comprehensive response to the \nZika virus. This should not be a partisan issue, and continued inaction \nleaves us more susceptible to this serious public health emergency. \nAlready, there are over 1,700 cases of the Zika virus in the United \nStates and U.S. territories, including over 300 involving pregnant \nwomen. We have seen seven cases so far in my home State of Rhode \nIsland. The virus is spreading. It is not going away on its own, and we \nwill certainly see these numbers increase as we approach the summer \nmonths. Again, I think we have to see this as a threat to our national \nsecurity and deal with it as we are trying to deal with other threats \nto national security.\n\n  But our national security is not just about being strong abroad, it \nis also being strong at home. A growing, vital economy allows us to \nmeet the fiscal challenges we need to fully fund defense and to fully \nfund our nondefense security activities. So, as Secretary Carter has \nsaid, underfunding the nondefense portion of the budget, in his words, \n``disregards the enduring long-term connection between our Nation's \nsecurity and many other factors. Factors like scientific R to keep \nour technological edge, education of a future all-volunteer military \nforce, and the general economic strength of our country.''\n  The words of the Secretary of Defense, I think, are right on target. \nFurthermore, the men and women of our military volunteer to protect and \nare fighting overseas for American ideals, including a good education, \neconomic opportunity, safe communities, and functioning infrastructure. \nThere is a reason why our past budget agreements have provided budget \nparity between defense and nondefense spending. We have done so because \nwe all recognize that we must protect our Nation as well as keep our \nNation worth protecting.\n  Our servicemembers and their families also rely on many of the \nservices provided by non-DOD departments and agencies. Efforts to \nsupport all these goals will be hampered unless civilian departments \nand agencies also receive relief from the budget caps.\n  Therefore, my amendment also revises the budget caps to allow for \nadditional spending on important programs carried out by civilian \nagencies, including $5.1 billion for infrastructure improvement. \nPresident Eisenhower understood the importance of a strong highway \ninfrastructure to our national defense. In fact, I think, at least \ncolloquially, his legislation was referred to at times as the \n``national defense highway system.'' But it was the Federal-Aid Highway \nAct of 1956 which led to our interstate transportation system.\n  Today, many elements of that transportation system, both roads and \nbridges, have fallen below acceptable standards. We need to take action \nnow to prevent further decline in that vital system. The unrealistic \nand arbitrary budget caps will result in deep cuts to critical \ninfrastructure programs. We need more resources to invest in our \ntransportation and infrastructure systems--not less.\n  In response to these shortfalls, my amendment would provide $5.1 \nbillion to help meet critical infrastructure needs for roads, bridges, \nrail, affordable housing, VA construction projects, water \ninfrastructure, and funds to mitigate lead contamination.\n  Here are a few facts for the consideration of my colleagues. Barely \none-third of our roads are in good condition, and one-quarter of our \nbridges need significant repair. In my State, we have the highest \npercentage of structurally deficient bridges. Without increased \ninvestment, that number could double in the next decade.\n  The Department of Transportation has identified an $86 billion state-\nof-good-repair backlog for bus and rail transit. That backlog continues \nto increase at a rate of $2.5 billion per year due to inadequate \nFederal funding. Amtrak's busy Northeast corridor has a $28 billion \nstate-of-good-repair backlog and relies on bridges and tunnels that are \nover 100 years old.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration's maintenance backlog has grown \nto $5 billion, and the FAA has identified over $400 million in needs \nfor immediate facilities repairs that we are not able to meet under our \ncurrent allocation. If we do not invest in our transportation system, \nefficiency and safety will be compromised.\n  Meanwhile, we have also an affordable housing crisis. Nearly 8 \nmillion low-income Americans are paying more than 50 percent of their \nincome on rent, living in substandard housing, or both. In fact, for \nevery four families that are eligible to receive HUD assistance, only \none can be served within this fiscal environment. Families cannot pay \nfor higher education or get ahead if the majority of income goes to \nsimply keeping a roof over their heads.\n  It is also important to continue to adequately fund the Drinking \nWater State Revolving Fund and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and \nto work to mitigate lead contamination. State revolving fund resources \nare critical to modernize our water infrastructure, reducing pollution, \nand protecting public health.\n  As the tragic events in Flint, MI, illustrate, when water quality is \ncompromised, it becomes a public health crisis. Water quality oversight \nisn't just about pipes and infrastructure. It is also about preserving \nan ecosystem and keeping our sources of drinking water free from \nharmful contaminants. Inadequately funding these basic necessities \nmeans that we cannot meet the needs of our communities.\n  We also understand, particularly as we look across the globe at our \ncompetitors--our military competitors--\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nthat our technological edge is narrowing. One reason is that they are \ninvesting a great deal in their research infrastructure and we are not \ninvesting as we were in the past, again, partly as a result of these \nbudget caps.\n  So, my amendment would authorize an additional $3.5 billion for \nscience and technological investment. Federal research centers like \nNIH, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and ARPA-E, all provide \nhope for treatments and cures for life-threatening and debilitating \ndiseases, generate new technology, and make scientific breakthroughs. \nThey are also key in helping to strengthen our economy and maintain our \ncompetitive edge--the foundation of our national security.\n  Again, the technological edge that we enjoyed over our near-peer \ncompetitors in the past is narrowing. Every defense official will say \nthat. We are not simply going to fix it by putting some more money into \ndefense-directed DOD research. We have to put money throughout our \nentire research enterprise. One other area is increasing our basic \neducation. This funding would support full implementation of several \nbipartisan legislative efforts, including the Every Student Succeeds \nAct, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Workforce \nInnovation and Opportunity Act, and efforts to improve college \naffordability.\n  We can never be fully secure if we are not fully providing for the \ndevelopment of the children of this country, because they will \neventually rise to positions of leadership, not just in the military \nbut in other critical areas that will make this Nation strong and \ncontinue our ability to provide the finest military force in the world.\n  We have tried to articulate throughout that our national security is \nmuch more than simply the funding we give to the Department of Defense. \nA well-trained and educated workforce, a productive workforce \ncontributes to our economy, and that contributes to our defense. \nInnovation through scientific research is important to our national \nsecurity.\n  The agencies that I cited, particularly the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Department of State, and all of these agencies have a \ncritical role overseas. They will not be able to play that role if we \nsimply increase funding for the Department of Defense and not for these \nother agencies. For some time now, the President and Secretaries \nCarter, Hagel, Panetta, and Gates have implored Congress to end the \nharmful efforts of the arbitrary spending caps and sequestration.\n  During last year's debate, I repeatedly and forcefully argued that \nusing the OCO account as a way to skirt the budget caps set a dangerous \nprecedent. That was the reason why I reluctantly had to vote against \nlast year's bill. I was deeply concerned that if we used this OCO \napproach for 1 year, it would be easy to do it next year and every year \nafter that, ensuring an enduring imbalance between security and \ndomestic spending. Such an approach would be completely counter to the \noriginal rationale of the Budget Control Act, which imposed \nproportionally equal cuts to defense and nondefense discretionary \nspending to force a bipartisan compromise.\n  Ultimately, we must return to an era of budget deliberations in which \nall discretionary spending, both defense and nondefense, is judged by \nits merit and not by arbitrary limits. We need to begin working \ntogether now to remove the budget caps and the threat of sequestration, \nnot just for the Department of Defense but for all Federal agencies \nthat contribute to national and economic security. Providing relief \nfrom the caps to only the defense portion of the budget, while ignoring \nthe very real consequences of continuing to underfund the nondefense \nportion of the budget, moves us farther away from that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

The Senate is considering S. 2943.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Independence of Our Federal Judiciary\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wanted to speak based on my experience \nover the years as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee--as the \nranking member, as the chairman--on something very public that has \nhappened.\n  Many Senators in both parties have appropriately condemned the racist \ncomments recently made by the Republican Party's presumptive \nPresidential nominee about Judge Curiel. Sadly, these baseless \nallegations he has made against a distinguished Federal judge come as \nno surprise. We have seen for months that personal insults are the \ncalling card of the Republican standard bearer. But I would say, \nsimilar to what many in both parties have said, anyone seeking the \nhighest office of this great Nation has to understand the fundamental \nrole that judges play in our democracy. The rule of law protects all of \nus, but only when administered by an independent judiciary.\n  I am deeply troubled by this attack on a sitting Federal judge, but \nmake no mistake--it is not the first, nor will it be the last \nRepublican attack on the independence of our Federal judiciary. This \nmay be the most extreme example, but it is just the latest in a series \nof Republican actions that seek to undermine and compromise a coequal \nbranch of government.\n  For more than 7 years, Senate Republicans have tried to block \njudicial nominations through stalling and delaying. They have even \ndistorted the records of the men and women nominated to serve on the \nFederal bench. This systematic--and it has been systematic--obstruction \nhas hurt courts across the country. But it is not just the courts I am \nworried about; it is the American people who go to those courts seeking \njustice. Judicial vacancies have soared under Republican leadership, \neven though we have dozens of nominations that have bipartisan support, \nand they are languishing on the Senate floor.\n  Earlier this year, Senate Republicans took their obstruction one \ntotally unprecedented step further. Within hours of the news of Justice \nScalia's passing, the Republican leader declared his unilateral refusal \nto allow anyone to be confirmed to the Supreme Court until the \nfollowing year, even though he said this in February. It was an \nextraordinarily partisan decision, and there is no precedent for it in \nthe United States Senate under either Democratic or Republican \nleadership. Since confirmation hearings began a century ago, never, \nnever has the Senate denied a Supreme Court nominee a hearing.\n  Recently, two law professors extensively analyzed the history of the \nSupreme Court. They concluded that\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\nthere is no historical precedent for this refusal to consider Chief \nJudge Garland's nomination. In fact, according to their report, there \nhave been 103 prior times in history when an elected President has \nfilled a Supreme Court vacancy prior to the election of the next \nPresident and has done so with the advice and consent of the Senate--\n103 times. The Republicans' unprecedented obstruction--and I quote \nhere--``threatens to damage the appointments process in the future and \nrisks significant harm to the Court.''\n  The Senate Republican leadership has chosen to put the functioning of \nour highest Court in jeopardy for more than a year. That is the \npartisan attack on our independent judicial system that more Americans \nneed to understand. When the dust settles on this latest series of \naccusations by the Republican's standard bearer, I hope the American \npeople remember what this says about his disrespect for the rule of \nlaw, what it says about his disrespect for our justice system, what it \nsays about how he will treat those who may disagree with him, and what \nit says about those who fail to hold him accountable.\n  Our Founders understood that this great Nation needs an independent \njudiciary. They designed our courts to be insulated from the political \nwhims of the moment. They designed our judiciary to serve as a check on \nthe political branches, including on the power of the President. Can \nyou imagine a future President who does not respect the role judges \nplay? A President who thinks judges should be disqualified from doing \ntheir jobs simply based on their race or their gender?\n  For the good of the country, I call on my Republican friends to stop \ndiminishing our independent Federal judiciary. It is too important to \nbe treated like an election-year pawn. Our Federal courts, from the \nSupreme Court all the way down, deserve to be at full strength, and the \nSenate needs to treat fairly the dozens of nominees before us, all of \nwhom have earned bipartisan support.\n  It is not fair to attack sitting judges for political gain when they \ncannot even respond to the attack. It is also not fair to make \nallegations against judges who, as nominees, cannot respond because \nSenate Republicans refuse to have a public hearing.\n  If the Republican leaders of this body want to distinguish themselves \nfrom the rhetoric of the campaign trail, they should change course here \nin the Senate. Actions speak louder than words. They should allow Chief \nJudge Garland a public hearing and a confirmation vote this month. They \nshould allow an up-or-down vote on the 22 judicial nominees who have \nbeen reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee and who just \nsit here, waiting for a vote.\n  The American people deserve leaders who respect and support our \nFederal courts and have the courage to take action.\n  Let me say from a personal point that I remember the day I stood \nbefore the Vermont Supreme Court as though it was yesterday. I took my \noath as the newest lawyer in Vermont, and I was the youngest lawyer in \nthe State of Vermont. I was very conscious of that, being both the \nyoungest and the newest. But I remember the senior partner of our law \nfirm, who was a well-known conservative Republican throughout the \nState, and as a young lawyer he told me: Do the best job you can. \nAlways tell the truth. But you do not criticize the judges. You might \nnot like their decisions. You can always appeal them. Maybe you will \nwin; maybe you will lose. But protect the integrity of our courts. They \nare above politics. They should not be brought into it.\n  Frankly, the attacks against a judge born in Indiana, a man who has \ndefended our Constitution, the people of this country, even when his \nlife was threatened--to attack him, to make racist comments about him, \nto demean the courts, to demean our judiciary, our Federal system, the \nbest in the world--it made my skin crawl. It was puerile; it was wrong. \nI hope that all of us in both parties will stand above that and protect \nthe integrity of our Federal judiciary.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak about my \namendment No. 4299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, not a lot of Americans know this, but we \nare at war in the Middle East. We are part of the Saudi-led coalition \nthat is in the middle of a very dangerous and catastrophic war inside \nYemen. The Saudi-led campaign inside Yemen began on March 26, 2015. The \nHouthis, a group within Yemen, had captured the capital in September of \n2014. The Saudi-led campaign, of which the United States is a member, \nhad intended to push the Houthis out of the capital.\n  The war has been absolutely devastating from both a humanitarian \nperspective and a U.S. national security perspective. Senator Paul and \nI have submitted an amendment that I will not call up right now--but I \nmay do so later in the proceedings--which would place some very \nreasonable conditions on the U.S. participation in this coalition, and \nin particular on the U.S. transfer of munitions to Saudi Arabia in \norder to continue this campaign.\n  What is the status of this civil war inside Yemen today? Well, first \nof all, as I mentioned, it has been an absolute humanitarian disaster. \nThe war has left 3,000 civilians dead, and the total number of deaths \nis 6,200. At this time 80 percent of Yemen's population is wholly \ndependent on international humanitarian relief because they don't have \nadequate food, water, or medical care.\n  The capital, Sanaa, has been without electricity or running water for \nover a year. The capital of this country has had no electricity or \nrunning water for over a year. Nearly the entire population of an \nentire country, Yemen, is now dependent on international humanitarian \naid in order to subsist.\n  During this time, the U.N. has documented 101 attacks on Yemeni \nschools and hospitals, 48 of which were attributed to this coalition-\nled bombing campaign that the United States is a part of. Hundreds of \nhealth facilities have closed due to damage and lack of fuel for \ngenerators, supplies, and shortage of medical personnel.\n\n  There have been multiple reports of cluster bombs--U.S. made cluster \nbombs being used in or near civilian populations. The United States has \nenabled this campaign. It would not happen without U.S. participation. \nThere would not be a Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen without the \nUnited States. Why? Well, first of all, it is billions of dollars in \nU.S. weapons and U.S. munitions that are being dropped inside Yemen, \nincluding those cluster bombs. It is our intelligence that is providing \nthe basis, the foundation, for all the targeting that is being done. \nOne can argue that targeting has been dramatically insufficient given \nthe number of civilian casualties, but there would be little way for \nthe Saudis to do targeting at all without U.S. intelligence. It is Air \nForces Central Command that has flown 709 air-to-air refueling sorties, \noffloading 26 million pounds of fuel to coalition aircraft. It is \nAmerican refueling missions that allow for the coalition planes to fly. \nSo the United States is an indispensable part of this coalition; thus, \nthe United States is at war inside Yemen today, and very few people are \ntalking about it. But we should, because in addition to a U.S. and \nSaudi-led coalition resulting in the death of thousands of civilians \ninside Yemen, this war is in direct contravention with U.S. national \nsecurity interests.\n  First, the damage done to U.S. credibility in the region and amongst \nMuslim populations should be obvious to all of us when it is our bombs \nthat are killing civilians. If you talk to Yemeni Americans, they will \ntell you that in Yemen this is not a Saudi bombing campaign; this is a \nU.S.-Saudi bombing campaign, so every death inside Yemen is attributed \nto the United States. We need to accept that as a consequence of our \nparticipation in this campaign.\n  Secondly, this coalition has made a very purposeful decision to \ntarget the Houthis instead of targeting terrorist groups, such as AQAP, \nwhich have used this civil war to expand their base of\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\noperations. The coalition has made a very purposeful decision to target \nthe Houthis instead of targeting ISIS, which had virtually no footprint \nin Yemen before this bombing campaign and now is growing by the day.\n  Here is what the State Department's annual counterterrorism report \nstates about the civil war inside Yemen:\n\n       AQAP benefitted during 2015 from the conflict in Yemen by \n     significantly expanding its presence in the southern and \n     eastern governorates. . . . The group was able to increase \n     its recruiting and expand its safe haven in Yemen. It also \n     insinuated itself among multiple factions on the ground, \n     which has made it more difficult to counter.\n\n  I almost want to read that again because what our own \ncounterterrorism report has told us is that the U.S. intervention in \nYemen has resulted in the dramatic growth in the strength of AQAP, an \nelement of Al Qaeda, a named enemy of the United States.\n  We don't have a resolution that commits the United States to war \nagainst the Houthis. We have never given the administration the power \nto fight the Houthis. We have given the administration the power to \nfight Al Qaeda. There is still a pending effective authorization of war \nagainst Al Qaeda. Inside Yemen, there are the Houthis and there is Al \nQaeda. A Saudi-led campaign, with participation from the United States, \nis fighting the Houthis--not a named enemy of the United States--while \nlargely ignoring AQAP, which has grown in scale and scope.\n  The State Department further affirms that both AQAP and ISIL have \n``carried out hundreds of attacks'' in Yemen last year, including \nsuicide bombings, car bombings, assassinations, et cetera, et cetera.\n  So why are we doing this? Why is the United States relatively quietly \nfacilitating a Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen that is in \ncontravention to our national security interests? Well, there are a lot \nof guesses as to why.\n  One is that as a consequence of the Iran nuclear agreement, we have \nto make a renewed commitment to the Saudis to push back on Iranian \ninfluence in and around the region. There is no doubt that there is a \nvery direct connection between the Houthis and the Iranians. Houthis \nare not an Iranian proxy, but there is a link, and there are going to \nbe times where I would support U.S. efforts to push back on Iranian \ninfluence in the region. But in this instance, there is an indirect \nconnection between the Houthis and the Iranians and all sorts of damage \ndone to U.S. credibility and national security interests by \nparticipating in this coalition in the way that we are today.\n  The second argument is that if the United States weren't involved, \nthe targeting would be even worse. There wouldn't be 3,000 civilian \ndeaths; there would be 20,000 civilian deaths if the United States were \nnot helping. Well, that may be true, but that is not an invitation to \nbe involved in a civil war, because U.S. intelligence and targeting \ncould probably always mean that fewer civilians would be killed. The \nfact is that it is likely that Saudi Arabia wouldn't engage in this \nconflict or bombing campaign at all if it weren't for U.S. support.\n  I think it is time for this body to do some oversight on a conflict \nthat has been raging for over a year with billions of U.S. dollars at \nstake, the consequence being the dramatic increase of the power of \nterrorist organizations that have plots against the United States. \nRemember, AQAP is the most lethal and most dangerous element of Al \nQaeda when it comes to potential threats directly to the U.S. homeland. \nIt is AQAP that sits at the pinnacle of Al Qaeda's potential ability to \nstrike the United States. Yet this Congress has remained almost \ncompletely silent as a bombing campaign funded and orchestrated in part \nby the United States has allowed for AQAP to get stronger.\n  God forbid that AQAP is successful in attacking the United States and \nthat they do it from a base in Yemen that was made possible by U.S. \npaid for and directed bombs dropped on that country.\n\n  I think the White House has recently recognized the danger of \ncontinuing along this same pace. There are reports that the White House \nrecently placed a hold on a pending arms transfer of U.S.-origin \ncluster munitions to Saudi Arabia over concerns about their use in \nYemen in areas inhabited by civilians. But we have to do our due \ndiligence and our oversight as well. If we are really serious about \nupholding our article I responsibilities to oversee the foreign policy \nof this Nation, then we have to add some conditions as well.\n  The amendment that I have helped offer to the NDAA would place two \npretty simple conditions on our support for the Saudi-led coalition. \nImportantly, my amendment doesn't prohibit the United States from \ncontinuing to fund this effort. If I had my druthers, I certainly would \nargue that we at least take a pause, but I understand that the \nconsensus may not be here in this body to temporarily or permanently \nhalt our support for this campaign.\n  All I am suggesting is that we place effectively two conditions on \nour financial support and logistical support for this campaign inside \nYemen:\n  No. 1, that the Saudi-led coalition make a commitment that it is \ndoing everything necessary to reduce civilian casualties and that they \nare conducting this campaign in concert with international humanitarian \nlaw. I can't figure out why anybody would oppose that. Let's just say \nthat if we are going to fund this bombing campaign, those we are \nfunding should make a commitment to try to kill fewer civilians instead \nof more civilians.\n  Second, those in the coalition should make a commitment to use U.S. \nsupport to fight terrorist groups--Al Qaeda and ISIS--instead of just \nfighting the Houthis. The United States isn't at war with the Houthis. \nWe haven't declared war on that group. We have declared war on Al \nQaeda, and Al Qaeda is growing in its lethality, influence, and \nterritorial control inside Yemen.\n  Another condition, as contemplated by our amendment, is to simply \nhave the President certify as a condition of continued support for the \nbombing campaign that the coalition is fighting terrorist groups \nalongside the Houthis.\n  I think if I had 100 different conversations with Members of the \nSenate, I can't imagine there would be a lot of objection because of \ncourse we want to fight terrorism. Of course that is our priority, not \nthe Houthis. And of course we want to do everything possible to reduce \ncivilian casualties.\n  I am grateful to Senator McCain, Senator Reed, and also Senator \nCardin and Senator Corker, who have some jurisdiction here, too, that \nthey are willing to take a look at this amendment. I am not offering it \ntoday because we are contemplating ways to structure the language to \nmake it acceptable to the chair and to the ranking member.\n  I will end this with a plea for the Senate to get back in the game \nwhen it comes to the oversight of this administration's foreign policy, \nin particular in places like Yemen. We have been out to lunch when it \ncomes to authorizations of military force for a long time. There is no \nauthorization right now to fight ISIS, but we are doing it. There is a \ndecade-old authorization to fight Al Qaeda that we should renew. If we \nare going to be involved in spending all of this money and all of this \ntime putting our soldiers and airmen at risk in the Yemen campaign, \nthen we should authorize that, too, and if we don't authorize it, then \nthe administration shouldn't do it.\n  So this is not an authorization I am proposing; it is simply a couple \nof commonsense conditions. I hope we can find a pathway to get a vote \non this amendment, and I hope this body has the courage in the future \nto step up and call a spade a spade and do our constitutional duty, \nperform our constitutional responsibility to provide oversight of the \nforeign policy by this administration.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4549\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, it is no secret we are living in a \ndangerous time. We face a variety of threats to our security at home \nand abroad. We all agree we need to make investments\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nin a strong military to protect and defend our national security. We \nhave also come together in agreement on the need to take on our \nnational security challenges and our challenges here at home in a \nbalanced way.\n  The bipartisan budget agreement that we passed into law last year was \nfar from perfect, but it provided much needed certainty for our economy \nby preventing the ongoing threats of a government default or a \ngovernment shutdown. It restored investment in both our national and \nour economic security, ensuring that every dollar of investment in \ndefense was matched by a dollar of investment in a stronger economy and \na stronger middle class.\n  A balanced approach has served us well. It was a necessary compromise \ngrounded in fairness that should guide our bipartisan work going \nforward. I understand that the chairman would like to give the Defense \nDepartment $18 billion more than they currently have from the American \ntaxpayer, but I also know the American people need stronger investments \nin the challenges they face each and every day just trying to get \nahead.\n  If we are going to spend more on our military, then it is only fair \nthat we also invest more in education, in job training, and workforce \nreadiness to raise incomes and create a stronger economy for all. If we \nare going to spend more on the Pentagon, then it is only fair we also \ninvest more in putting people to work and rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure and transportation and water infrastructure.\n  I also know we have unfinished business in the Congress to bolster \nour vulnerable cyber security and to boost TSA security and to better \nsupport our law enforcement needs. We also have a responsibility to act \non the public health crisis posed by Zika. We simply must do more and \napprove the necessary funding to prevent, protect, and respond to this \nserious and dangerous threat.\n\n  We need to provide relief to the people in Flint, MI, who are still \nsuffering from the impacts of lead contamination.\n  I understand the military has asked for more helicopters and more \nfighter jets, but I also know that the American people need Washington \nto be stronger partners in the fights we are confronting in communities \nacross our country today. That is why I am pleased to support Senator \nReed's amendment to invest $18 billion to help our middle class, to \nkeep our country safe, and to respond to the Zika virus, lead \ncontamination, heroin, opioids, and the crisis that we are facing with \ndrug abuse throughout our Nation.\n  As I have traveled in Wisconsin, it is clear that we face a heroin \nand opioid epidemic. I know that many of my colleagues in the Senate \nface that same crisis in their home States.\n  In Wisconsin, it is a big problem, and it demands a bold response \nfrom Washington. We are in the midst of a crisis that is touching far \ntoo many across our State. I have heard stories from family members who \nhave tragically lost loved ones to addiction, and I have heard from \npeople who are on the path of recovery.\n  At one of my community meetings in Pewaukee, a father came up to me \nto courageously share a story of tragically losing his youngest son to \naddiction right after Christmas a couple of years ago.\n  Recently, I heard from Leonard, from Colfax, WI, whose grandson \nNathan was killed in a car accident when he was just 16 years old. The \ndriver of the other car was under the influence of heroin at the time.\n  I have also heard from a mother from South Milwaukee whose son \nsuffered from addiction for 20 years. While he is now in recovery, at \none point she found him on their bathroom floor, unconscious from a \nheroin overdose.\n  Another mother from Mukwonago wrote to tell me that her own son's \nlife was saved by paramedics who administered the drug naloxone during \nhis overdose, allowing him to survive.\n  The message is clear. Families simply cannot afford to wait any \nlonger for help from Washington. It should not be easier for \nWisconsinites to get their hands on opioids or heroin than it is for \nthem to get treatment for their addiction.\n  Today, as we consider increasing our spending for our military, let's \nnot forget American law enforcement, first responders, health care \nproviders, and citizens fighting on the frontlines to combat our opioid \nand heroin crisis. Let's not forget those struggling to get sober and \nto stay healthy.\n  As communities continue to confront this epidemic on a daily basis, \nWashington needs to step up and needs to be a strong partner with \nState, local, and nonprofit efforts.\n  The first place we can start is by making emergency investments for \nprevention, crisis intervention, treatment, and recovery efforts. I was \nproud to support bipartisan legislation that provides this funding \nbecause these resources are vital as we continue to respond to this \nnational emergency. Unfortunately, this funding was blocked by \ncongressional Republicans. This epidemic knows no political party, and \nit should be an issue that unites us all.\n  We must do more because fighting this nationwide epidemic is a shared \nresponsibility. Everyone has a role to play in addressing this crisis, \nand Congress should be no exception. The communities we represent need \nthe resources necessary to win this fight.\n  From talking to the people I work for in Wisconsin, I know that the \nopioid and heroin epidemic is a problem that neither law enforcement \nnor the health care system can tackle alone. The Federal Government \ncannot solve this problem by itself, just as we cannot expect State and \nlocal communities to address it by themselves.\n  Together we must continue our fight and rise to this challenge. Let's \nwork together to help our communities recover from this epidemic and \nstay healthy.\n  The Senate will soon vote on the Reed amendment. This amendment would \nprovide $1.1 billion to respond to the opioid and heroin crisis. The \namendment would invest a total of $18 billion, equal to the amount of \nfunding that my Republican colleague, Chairman McCain, is proposing to \nspend on the Department of Defense.\n  The vote is about fairness and priorities. I believe that, if we are \ngoing to provide more funding to the Pentagon, we should also invest in \nour middle class, ensure our security here at home, and step up to the \nplate and provide the resources Americans need to respond to the \nserious emergencies they face here at home.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4229\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on Monday I came to the floor to speak \nabout the important provisions of the NDAA, sweeping reforms to the \norganization of the Department of Defense, to the Defense Acquisition \nSystem, and to the Military Health System. But I noted there was one \nchallenge the Committee on Armed Services could not address in the \nNDAA: the dangerous mismatch between growing worldwide threats and \narbitrary limits on defense spending in current law. This mismatch has \nvery real consequences for the thousands of Americans who are serving \nin uniform and sacrificing on our behalf all around the Nation and the \nworld.\n  From Afghanistan to Iraq and Syria, from the heart of Europe to the \nseas of Asia, our troops are doing everything we ask of them, but for \ntoo long we in Congress have failed to do everything we can for them.\n  Shamefully, our military is being forced to confront growing threats \nwith shrinking resources. This year's defense budget is more than $150 \nbillion less than fiscal year 2011, before the Budget Control Act \nimposed arbitrary caps on defense spending. Over the last 5 years as \nour military has struggled under the threat of sequestration, the world \nhas only grown more complex and dangerous.\n  Since 2011, we have seen Russian forces invade Ukraine, the emergence \nof the so-called Islamic State and its global campaign of terrorism, \nincreased attempts by Iran to destabilize U.S. allies and partners in \nthe Middle East, growing assertive behavior by China and the \nmilitarization of the South China Sea, numerous cyber attacks on U.S. \nindustry and government\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\nagencies, and further testing by North Korea of nuclear technology and \nother advanced military capabilities. Indeed, the Director of National \nIntelligence, James Clapper, testified to the Armed Services Committee \nin February that over the course of his distinguished five-decade \ncareer, he could not recall ``a more diverse array of challenges and \ncrises'' than our Nation confronts today.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015--or BBA--provided our military \nservicemembers with much needed relief from the arbitrary caps on \ndefense spending in the Budget Control Act. The BBA was a credit to the \ncongressional leadership, and many of us supported it as a necessary \ncompromise that provided our military with vital resources for fiscal \nyear 2016 but was more constrained in the resources it could provide \nfor fiscal year 2017. The fact remains that despite periodic relief \nfrom the budget caps that have imposed those cuts, including the BBA, \neach of our military services remains underfunded, undersized, and \nunready to meet current and future threats.\n  By the end of this fiscal year, the Marine Corps will be reduced to \n182,000 marines, even though the Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nGeneral Neller, testified last year that the optimal size for the force \nis 186,800. Facing a shortage of eight amphibious ships, the Marine \nCorps has been forced to examine options for deploying forces aboard \nforeign vessels, and a recent news report revealed the crisis in Marine \nCorps aviation. Years of budget cuts have left us with a Marine Corps \nthat is too small and has too few aircraft. The aircraft it does have \nare too old and can barely fly--and only by cannibalizing parts from \nother aircraft. Pilots cannot train and receive fewer flight hours a \nmonth than their Chinese and Russian counterparts. Young marines are \nworking around the clock to keep planes in the air with shrinking \nresources, knowing that if they fail, their comrades flying and riding \nin those aircraft could pay a fatal price.\n  Another news report showed what it means to have the oldest, \nsmallest, and least ready Air Force in history, as our Nation now does. \nThe service is short 700 pilots and 4,000 maintainers for its fleet, \nwhich is smaller than its mission requirement and lacks the spare parts \nit needs to keep flying. It is so bad that airmen are stealing parts \nfrom retired aircraft in ``the boneyard'' in my home State of Arizona \nand even museum pieces just to get their planes back into combat. Our \naircraft are aging, but even worse, our airmen are left ``burnt out'' \nand exhausted. This is the predictable consequence of years of \nrelentless operational tempo combined with misguided reductions in \ndefense spending. Today, less than 50 percent of the Air Force's combat \nsquadrons are ready for full-spectrum operations. The Air Force does \nnot anticipate a return to full-spectrum readiness for another decade, \nand this will only grow worse as budget cuts force the Air Force to \nretire more aircraft than it procures.\n  The story is similar in the Army. The Army has been reduced by \n100,000 soldiers since 2012, bringing the Army to a size that Army \nChief of Staff Mark Milley testified has put the Army at ``high \nmilitary risk.'' As the size of the Army has shrunk, readiness has \nsuffered. Just one-third of Army brigade combat teams are ready to \ndeploy and operate decisively. Indeed, just two--just two--of the \nArmy's 60 brigade combat teams are at the highest level of combat \nreadiness. To buy readiness today, the Army is being forced to mortgage \nits future readiness and capability by reducing end strength and \ndelaying vital modernization programs, and the result of budget cuts, \nforce reductions, and declining readiness is clear. In an unforeseen \ncontingency, General Milley testified in March that the Army ``risks \nnot having ready forces available to provide flexible options to our \nnational leadership . . . and most importantly, [risks] incurring \nsignificantly increased U.S. casualties.'' I repeat, ``significantly \nincreased U.S. casualties.'' U.S. casualties are the men and women who \nare serving.\n  By any measure, the fleet of 272 ships in the Navy today is too small \nto address critical security challenges. Even with recent shipbuilding \nincreases, the Navy will not achieve its current requirement of 308 \nships until 2021, and there is no plan to meet the bipartisan National \nDefense Panel's unanimous recommendation for a fleet of between 323 and \n346 ships. A shrinking fleet operating at a higher tempo has forced \ndifficult tradeoffs. Extended deployments have taken a heavy toll on \nour sailors, ships, and aircraft, and the Navy is no longer able to \nprovide constant carrier presence in the Middle East or the Western \nPacific.\n  In short, as threats grow, and the operational demands on our \nmilitary increase, defense spending in constant dollars is decreasing. \nThe President's defense budget is $17 billion less than what the \nDepartment of Defense planned for last year. In order to make up for \nthat shortfall, the military was forced to cut things it needs right \nnow: Army fighting vehicles, Air Force fighters, Navy ships, Marine \nCorps helicopters, and critical training and maintenance across the \nservices. As a result, the military services' unfunded requirements \ntotal nearly $23 billion for the coming fiscal year alone.\n\n  Then there is a massive and growing defense bill that we keep \npretending does not exist. Over the next 5 years, the Department of \nDefense says it needs a minimum of $100 billion above the Budget \nControl Act caps on defense spending, add to that nearly $30 billion in \nbase budget requirements that are currently hiding in the emergency \naccount for contingency operations--or OCO. That is another $150 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  Put simply, according to our own Department of Defense and our own \nmilitary leaders, our Nation needs an additional quarter of a trillion \ndollars over the current Budget Control Act caps over the next 5 years \njust to execute the current defense strategy--a strategy that I think \nmany of us would agree is not doing enough to address the many global \nthreats we face. My colleagues, we are fooling ourselves and we are \nmisleading the American people about the true cost of defending our \nNation. This makes no sense, and it is time to put a stop to this \nmadness. That is what my amendment would begin to do.\n  This amendment would increase defense spending by $18 billion. These \nadditional resources would be used to restore military capabilities \nthat were cut from the President's defense budget request; address \nunfunded requirements identified by military commanders, especially \nthose aimed at restoring readiness in the military services; and \nsupport national security priorities consistently identified by \nmilitary leaders and defense experts in testimony and briefings before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  This amendment would increase the pay raise for our troops to 2.1 \npercent. The President's budget request sets pay raises at 1.6 percent, \nwhich would make this the fourth year in a row that pay raises for our \ntroops were below inflation. Our troops deserve better, and if this \namendment passes, a 2.1-percent pay raise would match the employment \ncost index and keep pace with private sector wage growth.\n  This amendment prioritizes restoring military readiness. Over the \npast 5 years, the combination of expanding threats, high operational \ntempo, budget cuts, shrinking forces, and aging equipment have created \na growing readiness crisis in our military. Indeed, of the $23 billion \nin unfunded requirements identified by the military services, almost $7 \nbillion were directly related to readiness. The NDAA took a first step \nin addressing these requirements by redirecting about $2 billion in \ntargeted savings toward improving readiness. My amendment would add an \nadditional $2.2 billion to help alleviate the readiness crisis and \nmitigate the growing risk posed to the lives of our servicemembers.\n  This amendment would stop misguided cuts to the size of our military \nthat are based on outdated assumptions about the world. For example, \ncuts to the size of the Army were set in motion before the Russian \ninvasion of Ukraine and the rise of ISIL. There is simply no strategic \nlogic for continuing these cuts now and placing a dangerous burden on \nthe backs of our soldiers. That is why my amendment cancels the planned \nreduction of 15,000 Active Army soldiers. It also restores end strength \nin the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force, as well as the National Guard \nand Reserve. The amendment also prevents cutting a 10th carrier air \nwing.\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\n  Our military confronts an ongoing strike fighter shortfall, which is \nespecially severe in the Navy, and a readiness crisis across aviation \nin the services. This amendment would begin reversing this dangerous \ntrend by increasing aircraft procurement, including 14 F/A-18 Super \nHornets and 11 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.\n  The amendment also accelerates Navy shipbuilding to mitigate a \nlooming funding crunch in the next decade. My amendment provides the \nbalance of funding necessary to fully fund an additional Arleigh Burke-\nclass destroyer. It also replaces funds for a third Littoral combat \nship in the next fiscal year.\n  This amendment supports the recommendations of the National \nCommission on the Future of the Army. In order to support combat \naviation across the total Army, including the Guard and Reserve, the \namendment includes funding for 36 additional UH-60 Black Hawks and 17 \nLUH-72 Lakotas, 5 CH-47 Chinooks, and 5 AH-64 Apache helicopters. The \namendment also includes advanced procurement funding for 10 more \nApaches.\n  Despite the fact that our troops are still in harm's way in \nAfghanistan, where the Taliban is making steady gains and ISIL is now \npresent on the battlefield, the President's budget request funds less \nthan two-thirds of the current level of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. \nBoth Republicans and Democrats on the Armed Services Committee have \nrecognized that U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan should be based on \nconditions on the ground. That is why this amendment provides full \nfunding for the current level of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan to help \nour Afghan partners preserve the gains of the last 15 years and take \nthe fight to terrorists who seek to destabilize the region and attack \nAmerican interests.\n  This amendment supports the European Reassurance Initiative by \nmodernizing 14 M1 Abrams tanks and 14 M2 Bradley fighting vehicles for \ndeployment to Eastern Europe to deter Russian aggression.\n  The amendment also provides vital support for our allies and \npartners. My amendment provides $150 million in security assistance for \nthe Ukrainian people to defend themselves against Vladimir Putin's \naggression. It also provides an additional $320 million for Israeli \nmissile defense programs, including cooperative programs with U.S. \nindustry in order to protect one of our closest allies from a growing \nmissile threat.\n  In short, my amendment gives our troops the resources, training, and \nequipment they need and deserve to rise to the challenge of a more \ndangerous world.\n  I would also add one important fact about this amendment. Whatever \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may say, this \namendment is completely compliant with last year's budget agreement, \nthe Bipartisan Budget Act. That legislation set binding spending caps \non defense and nondefense discretionary spending, but the BBA set what \nthe Congressional Research Service called nonbinding target levels of \nfunding for overseas contingency operations, or OCO. In other words, \nthe BBA gave Congress the flexibility to increase OCO spending to meet \ncurrent and future threats if it saw fit. There is no doubt that this \nadditional spending is needed, and this amendment provides it in full \ncompliance with last year's budget agreement.\n  That said, I understand that some of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle believe we also need increases in nondefense spending. \nThat is why the Senator from Rhode Island has offered a second-degree \namendment that would add $18 billion in nondefense spending. This \namendment has some laudable programs.\n  I have long said that national security is not just the Department of \nDefense. I agree that we should provide additional funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Coast Guard. I would \nhave added the CIA and some of our other intelligence agencies. But I \ndo not believe there is any national security justification for adding \nbillions in taxpayer dollars to a defense bill to pay for \ninfrastructure, national parks, affordable housing programs, or \nagricultural research.\n  While the Senate may not reach full agreement on the amendment by the \nSenator from Rhode Island, what I believe his amendment does show is \nthat we all agree our military needs the additional resources my \namendment provides.\n  I do not know whether the amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island \nwill succeed or fail, but if it does fail, my Democratic colleagues \nwill be left to answer a simple question: Will you vote to give our \nmilitary servicemembers the resources, training, and equipment they \nneed and deserve? This vote will be that simple.\n  Let's be clear what voting no would mean.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of another year where the pay for \nour troops does not keep pace with inflation or private sector \naverages.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of cutting more soldiers and \nmarines at a time when the operational requirements for our Nation's \nland forces--from the Middle East and Africa to Europe and Asia--are \ngrowing.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of continuing to shrink the number \nof aircraft that are available to the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps \nat a time when they are already too small to perform their current \nmissions and are being forced to cannibalize their own fleets to keep \nour Nation's pilots flying at far higher risk.\n  Voting no would be a vote in favor of letting arbitrary budget caps \nset the timelines for our mission in Afghanistan instead of giving our \ntroops and our Afghan partners a fighting chance at victory.\n  In short, voting no is a vote in favor of continuing to ask our men \nand women in uniform to perform more and more tasks with inadequate \nreadiness, inadequate equipment, an inadequate number of people, and \nunacceptable levels of risk to their missions and themselves. This is \nunfair, and it is wrong. It is wrong.\n  For the sake of the men and women in our military who, as we speak, \nare putting their lives on the line to defend this Nation, I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will make the right choice.\n  For 5 years we have let politics, not strategy, determine what \nresources we give our military servicemembers. If we keep doing this, \nour military commanders have warned us that we risk sending young \nAmericans into a conflict for which they are not prepared. I know the \nvast majority of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle recognize \nthat the mistakes of the past 5 years have created this danger. Yet \nthis is the reality our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are \nfacing. It is our urgent and solemn task to confront it.\n  I say to my colleagues, Republican and Democrat alike, it doesn't \nhave to be this way. We don't have to tolerate this anymore. Let's stop \nallowing politics to divide us when we should be united in support of \nour military servicemembers. Let's begin charting a better course \ntoday, one that is worthy of the service and sacrifice of those who \nvolunteer to put themselves in harm's way on our behalf. Let's adopt \nthis amendment to give our servicemembers the support they need and \ndeserve, and in so doing, let's do our duty.\n  Mr. President, I know there are speakers on this amendment. I hope \nthey will come to the floor to discuss these amendments so that we can \nset a time--hopefully this afternoon, if not tomorrow--on this \namendment and the second-degree amendment by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4549\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Reed-Mikulski \namendment to respond to threats to our Nation by raising the caps for \nboth defense and nondefense spending.\n  All agree that we must defend the security of the United States. So \nmany argue that we need more money for DOD, even though DOD already \nconsumes 50 percent of all discretionary spending.\n  Here is a quick tutorial on the Federal budget. Discretionary \nspending is $1 trillion. The other two big expenditures are interest on \nthe debt and trust funds, particularly for earned benefits like Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But on discretionary spending--what we can \ndecide to spend of that $1 trillion--about $500 billion goes to \ndefense.\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\n  We all know we are under some pretty big threats. We have fought a \n15-year war. Our men and women deserve the best training, the best \ntechnology, and support for themselves and their families. I don't \nargue that. But I want people who like to say I am a numbers guy--let \nthem know what the numbers are.\n  I take the position that we need to make sure our national security \nis what it should be, but I argue that not all of national security is \nin the Department of Defense. There are clear and present dangers to \nthe people of the United States that are met by other agencies.\n  When we passed the Bipartisan Budget Act last October, we agreed on \nparity. What we said was that there would be parity between defense and \nnondefense. What does that mean? That means defense gets about $500 \nbillion and nondefense, which is all of the other programs for the \nUnited States of America, gets the other roughly $500 billion. That \nmeans everything from Pell grants and the National Institutes of Health \nto Homeland Security, the FBI--I could go on and on.\n  I am willing to support the need to defend America by allowing more \nspending on defense, but I take the position that America faces other \nthreats as well, and we need to maintain the parity.\n  The amendment being offered by Senator Jack Reed and me, as an \noriginal cosponsor, says yes to the $18 billion for defense needs and \nyes to $18 billion for nondefense needs so we can make the Nation safe \nand more secure.\n  The Reed-Mikulski amendment does two things: It amends the 2015 \nBipartisan Budget Act to allow $18 billion of relief from sequestration \nfor defense spending--the same amount in exactly the same way as \ndescribed by my senior colleague from Arizona, the American war hero \nJohn McCain. But there is another $18 billion in the Reed-Mikulski \namendment for nondefense spending because there are threats to the \nUnited States of America in addition to the ones the DOD confronts.\n  So what does the Reed-Mikulski amendment fund? It funds those \nagencies that we think provide national security in addition to the \nDepartment of Defense. We are talking about more money for the State \nDepartment so they can do their diplomacy, so they can provide their \nEmbassy security, and so we can meet the humanitarian need, where we \nare winning the hearts and minds of people and also making sure we help \nother people around the world. It will also give more to Homeland \nSecurity so that they can defend our coast and defend our borders, and \nit gives more money to the Department of Justice so they can track \nterrorists or keep an eye on things to make sure we don't have \nterrorist attacks here.\n  There are also other threats to the United States of America, one of \nwhich is in the area of cyber security. That occurs in order to have \nthe protection of dot-military and dot-gov to maintain our continuity \nof government, and dot-com, which is essentially the functioning of our \nwhole country that is not government or military. My gosh, everybody \nhas been hacked. OPM was hacked. Look at all that we lost. There are \nover 1 million hacks a week going on against government agencies by \npeople who want to steal our trade secrets from the Patent Office and \nNASA and NIH and FDA. Why invent a cure for cancer when you can steal \nit?\n  Then, of course, there is this threat to Zika. Make no mistake--these \naren't cute little bugs coming from the Southern Hemisphere; these are \nbugs that when they infect people, particularly pregnant women, the \nresults are horrific birth defects. Zika is a threat to the public \nhealth of the United States of America.\n  There is the danger of heroin, and there is a danger in terms of \nother kinds of environmental dangers, such as what Flint, MI, is \nfacing.\n  We are also running significant deficits in research infrastructure \nand human infrastructure. I am going to elaborate on that in a minute.\n  Why do we need the Reed-Mikulski amendment? Current spending caps are \n$20 billion below the fiscal 2010 level. Let's make no mistake--we \nappropriators aren't exactly these wild big spenders. Neither is the \nBudget Act. The Budget Act we are working under is at the level of \n2010. This amendment authorizes funding to meet real problems.\n  Other Members will come to discuss that, but I want to make clear \nthat if you want to keep our troops safe, the best way is to give peace \na chance. It is not a song from another era. If we want to try to \nprevent war, to contain war, or to end war, we need diplomacy. That is \nwhat the State Department does around the world--quelling conflict, \nstopping proliferation, supporting treasured allies.\n  We need to protect our people who work abroad, both our military and \nthose who work at our Embassies. We need Embassy security. We need \nforeign aid to respond to real human needs while avoiding creating new \nenemies or new problems abroad. We need the State Department, but we \nalso need Homeland Security. We need to protect our borders. We need \nthe U.S. Coast Guard out there protecting us against drug dealers, \nterrorists, and helping to provide port security. We need Customs and \nBorder Protection to secure borders. There are those who want to build \na wall. I want to make sure we have the men, women, and technology to \nsecure the borders. We need law enforcement to fight terrorism abroad \nand also to fight the drug dealers, human traffickers, cartel people, \nand organized crime. That is why we need the FBI's help and help from \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\n  This would authorize $1.4 billion for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the Department of Justice to make sure we have enough \npeople and the right technology to protect us, in addition to the \nspartan situation we find in the Appropriations Committee. We need to \nbe able to do that. When we look at cyber security, this is all hands \non deck, all government on deck, all of us on deck. We do need DOD to \nhelp with threats to our military.\n  We are increasingly relying on digital technology. I am so proud of \nwhat we do at the National Security Agency, the mother ship of talent \nfocused on protecting the Nation. I am proud of the cyber command, but \nI am also proud of what we do through our cyber security in terms of \nwhat we do with the Department of Homeland Security, the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology, and others, coming up with new \ninformation for security technology. There are a lot of numbers and \ndata, but I will skip over that.\n  Then there is the legacy of war. The legacy of war is what we owe our \nveterans. We just celebrated Memorial Day, honoring those who made the \nultimate sacrifice, but we also extended our support for veterans \neverywhere.\n  Did the Presiding Officer know that 60 percent of Veterans Health \nAdministration facilities are over 50 years old? The facilities are \naging in place. The VA itself has cataloged $10 billion worth of \nmaintenance deficiencies and code violations at hospitals and clinics. \nWe are not talking about new construction. We are talking about \ndeficiencies in maintenance and actual code violations.\n  The VA tells us about leaking roofs, mold growing, and other serious \nproblems. I could go on. We all remember Walter Reed and how the years \nof neglected maintenance led to horrible conditions for our injured \nveterans and their families. They deserve better. They deserve \nfacilities that are as fit for duty as they are.\n  Then there is this other issue that I am very concerned about, which \nis in the area of research and development. Some of my colleagues might \nsay: What the heck does that have to do with being in the military? We \nneed research and development to be able to come up with the new ideas \nand new technologies to protect our Nation. Look at what the Department \nof Energy did. They are helping to develop big trucks that sip gas like \na Honda Civic. What does that mean? It not only means our military can \nbe more efficient, but we can also be more energy independent.\n  The National Science Foundation has done so much in the way of basic \nresearch that it has enabled us to come up with whole new fields like \nnanotechnology or miniaturization that enables our people not only to \nhave the smart weapons of war but the smart weapons against disease. My \ngosh, look at what we are developing just in terms of new technology.\n  I don't know if the Presiding Officer is aware, but a lot of the work \nthat was\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\ndone at NASA, particularly in the area of space telescopes and rockets, \nhelped us come up with the new digital mammography. Can you believe \nthat? Because we studied space out there, we learned to protect our \npeople right here, and it also helps others.\n  I also want to talk about the fact that we do help some domestic \nprograms here in the area of children and human infrastructure. People \nsay: What does that have to do with defense? I will tell you what \nGeneral Dempsey told me. General Dempsey told me this, and he told \nothers. So it wasn't like a little thing with General Dempsey. GEN \nMartin Dempsey, former head of the Joint Chiefs and decorated war hero \nsaid: Senator Mikulski, did you know that for every four people who \nwant to enlist in our military, only one is found fit to serve? Either \npeople are physically unfit, can't read, or have had a problem with \nmental illness or addiction.\n  We need to invest in our children. If for nothing else, we need to \nmake sure all Americans are fit for duty, and that is why we need to do \nthis.\n  We have spoken eloquently as to why we need more money for Zika, the \nneed to fight the addiction some have with opioid drugs, and the \nsituation in Flint.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise in support of the Reed-Mikulski \namendment to respond to threats to our Nation by raising the caps for \nboth defense and nondefense spending. All agree that we must defend the \nsecurity of the United States. So many argue we need more money for the \nDepartment of Defense, DOD, even though DOD consumes 50 percent of \ndiscretionary spending. But I argue not all of national security is in \nDepartment of Defense. There are clear and present dangers to Americans \nmet by other agencies, such as the Departments of Homeland Security, \nDHS, State, and Veterans Affairs, VA.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act, which passed with 64 votes in the Senate \nlast October, was based on parity--equal relief from the consequences \nof sequestration--because there have been significant consequences of \nsequester for the American people.\n  We are willing to support the need to defend America by allowing more \nspending on defense. But America faces threats at home as well, and we \nneed parity in responding to those threats. That is why we are offering \nthis amendment to say yes to $18 billion for defense needs and yes to \n$18 billion for nondefense needs, so we can make the Nation safer and \nmore secure.\n  The Reed-Mikulski amendment does two things. It amends 2015 \nBipartisan Budget Agreement to allow both: $18 billion of relief from \nsequestration for defense spending, the same amount authorized by the \nMcCain Amendment, and $18 billion of relief from sequestration for \nnondefense spending, because there are threats that DOD can't address.\n  What does the amendment fund? There are five categories: 1, national \nsecurity spending, in addition to DOD, for DHS to defend our coasts and \nborders, Department of Justice to track down drug cartels and \nterrorists and State Department diplomacy, foreign aid, and embassy \nsecurity; 2, funding to address urgent threats to America, including \nheroin, failing water infrastructure as exposed in Flint, the Zika \nvirus, and cyber security; 3, physical infrastructure, including \nfunding for roads, bridges, transit, and VA hospitals; 4, research \ninfrastructure investments, creating jobs through new products and \ncures; and 5, human infrastructure, providing more resources to \nunderfunded, but overwhelmingly passed, authorizations for education \nand college affordability, workforce training, and food safety. This \namendment meets threats to America with new funding not available in \nour appropriations bills due to austerity imposed by budget caps.\n  Current spending caps are $20 billion below the fiscal year 2010 \nlevel, 7 years ago. These cuts have consequences. This amendment \nauthorizes funding to meet real problems. Other members of the \nAppropriations Committee will come to the floor to discuss needs in \ntheir subcommittees, but first I want to talk about some of the dangers \nwe are addressing with this amendment.\n  The best way to keep our troops safe is peace. But we live in \nturbulent times, which means we need diplomacy. The State Department \nworks around the world to quell conflict and help displaced and \nthreatened refugees, stop weapons proliferation, and support treasured \nallies, especially those absorbing refugees from Syria.\n  We need embassy security so we can bring our diplomats home safely. \nWe need foreign aid to respond to real human needs while avoiding \ncreating new enemies abroad. We need the State Department to help keep \nAmerica safe. That is why the Reed-Mikulski amendment includes $1.9 \nbillion to continue the key security mission of the State Department.\n  Communities in the U.S. face lone-wolf terrorists, drug traffickers, \nand smugglers. The Department of Defense doesn't fight domestic crime \nand terrorism. We need the Department of Homeland Security's Coast \nGuard protecting our coasts; Transportation Security Administration, \nTSA, keeping air travel safe; and Customs and Border Protection, CBP, \nsecuring the border. We also need the Department of Justice's Federal \nBureau of Investigation, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. \nMarshals.\n  This amendment authorizes $1.4 billion for DHS and the Department of \nJustice, so they can improve outrageous wait times at airports, meeting \ngrowing passenger volume, which is up 7.4 percent from 2015, without \ncompromising safety; hire 2,000 officers on the borders; hire FBI, \nlocal police, and other Federal law enforcement to capture and \nprosecute criminals here in America--violent crime rose nearly 2 \npercent last year after falling in 2 prior years. The Department of \nDefense can't do those things.\n  I now want to turn to a threat that requires all hands on deck: cyber \nsecurity. We need DOD to help threats to our military, which is \nincreasingly reliant on digital technology, and threats from nation \nstates. I am so proud of Cyber Command, Fort Meade, and the National \nSecurity Agency, NSA, the mothership of talent, focused on protecting \nthe Nation.\n  But we have not done enough to protect ourselves at home. More than \n22 million Americans are at risk of identity theft because our own \nOffice of Personnel Management couldn't keep their records safe. We \nneed the FBI finding the criminals behind the keyboards, DHS advising \nFederal agencies, and the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology setting standards. And every agency needs to secure itself.\n  Last year, Federal agencies reported 77,000 cyber incidents--up 10 \npercent from fiscal year 2014. The Food and Drug Administration and the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office need to protect trade secrets, and the \nSocial Security Administration needs to protect our personal \ninformation. That is why our amendment includes $2 billion for cyber \nsecurity, so our nondefense agencies can join DOD in the fight.\n  The Reed-Mikulski amendment helps America be more secure, but also \nsafer. Americans are threatened daily with our roads and bridges \nfailing, our waterways and ports needing modernization, and our transit \nsystems clogged and crumbling.\n  Demand for flexible transportation investments is overwhelming. Since \n2010, the Federal Aviation Administration's backlog has grown by $1 \nbillion to a total of $5 billion, risking breakdowns in air traffic \ncontrol. Amtrak carries 30 million passengers each year, but can't stop \ndeadly derailments. Here in the National Capital Region, while ``safe \ntrack'' repairs clog highways and side streets, the Department of \nTransportation tells us there is an $86 billion maintenance backlog for \nbus and rail systems nationwide.\n  It is not just our transportation infrastructure that fails us; 60 \npercent of Veterans Health Administration facilities are over 50 years \nold and facilities are beginning to show their age. VA has catalogued \nalmost $10 billion worth of maintenance deficiencies and code \nviolations at existing hospitals and clinics. VA even classifies these \ndeficiencies as Ds and Fs, from leaking roofs to air handling systems \nin need of replacement.\n  These deficiencies can cause serious problems. For example, old air \nhandling units risk microbial contamination. If uncorrected, it could \ndirectly impact patient care because old ventilation systems would pump \ncontaminated air into inpatient and outpatient areas. We all remember \nWalter Reed, where years of neglected maintenance\n\n[[Page S3612]]\n\nled to horrible conditions for injured veterans and their families. Our \nveterans deserve better. That is why the Reed-Mikulski amendment \nincludes $3.2 billion to meet the physical infrastructure needs of the \nU.S.\n  It is not just our physical infrastructure. America's research \ninfrastructure has failed to keep pace with inflation. The National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, has lost more than 20 percent of its \npurchasing power since 2003. The history of economic growth shows we \nneed civilian research to create new ideas and new jobs.\n  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration built a methane \ndetector for its Mars rover that is helping find dangerous gas leaks on \nEarth. The National Science Foundation funded two Stanford graduate \nstudents' effort to build a search engine that formed the basis for \nGoogle. The Department of Energy is helping big trucks sip gas like a \nCivic. Our NIH researchers are on the cusp of finding cures for \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer. That is why the Reed-Mikulski \namendment includes $3.5 billion for research and development to create \njobs and find cures.\n  We can't cure cancer without investing in NIH. Now, we are looking at \na new health crisis and a new threat to America: Zika. Americans--\nparticularly women and children--are in danger. The President has said \n$1.9 billion is needed to fight Zika and stopping it from doing any \nmore harm. That funding is included in our amendment.\n  As of June 6, there were more than 1,732 confirmed Zika cases, \nincluding 341 pregnant women, in the U.S. and its territories. The \nmosquitos that carry Zika are already in at least three of our States, \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that soon \nthey will be in 30 States.\n  There is still a lot we don't know, but what we do know for sure is \nthat Zika has terrible consequences for women and babies. Scientists \nhave confirmed the link between the Zika infection in pregnancy and \nserious birth defects in babies. The details about what Zika does to \nthe brains of unborn children are truly horrific. Zika is a threat we \ncan stop if we have the will and the funding to do so.\n  Another emergency we can stop is the heroin epidemic. Every Senator \nand Governor has heard about the resurgence of heroin, which knows no \nboundaries--geographic or socioeconomic. Since 1999, the rate of heroin \nand opioid deaths quadrupled to an average of 78 deaths each day.\n  The Senate passed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, CARA, \non March 10 with a vote of 94-1. Authorization is nice, but we need the \nmoney to fund law enforcement, treatment and recovery and better pain \nmanagement so people don't get hooked on opioids in the first place. \nThat is why the Reed-Mikulski amendment includes $1.1 billion for \nheroin response and treatment.\n  Every community is dealing with addiction, but every State also \nworries about its water. The amendment also includes $1.9 billion to \nupgrade water systems throughout the U.S. Today, nearly 100,000 \nresidents of Flint don't have clean and safe drinking water. Up to \n9,000 children may have lead poisoning; some are already exhibiting \nsigns in school. Flint's water is still contaminated because its pipes \nare permanently damaged.\n  This is a national crisis. Flint is ground zero. Contaminated \ndrinking water is happening in cities and rural communities across \nAmerica. This is about the infrastructure and our failure to replace \nit. But it is about more than just replacing pipes. It is about the \nhuman infrastructure. This is about the lives of our children. What \nhappened in Flint, MI is a failure of a State's government to protect \nits own people. The threat from our aging water systems is real, and it \ncan't be solved by DOD.\n  From our water infrastructure to our human infrastructure which \nincludes the very troops who make up the DOD, we must do more to ensure \nreadiness. Shockingly, General Dempsey tells us only one of every four \nrecruits qualifies for duty. One can't read, one can't meet physical \nrequirements, and one is disqualified due to legal or mental problems. \nThey wanted to serve, but did we serve them?\n  We have overwhelmingly passed authorizations to help. The Every \nStudent Succeeds Act, which passed the Senate 85-12, aims to give kids \na better K-12 education so they are ready for college, careers, or \nmilitary service. But implementation is underfunded in the fiscal year \n2017 Labor-HHS-Education bill by more than $1 billion. We can't say we \nwant to solve problems with great policies, but then fail to fund the \nsolutions. That's why the Reed-Mikulski amendment includes $900 million \nfor underfunded authorizations of education and college affordability, \njob training, and food safety policy.\n  I talked at the beginning about how the State Department makes \nAmerica safe with diplomacy and foreign aid. But I want to end with how \nforeign aid can help make us safer by helping the lost generation of \nchildren across the globe that is on the move and on the march.\n  Nearly 60 million people worldwide are forced from their homes due to \nconflict and persecution. Refugees account for 20 million of those \npeople, half of which are children. This is not an isolated problem. \nMillions of refugees are from Syria and Iraq, Yemen, South Sudan, \nBurundi, and other conflict zones. What do they have in common? They \nare desperately in need of life-saving assistance, including food, \nwater, medical care, and shelter. Many will not be able to return home \nfor years--if ever.\n  These refugees cannot survive indefinitely on relief aid. The \nchildren need to attend school. The adults need jobs. These refugees \nare scared and ready to face the unknown, rather than endure the \nbrutality at home. They are only asking for one thing: help. All of us \nremember a time when, as a child, we needed help or our parents needed \nhelp. We also remember the names and faces of those who helped and \nthose who refused.\n  What do we think they are doing? Do we want these children to \nremember the United States as the people who helped, or as the people \nwho refused? If we don't help, what are we creating? A generation of \npeople who hate and distrust us because of our refusal when they were \nin need. We need the Reed-Mikulski amendment so our frugality doesn't \ncreate a generation that hates America.\n  We all want to protect America. I support the troops. I support the \nDepartment of Defense. I support the men and women at Maryland's nine \nmilitary bases. The Chairman of the Armed Services says they need $18 \nbillion more to meet the threats around the world. I support that \neffort, but only if there is parity. That is why we are proposing $18 \nbillion to meet threats to America not funded by the Department of \nDefense. I urge my colleagues to support the Reed-Mikulski amendment to \nraise the caps for both defense and nondefense items that defend \nAmerica.\n  I note that the distinguished majority leader is on the floor.\n  If we are going to spend more money on defense, even though we \nalready spend roughly $500 billion--about 50 percent of all \ndiscretionary spending--let's also spend money on other agencies that \nenable us to have a strong national security. Let's also put money into \nthe other threats to the United States. Right now there is a public \nhealth crisis with Zika. There is a public health crisis with opioid \nand heroin addiction and a crisis in Flint, MI. Others are facing \nenvironmental problems. Let's make these other investments to make sure \nwe keep America strong.\n  I yield the floor by saying: Let's please vote for the Reed-Mikulski \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, our government has work to do, but when it \ncomes to making sure that our courts have the judges they need, when it \ncomes to making sure that the Federal agencies have the leaders they \nneed, and when it comes to filling a vacant seat on the highest Court \nin this Nation, Senate Republicans refuse to do their job.\n  Senate Republicans have a long history of obstructing President \nObama's nominees. Earlier this week, I released a report documenting \nthat long history. The Republicans have slowed down the confirmation of \njudicial nominees to a crawl--the people needed to resolve important \nlegal disputes.\n\n[[Page S3613]]\n\nThey have stalled confirmations of key agency heads. These are the \npeople needed to protect consumers, to protect our environment, and to \ndefend our country.\n  They are blocking Merrick Garland, a judge whom our colleague from \nUtah, Senator Orrin Hatch, previously called a ``fine man'' whom the \nPresident could ``easily name'' to fill the vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Instead of working to make government function and more efficient, \nSenate Republicans have made it their priority to keep key positions \nempty for as long as possible--to hamstring efforts to protect \nconsumers and workers, to delay efforts to hold large corporations \naccountable, and to slow down work to promote equality.\n  The view of Senate Republicans seems to be pretty simple. If \ngovernment isn't working for them, their rich friends, or their \nrightwing allies, then Senate Republicans aren't going to let it work \nfor anyone. But it isn't too late. They still have time to put aside \ntheir extremism and start doing what they were sent here to do.\n  Start with district court judges, the men and women who resolve \ndisputes over how government works and whether the Constitution or \nFederal laws are being respected. They do an enormous amount of work. \nTheir work is not political. Democratic and Republican Senators have \nworked with the President to select these nominees.\n  As of today the Senate Judiciary Committee has cleared 15 people who \nwere nominated for seats on the Federal district courts. These nominees \nhave the support of Democrats and Republicans. They are ready to serve \ntheir country. One of them is from Massachusetts. We need our judge. \nThis Nation needs its judges. So let's vote.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following 15 nominations: \nCalendar Nos. 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, 459, 460, 461, 508, 569, \n570, 571, 572, and 573; that the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; \nthat the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in \nthe Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we continue to process judicial \nnominations, and we have done so even when a majority of the Republican \nconference did not support the nominee, as was the case with the \ndistrict court nominee from Maryland, whom we confirmed before the \nrecess. That is an example of a judge confirmed that a majority of \nRepublicans did not approve of.\n  Just this past Monday, the first day after the recess, we confirmed \ntwo more article III judicial nominees. We tried to confirm them before \nthe recess, by the way, but our Democratic colleagues would not clear \nthem.\n  President Obama has had many more judicial nominees confirmed than \nPresident Bush did at the same point in his Presidency. We will \ncontinue to process his judicial nominations, but the minority is not \ngoing to dictate to the majority when and how we will do so.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. WARREN. I ask through the Chair if the majority leader will yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yielded the floor.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I am asking if the majority leader will \nyield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader does not have the floor.\n  Ms. WARREN. All right, I will just ask my question.\n  On Monday, I wanted to come to the Senate floor to make the request I \njust made, but I guess the majority leader was taking a lot of heat \nabout judges and Donald Trump's racist statements about them and didn't \nwant to draw any more attention to the Republicans' unprecedented \nblockade of judicial nominations. So the Republicans offered me a deal: \nJust go away, and we will confirm two Court of International Trade \njudges.\n  The Court of International Trade is pretty important. It handles \ntrade enforcement cases, and nearly half of that court has been empty \nfor a year because Republicans refused to do their jobs.\n  These two uncontroversial nominees have been twisting in the wind for \n336 days. They are highly qualified, honorable lawyers who are ready to \nserve their country. So on Monday, I took the deal. The Republicans \nreleased two hostages, and the Senate confirmed them by a voice vote, \nwithout objection--not a single objection nearly a year after they were \nnominated.\n  Today, the majority leader isn't offering to release any hostages, \nand my question for the majority leader is, What happened between \nMonday and today?\n  I yield the floor if the majority leader wishes to respond.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we tried to confirm the article III \njudges she is referring to before the recess and our Democratic \ncolleagues would not clear them.\n  I don't know whether the Senator from Massachusetts has additional \nUCs to propound or not, but if she does, I would respectfully suggest \nshe propound them.\n  Ms. WARREN. Then I certainly will.\n  Mr. President, last week the majority leader wrote an op-ed in the \nWall Street Journal, and it was titled, without a hint of irony, ``How \nthe Senate Is Supposed to Work.'' In his article, Senator McConnell \ndeclared: ``On issues of great national significance, one party should \nsimply never force its will on everybody else.'' He pleaded that ``it's \nnot an act of betrayal to work with one's political adversaries when \ndoing so is good for the country.''\n  Senator McConnell agreed to confirm two highly qualified judges on \nMonday because it served his political interests. Today, he doesn't \nfeel like it, so he forces his will on everyone else. That is not how \nthe Senate is supposed to work.\n  The Constitution is clear. The Senate's job is to provide advice and \nconsent on the President's judicial nominees. There is no asterisk that \nsays ``only when the majority leader has an embarrassing political \nproblem'' or ``except when the President is named Barrack Obama.''\n  It is not what the Founders had in mind because it is small, it is \npetty, and it is absurd. For these district court nominees, the U.S. \nSenate should be asking one question and one question only: Are these \njudges qualified or are they not qualified? That is it. But that is not \nwhat is happening in the U.S. Senate. Instead, good people twist in the \nwind, hung up as political hostages, and that is undermining the \nintegrity of our courts.\n  So if you will not give all 15 judges their votes, let's at least \nhave a vote on the 9 district court nominees who had their Judiciary \nCommittee hearings last year. Senator Toomey called for some of these \nnominees to be confirmed last month. All of these nominees have been \nwaiting for at least 6 months--almost 200 days--since their hearings. \nWhen President Reagan was in office, almost no uncontroversial nominees \ntook longer than 100 days to confirm from the day they were nominated. \nThe delay is ridiculous. Give them their votes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nine nominations that have \nbeen pending since 2015: Calendar Nos. 357, 358, 359, 362, 363, 364, \n459, 460, 461; that the Senate proceed to vote without intervening \naction or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to \nthe nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record; \nthat the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and \nthe Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, so our \ncolleagues are not confused, looking at the Bush years to today and the \nObama\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\nyears to today--apples and apples--President Obama has had 327 judges \nconfirmed, and President Bush had 304. President Obama has not been \ntreated unfairly. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, right this minute, right here on the floor \nof the Senate, we face one of those ``issues of great national \nsignificance'' that the majority leader wrote about in the Wall Street \nJournal. It is an exploding number of judicial vacancies.\n  The Washington Post recently reported:\n\n       Of 673 U.S. district court judgeships, 67--or 10 percent--\n     are vacant under President Obama, nearly twice as many as at \n     this point of Republican George W. Bush's presidency and 50 \n     percent higher than at this time under Bill Clinton or George \n     H.W. Bush.\n       The number of federally designated district court \n     ``judicial emergencies''--where seats carry particularly \n     heavy caseloads or have been open for an extended period--is \n     also roughly double what it was in May 2008 and May 2000.\n\n  Addressing those emergencies is good for the country. Keeping our \ncourts functioning is good for the country. Confirming nominees who \nhave the support of Republicans and Democrats is good for the country.\n  But just a minute ago, the majority leader blocked confirmation of \nall 15 noncontroversial judges who are waiting for votes. That is not \nputting the country first; that is putting politics first. It is \nforcing the will of a small number of extremist Republicans on the \nentire country, and the integrity of our judicial branch is suffering \nfor it.\n  So let me try this again. Surely we can agree to confirm the four \noldest nominations on this list--two Democratic recommendations and two \nRepublican recommendations. They all had hearings in September, 9 \nmonths ago. What are we waiting for? Give them their votes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following four nominations: Calendar \nNos. 357, 358, 359, and 362; that the Senate proceed to vote without \nintervening action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; \nthat the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be \nin order to the nominations; that any related statements be printed in \nthe Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I object, unfortunately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise once again to discuss the state of \nour Nation's healthcare system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Oh, she does?\n  Ms. WARREN. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could say that I am surprised by this, but I \nam not surprised.\n  The Republican leader can say whatever he wants today, but he has \nmade his intentions very clear when it comes to President Obama. On the \neve of the 2010 elections, Senator McConnell said that ``the single \nmost important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a \none-term president.''\n  Well, President Obama won reelection, but Senate Republicans have \nstill stalled, delayed, and blocked his nominees. Since they took \ncharge of the Senate last year, these Republicans are on pace for the \nlowest number of judicial confirmations in more than 60 years.\n  So can we at least confirm one noncontroversial district judge?\n  The nominee on the list who has been waiting the longest is Brian \nMartinotti. New Jersey needs this judge. He was nominated a year ago. \nHe has been twisting in the wind for 9 months since his confirmation \nhearing. Give him a vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 357; that the Senate proceed \nto vote without intervening action or debate on the nomination; that \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table \nwith no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in \norder to the nomination; that any related statements be printed in the \nRecord; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I will \ncertainly look at this and see what can be done, but at this present \ntime, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, Brian Martinotti deserves better than \nthis. All these nominees deserve better than this. Merrick Garland \ndeserves better than this, and the American people deserve better than \nthis. We will keep fighting to try to get the Senate Republicans to do \ntheir job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have only been here 40 years, and this \nhappens every time at the end. They have not been mistreated. The fact \nis that they have had more judges confirmed in 7 years than President \nBush had in a full 8 years, and they are going to have more judges. But \nit is the majority leader's determination as to when those judges will \ncome up and when they will be confirmed, and I think he has been doing \nit on a regular basis.\n  I hate to go back in time, but I could go back in time and show how \nthe delays on the Republican judges with the Republican Presidents were \njust unbelievable. All I can say is that it is nice to raise these \nfusses around here--and I don't blame the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts because she is doing her job--but let's allow the \nmajority leader to do his job as well.\n\n\n                       ObamaCare and the Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I rise once again to discuss the state of our Nation's \nhealth care system and what we can likely expect in 2017 under \nObamaCare. This is a good subject following on to the judgeship \ndiscussion because the Democrats are acting so offended and so \nmistreated. Well, I hate to tell you how we were mistreated time after \ntime after time when we had Republican Presidents.\n  Let me just talk about what we can expect in 2017 under ObamaCare. \nHowever, before I delve into that discussion, it is important to \nprovide a little context.\n  Roughly 7\\1/2\\ years ago, President Obama was sworn into office, \nriding on a wave of good will, optimism, and so many promises about \nwhat he was and was not going to do that it was difficult to keep \ntrack. Seven and a half years may not be all that long in the grand \nscheme of things, but it is surely long enough to evaluate the economic \nsuccesses and failures of a single administration. Let's take a look at \nwhat we have witnessed in the years President Obama has been in office.\n  Since January 2009, our Nation's gross domestic product has grown at \nan average annual rate of only 1.7 percent. Think of that--1.7 percent \nin 7\\1/2\\ years--and the overall trajectory hasn't been improving. In \nthe last quarter, our economy grew at the slowest rate in 2 years.\n  At the same time we have experienced that slow GDP growth, wage \ngrowth has been sluggish and median household income in the United \nStates has actually gone down under this President, declining at an \nannual rate of almost one-half of 1 percent. Slow economic growth, slow \nwage growth, declining household incomes--and this past Friday we \nlearned that the economy added only 38,000 jobs in May, with job gains \nhaving averaged a sluggish 112,000 per month since President Obama took \noffice.\n  When are the American people going to wake up and realize these \npeople are not doing their job? Not only are they not doing their job, \nthey are doing a lousy job.\n  There is not a new normal here either. They are trying to pass off \nthat they have low unemployment rates. They are not counting all the \npeople who just don't even look for a job anymore. If you count them, \nit is well over 9 percent. That is what we have seen in the Obama \neconomy.\n  Sadly, even that doesn't tell the whole sad story. Along with a \nstagnant economy and declining household income, the cost of health \ncare has gone\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\nup almost exponentially--and exponentially in some areas. Health care \npremiums for families with employer-based coverage--one of a handful of \nbenchmarks for measuring the costs of health care in the United \nStates--have gone up by an average of 5 percent a year. That trend, \naccording to both the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, is expected to continue over the next decade, \nwith premiums in the individual health insurance market going up at an \neven faster rate.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve projects that growth in our economy \nwill range between 1.8 percent and 2.3 percent, well below historic \naverages and far below the growth rate for average health insurance \npremiums.\n  Do you think we are going to do any better with a new Democratic \nPresident? I don't think so. She has already admitted she is going to \nfollow the principles of this President and the program of this \nPresident.\n  Long story short, under this President we have seen mostly lackluster \neconomic growth and a decline in household income while the cost of \nhealth insurance has eaten up an increasingly larger share of American \nfamilies' earnings and an ever-growing percentage of our national \neconomy. According to most credible projections, it is only going to \nget worse. There are still 30 million people without health insurance, \nabout the number there was when they came up with this colossal \nwasteful mess of the health care bill.\n  This correlation of economic stagnation and exploding health care \ncosts is particularly damning for this President because his signature \ndomestic achievement--his top priority after being elected--was passage \nof the so-called Affordable Care Act, a law that was, among many other \nthings, supposed to bring down health care costs.\n  The word ``affordable'' is actually the operative word in the name of \nthe law. Yet it is probably the least suitable word for describing what \nthis statute has actually done to our health care system.\n  It has now been 3 years since the Affordable Care Act was fully \nimplemented and in effect. And in all 3 of those years, average health \ninsurance premiums in the United States have gone up by double-digits \nin many markets. Insurers are currently making rate decisions for year \n4 of ObamaCare, and from what we have seen thus far, things are only \ngoing to get worse. According to one analyst, the average of the \nweighted rate increases requested from 28 States and the District of \nColumbia is approximately 20 percent.\n  Indeed, over the past few months, it seems as though we have seen a \nnew headline every day that highlights the failure of ObamaCare to \nbring down premiums.\n  For example, we have recently learned that in New York patients may \nsee an average premium increase of 17 percent on the ObamaCare \ninsurance exchanges. In fact, one major New York carrier requested a \nrate hike of 45 percent over what they charged last year--or should I \nsay this year, I guess.\n  In the State of New Mexico, one major insurer requested a premium \nincrease of more than 83 percent, and those States are not outliers. \nAverage premiums in Mississippi could increase by over $1,000 next \nyear, according to recent reports. Insurers have requested average \nhikes of nearly 14 percent in the State of Washington. A major carrier \nin New Hampshire just requested an increase of more than 45 percent for \n2017. Another insurer has submitted a request to raise premiums by more \nthan 36 percent in Tennessee. People in other States, such as Virginia, \nFlorida, Maine, Oregon, and Iowa, are all facing potential double-digit \nincreases in premiums, with some in the 30-percent to 40-percent range.\n  Keep in mind these are just the States we know about thus far. More \nnumbers and almost certainly more requested premium hikes will be made \npublic very shortly. We are still waiting to see specifically what will \nhappen for the people of my home State of Utah. Still, we already know \nthat many Utahns are facing difficulties. I hear from my constituents \nall the time on these issues.\n  For example, a citizen from Roosevelt, UT, recently wrote to me to \nsay this about her experience with ObamaCare:\n\n       I can't afford the monthly premiums, and as long as I have \n     to pay extraordinary deductibles, I may as well just continue \n     paying for the visits as I go and not have to worry about the \n     extra money I would have to spend in premiums, which are \n     outrageous. . . . I realize I will have to pay a penalty when \n     I do my taxes, but it will be way less than the premiums I \n     would have had to pay had I signed up for this health care \n     debacle.\n\n  Another constituent named Richelle from Santa Clara, UT, said this in \na recent letter:\n\n       As I am looking into purchasing the health care coverage we \n     need; I'm finding that it is totally ridiculous. The \n     catastrophic health care we were planning for a few years ago \n     no longer exists because of the health care laws. In order to \n     get LEGAL health care for me, my spouse, and my 3 eligible \n     children, I'm being required to pay close to $1300 per month! \n     These policies still require huge deductibles and will \n     quickly eat up the money we've put away for such things.\n\n  Unfortunately, these stories are not isolated incidents. People \nthroughout the country are growing more and more concerned about the \ncost of health care under the President's health care law. Even without \nthe skyrocketing cost of health care, millions of American families \nwould still be struggling to make it under the Obama economy. Yet for \nthese people, all of whom have had to suffer through a period of \nstagnant economic growth and declining incomes, these rising health \ncare costs are, at best, a slap in the face and, at worst, a nail in \nthe financial coffin.\n  I have spent a lot of time on the Senate floor over the last 6 years \ndescribing what has gone wrong with the Affordable Care Act. I will not \ndetail the substantive and structural problems with the law here today. \nInstead, I will just repeat what should be clear to everyone here. This \nlaw is not working. This law has imposed even greater burdens on \nvirtually all the participants in our health care system, and this law \nis failing middle-class and lower income families throughout the \ncountry.\n  We can and we must do better, but in order to do so, we will have to \nturn our focus to the biggest problem that patients face as they \nnavigate our health care system, and that is cost. We must bring down \ncosts. Any future attempts at health care reform that are not cost-\nfocused are, in my view--and I suspect the view of most Americans--a \nwaste of time and effort.\n  As for me, my position is pretty clear. I support the repeal of \nObamaCare, and I support a replacement that makes sense. I have worked \nwith colleagues to come up with a replacement proposal designed \nspecifically to contain costs for patients and consumers. A number of \nhealth care experts have concluded that our proposal, which we have \ncalled the Patient CARE Act, would do just that.\n  Of course, there are other proposals out there. For example, I know \nthe House majority is working on a proposal, and I am anxious to see \nwhat they come up with. As chairman of the Finance Committee, which has \njurisdiction over many major aspects of our health care system, I have \nbegun reaching out to stakeholders to discuss in more detail the \ncurrent premium prices and what needs to be done to address it.\n  But let's be clear. To bring down these rising health care costs, we \nwill need significant buy-in from my friends on the other side of the \naisle. Quite frankly, I don't know how any of them can read the recent \nnews reports about premium hikes and hear the stories from their \nconstituents about skyrocketing health care costs and think ObamaCare \nis working just the way it was supposed to.\n  As I have said before, my hope is that at some point my colleagues on \nthe Democratic side will begin to acknowledge the failures of \nObamaCare. At the very least, they should acknowledge it has failed to \nbring down costs for patients and consumers and is, in fact, driving up \ncosts.\n  Until that acknowledgment comes, I plan to do all I can to make the \ncase to the American people about the need for change and to work with \nanyone who is willing to put in the effort to address these monumental \nproblems. I look forward to speaking more about these issues in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  With all the economic struggles the American people--particularly \nthose in the middle class and with lower incomes--have had to deal with \nunder the Obama administration, the last thing families in the United \nStates\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\nneed is the continuation of the skyrocketing health premiums we have \nseen as a result of ObamaCare. I plan to do all I can to reverse this \ntrend.\n  I know there are some on the Democratic side who knew from the \nbeginning it wasn't going to work. Then they would be able to throw \ntheir hands in the air and say: It is not working. We need to go to \nsocialized medicine or one-size-fits-all Federal Government control of \nhealth care in this country. Anybody who thinks that is going to be a \ngood system, boy, have I got a bridge to sell you.\n  The fact is, as bad as our system was before, it was better than what \nthis is. We can make it better, but it is going to take Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together in the best interests--and get rid of the \nstupid politics involved--to come up with a program that will work for \nthe American people.\n  I can tell you this, the American people cannot live on the slow \ngrowth that is currently going on. We cannot compete with the rest of \nthe world on the slow growth that is currently going on, and it has \nbeen a slow growth for all of President Obama's time in the Presidency.\n  It wasn't all his fault, but--by gosh--there could have been programs \nthat would have made it better had they just relied a little bit more \non the free market system that has made this country the greatest \ncountry in the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk against an amendment that would undermine the spirit of \nbipartisanship we have cultivated with the last several budget deals \nwithout fully addressing our national security and domestic needs and \nto speak in support of an alternative that would do so much more to \nprotect our families, improve our national security, and build on our \nbipartisan budget deal in a truly fair and responsible way.\n  As I will go into a bit more, for an amendment to a bill focused on \nensuring our Nation is prepared to meet future challenges here at home \nand across the world, the Republican amendment ignores too many \npriorities in the nondefense world that are critical to our Nation's \nsecurity. It only supplements defense priorities, leaving by the \nwayside domestic challenges, such as the Flint water crisis, the Zika \noutbreak, the opioid crisis, and domestic law enforcement agencies like \nthe FBI, to say nothing of investments that we also know improve \nnational security in the long run, such as education, health care, a \nstrong economy, and more. It casts aside the principles we laid down in \nour bipartisan budget deal that we should be building on, not tearing \ndown.\n  I want to spend a minute or two on that last point, since it is a \nvery important one. As many of us have said before, a budget is far \nmore than simply numbers on a page. A budget truly is a statement of \nvalues, of priorities, of the kind of nation we are, and the kind of \nnation we want to be. That is why I am so proud that following the tea \nparty government shutdown back in 2013, Democrats and Republicans were \nfinally able to come together, break through the gridlock, and reach a \nbipartisan budget deal.\n  Our deal wasn't perfect. It wasn't what any of us would have written \non our own, but it was a critical step in the right direction. It \nrestored investments in health care and education, in research, and \ndefense jobs. It halted the constant lurching from one crisis to the \nnext, and it showed the American people that we in Congress can make \nthings work when we work together.\n  We were able to get a bipartisan deal because we kept to a core \nprinciple, which was rolling back the cuts evenly across defense and \nnondefense investments. That wasn't the only hurdle, but it was a big \none. Both sides agreed that we may not agree on everything, but we had \nto solve the problem in a fair and balanced way and one that addressed \nall of our budget challenges here at home and throughout the world.\n  Establishing this principle and then sticking to it in our 2015 deal \nis what helped us make the progress we have made and build a foundation \nfor continued work. I believe it is a principle we need to stick to if \nwe want that good work to continue.\n  We reached a 2-year bipartisan budget agreement just last fall. If \nthe Senate is about to open that bipartisan budget agreement on this \nbill, then we should be doing it in a thoughtful and productive manner \nthat allows us to build on the 2-year deal and address a fuller range \nof security issues.\n  Unfortunately, the amendment we are going to vote on either later \ntonight or tomorrow would move us in the wrong direction when it comes \nto this productive bipartisan work. Instead of building on our deal, it \ntries to circumvent it. Instead of working together to truly restore \ninvestments, it uses a gimmick to pretend to restore investments, and \ninstead of working with Democrats to restore cuts on the domestic side \nthat support our national security as well, it only supports the \ndefense side and leaves far too much behind. I don't think that is \nright, and I think we can actually do better.\n  If Republicans truly want to work with us to build on our budget deal \nin this bill in a way that truly prepares us to respond to domestic and \nforeign challenges facing our country, we have an alternative. Our \namendment, the Democratic alternative, would restore investments that \nhelp workers, the middle class, veterans, and families all across our \ncountry at an equal level to the defense priorities. It would invest in \ncritical priorities that clearly keep our country safe, including \nsupporting the operations of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and \nsupplying the Transportation Security Administration with the tools \nthey need to keep our airports and other transit hubs safe that have \nbecome a target for terrorist attacks and allow us to tackle the opioid \ncrisis that is devastating communities in my home State of Washington \nand across the country.\n  It would provide the resources for us to respond to the water and \nlead issues in Flint and many communities in our Nation, and provide \nresources to help us address so many of the challenges facing our \nworkers, our families, our communities, and our middle class and do it \nin the fair and balanced way that we all know works by building on the \nbipartisan budget deal and treating defense and nondefense equitably \nand fairly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic amendment so we can \nrestore these investments in critical defense and nondefense programs \nand invest in priorities that keep us safe and strengthen our \ncommunities and the middle class. Having a powerful military is \nimportant to our country's safety but so is access to safe drinking \nwater and so are TSA agents protecting our transit hubs, Zika research \nto prevent further spread of this disease, and so much more.\n  I hope we can work together to build on our bipartisan progress, \nstick to our bipartisan principles, and keep our country moving in the \nright direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the \nvisit of Prime Minister Modi of India and to speak about an amendment I \nhave, but listening to the Senator from Washington, I have to express \nmy sense of wonder and amazement at our Democratic colleagues for whom \nno amount of money, no growth in the size of government is too much.\n  While I am certainly sympathetic to the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona which would increase defense spending at a time when there is a \ngreater array and a greater diversity of threats to our country than \nDirector of National Intelligence James Clapper has said he has seen in \nhis 50-year career, the idea that because we want to take care of the \nNo. 1 priority of the Federal Government, which is national security \nand self-defense, we have to somehow use that to leverage more spending \nin other areas that are nondefense-related is simply unacceptable, \nparticularly at a time when our national debt is $19 trillion.\n  The other day, I happened to be speaking to a young woman who said: \nWell, what would you tell me to tell my peers?\n  She must have been--who knows how old she was--in her early twenties.\n  She said: What would you tell me to tell my peers about politics and \nwhy\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\nthey should care and why they should be involved?\n  I told her: Well, if I were you, I would be angry. I would be mad. \nYour generation should be angry with my generation because what we have \ndone is spent a bunch of money we did not have, and we have simply \npassed the debt and the bill off to your generation.\n  It is not just the $19 trillion in debt, it is also the pathway to \nSocial Security and Medicare, the promises we made to our seniors for a \nsecure late-in-life lifestyle that simply can't be kept unless we \nsupport and reform Social Security and make it sustainable for future \ngenerations.\n  So this is not the main reason I came to the floor to speak today, \nbut I just have to express my own sense of wonder and amazement at our \nDemocratic colleagues who want to continue to spend money we don't have \nbecause they know that if you end up spending this money they are \nasking for, it is just going to be added to the bill that is going to \nbe paid for by the next generation, people like these young folks down \nhere who are pages. That is, frankly, immoral, and it is not \nacceptable.\n\n\n                  Visit by the Prime Minister of India\n\n  Mr. President, the main reason I came here to speak--today was really \na historic day in Washington, DC, and in the relationship between the \nGovernment of the Republic of India and the United States of America. \nLike many of my colleagues, I had a chance to listen to Prime Minister \nModi speak to a joint meeting of Congress this morning over in the \nHouse of Representatives. I was reminded of how far our two countries \nhave come in such a relatively short period of time.\n  My first visit to India was about 10 years ago. I had been encouraged \nto go because of some of my constituents back in Dallas, TX, who \nstarted the Dallas Indo-American Chamber of Commerce. We actually have \na large Indian-American community in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area and also \nin Houston. Around the State of Texas, we probably have some 250,000 to \n300,000 Indian Americans--part of the diaspora Prime Minister Modi \ntalked about before and of which he said he was particularly proud and \nwhich binds our two countries together.\n  When I came back from my trip to India, at the same request of the \nsame constituent--he encouraged us to create a U.S. Senate India \ncaucus, knowing that our two countries had a lot more work to do \ntogether. I am happy to say that 10 years ago, when Secretary Clinton \nwas Senator Clinton, she and I cofounded the U.S.-India caucus. Later \non, Chris Dodd--after Senator Clinton became Secretary Clinton--and \nthen after Senator Chris Dodd left, Senator Mark Warner is my current \ncochair. We have about 30-some-odd members of this U.S.-India caucus, \nwhich demonstrates again the acknowledgment of how important this \nrelationship has become.\n  I am grateful for the concrete manifestation--the evidence of that \nrelationship, things like the fact that, as Prime Minister Modi said, \nIndia joins the United States in more joint military exercises than any \nother country.\n  We also have a robust civil nuclear agreement that allows for the \nexchange of critical information and technology. This has been a long \ntime in coming. I think it was 2008 when the Bush administration \nadvocated for this civil nuclear agreement which now, apparently, is \ncoming to fruition. I noticed that President Obama and Prime Minister \nModi announced the construction plans for a number of nuclear \npowerplants in India. India is a vast country--I think he mentioned 1 \n\\1/4\\ billion people. Many of them simply don't have electricity and \nlive very impoverished lives. So it is an acknowledgment of our close-\nknit relationship but also of the need that India has, in order to \nadvance and lift its own people to better living conditions, to have \naccess to the electricity that is going to become available once these \nnuclear powerplants are constructed.\n  Of course, our economies continue to rely upon each other \nincreasingly for trade and investment. As more and more American-made \ngoods or American agricultural products are sold to India--with the \nrising middle class, there are going to be more and more people \npurchasing those goods and services. Of course, that is going to help \nimprove jobs here in the United States, as well as the quality of life \nthere.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we share growing cultural ties. Fast-\nforward to today. When Prime Minister Modi spoke today, he talked about \nhis vision for his country's future, including deepening and broadening \nthe relationship with the United States. That is a very welcome \nstatement by the Prime Minister.\n  Unfortunately, over the last few years--7 or 8 years of the Obama \nadministration, many of our friends and allies around the world have \nquestioned our commitment to those friendships and these alliances, \nand, conversely, many of our adversaries have become emboldened when \nthey see America retreating from its engagement with the rest of the \nworld. We do not need American boots on the ground around the globe, \nbut we do need American leadership around the world. There is no other \ncountry with benign intent like the United States that can fill that \nleadership void.\n\n  So I was glad to hear Prime Minister Modi talking about the \nimportance of it. I hope we all respond appropriately. Of course, this \nis important not just today, but it will become increasingly important \nin the 21st century. The safety and stability of the Asia-Pacific \nregion in particular will depend more and more on the safety and \nstability of India. Here in the Senate, we have had ample opportunity \nto work with our friends from India in order to guarantee that goal.\n  There are a couple of pieces of legislation I have cosponsored with \nSenator Warner, my cochair of the U.S.-India caucus, that will bolster \nour ties with India.\n  The first would help bring India into an existing trade structure, \nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, or APEC. It would direct \nthe Department of State to develop a strategy to facilitate India's \nmembership status in this organization, and it would urge APEC nations \nto support India's membership. As the world continues to become more \ninterconnected through trade, we need to make sure like-minded \ncountries with economic might, such as India, have a seat at the table.\n  Of course, it is a truism that countries that do business together \nand trade together are much less likely to engage in some conflict \nagainst each other. So trade is good for national security and internal \nsecurity as well, not just for the economy.\n  The second bill I have introduced will help cement India's status as \na major partner of the United States. It would strengthen our defense \nand technology ties and also make sure that India is equipped to handle \nthe myriad threats coming its way. The truth is that India is at risk \nfor many of the same sort of threats that the United States is. This \nmorning, Prime Minister Modi mentioned the cyber threat. Certainly that \nis true, but we know India is a target for international terrorist \nattacks. Indeed, the Prime Minister mentioned the terrible attacks that \noccurred in Mumbai not that many years ago, when terrorists came in and \nkilled a bunch of tourists there in Mumbai or Bombay.\n  I am proud to cosponsor an amendment to the Defense authorization \nbill filed by the junior Senator from Alaska. This amendment would \nencourage greater military cooperation with India. Even though it is at \nan alltime high, it could certainly be improved through more joint \nmilitary operations and officer exchanges. This is really an incredible \nsource of American diplomatic power and strength, particularly in our \nmilitary-to-military relationship.\n  I can't tell you how many times I have been to countries around the \nworld, the way I was, for example, in Cairo, Egypt, sitting there \ntalking to the President of Egypt, President Sisi, who was talking \nabout his military training here in the United States, in San Antonio, \nTX, my hometown. Of course I had to ask him how he likes the Tex-Mex, \nMexican food. He said it was a little too spicy for him.\n  The point is that these military-to-military exchanges with countries \nlike India and Egypt and others are a great opportunity for us to \nestablish friendships and connections, and people who invariably--and I \nam sure nobody dreamed that then-Military Officer Sisi would become the \nPresident of Egypt, but he rose in that leadership position and now is \nthe leader of that large\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\ncountry of some 92 million people. So those military-to-military \nrelationships, those joint military exercises with countries like India \nare very important.\n  Let me close on the Prime Minister's comments this morning by \nthanking him publicly. It speaks volumes to his commitment to further \nthe U.S.-India relationship. I look forward to continuing to play a \nsmall part in that effort through the work of the Senate India caucus.\n  As Prime Minister Modi's visit illustrates, the United States cannot \nafford to ignore our friends and those who share common values, as \nPrime Minister Modi spoke. The world is simply too unstable and too \ndangerous. Plus, it is just plain stupid not to maintain a good \nrelationship with your friends and allies and people who share similar \nvalues. But we also have to look at the other side of the coin, and \nthat is to push back on our adversaries. And as I said, unfortunately, \nover his 8 years in the White House, the President has seemed somewhat \ndetached from both of those--either encouraging stronger relationships \nwith our friends and allies by demonstrating that we have their back \nand that we can be trusted or by pushing back on our adversaries when \nthey take aggressive action. As I mentioned earlier this week, his \nfirst Secretary of State, Secretary Clinton, regularly lacked the \nability to call a spade a speed, particularly with regard to challenges \nlike our enemy in North Korea.\n  Not long ago--I guess it was in August of last year--I had a chance \nto visit with Admiral Harris, the four-star head of Pacific Command. \nWhen we asked him to list the danger spots in the world that keep him \nawake at night, he mentioned North Korea as the No. 1 threat. Of \ncourse, some of that may be the proximity of his command there in \nHawaii. But the fact is, North Korea is ruled by a dangerous dictator \nwho has nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, which \nis a dangerous mix.\n  Of course, unfortunately, under Secretary Clinton's watch and \nPresident Obama's watch, this has gotten nothing but worse. As we \ncontinue to consider the National Defense Authorization Act, we do have \na chance to take up some of the slack, though. We are not without tools \nhere in the Congress to fill in some of the gaps and to correct some of \nthe misguided foreign policy prescriptions of the White House.\n  One way we can do that is by supporting an amendment I have filed \nthat will help us hold Iran accountable for its recent hostile actions \nagainst U.S. sailors. We all remember that last January, two Navy \nriverine boats with 10 American sailors on board made headlines around \nthe world when they strayed into Iranian waters. They were taken \ncaptive by members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps after \nbeing forced at gunpoint to surrender. The sailors were blindfolded. \nThey were hauled back to Iranian soil. They were interrogated and \ndetained. The IRGC henchmen documented the event at almost every step \nalong the way, quickly broadcasting those videos and photos of the \ncaptured sailors among state-run media outlets.\n\n  This is not in line with international norms. This is not the way we \nwould treat a foreign country's navy if the same thing happened, and \nthe Geneva Convention makes clear that when military forces from one \ncountry detain military forces of another those prisoners are to be \nprotected from public displays of humiliation, not to be used for \npropaganda purposes, which is what the American sailors were used for. \nSomething called the doctrine of innocent passage--a concept of what is \nknown as customary international law--provides that all vessels have \nthe right of travel through another country's territorial waters to get \nfrom point A to point B swiftly.\n  It is pretty apparent that Iran violated our sailors' right to \ninnocent passage, but we haven't heard a peep out of the White House. \nInstead, the administration has patted itself on the back and claimed \ntheir bad Iran deal somehow brought these sailors home safely. They \nclaim that somehow the enhanced credibility they had from the misguided \nIran nuclear deal somehow gave them a seat at the table and an ability \nto negotiate the release of our own sailors from Iran. This is \nabsolutely ridiculous, and it ignores the crux of the problem. These \nsailors shouldn't have been taken captive in the first place.\n  While the President may leave this kind of aggression unanswered, we \ndon't have to. My amendment would require the President to answer two \nsimple questions: Did Iran's hostile actions in January violate \ninternational law? And were any Federal funds paid to the Iranian \nregime to effect the release of our sailors? In other words, did the \nObama administration pay ransom to bring them home? I think the \nAmerican people, certainly our taxpayers, have a right to know whether \nthe Obama administration used their hard-earned tax dollars to pay \nransom to a rogue regime like Iran's.\n  If the administration does find that Iran violated international law, \nsanctions on those Iranians responsible would be triggered under my \namendment. It is absolutely imperative we not turn a blind eye to \naggression by the world's thugs, tyrants, and renegades, which is, \nunfortunately, what we seem to do too often.\n  We need to hold Tehran accountable in some way. Since the President, \nso far, has refused to do that on his own, it is incumbent on Congress \nto lead on this issue, and my amendment is a good start. I am hopeful \nmy colleagues will support it so Iran knows, even if it doesn't have to \nanswer to the President of the United States, it will have to answer to \nthe American people through their elected representatives in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is week 45 of ``Waste of the Week,'' \nwhere I have been here talking about waste, fraud, and abuse, and \ntrying to find ways to save taxpayers' dollars. As I have said a number \nof times, our efforts since 2010 are to go big to address the real \nfiscal situation that this country is dealing with, the runaway \nentitlements, the ever-shrinking discretionary pot, and the deficit \nspending, leading to borrowing that has taken us from $10.7 trillion \njust in my first term here now in six years--from $10.7 trillion--to \n$19.2 trillion. I don't think any of us can contemplate what $19.2 \ntrillion really means. But what it means in terms of its impact and \neffect is that we are passing on to future generations a debt that they \nwill not be able to repay without serious consequences to our economy \nand serious consequences to their pocketbooks. That is a speech for \nanother time.\n  ``Waste of the Week'' is simply an attempt, since we have not been \nable to address the larger issue, to look at documented examples, \nexposed by inspector generals, the Government Accountability Office, \nand other agencies of clear waste, fraud, and abuse that has used \ntaxpayers' dollars in an improper way. So this 45th edition now \nhighlights close to $170 billion, exceeding our goal of $100 billion \nconsiderably and with no end in sight.\n  We are debating last week and this week the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, critically important for our national security and \nto provide for the kinds of things our military needs to be an \neffective military. So I think it is appropriate to raise the issue \nthat no agency is sacrosanct. While I am a committed supporter of \nnational defense, while I served on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nfor a 10-year period of time in my former time in the Senate and I \nsupport much of what the military does, it is important that we point \nout that they are not sacrosanct from falling into the category of \nabuse, waste, or money that should have been better accounted for and \nspent. So I am taking this opportunity during this debate to point out \nthe fact that each agency of the Federal Government needs to be looked \nat, even those that we favor and want to support. Obviously, any penny, \ndime, nickel, dollar, or more saved from something that need not be \nspent is something that can help our soldiers be better trained and can \nhelp us have a stronger military. If not needed there, it can used to \noffset other programs\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\nwithin the Federal Government, or, most importantly, hopefully sent \nback to the taxpayer or reduced from the taxes that we take from the \ntaxpayer.\n  Today I want to talk about the acquisition process. The Department of \nDefense weapons acquisition system is the process by which DOD, or the \nDepartment of Defense, procures weapons systems or related items from \nvarious defense contractors. They include the design, development, \ndeployment, and disposal of weapons used by our military.\n  Since 1990, the Government Accountability Office has included the \nDepartment of Defense's weapons acquisition system on its annual High \nRisk List. Let me explain that. The High Risk List, which is put out \nevery two years by the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, lists \nspending that falls under the category of, frankly, ``Why are we \nspending this money in the first place?'' or ``Let's look at how we are \nspending this money and see if it can be spent in better and more \nefficient ways.'' It is looking at programs' vulnerabilities to waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  One of the biggest problems with the system is that frequently \nsignificant dollars are spent on weapons programs that end up never \nbeing completed. Between 2001 and 2011, the Department of Defense spent \n$46 billion on a dozen different weapons systems programs that were \nnever completed. Let me repeat that: $46 billion of money was spent on \nprograms, well intended, but never completed for various reasons. I \nwant to use just one example of that $46 billion category, and that is \na program that was initiated but was never finished and is an example \nof how taxpayers' money can be spent in significant amounts and with no \nresults.\n  It was clear that after 9/11 we ought to be looking at the \nPresidents' transportation. In this case, Marine One is the helicopter \nthe President uses when transferring to Andrews Air Force Base to climb \naboard Air Force One or is used overseas for special short trips. \nMarine One was deemed to be somewhat behind on its technological \ncapabilities, especially its communications and security capabilities. \nThe Department of Defense initiated an effort to build a new \nhelicopter; yet the requirements and engineering needed for this new \nhelicopter design were never finally fixed. As the process went forward \nand the money was being spent, new ideas and new technologies came into \nplay, and the thought was this: Well, let's add this here and change \nthat there and incorporate this into it. As a result, the original \nengineering that had been mapped out, the requirements, the design were \nnot followed. There were constant changes, constant pleas that we need \nto spend more money, we need to do more and more. On and on it went. \nWithout those fixed and agreed-on guidelines, the Department of Defense \ncontinued putting more add-ons over the years until, ultimately, the \nhelicopter became so weighted with so much new technology and security \nposition adjustments and so forth that the helicopter's mission \ncapability was compromised. As such, the program finally had to be \nscrapped in 2009, and the cost to the taxpayers was $3.7 billion--spent \nfor no purpose whatsoever. It was a good idea, a good intent, probably \nthe right thing to do, but without a sufficient acquisition system and \ndevelopment system, without an ability to say: Look, let's get this \nthing fixed in terms of what we want it to look like, what we want it \nto be, and let's go forward with it, and perhaps there are a few \nadjustments that we can make. But, certainly, it would be better to \nincorporate the new technologies at a rate that we thought we could \naccomplish within a limited amount of time, rather than simply \nongoing--2001, 2002, 2003, all the way to 2009--and finally say we are \nnever going to get there, ending up, as I have said, with $3.7 million \nof waste. That is just one example.\n  In the 2014 report, the Government Accountability Office found \nproblems like this have persisted within weapons acquisitions for \ndecades. GAO found that many defense programs are launched before \nofficials have enough information needed to determine whether the \nproposed program is even viable. Meaning, there is a mismatch between \nthe new defense system's wish list of all the things the DOD would like \nto have versus the current technology that would be able to provide \nwithin the current financial and time constraints for developing \nprograms. In turn, the program sometimes gets the green light to move \nforward with unrealistic costs and timetables, leading to increased \ncosts and development delays.\n  The Government Accountability Office and military experts have \nemphasized the need to increase DOD staff training on how to properly \nestimate project needs and technology capabilities before launching a \nproject. Now, we would think this would have been simple. We would \nthink this would be the guidelines from the very beginning: You don't \nstart a project until you estimate what the project needs and the \ntechnological capabilities and the capabilities of providing those \nneeds before you start. But there is a history within the Department of \nDefense--and, frankly, within policies of defense contractors--to get \nit started. Once it is started, they are not going to turn it back \ndown. History is replete with Department of Defense acquisitions that \nhave incorporated changes that, once started, you can't stop the thing. \nThen the narrative turns from this: Why are we doing this in the first \nplace, because we never fixed the requirements and fixed the cost and \nagreed not to go beyond that cost? It turns into this: Oh, well, we \nneed to spend more. We can't turn back now because otherwise we have \nwasted that money.\n  The Presidential helicopter is a perfect example. We are talking \nabout $3.7 billion. On and on it goes. I have just given one example.\n  I am pleased that Senator McCain and Senator Reed, the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, have \nacknowledged this. This National Defense Authorization Act of fiscal \nyear 2017 makes some very important reforms to the DOD acquisition \nprocess. They have taken note of this, and the committee has taken note \nof this. Before us now is this bill--the bill that sits on my desk and \non every desk here and that we are debating and adding amendments to \nand hopefully will finish this week. In this legislation we are \ndebating and talking about and hope to pass are a number of reform \nprocesses and reform legislation to help us address these problems. \nThis legislation would reform the current regulatory process and make \nit easier for companies to compete for DOD contracts in order to boost \ncompetition and lower costs. In addition, the bill would increase \ntraining--maybe this is the most important of all--for those at the \nDepartment of Defense who plan and oversee the acquisition process. It \nwill put greater emphasis on technological innovation, which could help \nsave money while spearheading new, cutting-edge defense systems. That \nis the goal. That is the goal we have outlined in this legislation and \nwhy we need to support this legislation. It is an example of how the \nSenate can tackle waste, fraud, and abuse right now, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support these proposals.\n  Having said that, let me add, as we do each week, $3.7 billion for \nfailed efforts to develop the new helicopter for the President, which \nbrings our total taxpayer price tag to nearly $176 billion--not small \nchange. Think what we could do with that if it was spent wisely or, \nmore importantly, if we didn't have to take it from the taxpayer in the \nfirst place.\n\n  Mr. President, having said that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                   Presidential Tax Transparency Act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the \nPresidential Tax Transparency Act--legislation that I have authored \nwith Senators Warren, Bennet, Kaine, Baldwin, and Boxer. The reason I \nproposed this legislation is that ever since Watergate, it has been \nroutine for Democratic and Republican Presidential nominees to release \ntheir tax returns. In effect, this has been the norm; this has been the \nstandard operating procedure for almost four decades. That is because \nthe American people expect transparency when it comes to a Presidential \ncandidate's actions and values.\n  They are running for the highest office in our land. They are running \nto be Commander in Chief for the most powerful Nation in the history of \nthe world. When transparency is the overwhelming expectation of the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\npeople regarding the Presidency, my view is it ought to be the law.\n  We are in the midst of a Presidential election. The nominating \nconventions are weeks away. One of the candidates who has become his \nparty's presumptive nominee has thus far refused to release his tax \nreturns. In my view, this is a clean break from decades of traditions \nin our elections. It is a rebuke of the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, including a majority of Republicans, who are demanding \nopenness and honesty from their Presidential candidates of both \npolitical parties on this issue.\n  The reason is that tax returns give the American people a lot of \nstraightforward, honest answers. It is not just about what rate you \npay; it is about whether you even pay taxes. Do you give to charity? \nAre you abusing loopholes at the expense of hard-working middle-class \nfamilies? Do you keep your money offshore?\n  The fact is the tax return shines a light on your financial \nintegrity. It will show if a person is trying to game the system, for \nexample, by having their company pay for personal vacations on a \nprivate jet. Certainly, that is something far removed from the reaches \nof most hard-working families.\n  My view has been that running for President is pretty much like a job \ninterview. Every candidate has to stand up before the public and show \nthat they have the temperament, the background, and the character to \nlead our wonderful country and be Commander in Chief. I believe that \nafter decades of tradition, releasing tax returns is a big part of the \nprocess.\n  When it comes to a candidate's financial background in taxes, I don't \nthink the public should have to take somebody's word for it or just \naccept the kind of boasting you see on some of these shows that get \nwide viewership. The public has a right to know the facts, and the \npublic has a right to know the truth.\n  The proposal that my colleagues and I have proposed is pretty simple. \nIt says that within 15 days of becoming the nominee at the party \nconventions, the candidates would be required to release at least 3 \nyears of tax returns. If a nominee stonewalls the law and refuses, then \nthe Treasury Secretary would share the returns with the Federal \nElection Commission, and that Commission would make them public online. \nThere would be an opportunity as well for redactions, which, in effect, \nare changes when appropriate.\n  When Presidents nominate individuals for Cabinet seats and executive \nbranch jobs within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee--the \nTreasury Secretary, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Social \nSecurity--those nominees all submit 3 years of tax returns for the \ncommittee to review. When there is a need and where it is appropriate, \ninformation from those returns is made public. Remember, that is the \nstandard for people who would serve under the President of the United \nStates. In my view, the Commander in Chief ought to be required to do \nbetter. The fact is, nominees have traditionally released a lot more \nthan 3 years. So probably it is a bit modest, and a number of people \nwho have looked at the proposal support what our colleagues and I are \ndoing, like the transparency, like the disclosure. A number of them \nhave said: You really ought to think about going further.\n  I think colleagues know that I probably have spent as much time here \nin the Senate as any colleague trying to promote ideas and policies and \nget beyond some of the partisanship that dominates these debates. I am \ntalking about candidates on both sides being required to meet this new \nbar. The same rules would apply to all nominees from both parties.\n  A word about this notion of requiring a Presidential nominee to do \nthis: I certainly wish that it weren't necessary to have a law \nrequiring this. That would be my first choice. The fact is, it \nshouldn't take a law because this has been the norm; this has been the \nexpectation.\n  This is how I came to believe that a law was necessary. You volunteer \nto run for President of our wonderful country. You are not required to \ndo it; you volunteer to do it. In my view, when you volunteer, there \nhas been this norm, and there has been this expectation. Since \nWatergate, almost 40 years, there has been this expectation that you \nwould make public your tax return. The failure to do so deviates from \nthe norm, deviates away from transparency and in favor of secrecy. So \nmy view is, when a candidate for President of the United States is not \nwilling to disclose their taxes voluntarily and deviates from the norm, \ndeviates from the understandable expectation the American people have, \nthen I think you need a law, and that is why I have proposed it.\n  For these four decades, the American people have been pretty clear: \nIf you are a major party's nominee to be the leader of the free world, \nyou do not get to hide your tax returns.\n  This is the first time I have discussed our proposal here on the \nfloor. I hope our colleagues will support the Presidential Tax \nTransparency Act, and I hope our colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwill agree that the American people deserve this guarantee of tax \ntransparency that I have described this afternoon.\n\n\n                   Recognizing Hermiston High School\n\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak briefly on one other matter that \nwas particularly striking last week when I was home. I am going to talk \nfor a few minutes about the wonderful work taking place at Hermiston \nHigh School in Eastern Oregon.\n  Last week, I had the honor of visiting the terrific Career and \nTechnical Education Program--the CTE Program--in Hermiston, and I had a \nchance to watch some very impressive students in action. One of the \nprograms I visited was the Columbia Basin Student Homebuilders Program \nthat got off the ground with a small amount of State financial \nassistance. The reason I wanted to discuss it this afternoon is, I \nthink this program that can be a model, not just for my State, but for \nthe Nation. Students enrolled in the homebuilders program work with \nlocal construction professionals to actually build houses for their \ncommunity. Under the supervision of a teacher, students learn all \nfacets of planning, designing, and building a new energy-efficient home \nwithin a budget.\n  During my visit, Liz, a star high school senior and a future \nengineer, gave me a tour of this year's home. It is nothing short of \ngorgeous. At the end of the school year, this beautiful, custom-\ndesigned home is going to be sold to a lucky family. Students are \ninvolved in every bit of the process--from planning and design, to the \nactual construction, to the marketing and sale of the house. Revenue \nfrom the sale of the home funds the next project, so the next round of \nstudents in the program get to participate with no future funding \nrequired.\n  Hermiston High School's career and technical education courses \ndemonstrate to students that their community leaders are committed to \nhelping them prepare for a successful life right out of high school. \nOne student I met, Hannah, told me about a recreation and tourism \nproject that involves starting a hospitality business. She is working \nto expand her line of cupcakes to meet customer demands.\n  I note that the Presiding Officer has a great interest, as I do, in \npromoting recreation. That is why I have introduced the RNR bill, the \nRecreation Not Red-Tape Act.\n  I was struck by Hannah's expertise.\n  I note that the Presiding Officer probably saw this last Sunday. The \nDenver Post had an extraordinary article describing recreation as the \neconomic engine of the future. I am not saying that just because they \nwere kind to the RNR bill, but they talked about the promise of \nrecreation and tourism, particularly for our part of the world.\n  I was so impressed with Hannah. I said: I am going to send you the \nRNR bill, and I would appreciate it if you and your colleagues would \nlook for additional ways to cut the red-tape and promote recreation and \ntourism in Oregon, and throughout the West, and support our existing \nand future businesses.\n  The fact is that too many of our students are not graduating high \nschool on time and far too many are unprepared for the workforce. \nResearch has shown that students enrolled in career and technical \neducation courses graduate from high school at a higher rate. In fact, \nthe students at Hermiston High School told me their homebuilders \nprogram made them want to show up for school.\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\n  I am committed to increasing graduation rates in Oregon and across \nthe country, and I think one of the best ways to do it is to support \nprograms like the one in Hermiston, because I think it is tailor-made \nto achieve this goal.\n  Funding for Perkins Career and Technical Education Act courses is a \nway to make sure that programs like the one I just saw at Hermiston can \nbe started around the country, but funding for these programs has been \ndecreasing since 1998. At the same time, there is bipartisan consensus \nthat career and technical education programs are important, not just \nfor kids who want to be homebuilders but for all students. It seems to \nme that in overhauling the failed policies of No Child Left Behind, the \nSenate made a choice to move away from the era of over-tested ``bubble \nkids'' and towards an era of well-rounded, multi-skilled high school \ngraduates. I am glad to see that the Senate HELP Committee is working \nhard on a proposal to reauthorize this career and technical education \nprogram, known as the Perkins Act. The last time it was reauthorized \nwas in 1998. So I am going to work closely with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to keep pushing for a new bill.\n  The fact is that the educators I saw last week are ambitious by any \nmeasure. They saw that their students were not graduating with the \nskills necessary to be successful in their future school and work \nlives. So the local educators started partnerships with local \narchitects, engineers, and other professionals. They created a unique \nprogram that blends innovative classroom instruction with real-world \napplication. We have businesses directly engaging with young people. \nNot only do they show what kinds of jobs are available in the \ncommunity, but they also prove that school is an important \nsteppingstone in preparing students for the real world.\n  I have been in public service for a while. It is such a tremendous \nhonor to represent Oregon in the Senate. But I will tell you, watching \nthe way a small community in eastern Oregon, Hermiston, has come \ntogether and made a commitment to their young people is special. It is \ntruly what we call the Oregon way.\n  I will close by way of saying that I am grateful to the school, \nHermiston High School, for allowing me to visit. I will do everything I \ncan to take the student homebuilder program that I saw last week and \nspread the word about what the potential is here. They already sold one \nhouse for a very healthy price, and I think we would be wise--again \nhere in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans--to come together and \nsupport career technical education programs like the ones I saw in \nHermiston and urge all of us here in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, \nto support Federal and State assistance for these kinds of programs, \ncareer and technical education programs, for even more students from \none end of our country to the other.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n      Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, for some time, including times on this \nfloor, I have said that the choice between a clean environment and a \nstrong economy is a false one. Some people say you can't have a clean \nenvironment and a strong economy at the same time. I just don't think \nthat is correct. TSCA is an acronym for Toxic Substances Control Act.\n  The TSCA reform legislation that we approved in this body last night \nis proof of the fact that we can have a cleaner, safer, and healthier \nenvironment and also have a strong economy. They go together, and \nmaybe, when I finish my remarks, folks will understand why that might \nbe true.\n  Every day in this country manufacturers use a variety of chemicals. I \nam told there are tens of thousands of chemicals on this planet. It is \nin the air, in the ground, in the water, and in our bodies. \nManufacturers use these chemicals to make everything from carpets--like \nthe carpet we are standing on--to cosmetics, water bottles, and dish \nwashing soap.\n  Former President Gerald Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act \nof 1976 and said it was landmark legislation. He said that this is huge \nlegislation in terms of protecting the environment and public health. \nHe said it was intended to give the EPA the authority to monitor, test, \nand regulate the chemicals that pose a risk to human health or the \nenvironment. That was the deal. Over the past four decades, since \nGerald Ford signed that legislation into law, the Toxic Substances \nControl Act has never worked as intended, leaving the public at risk \nfor toxic exposures and the private sector with a broken regulatory \nprocess that has undermined innovation. Frankly, it led to a lot of \nuncertainty and lack of predictability.\n  As a recovering Governor, I know that among the things we need in \norder to have a better and more nurturing environment for job creation \nand job preservation is to make certain that businesses, whether large \nor small, have predictability and certainty. When the Toxic Substances \nControl Act passed 40 years ago, it did not provide that predictability \nand certainty.\n  In fact, for the last 40 years, I think the EPA has fully vetted six \ntoxic substances. Imagine that--six in 40 years. In the last 20 to 25 \nyears, there were none. In the meantime, States have stood up and said: \nIf the Federal Government is not going to do it, we will do it. Now we \nhave a patchwork quilt of State requirements. We have businesses--not \njust chemical businesses but a wide variety of businesses--in this \ncountry that are trying to comply with laws in dozens of States, and \nthe Federal standard that we set 40 years ago just does not work.\n  For a while, the Toxic Substances Control Act has been broken. That \nis a polite way of saying it. Over the past 39 years, we have learned a \nlot more about toxic chemicals. We have learned about how they can \ncause harm to our environment. They can cause harm to public health, \nand we also learned how best to identify and protect against these \nrisks.\n  More than 3 years ago, two of my colleagues--one a Democrat, Tom \nUdall of New Mexico, and the other a Republican, Dave Vitter of \nLouisiana--wrote something called the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical \nSafety for the 21st Century Act. That is a mouthful, isn't it?\n  Frank R. Lautenberg was a Senator from New Jersey for many years, \nwhose birthday I remember to this day. He is now deceased, but his \nbirthday is January 23, and the reason why I know that is because that \nis when my birthday is. This is an issue we actually shared a strong \ninterest in doing something about.\n  My recollection--it is hard to remember when people move around from \ndesk to desk--is that his seat was back here behind where I am standing \ntoday.\n  My colleagues Tom Udall and David Vitter wrote a bill and named it \nafter Frank R. Lautenberg because this is an issue he cared a lot \nabout. He tried several times to write legislation that could be \nenacted to take the 40-year-old Toxic Substances Control Act from 1976 \nand bring it into the 21st century and help it become effective and \nmake sense for the digital age.\n  The bill written by Senators Udall and Vitter reforms the old Toxic \nSubstances Control Act, and it does it in ways to better protect the \npublic--to protect us, our families, our businesses, and so forth. It \nis also designed to create a more manageable regulatory framework for \nAmerican businesses and innovators so they have some predictability and \ncertainty with what they are dealing with. Whether they happen to be \ndoing business in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Wyoming, Idaho, or \nCalifornia, they would have some certainty as to what the rules of the \nroad were going to be for toxic substances or the chemicals they might \nbe using in their processes.\n  After the bill was introduced by Senators Vitter and Udall, I worked \nclosely with both of them for more than a year as a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. We led a number of meetings, \nhad many discussions, and we were always\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\nfocused on securing enhanced protections for public health and the \nenvironment while providing certainty and predictability for American \nbusinesses.\n  I focused especially on language to secure provisions that would \nprotect children, pregnant women, and workers from toxic risk. The \nprovisions I especially focused on included ensuring that the EPA had \naccess to information in order for them to assess safety risks.\n  A third area that I looked at was to enact something to allow States \nto enforce Federal toxic safety law. If the EPA wasn't doing its job, \ncould there be a State backstop in a way that made sense? I think that \nwas not an unreasonable thing to ask. We did that in Dodd-Frank with \nrespect to nationally chartered banks. If the Office of the Comptroller \nof the Currency in nationally chartered banks is not making sure \nconsumers are being looked after, then we allow State attorneys \ngeneral--not to write regulations or their own law but to enforce \nFederal standards and laws. I wanted to make sure that in the event \nthat someday we had an EPA that frankly wouldn't enforce a new version \nof the substance control act, then States could enforce it for them.\n  Chemical manufacturers and consumers alike deserve legal clarity, a \ntimely review process, and the ability to trust that products people \nuse every day are safe. I might add that when Senator Udall and Senator \nVitter started to introduce this legislation and started to gather \ncosponsors--I don't mean to be presumptuous, but my guess is the \nPresiding Officer probably ended up as a cosponsor. At the end of the \nday, we had 30 Democrats and 30 Republicans. The idea was to add a \nDemocrat, add a Republican, add a Democrat, add a Republican--a little \nbit of a look at how a bill is made or should be made. It is almost a \ntextbook example of how legislation could be formed or should be \nformed, even on a difficult and contentious issue like the one I am \ntalking about today.\n  I was involved at the very beginning in the initial efforts to \nrewrite the Toxic Substance Control Act. I was involved with David \nVitter and Tom Udall and also the chairman of the committee, Jim \nInhofe. But I got to a point where I said to the coauthors of the \nlegislation--they were looking for cosponsors, and I said: I will be \nwilling to cosponsor your version of the rewriting of the Toxic \nSubstance Control Act, but there are 10 changes that I would like to \nconsider making.\n  They said: What are they?\n  I said: Well, here they are.\n  And I gave them some idea of what they were. They asked me to put \nthem in writing, so I put them in writing in a letter to Senators \nVitter and Udall and said: These are the changes I would like to see \nmade in the bill you have introduced. If you will make these changes or \nagree to these changes, I will cosponsor your bill, and not only will I \ncosponsor your bill, but so will 10 or 11 other Democrats. We all \nsigned the letter. This was probably about a year and a half ago.\n  The letter was more to Senator Vitter than Senator Udall; I think it \nwent to both. But to his credit, Senator Vitter and his staff went \nthrough it piece by piece, proposal by proposal--all 10 of them. At the \nend of the day, they agreed essentially with all of them, and they said \nthat they would incorporate all 10 of the proposals in the bill. They \nsaid: Now will you cosponsor the bill?\n  And I said: Yes, I will. And so did the rest of us who signed the \nletter--all 10 of us.\n  When I said that I would cosponsor the bill, I also said there were \nthree areas that still needed some work. My passion for pushing for \nthis legislation will be tempered somewhat by your willingness to also \nact on subsequent changes in the bill in these three areas. I will not \ngo into those three areas, but I will say that later on, some of my \ncolleagues--Senators Cory Booker, Senator Whitehouse, Senator Jeff \nMerkley, and Senator Ed Markey--sort of stepped up and said: We are \ninterested in those three areas, and we want to see further changes \nmade in the bill.\n  With those changes, we added even more cosponsors, and finally we \nended up with 60. We said: Let's take that bill to the Senate. It \nreported out of committee and eventually worked through the Senate. It \nwas not easy, but we finally got it done. We went to conference with \nthe House, and, lo and behold, we passed a conference report \nunanimously last night by unanimous consent, and nobody objected. \nConsidering how controversial this bill has been for years, that is \namazing.\n  At a press conference we held today with the principal Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate, one of the House Members came over. Senator \nTom Udall talked about how he felt elated to be able to unanimously \npass a contentious bill after all these years. He likened it to \nstanding on a mountaintop. He is a mountain climber. In New Mexico they \nhave some tall mountains, and he said it was like standing on a \nmountain top. He said: I feel elation when I climb to the top of a tall \nmountain and stand atop the mountain. And he said this morning at the \npress conference that he felt elation as well.\n  Then, when I spoke after Senator Udall, I said that in Delaware we \ndon't have tall mountains. Delaware is the lowest lying State in \nAmerica. We really worry about climate change and sea levels rising. \nBesides that being some theory, it is something that we worry about. So \nthe highest part of land in Delaware is a bridge. Every now and again, \nif I want to go up high and climb something, I can climb the bridge, \nbut it is not really that high.\n  The thing that gave me elation in Delaware when I was Governor--and \nbefore that the State treasurer and all--was when we all worked \ntogether. Delaware has a tradition; we call it the Delaware way. It is \nwhere Democrats and Republicans work together, set aside partisan \ndifferences, and just ask: What is the right thing to do?\n  Delaware is a small State. We can get pretty much the key \nstakeholders in a room and work out a lot of our differences within a \ncouple of hours. It is pretty amazing how it works sometimes.\n  I share with my colleagues today an African proverb. The Presiding \nOfficer has probably heard this before, and he has probably used this \none before. It goes something like this: ``If you want to travel fast, \ngo alone. If you want to travel far, go together.''\n  Let me say that again. ``If you want to travel fast, go alone. If you \nwant to travel far, go together.''\n  That is especially true in the Senate. In order to get anything of \nany consequence done, you need 60 votes. We are at about 55 \nRepublicans, and roughly there are about 45 Democrats with maybe an \nIndependent in there somewhere. So we have to figure out how to travel \ntogether.\n  We have been traveling a long way over the last 4 years or so, but we \nfinally got to our destination, and I think we finally came to a good \noutcome in terms of the policy we have adopted. For the first time, the \nlegislation that has been agreed to by the House and Senate and will be \nsent to the President will require that every product used in consumer \nproducts will be assessed for safety.\n  Let me say that again. Every chemical used in consumer products will \nbe assessed for safety. At the same time, our legislation will offer \nbusinesses a predictable and manageable regulatory framework--not a \nwhole bunch of different regulatory frameworks, but one--for chemicals \nthat do not pose a safety hazard.\n  As I said, we have been struggling and negotiating this bill in the \nSenate for a long time--maybe as much as a half dozen years. There has \nbeen a lot of give and take on both sides of the aisle to get to where \nwe are last night and today. We are where we are today because both \nsides worked together to compromise on policies without compromising on \nour principles.\n  I mentioned that Frank Lautenberg used to sit at one of these desks \nbehind me, and so did Ted Kennedy. I will never forget going and having \na lunch with him when I was fairly new in the Senate. I wasn't sure \nthat we had the kind of interpersonal relationship that I wanted, and \nas the Presiding Officer knows, this place works a lot on \nrelationships.\n  I said to him: Maybe someday I can come to your office and just sit \nand talk with you for a while and have a cup of coffee.\n  He said: Why don't you come to my hideaway, and we will have lunch \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\n  I said: Really?\n  He said: Yes.\n  After about a week or two, we went to his hideaway, and we had lunch \ntogether. His hideaway was an amazing place. It was almost like a \nmuseum in terms of all the things about the Kennedy family and his \nbrothers and his own life.\n  Among the things we talked about that day was his ability to find \ncompromise and consensus with one of our current colleagues, a guy \nnamed Mike Enzi--a wonderful guy named Mike Enzi who the Presiding \nOfficer knows is one of two Senators from Wyoming, a former mayor of \nGillette, an accountant--I think maybe a CPA. When I was presiding over \nthe Senate years ago, I remember Mike Enzi coming to the floor of the \nSenate and speaking about the 80-20 rule and how the 80-20 rule allowed \nthe folks in a committee he served on as the senior Republican called \nthe HELP Committee, or the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee--Ted Kennedy was the senior Democrat on that committee. It \nwas an incredibly productive committee. There were all kinds of \nbipartisan legislation coming out of it.\n  Later on that day I asked Senator Enzi off the floor: How do you and \nTed Kennedy manage to get so much done in the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pension Committee? How do you do that?\n  He said: It is the 80-20 rule.\n  I said: What's that?\n  He said: Ted Kennedy and I agree on about 80 percent of this stuff, \nand we disagree on the other 20 percent. What we do is we focus on the \n80 percent where we agree, and we set aside the other 20 percent to \nanother day and we will figure that out some other time.\n  When I talked to Ted Kennedy about the same thing, he said: I am \nalways willing to compromise on policy, process, but I just don't want \nto compromise on my principles. He and Mike Enzi managed to have an \nincredibly productive partnership on that committee and here in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Kennedy had a similar relationship with Orrin Hatch, who now \nchairs the Finance Committee, as we know.\n  But we are where we are today because both Democrats and Republicans \nhave worked together to compromise on policy without having to \ncompromise our principles. The final product is a testament to a robust \nand a transparent committee process. I think it is a textbook example \nof how we ought to legislate around here. If we can get something that \ndifficult, that complex, and that controversial behind us in an \nappropriate way and get support from environmental groups, business \ngroups, Democrats and Republicans, maybe there are some other things we \ncan get done, and God knows we need to.\n  I am proud of the work we have done together to reach this historic \nagreement. In addition to thanking Senator Udall, Senator Vitter, and \nthe chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nInhofe, I also want to say a special thank-you to the members of our \nstaff. I think those of us who serve or are privileged to work here as \nSenators work hard, but on this issue--and some of us worked hard on \nthis issue, but the folks who really worked hard on this issue are the \nmembers of our staff. I will not go through the names of all the folks \nwho worked with this Senator and that Senator, but I just want to say \nto those of you who know who you are, thank you. You have done great \nwork, and you have enabled us to do the people's work.\n  I would say to a fellow who was a member of my staff for the last \nmaybe 3 years and who worked day and night on this legislation--a \nfellow named Colin Peppard who now works for the Los Angeles County \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority out on the west coast--a special \nshout out to him and a special thank-you to him for all his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I think that is pretty much it for me today. It looks \nas though the Senator from Minnesota is here and has a hungry look on \nhis face. He hungers to share something with all of us.\n  With that having been said, I will yield the floor to Senator Franken \nof Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank my good friend from Delaware.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Merrick Garland\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address the nomination of Chief Judge \nMerrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court. Today marks 84 days since \nPresident Obama nominated Judge Garland to fill the vacant seat on the \nSupreme Court bench. In that time the consequences of permitting that \nvacancy to persist have become clear. The eight-member Court has now \ndeadlocked four times, and in two cases where the Court found itself \nevenly divided and unable to reach consensus it punted, sending cases \nback to the lower courts.\n  There is no denying that the Senate's refusal to do its job, to take \nup the business of filling that vacancy, means that in some cases the \nCourt is not able to fulfill its core function, meaning in some cases \nthe Court does not resolve circuit splits and cannot serve as the final \narbiter of the law. That is not just my view, that is an opinion shared \nby one of the Court's current members, Associate Justice Anthony \nKennedy. Testifying before the House Appropriations Committee back in \n2013, Justice Kennedy described what happens when the Court is short-\nstaffed. Although he is discussing the effect of recusals on the \nability of the Court to do its job, his comments are no less relevant \nin the case of vacancies. This is what Justice Kennedy said: ``On our \nCourt, if we recuse without absolutely finding it necessary to do so, \nthen you might have a 4-4 Court, and everybody's time is wasted.''\n\n  Let me say that again. ``Everybody's time is wasted.'' Well, my \nRepublican colleagues don't seem to be bothered by wasting everybody's \ntime.\n  Mr. President, 116 days ago, less than an hour after the news of \nJustice Scalia's death, the majority leader proclaimed that the Senate \nwould not consider a replacement until after the Presidential election \nand said that ``the American people should have a voice in the \nselection of their next Supreme Court Justice.''\n  In the 116 days since the majority leader made that bold \nannouncement, Republican Senator after Republican Senator has taken to \nthe Senate floor to deliver variations on that theme. My good friend \nSenator Cornyn helpfully explained that Senate Republicans had made a \ndecision to ``give the voters a voice on who makes the next lifetime \nappointment to the Supreme Court.'' He said, ``I want to be clear that \nthe American people do deserve a voice here and we will make sure that \nthey are heard.''\n  We have been through this before. We agree. The American people \nshould have a voice in this process. They did. They elected Barack \nObama to be President of the United States. By my read of the \nConstitution--article II, section 1, to be exact--the President shall \n``hold his office during the term of 4 years''--a term which has not \nyet expired.\n  It seems clear to me that in the text of our founding documents, our \ndemocracy was designed to ensure that its citizens have a voice in this \nprocess. President Ronald Reagan made this point quite eloquently when \nhe presided over the swearing in of not just William Rehnquist as Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court but also one Antonin Scalia as Associate \nJustice. President Reagan explained that ``the Founding Fathers \nrecognized that the Constitution is the supreme and ultimate expression \nof the will of the American people.'' Of course, President Reagan was \nright. The Founding Fathers recognized that the very purpose of the \nConstitution was to embody the spirit and the voice of the American \npeople.\n  I find it preposterous when my Republican colleagues, who purport to \nrevere the Constitution and the Framer's original intent, insist that \nthe only way to guarantee that the people's voice is heard is to delay \nfilling the vacancy, because, after all, the Founding Fathers did not \njust contemplate such a situation, they actually experienced it.\n  When President John Adams--himself a Founding Father and a drafter of \nthe Declaration of Independence--was presented with the opportunity to \nappoint a Supreme Court Justice, he himself was a lameduck President. \nThe Chief Justice at the time, Oliver Ellsworth, resigned after the \n1800 Presidential election--an election that\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nPresident Adams lost. Nevertheless, Adams set about the work of \nselecting a replacement. When he eventually nominated John Marshall in \nJanuary of 1801, more than 2 months after losing the election to a \nPresident of a different party--and the country still did not know who \nthat would be because Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr had tied, but \nthey were not his political party. Despite an unresolved election and \nin the face of great uncertainty, Adams nominated Justice Marshall, and \nthe Senate took up John Marshall's nomination and confirmed him to the \npost of Chief Justice on January 27, 1801, by voice vote.\n  John Adams was by every definition of the term a lameduck President. \nThe Senate could have refused to fill the vacancy. They could have left \nthe Supreme Court short-staffed. Senators could have insisted that the \nseat not be filled until it was clear just exactly whom the American \npeople had selected as their next President. But the Senate recognized \nthat it had a constitutional obligation to confirm a replacement. That \nshould come as no surprise because of the 32 Senators serving in the \nSixth Congress, 5 of them had been delegates to the Constitutional \nConvention: Abraham Baldwin of Georgia; Jonathan Dayton of New Jersey; \nJohn Langdon of New Hampshire; Gouverneur Morris of New York, whose \nfirst name was Gouverneur, but he wasn't a Governor; his mother's \nmaiden name was Gouverneur; and Charles Pinckney of South Carolina. All \nof them are real Founding Fathers. If anyone should have known what the \nConstitution required in this situation, it was they.\n  Now, picture them milling about the floor of the Old Senate Chamber \non January 27, 1801, talking amongst themselves and their colleagues \nand whipping votes. At the time, the Senate's practice was to consider \nnominations in an executive session with the doors closed. Only \nSenators and certain staff were allowed in the Chamber and the \nproceedings were intended to be secret, so the Congressional Record \ncontains no debate on John Marshall's nomination. We can only imagine \nwhat Senators said, but I suspect it went something like this:\n  Well, John, Abraham, Gouverneur, I suppose we should vote now on the \nPresident's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  Why, yes, Jonathan, of course. I remember when we wrote into the \nConstitution that when a vacancies occurs, the President shall appoint \na nominee to fill the vacancy and we Senators shall provided our advice \nand consent.\n  Yes, John, I recall the day we wrote that. You were in a particularly \ngood mood because your wife Betsy had arrived by carriage the night \nbefore from New Hampshire.\n  Yes, Abraham, I recall that well. After all, it was only 13 years \nago, and the next day we wrote the provisions about the Supreme Court. \nI remember very well how specific we were. The President appoints a \nnominee in the event of a vacancy and we in the Senate do our job by \nproviding advice and consent. So by all means, let's vote.\n  These men, these Founding Fathers set aside whatever reservations \nthey may have had about the unique circumstances surrounding John \nMarshall's nomination and a lameduck President of a different party \nthan the party that won the Presidential election. They allowed the \nSenate to hold a vote. These are the Founding Fathers who wrote the \nConstitution. As a consequence, John Marshall went on to serve as our \nNation's fourth Chief Justice, authoring opinions that make up the \nfoundation of constitutional law. It was obvious to those Founding \nFathers in the Senate, as it should be to all of us serving here today, \nthat the Supreme Court is too important, too central to our democracy \nto ignore.\n  I urge my colleagues--particularly those motivated by a fidelity to \nthe Framers' original intent--to end their obstruction and grant the \nPresident's nominee full and fair consideration.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 4251. I \nhave filed the amendment; I have not yet requested it to be made \npending. I would like to see this amendment move through. It seeks to \nremove the President's authority to deny troops their mandated pay \nraise.\n  The issue of paying our troops should not be a partisan issue any \nlonger. We have fought this battle for too many years on the Senate \nfloor. This year I put forth a bipartisan solution with my colleague \nfrom Montana, Jon Tester, and with Senators Rubio, Portman, and \nBoozman. It is a long-term solution.\n  Since 2004, the President has been required by law to give troops a \npay raise matching the Employment Cost Index, also called the ECI, but \nwhen we mandated that the President raise troop pay with the ECI, we \ngave the ability for an exemption; that is, when the country is facing \nserious economic conditions or for matters of national security.\n  Now, citing economic conditions, the President has used this \nexemption the past 3 years and he used it again this year--all while \nciting a growing economy. What happens is our troops are not getting \nthe pay raise that Congress says they should, matching the ECI. When we \nare facing economic uncertainty, that is when our troops need it the \nmost.\n  The amendment is very clear cut. It removes the President's authority \nand future Presidents' authority to cite economic concerns when sending \nover a Presidential budget request without the mandated pay raise. It \nis clear that this exemption is being abused. For example, in 2016, in \nhis State of the Union Address, President Obama said that ``anyone \nclaiming that America's economy is in decline is peddling fiction.'' \nBut just 1 month later, in his fiscal year 2017 budget request he sent \nto Congress, President Obama cited ``economic concerns affecting the \ngeneral welfare'' and only asked for a 1.6-percent pay raise for our \ntroops, despite the ECI being 2.1 percent.\n  As we continue to debate this bill and call up amendments, I urge my \ncolleagues to support amendment 4251. Again, we have good bipartisan \nsupport on it. This is a long-term solution. This is not just about the \ncurrent President, this is about future Presidents as well and the \nproblems we continue to face; that is, our troops have not seen a pay \nraise over 2 percent in the past 6 years. As our Nation continues to \nfind itself threatened abroad, we rely on our troops now more than \never. They deserve better. It is time to act.\n  I thank Senator Tester, Senator Rubio, Senator Portman, and Senator \nBoozman for their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of an \namendment offered by the senior Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, to \nstrike the changes to the basic allowance for housing, or BAH, that are \nproposed in section 604 of the Defense authorization bill. This \namendment is very similar to one I filed this year as well as one I \nsponsored last year.\n  Currently, each servicemember receives a housing stipend based on his \nor her rank, geographic location, and dependency status. Under section \n604, however, this part of the military compensation package would no \nlonger be considered a cash allowance. Instead, servicemembers would be \ncompensated on an actual cost basis similar to the system that was in \nplace in the 1990s, which resulted in a burdensome and inefficient \nadministrative approval process.\n  Notably, the 2015 Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization \nCommission established by the fiscal year 2013 National Defense \nAuthorization Act examined the issue of allowances as it assessed the \nmilitary's compensation and retirement system. The Commission found \nthat the current allowance system strikes an appropriate balance in \nproviding compensation to military members and assistance for their \nliving expenses. The Commission deliberately chose not to recommend any \nchanges to the allowance system, and this view is shared by the \nDepartment of Defense. In fact, the Secretary of the Navy called me \ntoday to express to his concerns about this provision.\n\n  In its Statement of Administration Policy, the administration notes \nthat it strongly objects to section 604, which, in its words, ``would \ninappropriately penalize some servicemembers over others by linking \ntheir BAH payments to their status as members of dual-military \ncouples''--in other\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\nwords, members of our military who are married to other servicemembers. \nUnder section 604, both members of a dual military couple would be \nprovided a lesser compensation package than other members of equal \ngrade, sending a message that their service is not as highly valued.\n  The Statement Of Administration Policy went on to note that ``Section \n604 would disproportionately affect female servicemembers and those \nmilitary families in which both military members have chosen to serve \ntheir country.'' Twenty percent of servicewomen are married to other \nservicemembers. By comparison, only 3.8 percent--in other words, less \nthan 4 percent of Active-Duty men--are married to other servicemembers. \nThus, women are five times more likely to be affected by this reduction \nin housing allowances than their male counterparts--five times more \nlikely for the women servicemembers to be affected because they are \nmore likely to be married to servicemembers.\n  This proposed change would similarly penalize our junior \nservicemembers who are more likely to live with another servicemember \nas a roommate to help defray the cost-of-living expenses. As such, this \nprovision could have a profound implication for both recruitment and \nretention of our all-volunteer force and discourage our best and our \nbrightest from staying in the service.\n  I do recognize that the Department's personnel costs are a budget \nconcern, but finding savings that unfairly single out some military \nmembers is not the way to do it, particularly when one considers the \ngrowing role women servicemembers are playing and which I strongly \nsupport and admire.\n  Last year I spearheaded a successful movement to remove a similar \nprovision from the fiscal year 2016 NDAA. I am disappointed to see that \nthis proposal has resurfaced again this year. I am pleased to work with \nmy colleague from Alaska Senator Murkowski to remove a provision that I \nbelieve is both unfair and harmful.\n  I do recognize the very difficult task the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee had in putting together this bill. I commend both the \nchairman, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Jack Reed, \nfor their terrific work on so many issues. I do hope they will look \nagain at this particular cut in the basic housing allowance and support \nour amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Billy Lawless\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we all know the Senate of the United \nStates is composed of two Senators from each State. Today I have news. \nMy home State of Illinois just picked up a third senator.\n  Last month, the Irish Prime Minister--Taoiseach--Enda Kenny, \nannounced eight appointees to the Irish Senate. One of the appointees \nis my dear friend in Chicago, Billy Lawless.\n  Billy is the first Irish citizen living in the United States to be \nappointed to the Irish Senate. This is truly historic. Today Billy \ntakes a seat in the Irish Senate. Ireland will get a senator who will \nfight for the disenfranchised, the dispossessed, and those yearning to \nwork hard for a better life.\n  No one has been a stronger voice and advocate for the Irish diaspora \nand immigration reform than Billy Lawless of Chicago, IL. Prime \nMinister Kenny couldn't have made a better choice.\n  For generations, sons and daughters of the Emerald Isle have landed \non our shores in search of the American dream. Billy Lawless is no \ndifferent. As a young boy, he grew up on a dairy farm in Galway, a city \nin western Ireland, delivering unpasteurized milk to local restaurants \nand hotels.\n  As an adult, he made a name for himself as a prominent businessman in \nGalway. He ran several pubs, restaurants, and hotels. Life was good, \nbut for years he had always had a dream of opening a restaurant in the \nUnited States. When his youngest daughter earned a full college \nscholarship in the United States, Billy took that as a sign from \nHeaven. He moved his family to America. After 48 years in Galway, he \nwanted to see if he could succeed in the United States and he \npersonally could live the American dream.\n  He first went to Boston and Philadelphia, but on December 31, 1997, \nNew Year's Eve, a historic day, Billy Lawless arrived in Chicago and \nknew he had found a home. From Galway, that most Irish of Irish cities, \nto Chicago, the most Irish of American cities, it was a perfect \ntransition.\n  Within 6 months, Billy opened an establishment known as Irish Oak, \njust a couple blocks south of Wrigley Field. Today he owns four \nrestaurants and a fifth one is about to open. All the Lawless \nrestaurants are known for three things--great food, great fun, and \ngreat people.\n  Simply put, the Lawless family is restaurant royalty in Chicago. The \nfamily business started with 10 employees. Now they have 300. Since \narriving in Chicago nearly 20 years ago, Billy has brought new energy \nto the city--Irish energy--hard work, and a stubborn drive to succeed. \nWith the great help of his great wife Anne and his four children--\nBilly, Jr., Amy, John Paul, and Clodagh--Billy achieved the American \ndream.\n  Billy could have said: I have achieved my American dream. Good luck \nwith yours.\n  That is not who he is. After all, Billy is Irish. He looks out for \nhis friends and neighbors.\n  The first bar Billy opened, the Irish Oak, became a favorite for \nIrish construction workers. Many of them were undocumented and asked \nfor Billy's help in getting their papers in order. Billy never \nhesitated. He became their champion and a strong defender of Irish \nimmigrants everywhere. When asked why he took such an interest in the \nissue, he said: ``That's what we Irish do for each other.'' But he \ndidn't stop there. When he learned that those same problems were shared \nby others, Billy became an eloquent and forceful advocate for all \nimmigrants.\n  Billy Lawless gets it. He understands that protecting immigrants' \nrights is part of the strength of our immigrant Nation. I know he will \ncontinue to be an energetic and compassionate guardian of the Irish \ndiaspora and all immigrants' rights from his seat in the Irish Senate.\n  The United States and Ireland have long and proud histories, forged \nin the fires of a proud and rebellious spirit and united in friendship. \nHaving Billy Lawless's unique and authentic voice in the Irish Senate \nwill only strengthen our countries here and abroad. He represents the \nvery best of the both the Irish and American spirit.\n  It was only 2 years ago that I came to the Senate floor to \ncongratulate Billy and his wife Anne on becoming citizens of the United \nStates. They had waited a long time, and they had worked hard for it. I \nwas proud to call them not just my friends but my fellow Americans. \nToday I am proud to call Billy Lawless my fellow Senator.\n  Congratulations on a well-deserved honor.\n\n\n                 Independence of our Federal Judiciary\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to address an issue of serious constitutional \ngravity. I rise to address the latest in a long line of appalling and \ninsulting remarks made by the Republican Party's presumptive \nPresidential nominee.\n  Last week Donald Trump attacked the ethnicity of U.S. district court \njudge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over a civil fraud lawsuit \nagainst Trump's so-called university.\n  Mr. Trump referred to Judge Curiel's heritage in a lengthy tirade \nabout the judge's ruling in the case. He also called Judge Curiel a \n``hater'' and ``a total disgrace,'' suggesting that the judge should \nrecuse himself due to his ``negative'' rulings.\n  When pressed on the issue, Mr. Trump doubled down. In an interview \nwith the Wall Street Journal published last Thursday, Mr. Trump stated \nthat Judge Curiel had ``an absolute conflict'' in presiding over the \nlawsuit because the judge is of ``Mexican heritage.''\n  Mr. Trump went on to explain that the judge's ethnicity presents an \n``inherent conflict of interest'' because of Mr. Trump's campaign \npledge to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.\n  Let me be clear. Mr. Trump's attacks on Judge Curiel have been \ncharacterized--even by Republican Senators and Congressmen--as racist, \ninappropriate, and completely unfounded.\n  Judge Curiel is an American. He was born in East Chicago, IN, just \nsteps\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\naway from the border with my State. His parents had emigrated from \nMexico to the United States.\n  He has a distinguished record. After attending law school at Indiana \nUniversity, Judge Curiel practiced law in Indiana and California. In \n1989, he joined the U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of \nCalifornia.\n  As a Federal prosecutor, Judge Curiel served in the Narcotics \nEnforcement Division and worked to bring down drug cartels. After \nprosecuting a major cartel, he received a death threat and was forced \nto live under guard for months.\n  In 2007, he was appointed by a Republican Governor in California to \nserve as a State judge. President Obama later nominated Judge Curiel to \nthe Federal bench. The Senate confirmed his nomination by a unanimous \nvote on September 22, 2012.\n  Judge Curiel is well respected in the legal community. A former \ncolleague recently said: ``His integrity is beyond reproach.'' And a \nCalifornia attorney who led the screening committee that reviewed Judge \nCuriel in 2011 said:\n\n       He was very highly recommended. No one could say a bad \n     thing about him.\n\n  Despite these accomplishments, Donald Trump views Judge Curiel as \nincapable of serving as an impartial jurist in this case involving \nTrump University due to the judge's ethnicity. Mr. Trump believes the \nlawsuit that Judge Curiel is presiding over should have been dismissed \nlong ago. Maybe Mr. Trump should take a closer look at reality.\n  Multiple lawsuits have been filed against Mr. Trump's so-called \nuniversity, and in one of the two lawsuits that Judge Curiel is \npresiding over, former students allege that Mr. Trump and Trump \nUniversity defrauded them by making misrepresentations about the \neducation they would receive.\n  The plaintiffs provided evidence to support their claims and, as a \nresult, Judge Curiel denied a motion from Mr. Trump to grant summary \njudgment in his favor, which would have avoided a trial. Nothing in \nthis ruling suggests a lack of impartiality. Instead, Judge Curiel's \nrulings indicate that a factual dispute exists in the case and the \nplaintiffs deserve their day in court.\n  Unfortunately, reality and the facts don't seem to matter to Mr. \nTrump. Instead of acknowledging the inappropriateness of his attacks on \nJudge Curiel's character and heritage, he has doubled down on them. Mr. \nTrump apparently believes that after he bullies and demeans a group of \npeople, he should never have to face a member of that community in a \ncourtroom.\n  One of Mr. Trump's most reprehensible statements--and there are \nmany--calls for a total and complete ban on Muslim immigrants coming to \nthe United States of America. In an interview that aired on ``Face the \nNation'' on Sunday, Mr. Trump was asked:\n\n       If it were a Muslim judge, would you also feel like they \n     wouldn't be able to treat you fairly because of that policy \n     of yours?\n\n  He responded:\n\n       It's possible, yes. Yeah. That would be possible, \n     absolutely.\n\n  Where does Mr. Trump's twisted logic end? Does his crude attack on a \ndisabled reporter present a conflict of interest for a judge with a \ndisability who presides over a case against him? Do his disparaging \nremarks about women disqualify female judges from ruling on lawsuits \nfiled against his failed business ventures?\n  Mr. Trump's assertions are not only bigoted, they also endanger the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary as he aspires to the highest \noffice in the land. Despite those concerns, Senate Republicans are \nkeeping 89 Federal judicial seats vacant, including an empty seat on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, in the hopes that Donald Trump will be able to \nfill those vacancies.\n\n  After Mr. Trump's racist diatribes, I would like to ask my colleagues \nhow they can possibly trust Mr. Trump to appoint judges to the Federal \nbench. Are they comfortable with a potential President who apparently \nbelieves that the only qualified candidates for Federal judgeships are \nthose who possess racial, religious, or other characteristics that he \nhas not yet disparaged?\n  Trusting Donald Trump to fill judgeships in our Nation's Federal \ncourtrooms is a risky and constitutionally dangerous bet. Placing that \ntrust in Trump would threaten grave harm to our system of justice and \nto our rule of law.\n  I thought--or had hoped--that we had moved past the dark time in our \nNation's history when defendants believed it was appropriate to try to \nremove judges from a lawsuit on the basis of race. It was just over 40 \nyears ago that an African-American Federal judge named A. Leon \nHigginbotham, Jr. presided over a class action lawsuit involving civil \nrights claims.\n  The defendants in the lawsuit filed motions to disqualify Judge \nHigginbotham from the case based on his race. In his opinion denying \ntheir motions, Judge Higginbotham wrote the following:\n\n       It would be a tragic day for the nation and the judiciary \n     if a myopic vision of the judge's role should prevail, a \n     vision that required judges to refrain from participating in \n     their churches, in their non-political community affairs, in \n     their universities. So long as Jewish judges preside over \n     matters where Jewish and Gentile litigants disagree; so long \n     as Protestant judges preside over matters where Protestant \n     and Catholic litigants disagree; so long as White judges \n     preside over matters where White and Black litigants \n     disagree, I will preside over matters where Black and White \n     litigants disagree.\n\n  In light of Mr. Trump's reprehensible remarks, Judge Higginbotham's \nwords have taken on a renewed resonance. If Mr. Trump's myopic vision \nfor the Federal judiciary prevails, it will indeed be a tragic day for \nthe Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Georgia would yield for \nme to make a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized following the remarks of the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, be allowed to follow \nthe Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Veterans First Act\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, last week, the Attorney General of the \nUnited States sent a letter to Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader of \nthe House, to inform Mr. McCarthy and all of us, that she would not \ndefend the administration on the constitutional challenge to the firing \nof Sharon Helman, the director of the Arizona hospital of the Veterans' \nAdministration.\n  The firing took place because Ms. Helman had manipulated the books \nand overseen the manipulation of appointments to the point where as \nmany as 40 veterans waiting in line to get their first appointment died \nbefore they were ever seen by the VA. She was convicted by a court of \nlaw for taking illegal gratuities in her position as director of the \nhospital.\n  Ms. Helman filed a constitutional challenge as to whether we had the \nability in the administration to fire her constitutionally, and Loretta \nLynch has said she is not going to defend the United States or the law \nwe passed, called the Veterans Accountability and Choice Act, which \ncalls for the firing of employees by the Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration for cause.\n  Today, in Phoenix, AZ, it was announced that the Veterans' \nAdministration is firing three more employees of the Veterans' \nAdministration hospital. Yet, in the shadow of that, Loretta Lynch is \ntelling America she will not defend the country on the carrying out of \nthe laws we pass in this country, in this body, and that the President \nof the United States has signed.\n  There is a solution to this problem, Mr. President. It is called the \nVeterans First Act, which was written originally by 19 members of the \nSenate--all members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It has been \nsigned and cosponsored by 43 other Members of the Senate and once and \nfor all ends the hide-and-go-seek that takes place at the Veterans' \nAdministration. It takes the Veterans' Administration out from\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\nunder the Merit Systems Protection Board for all senior executive \nleadership. In other words, the 434 senior executives in the Veterans' \nAdministration now protected by the Merit Systems Protection Board no \nlonger would be protected by that Board but instead would be subject to \nthe Secretary's firing or the Secretary's hiring. Any appeal for \nactions taken on behalf of the Secretary will be to the Secretary, not \nto the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n  The American people and the brave veterans who have fought and \nsacrificed for this country deserve the right to know that if they are \ninjured by the Veterans' Administration or if the Veterans' \nAdministration is not carrying out what it is supposed to do for them, \nwe will take action, and we will be effective.\n  I resent the fact that the Attorney General of the United States has \nchosen not to defend a constitutional challenge to our authority, which \nthis Congress passed and our President signed to give that authority to \nSecretary Bob McDonald and whoever would follow him as Secretary of the \nVA.\n  But that is not the only thing in the Veterans First Act. For the \nfirst time ever, we are going to give caregiver benefits to Vietnam-era \nveterans--22,500 handicapped veterans--who today can't get the same \nbenefits that post-9/11 vets can get. That is wrong, and we are taking \ncare of that.\n  We are dealing with the opioid problem that started at the Tomah \nhospital in Wisconsin. We are correcting that and putting in good \nstandards for the use of opioids and the prescription of opioids and \ntherapies to get people off opioids.\n  We are cleaning up the mental health access situation to improve \nmental health access for all our veterans. We are giving the type of \ndiscipline to the leaders of the Veterans' Administration to see to it \nthat our hospitals are run like they should be, our veterans get the \nservices they deserve, and we give to our veterans who return home \nafter fighting for us the best quality health care and the most \nresponsive health care system we can possibly provide.\n  I urge the Presiding Officer and the other Members of the Senate to \njoin with me when our bill comes to the floor and to pass the Veterans \nFirst Act. It brings about real accountability in the Veterans' \nAdministration, real choice for our veterans, and real care for our \nVietnam veterans. It addresses the opioid problem and once and for all \nprovides for a comprehensive reform for the Veterans' Administration, \nwhich hasn't taken place in decades and decades.\n  I commend the members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for their \nleadership. I thank the Presiding Officer for the time, and I yield to \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4549\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator McCain, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, believes that $602 billion is not enough for the \nDepartment of Defense. Rather than reject unnecessary spending for \nweapons and other programs the Pentagon says it does not want or need, \nthe Senator from Arizona not only says we should fund them, he also \nproposes to spend another $18 billion on defense.\n  I will leave it to others to defend or contest the assumptions on \nwhich Senator McCain's amendment is based. But I do want to speak \nbriefly in support of the second degree amendment offered by the \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Because if there is one thing we have learned over and over, it is \nthat protecting U.S. national security is not only about a strong \nmilitary that can respond when all other options fail. It is also about \nhomeland security, including border control and maintaining critical \ninfrastructure. It is about law enforcement within the United States. \nIt is about cyber security. It is about educating the next generation \nof Americans and creating jobs that lead to advancements in science and \ntechnology. And it is about strengthening the capabilities of foreign \npartners and acting as a leader in international diplomatic efforts to \nprevent and respond to threats to global security.\n  The fiscal year 2017 budget allocation for the Department of State \nand foreign operations is $591 million below fiscal year 2016. That, \ncoupled with the fact that the President's budget underfunds programs \nfor refugees and other victims of disasters by $1 billion, presents us \nwith an untenable budgetary situation. The amendment offered by the \nSenator from Rhode Island would help to alleviate this shortfall.\n  While there are many foreign crises, Senator Reed's amendment focuses \non one area where the situation is particularly dire. It authorizes \n$1.9 billion to support the Department of State and U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development to implement their portions of the Integrated \nCampaign Plan to Counter ISIL. The funds would also support embassy \nsecurity, as well as additional assistance for Israel, and for Jordan \nand Lebanon which have been severely impacted by the influx of hundreds \nof thousands of Syrian refugees.\n  This is directly related to U.S. security interests in the Middle \nEast at a time when the stability of the entire region is under threat.\n  In a June 2 piece in Time Magazine, Retired GEN James Conway, former \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, and Retired ADM James M. Loy, former \nCommandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, wrote that:\n\n       . . . the security challenges our nation faces today are \n     not the same as when we began our service during the Cold \n     War. . . . Twenty-first century problems require fine \n     scalpels, and the military is a broad sword. We can start by \n     better resourcing and strengthening our own institutions. The \n     State Department, the Peace Corps and USAID are the front \n     lines of keeping our country safe, but they are underfunded \n     and undermanned.\n\n  Mr. President, we should also remember that the Balanced Budget Act \nis based on parity. The spending caps we put in place have consequences \nfor both the defense and nondefense sides of the ledger. Yet the \nSenator from Arizona's one dimensional approach ignores this bipartisan \ncompromise. His amendment ignores the essential roles that development \nand diplomacy play in national security. It ignores the many domestic \ncomponents to a strong defense, like a well-trained workforce and \nreliable infrastructure, like energy independence, like health systems \nthat have the resources to protect the public from infectious diseases, \ncontaminated drinking water, and unsafe food.\n  If you ask the American people whether these investments are as \nimportant as more fighter planes and warships, they would emphatically \nanswer ``yes''. And that is why the very name of the Balanced Budget \nAct includes the word ``balanced''.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island should be passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe June 2 article I referred to by General Conway and Admiral Loy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Former Military Leaders: 3 Lessons for Our Next Commander-in-Chief\n\n             (James Conway and James M. Loy, June 2, 2016)\n\n\n                   Military alone cannot keep us safe\n\n       As Hillary Clinton makes a national security speech \n     Thursday and with Trump's recent major foreign policy speech, \n     it's important to remember that the military alone cannot \n     keep us safe. As the former commandants of the Marine Corps \n     and the Coast Guard, we believe our next Commander-in-Chief \n     will also need the civilian tools in our arsenal to keep our \n     nation strong and secure.\n       For centuries, the blessing of two large oceans on our \n     flanks acted as geographical barriers. But in the modern era, \n     technology has made the world smaller and increasingly \n     interconnected. The recent attacks in Brussels, Paris and San \n     Bernardino, Calif., remind us that global threats do not \n     respect borders, and oceans are not enough to preserve our \n     peace and prosperity.\n       The security challenges our nation faces today are not the \n     same as when we began our service during the Cold War. \n     National security challenges have become more resistant to \n     bullets. Ebola, the Zika virus, the influx of undocumented \n     children from Latin states, and even the rise of ISIS cannot \n     be resolved only with the force of arms.\n       If there was one immutable lesson of the Sept. 11 attacks, \n     it is that instability in remote corners of the world can \n     pose a direct threat to our way of life. The rise of ISIS is \n     only a recent example that underscores that reality.\n       Military force will continue to be a necessary deterrent \n     for the exercise of American\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\n     power, but it cannot be the only option. To preserve our flag \n     and freedom, there are three areas where America must do \n     better.\n       1. We must strengthen not only our soldiers, sailors, \n     Marines, Coast Guard, and airmen but also our diplomats and \n     development experts who are critical to our national \n     security.\n       Fighting terrorism means more than bombing the Middle East \n     from the air. It means supporting weak or fragile states, \n     increasing foreign military training and assistance, and \n     devoting more resources to fight weapons proliferation. These \n     are battles best fought at the local level with knowledge of \n     cultures, economics and history.\n       2. We must help create economic opportunities around the \n     world--particularly those where there are security concerns.\n       Think of America's engagement with Germany, Japan and South \n     Korea in the postwar years. They are now our fourth, fifth, \n     and sixth largest trading partners, respectively. Helping \n     promote rule of law and economic development strengthens our \n     economy here at home.\n       3. We must strengthen the humanitarian values that \n     undergird American global leadership.\n       U.S. foreign assistance has helped cut extreme poverty in \n     half since 1990. It has increased life expectancy in the \n     developing world by 33%, afforded two billion people access \n     to clean water, and the number of children in primary school \n     has tripled over the last 25 years.\n       Pandemics and diseases like Ebola and the Zika virus are \n     more easily defeated in the countries where they originate \n     when those countries have strong health care systems, an \n     educated population and the economic means to combat the \n     virus. We can help build those institutions. To those \n     concerned about the cost of assistance to the developing \n     world, we would submit to you that economic development is \n     cheaper than sending in the military.\n       Twenty-first century problems require fine scalpels, and \n     the military is a broad sword. We can start by better \n     resourcing and strengthening our own institutions. The State \n     Department, the Peace Corps and USAID are the front lines of \n     keeping our country safe, but they are underfunded and \n     undermanned.\n       Facing the largest global displacement of people since \n     World War II, we have much more work to do. If we are not \n     helping to support and build up allies and friends, then we \n     are reducing our prospects for success and ceding immense \n     benefits for our own national security.\n       General James Mattis got it right when he said: ``If you \n     don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy \n     more ammunition.''\n       Keeping all the tools of American national security strong \n     will help save lives and promote global stability and \n     prosperity. Regardless of who is elected in November, a \n     candidate who understands these challenges, and acts \n     accordingly, will be in America's best interests.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nAlaska on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an \namendment that I have filed to the National Defense Authorization Act. \nThis is amendment No. 4222, and it addresses an issue of great interest \nto military families not only in my State, where we are proud to host a \nstrong contingent of military that defend our Nation, but this is an \nissue that really stretches across the country What we propose in \namendment No. 4222 is to strike section 604 of the NDAA, which \nrepresents a paradigm shift in the way the basic allowance for housing \nis paid to our Active-Duty members.\n\n  The Department of Defense and our military families have long \nbelieved that BAH is part of a total compensation. Effectively, it is \npart of your paycheck. It is part of what you earn. It is something \nthat you can count on based on where you are posted, what your rank is, \nand whether you have any dependents. We have seen the BAH be subject to \narbitrary and somewhat unfair reductions in recent years. It has \nunfortunately become the bill payer for other priorities.\n  BAH is regarded by the Defense Department as a component of a \nservicemember's total compensation. It is a compensation program. \nSection 604 turns the BAH into a reimbursement program. So instead of \nhaving BAH in your bank account to spend on living expenses as you deem \nfit, Section 604 essentially requires servicemembers to turn their \nreceipts in to an accounting office and basically plead your \nentitlement to that reimbursement for the cost of your housing as well \nas utilities. I suppose alternatively you could take your entitlement \nand accept the risk that some audit or verification process will \nrequire you to pay something back, perhaps a lot back. Section 604 does \nnot explain how this whole verification process will work.\n  Believe me, when I had an opportunity to visit with military spouses \nat Fort Wainwright just last week about this, they asked me: How does \nthis reimbursement work? How do I get these utilities statements in for \nreimbursement? Already there are not enough people to process the basic \npaperwork that goes on for reimbursement of other expenses like \npermanent change of station moves. Tell me how this is going to be a \nbetter system.\n  Our military families are very familiar with deep bureaucracy and \nendure a fair amount of hassle to get what they are already entitled \nto.\n  I heard loud and clear from these military spouses the concerns they \nhad about a proposal. They are looking at this as a one-size-fits-all \nsolution; perhaps it is not a well-formed solution and it could have \nextreme consequences for those who serve in highly rural places, like \nin Alaska.\n  The BAH doesn't pay only for housing, it pays for the utilities. BAH \npays for lights and heat, but keep in mind what it means to be in a \nvery remote, very rural place. In places like Fairbanks, you are \nlimited in terms of your options for energy, for power. Your costs are \nhigh. You could be looking at a home heating fuel bill on a monthly \nbasis that could actually exceed the cost of your mortgage. Think about \nwhat that means. You may be in the enviable position of having found a \nhome in a community that you think is affordable. The monthly rent is \naffordable, the mortgage might be affordable, but if it is an older \nhouse, if it is not fully weatherized, if you are on home heating fuel, \nyou may be looking at a situation where you are paying more in \nutilities than for the cost of your housing.\n  Another cost you might use your BAH to pay is snow removal. It is not \nan option to not have your snow removed, and if your spouse is \ndeployed, you need a way to get out of a long driveway. Who is going to \nbe paying for the snow removal? Oftentimes, BAH pays to pump out the \nseptic system, which has to be done on a somewhat quarterly basis \nbecause there are so many homes that are not on water and sewer. By the \nway, when we talk about water, is the cost of hauling water recoverable \nunder this new reimbursement program? When you are not on a water \nsystem, you have to get your water from somewhere. Some military \nfamilies at Fort Wainwright are paying to have water hauled to their \nhomes either by a truck or they go out to the community tap to fill up \ntheir tank, but there is a cost associated with that. These spouses are \nasking me: How is that going to be accommodated under the new BAH plan? \nWill this be considered part of these allowable reimbursements?\n  This is all very troubling to me. It was certainly very troubling to \nthe military families I spent time with. It is not like our military \nfamilies don't have enough to worry about.\n  One military spouse told me of the situation in her family. She is a \nlicensed attorney in another State. She hasn't been able to get waived \nin to practice in the State of Alaska. Her husband is an E7 soldier and \nhas been in for 19 years, so effectively two professionals. They have \nthree children. She says she spends about $1,500 a month for food, \nformula, and diapers for the three small children. She pays $38,000 a \nyear for childcare. Childcare in and around the Fort Wainwright area is \nvery expensive, and she is not able to get reimbursement for childcare \nbecause she is not working. She is trying to get a job. But recognizing \nthat they have all these other costs on top of it all, this military \nspouse--two professionals in the household, three children--tells me \nher family is WIC eligible.\n  The stories I hear about our military families who are accessing our \ncommunity food banks--our military families are worried. They are \nworried about what is happening at home, the financial issues they are \nfaced with.\n  This was one concern I heard specifically: If this is a reimbursement \nsystem and I have to submit receipts for expenses--expenses that may \nexceed the cost of housing, exceed the cost of a mortgage, and it takes \na long while to get this reimbursement--what happens if I can't pay my \nbills on time?\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nMy job requires a security clearance? And that security clearance \nrequires that your credit record be absolutely impeccable. How is all \nthis going to work?\n  There is so much stress, so much anxiety that I heard from these \nspouses as we were discussing these issues.\n  When we think about what our military families are worried about, \nthey are focused on the stress that comes with force structure \nreductions, frequent PCS moves, needing to understand the latest and \ngreatest TRICARE complexity, figuring out whether the old retirement \nparadigm or the new retirement paradigm is better. And then they have \nthis--yet another layer of complexity with section 604 that just adds \nto the stress and adds to the anxiety.\n  We have to be honest with one another. We have to be honest with our \nmilitary families. The bill before us does not afford those who serve a \npay increase that is commensurate with the value of their service. \nThankfully, we are working on a fix, and I greatly appreciate the \nleadership of Senator McCain and his willingness to work with so many \nof us on these issues that are a concern to our families.\n  When we look at what is going on now with BAH, I think we are messing \nwith a very significant component of total compensation. That is simply \nnot an appropriate way to thank families who have already suffered \nthrough multiple deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, and now they have \nto contend with a host of uncertainties created by the rise of ISIL, \nthe tensions on the Korean Peninsula, a resurgent Russia, and an \nambitious China. This is not right for our military families.\n  The Pentagon has issued a Statement of Administration Policy. They \nare quite clear about where they are on this. They believe section 604 \nis damaging to the force, and that is why they oppose section 604. It \nis burdensome to move from a compensation approach to a reimbursement \napproach. It is inefficient. It appears to completely eliminate the BAH \nincrement presently paid to families with children. It penalizes dual \nmilitary couples. It disproportionately impacts female servicemembers. \nThink about it. About 20 percent of women on Active Duty are in a dual \nmilitary marriage, compared to about 3.8 percent of Active-Duty men. So \nwomen on Active Duty are effectively taking a harder hit. And if we \nthink this is not going to have an impact on recruitment and \nretention--I think we are going to be looking at some second-order \nconsequences with respect to that and also as it relates to \nadministration of the GI bill education benefit.\n  I mentioned the effective penalty on dual military couples. I know a \ndual-career military couple. I am very pleased to know that their \nmilitary career has taken them to some pretty good places and the \nbetter news is that they have moved together. One spouse has been \nselected for promotion to lieutenant colonel 2 years below the zone, \nwhich is a very big deal. This week, his wife learned that she, too, \nhas been selected for promotion to lieutenant colonel 1 year below the \nzone. So we can see that both of these individuals are very high \nperformers, really rock stars when it comes to a competitive promotion \nenvironment. They are doing great, but they are looking at the impact \nsection 604 will have on their specific situation as a dual military \ncouple. They estimate that if their next assignment is here in the \nlower 48, they will lose about $20,000 from their compensation. If we \nare fortunate that they should both get assigned to Alaska on the next \nrotation, that hit to them will rise to $29,000--an almost $30,000 \nreduction in total compensation from what they as a military couple \nwould receive under the current system. That is significant. They are \nexactly the kinds of people the private sector wants to recruit but our \nmilitary wants to retain, and I am not the only person who appreciates \nthis fact.\n  When I was in Fort Wainwright, one dual military spouse said: Who I \nam married to should not affect my BAH entitlement. That summed it up \nin a pretty neat and tidy way.\n  Over this past week since I have been back here, I have heard from \nsenior military leaders and senior enlisted advisers to those leaders, \nall of one voice. They are saying that this brings down the morale in \nthe volunteer force. I will relay to my colleagues the comments from \none of the commanders in Fort Wainwright when I was there last week. He \nhad been sitting in the back of the room listening to all of the \nmilitary spouses weigh in and voice their concerns and their anxiety \nabout what was going on. He said to me: This is a clear reminder of how \nmorale affects the overall mission. I have been on assignment. I have \nbeen deployed to Afghanistan. I have broken down doors. I have been on \npatrol looking for IEDs.\n\n  When you are on these missions, your head has to be 100 percent in \nthe game. You can't be thinking about what is happening at home. You \ncannot be thinking about whether or not there are financial struggles \nthat your spouse is dealing with. You cannot be distracted from where \nyou are in the here and now. We are not just talking about ``quality of \nlife'' issues; we are talking about ``matter of life and death'' \nissues.\n  He said: If my head is not 100 percent in the game, then somebody's \nlife potentially is on the line.\n  It was a clear reminder to me of how morale affects the mission and \nhow we need to ensure that our men and women whom we have tasked to \ntake on the most difficult of tasks are able to focus on where they are \nright then. And making sure all is well at home is a responsibility we \nalso have.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the BAH over the years. Some \nof us think that it is in need of reform or that perhaps right-sizing \nthe BAH will mean more money for readiness and modernization. I \ncertainly get that argument. I may not agree with all of that, but I do \nknow there are some very hard choices that have to be made in a \ndifficult budget environment. I respect the work the chairman has done, \nalong with the ranking member, in trying to deal with all of that. But \nI do feel very certain about one thing: Those who believe that BAH \nshould be reformed need to make that case openly and directly and \ntransparently to our military families. I think putting a game-changing \nprovision like section 604 in the NDAA without that consultation misses \nthe mark.\n  The changes we are considering in BAH would not be effective until \n2018. We have some time here, and we can get this right. My amendment, \nwhich is a bipartisan amendment, simply says: Take a timeout. Let's \ntake a step back.\n  To those who think the BAH is in need of reform, make the case to \nmilitary families if you choose, but let's not rush this through. This \nis not what we should be doing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters from the Military Officers Association of America as well as \nthe Air Force Sergeants Association in support of my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Military Officers Association\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                                     May 27, 2016.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK),\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: I am writing to thank you for your \n     continued strong support for our men and women in uniform and \n     their families, as most recently demonstrated by your \n     introduction of amendment #4222, which would remove Sec. 604 \n     from S. 2943, the Senate's FY17 defense policy legislation.\n       Section 604 aims to recoup more than $200 million annually \n     from the Regular Military Compensation (RMA), earned by \n     servicemembers through reductions to the Basic Allowance for \n     Housing (BAH), a main component of RMA of which they are \n     entitled to under law. These reductions would begin in \n     January 2018 for new entrants into military service and after \n     the next Permanent Change of Station (PCS), for those already \n     serving.\n       The reductions to BAH, as called for in 604, undoes the \n     diligent work done by Congress over the past 15 years to \n     rectify the out of pocket housing costs long borne by \n     servicemembers and clearly sends the wrong message to them \n     and their families--that their service and sacrifice is not \n     important.\n       At a time when we have asked servicemembers to contribute \n     more to their retirement savings, more to their housing, and \n     possibly more to their healthcare, this proposal is wrongly \n     conceived, unfair, and would do harm to the retention of our \n     currently serving men and women and their families.\n       The Military Officers Association of America (MOAA) \n     strongly supports amendment #4222 to remove Sec. 604 and \n     urges other members of the Senate to support the amendment as \n     well.\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\n       Thank you for your leadership and for your continued strong \n     support for our men and women in uniform and their families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dana T. Atkins.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Air Force Sergeants Association,\n\n                                       Suitland, MD, June 1, 2016.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: on behalf of the 100,000 members of \n     the Air Force Sergeants Association I want to thank you for \n     introducing amendment #4222 to S. 2943. Removing Sec. 604 \n     from the Senate's FY17 NDAA, as articulated in your \n     amendment, is absolutely the right call!\n       To propose BAH reductions while servicemembers are already \n     concurrently contributing more to their retirement and \n     potentially to their healthcare clearly sends the wrong \n     message. Keeping in mind that vast numbers of military \n     families funnel their children into similar service, \n     retention of those now serving in uniform as well as \n     recruitment of future talent both stand to suffer.\n       AFSA strongly supports amendment #4222 to remove Sec. 604 \n     from S.2943 and urges other members of the Senate to also \n     support this amendment.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Robert L. Frank,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor to my colleague from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Alaska. I \nappreciate that.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the NDAA, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which we are currently working on. The NDAA is \nclearly one of the most important pieces of legislation we take up in \nCongress because it authorizes vital programs designed to keep our \nNation secure and our people safe.\n  We have worked very hard to make sure the bill upholds the nuclear \nmissions at our missile bases, as well as unmanned aerial systems--the \nUAS missions--that have emerged as a vigorous part of our Nation's \ndefense.\n  I commend the chairman and the ranking member for their good work in \nbringing this bill to the floor. It is a massive undertaking. In \nparticular, I thank them for their support on some important \npriorities.\n  This bill fully authorizes programs to sustain our strategic forces, \nincluding plans to upgrade the Minuteman III ICBM, the venerable B-52 \nbomber, and our nuclear cruise missiles. The bill also fully authorizes \nthe Global Hawk program, which is proving its worth every day and \ndemonstrates the value of unmanned aircraft in performing intelligence, \nsurveillance, and reconnaissance missions.\n  The Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, approved the National \nDefense Appropriations Act last month, putting in place the funding to \nsupport our armed services. As soon as we pass the authorization bill \nthat is now before the full Senate, I understand we will work to bring \nits companion bill, the appropriations bill, to the floor for a vote as \nwell. Both are vital for our armed services.\n  Together, these two bills--the National Defense Authorization Act and \nthe National Defense Appropriations Act--will provide our armed \nservices with both the blueprint and the funding they need to defend \nour Nation and the American people.\n  As I have said, I have filed several amendments that I believe will \nstrengthen the bill and our national security, and I wish to take a \nminute to talk about them now.\n  First, I have filed a measure that requires the Air Force to procure, \nin a timely manner, Black Hawk helicopters to replace the Vietnam-era \nHuey helicopters that currently provide security to our \nintercontinental ballistic missile fields. These fields are located \nnear Minot Air Force Base in my home State of North Dakota, as well as \nat missile bases in Wyoming and the State of Montana.\n  The Air Force uses helicopters to provide security for missiles that \nare in transit, as well as to move security forces quickly to any \nmissile field site that could come under any kind of threat.\n  I love the old Huey helicopters. They are great. I have flown in them \nfor many years, on many occasions, and it is certainly an iconic \naircraft and one that has served our Nation's military very well \nthrough the Vietnam era and through today. But the reality is that it \nis no longer able to do the job that we need done.\n  I spent some time with pilots at Minot Air Force Base earlier this \nyear and heard about the challenges they face. For example, the front \npanel of the Huey sometimes will not light up. Remember, these are \naircraft that were manufactured in 1969. The pilots flying these \naircraft are a lot younger than the helicopters they are flying, but \nthey do a remarkable job. The mechanics do an amazing job in keeping \nthem going.\n  For example, sometimes the front panel of the Huey will not light up. \nWhen they are flying at night, they stick a portable LED light on the \ndash so they can see their gauges. Think about that. We have amazing \nyoung men and women in the military flying these helicopters that are \nmuch older than they are--helicopters from 1969. Some of the gauges \ndon't have lights on them, so they put LED lights on as a makeshift way \nto see the gauges in the dark when they are flying to the missile \nfields performing their mission. If they hit some rough weather, guess \nwhat happens. The jostling knocks the LED lights off the control panel, \nand now they are in the dark. They can't even see their gauges.\n  Think about being out there flying helicopters on a military mission, \nand it is dark. You may be in rough weather, and you can't see your \ngauges. Obviously, that doesn't get the job done. That is not something \nthat is acceptable for our men and women in uniform.\n  The Air Force acknowledges this, and they are working on getting an \nupgraded helicopter. To their credit, the Air Force wanted to move this \nas fast as possible, but under the plan DOD had approved, it would take \n5 years before we would get new helicopters.\n  Think about the situation I just described. Here are these air men \nand women flying in this makeshift condition, in a situation where the \nAir Force has acknowledged that this equipment does not meet the \nmission requirements--does not meet the mission requirements. That is \nwhy we have to accelerate this timeline, and that is what this \namendment does.\n\n  Specifically, my amendment instructs the Air Force to get Black Hawk \nhelicopters on contract by 2018, which accelerates the Air Force's \ncurrent procurement plan by approximately 2 years. It would enable them \nto acquire Black Hawk helicopters under the Army contract. The Army is \nalready buying these helicopters. It has been fully bid. They have been \ndoing it for some period of time. It would allow the Air Force to \npiggyback on it and buy the Black Hawk helicopters they need. It saves \nmillions of dollars, I think somewhere between $80 and $120 million. \nThis is commonsense stuff. I think it is a win all the way around.\n  This provision is coauthored by Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of \nMontana. Obviously, he is well aware of the problem, too, because they \nface the same difficulty across our border in Montana. It is \ncosponsored by the other members of the Senate's ICBM coalition. It is \nbipartisan. We have a number of Senators on board supporting it.\n  Also, it is a companion bill to the amendment that Senator Tester and \nI included in the fiscal year 2017 Defense appropriations bill. We have \nalready put $75 million in the Defense appropriations bill to start the \nacquisition. The dollars are there; this is the authorization that goes \nwith the dollars. We worked very hard on this. We set it up the right \nway, and it is something we need to do.\n  The second amendment I introduced will help to meet the challenge of \ntraining enough pilots to fly RPAs, or remotely piloted aircraft--\nunmanned aircraft. I don't know that there is any mission in the Air \nForce or perhaps the whole DOD that is more in demand right now than \nRPAs, unmanned aircraft. All over the world, we are using this amazing \ntool--Global Hawk, Predator--and it is in tremendous demand right now. \nThat also creates a tremendous demand for pilot training.\n  Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed included language in the base\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\nbill that requires the Air Force to make the transition to using \nenlisted pilots to fly RPAs, so we would have both officers and \nenlisted pilots able to fly RPAs. It is needed because of the \nincredible demand for pilots, which results from the incredible demand \nfor this mission.\n  I want to make sure that if the Air Force is going to make this \ntransition, it can guarantee that pilots in the Air Guard, who use \nseparate personnel systems and different training schedules, are able \nto receive training at a rate that is commensurate with their Active-\nDuty counterparts. Obviously, we rely heavily on the Air Guard, and \nthey need to have the necessary access to training. This amendment \ndirects that the Air Force is able to use contractor services to ensure \nthat there is enough training capacity to train Air National Guard \npilots to fly RPAs in order to keep pace with Active-Duty pilot \ntraining.\n  We know that the Air Force has had difficulty training RPA pilots \nfast enough to meet operational demands. One way to correct that \ndeficiency is to use the private sector to augment the training the Air \nForce provides directly.\n  In North Dakota, General Atomics--the manufacturer of the Predator \nand the Reaper--is building a training academy to train pilots. It is \nat the Grand Forks Air Force Base. It is in a technology park on the \nGrand Forks Air Force Base. They are going to train pilots for their \nforeign military sales. So for aircraft that has been purchased by our \nmilitary allies--France, England, Italy, Netherlands, I think maybe \nAustralia--there are a litany of our allies who are now using RPAs, and \nGeneral Atomics will conduct that training at Grand Forks Air Force \nBase. There is no reason our own Air Force can't leverage that \nincredible resource as well or resources like it at other locations. \nClearly, it is something we need to help leverage our pilot training.\n  With that, I will wrap up. Again, I want to emphasize the importance \nof this and the National Defense Authorization Act. I thank both the \nchairman and the ranking member for their work.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join together in a bipartisan way \nand pass this important legislation for our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to be recognized to speak in support of \nthe McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4229\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, to Members of the body on both sides of \nthe aisle, I appreciate the effort to produce a bipartisan national \ndefense authorization bill. I think our committee did a good job in \ncoming up with a bipartisan bill, but as a body and as a country we \nhaven't done enough and this is a chance to rectify what I think is an \nincredibly big problem.\n  We are at war--at least I think we are. We have been at war for the \nlast 15 years. I cannot tell you how hard it has been on the all-\nvoluntary force. I was in the Air Force for 33 years. I retired last \nyear. I had the pleasure of meeting a lot of men and women in uniform \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. I think I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan 37 \ntimes in the last decade. I have seen incredible sacrifice by those who \nserve our Nation to defend us against another 9/11 and what their \nfamilies have gone through.\n  As a nation and a Congress, what have we done to those who have been \nfighting this war? We are on track to have the smallest Army since \n1940. Sequestration--across-the-board budget cuts that have taken \nalmost $1 trillion out of the defense budget--is insanity and nobody \nseems to give a damn about fixing it. None of us have to go and fly in \nplanes that are about to fall out of the sky. None of us are commanders \nof troops and having to use duct tape to get through the day. None of \nus have to worry about going over and over and over to the war zone \nbecause the war is getting worse, not better.\n  It looks like all of us should listen to our commanders who have said \nwith one voice that the readiness of the U.S. military is in an \nemergency situation. The ability to give the flying hours our pilots \nneed can't be done because of budget constraints. It looks like we \nwould want to listen to the Chief of Staff of the Army, Air Force, \nNavy, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps who are telling us that \nsequestration has taken a toll on the ability to defend this Nation.\n  We have had some patchwork solutions. We put some money back, but we \nare due to go back into sequestration next year. The amount of money we \nput back in the Ryan-Murray compromise was much appreciated, and \nSenator McCain is trying to put an $18 billion infusion into the \nmilitary to meet their unfunded needs that would plus-up the Army by \n15,000 and would plus-up the Marine Corps and the National Guard and \nwould give more money for operation and maintenance.\n  The problem that seems lost on this Congress is that training hours \nhave to give way to operational needs in theater. Let me give one small \nexample. There is a Marine Corps readiness rapid response force in \nSpain that is stationed in Spain to deal with Benghazi-type events \nthroughout Africa. They have to fly--in case something went bad--\nthousands of miles. They have 12 aircraft, B-22s, and 2 teams. The \nCommandant of the Marine Corps is having to take six of these aircraft \naway from Spain to bring them back to the United States because we \ndon't have enough airplanes to train the B-22 pilots. That means there \nis a hole in our ability to protect our citizens and diplomats in \nAfrica.\n  I cannot tell you the damage that sequestration has done to our \nmilitary, and we seem unmoved by all of this. I cannot believe that the \nbody is not responding more aggressively to the needs of our military, \ngiven the threats we are facing. How much more information do we need \nfrom our commanders to believe this is an emergency?\n  I say to my Democratic colleagues, I know sequestration is hurting on \nthe nondefense side, but all spending is not equal. I stand ready with \nyou to find a way to buy back sequestration and pay for it by having \nsome revenue come from closing loopholes and deductions like the \nsupercommittee envisioned by using some revenue and some entitlement \nreform to buy back what is left on sequestration. I am not asking that \nyou just spend money on defense and ignore the rest of the problems \nassociated with sequestration.\n  I have sat done on two separate occasions with Members on the other \nside to try to find ways to buy back sequestration so we could actually \nachieve the savings, and we have been able to not do a whole lot. Ryan \nand Murray came up with a fix that provided some relief that expires at \nthe end of the year.\n  The bottom line is this. The McCain amendment is making the argument \nthat the $18 billion in this amendment has to be spent based on an \nemergency.\n  Here is the question: Is there an emergency when it comes to the \noperational needs of this country on the defense side? Have we put our \ntroops in a spot where we are risking their lives and their ability to \nprosecute the war because we have gone too far with defense cuts? I \nthink we have, but if you don't believe me, you should listen to our \ncommanders and hopefully I can read some of their quotes.\n  With this $18 billion infusion, we are able to increase the size of \nthe Army, and if you are in the Army, you could use a little help right \nabout now. You have been busting your ass for the last 15 years, going \nback and forth, back and forth, and the way we reward your service is \nto decrease the size of the Army.\n  I just got back from Asia, and everybody in Asia is wondering: What \nthe heck is America doing? We are going to have the smallest Navy since \n1915. We are going to pivot to Asia with what? Under sequestration our \nability to modernize the Navy has been lost. They don't have the money \nto build the new ships that we need to fight the wars of the future and \ncontain a threatening China because they are in a war now. They are \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. It looks like we would want to help the \nMarines. If you are a marine, boy, have you been on the tip of the \nspear.\n  This amendment would allow us to have 3,000 more marines. What does \nthat mean? It means we will have 3,000\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\nmore people to help prosecute the war and take a little burden off the \nMarine Corps, which has been absolutely worn out. Seventy percent of \nthe F-18s in the Marine Corps have problems flying. We are \ncannibalizing planes to keep other planes in the air.\n  To those who say we need to reform the Pentagon, you are right. Not \nonly do we need to, we have. Fifty percent of the Department of Defense \nbudget is personnel costs. Last year we reformed retirement. At 20 \nyears, you are not going to get half of your base pay. You will get 40 \npercent in the future. That will save money. We are going to allow a \nThrift Savings Plan for those who want to contribute 5 percent of their \npay and we will match 5 percent, but they can't get the money until \nthey are 59 or 60. That will be money for the servicemembers, but it \ncomes later.\n  We are going to ask our retirees to pay a little bit more for the \nmilitary health care system because we haven't had a premium adjustment \nof any consequence since 1995. We are going to go to fixed-price \ncontracts to deal with the abuse of cost-plus contracts to save money. \nWe are trying to reduce the number of general officers because they \nhave exploded.\n  We are doing a lot of things to make the Pentagon operate better, but \nat the end of the day, you need people to defend this country. When \nsequestration kicks back in, we are going to go from 475,000 to \n420,000.\n  What I am asking for is a bipartisan effort to stop the bleeding, to \ntake the request for the military that is unfunded and desperately \nneeded and give them a little bit of hope. We need to let them know \nCongress is listening to their problem because we are not. We are \nignoring the problems of our military because if we were really serious \nabout helping them, we would pass this by a voice vote, but, no, we \ncan't increase defense spending by $18 billion to increase the size of \nthe Army, Marine Corps, and the National Guard, to give more flight \ntime to our pilots, more money to maintain the equipment and increase \nthe size of the National Guard, which has really suffered during the \nlast 15 years, and to buy more airplanes. The bottom line is, we can't \ndo all of that because we have to increase nondefense spending.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, if you don't think there is an emergency \nin the military, then you haven't been listening. To those Republicans \nwho believe the appropriations bill has adequately funded the needs of \nthe military, you haven't been listening. Well, I have been listening. \nWashington is broken in many ways. I enjoy being a Member of the \nSenate, and I respect my colleagues, even though we disagree, but this \none I can't understand. I can't understand this. I can understand \nideology, I can understand the differences between pro-life, pro-\nchoice, guns, revenue, and taxes. I can understand conservatism, \nliberalism, libertarianism. I can understand that in a great country we \nhave differences, but this I can't understand.\n  I can't understand why any of us would let this happen to our \nmilitary. Whether you are a Libertarian, vegetarian, Republican, or \nDemocrat, you need these men and women defending you so you can argue \namong yourselves. We can argue until the cows come home about how \nAmerica should be, and it is a privilege to have this debate. While we \nare arguing among ourselves about how to make America great again or to \nbecome one, stronger together, or whatever damn phrase is out there, \nthe people who are giving us the privilege to argue are being worn out \nand underfunded.\n  Let me tell you the consequence of this. At a time the enemy is \ngrowing in capability to attack this country, we are gutting our \nability to defend this country. A perfect storm is brewing. We have an \nAmerica in retreat and in decline all over the world. We have a \nPresidential contest that is absolutely crazy. The Republican nominee, \nwhen he talks about foreign policy, it is complete gibberish.\n  The Democratic nominee seems to be afraid to articulate how to change \nthings. What is she going to do differently? Where is she on \nsequestration?\n  Secretary Clinton, do you think now is the time to spend more on our \nmilitary because we are in an emergency situation? Tell me why I am \nwrong. Tell me why you don't believe all of the things said by those in \nleadership.\n  I am dumbfounded that this is hard given the state of readiness of \nour military. I am dumbfounded that we can't improve military readiness \nwithout increasing spending for food safety modernization. I am sure \nthere is probably something legitimate there, but the Food Safety \nModernization Act is not going to stop ISIL from coming here.\n\n  There is $1.9 billion for water infrastructure. I am sure it is \nlegitimate, but all I can say is that whatever problems we have with \nwater, they pale in comparison to the problems we have with terrorism.\n  Who are we as a body, who are we as a people if we can't see this \nbeing an emergency? If you are not listening and you have shut your \nmind and eyes to what is going on, then shame on you.\n  This is the low point to me; that we cannot as a body agree that our \nmen and women in the military are in a bad spot and they need our help \nyesterday. So vote the way you are going to vote, but don't tell me \nthat the Appropriations Committee, of which I am a member, has fixed \nthe problem because we haven't. We did appropriate more money, and I \nappreciate it, but the $18 billion on this list is not addressed by the \nAppropriations Committee's effort to do more, and don't tell me this is \nnot an emergency because I don't believe it. Don't hold the men and \nwomen hostage from getting the money they desperately need to defend us \nall because you want more money somewhere else.\n  Whatever differences we have, whatever hopes and dreams we have as \nindividuals or collectively as Americans are at risk because the people \nwe are fighting would kill every one of us if they could. They could \ncare less if you are a Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative. \nThey want to hurt us, and they want to hurt us badly, and the only way \nto keep them from hurting us is for some of us to go over there in \npartnership with others over there to keep the fight from coming back \nover here.\n  It looks like all of us can agree on giving the people going over \nthere the best chance they can to survive the fight, come back home and \nprotect us all, but apparently we can't get there. Shame on us. Shame \non us all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nminutes of debate, equally divided.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, this is a motion to instruct the conferees \nthat whatever is decided in the conference to fund the Zika crisis, the \nmoney would not be taken out of the Ebola fund and that the money that \nhas been borrowed from the Ebola fund would be replenished.\n  Remember that since the Ebola outbreak was contained 1 year ago, \nthere have been seven more clusters of outbreaks since that time, and \nthe CDC still employs 80 employees working on Ebola. With the last \nrecent Ebola case\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\nin Guinea, the CDC has had to vaccinate 1,700 people and then go out \nand do the infection control over there in West Africa in 50 health \ncenters and make 20,000 connections to try to ensure that it does not \nspread, which of course is the source of how Ebola gets to the United \nStates.\n  So this motion is simply to say: Let's not take the Zika crisis funds \nout of Ebola and replenish what has already been taken out.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, we did just vote to go to conference. I \nwould like to see the conference be able to deal with this issue.\n  In the Ebola funds, there is still $1.2 billion left in the Ebola \nfunds. There is still $1.2 billion left in the Ebola fund. This is $510 \nmillion that was to be used for things like reimbursing hospitals that \nwould have an influx of Ebola patients in this country, which never \nhappened, and other issues.\n  The administration has said they do not need this $510 million for \nEbola. They clearly would like to use it for other purposes, and in \nfact have used $510 million for other purposes.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine seconds.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Missouri \nsimply that the administration does not say that they don't need this. \nAs a matter of fact, in their $1.9 billion request, they have asked for \nthe replenishment of this, and the statements that I just made were \nmade by Dr. Frieden and Dr. Fauci as early as this morning.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, in the $1.9 billion request, they would not \nhave asked for this money because they were asking for $1.9 billion of \nnew money, some justified and some not.\n  I believe we worked hard to get a good start here. This can clearly \nbe an open item in the conference, but I don't think it should be a \ndirected item in the conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a motion to instruct conferees at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Sullivan] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment \n     to the bill H.R. 2577 be instructed to insist upon the \n     inclusion of the provisions contained in Senate amendment \n     4065 (relating to the reconstruction of certain bridges).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, this instruction relates to an earlier \namendment I had, No. 4065. It is a simple amendment that would allow \nStates and communities throughout our Nation to expedite the permitting \nprocess and construction of their bridges that pose safety concerns for \ntheir citizens. This would only apply to bridges that are built in the \nsame place--they are not expanding bridges--same size, and bridges they \nare replacing. It is essentially maintenance on bridges. If State \nenvironmental agencies determine that Federal permitting requirements \nshould be waived, then they are allowed to do this to expedite the \npermitting of the bridge.\n  Let me explain why this is important. Right now in America, there are \n61,000 structurally deficient bridges in need of repair. Yet when we \ntry to repair these bridges, it takes 5 years to 6 years just to get \nthe Federal permitting requirements. This amendment--these instructions \nwould allow this process to move much more quickly. It will be \nimportant for the safety of our citizens, to put Americans back to \nwork, and to grow our economy. It is a commonsense instruction.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are focused on \npermitting reform. This is something very simple that we can do that \nwill benefit all of our States and all of our citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have laryngitis, which is the dream of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle, but I want to say that the \nSullivan amendment is dangerous and it is unnecessary. It is the last \nthing we should do given the lessons we have learned in Flint, MI, \nbecause what the Sullivan amendment says is that you can be exempted \nfrom nine Federal health and safety laws when you rebuild the bridge. \nFor example, it would allow the dumping of oil, toxic materials that \ncould include lead, construction debris, and that all will go in the \nwater--water we swim in, water we fish in, water we drink. After Flint, \nhow could we do this?\n  This is not a problem. If you ask Senator Klobuchar--I just talked to \nher--and Senator Franken, they rebuilt their bridge in a year because \nthere is already expedited language in all of the laws on which we \nworked together.\n  So please reject this. It is dangerous, it is unnecessary, and it \ncertainly is unrelated to the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. I yield to my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, in 15 seconds I yield to no one here in my \ncommitment to the environment, but I also have a commitment to common \nsense. We are talking about bridges, not expanding--same size, same \ndimensions, and same location. If that were it, I would oppose this \namendment; however, this amendment has a safety valve that the \nconstruction, reconstruction, or maintenance of the bridge must pass \nmuster with the State-level permitting and environmental protection \nauthority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KING. I understand. I think we should support it. Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 55 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Wow. In the beginning, God created.\n  I just want to say to my friend Senator King, just ask the people of \nFlint,\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nMI, how happy they were that the State took over the health and safety \nrules. Their kids are suffering from lead poisoning. Sometimes you are \ntalking about bridges that are 100 years old. They contain toxic \nmaterials. Again, this is not necessary. We haven't got a problem \nbecause we have taken care of expedited procedures. My arm was twisted \non it in the FAST Act. So let's reject this because we want to protect \nthe health and safety of the people we represent.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey) and the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Graham).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nToomey) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th \nanniversary of the Nevada Justice Association. Since 1966, the Nevada \nJustice Association has been a fierce advocate for justice and worked \nto fulfill the ideals enshrined in our Nation's justice system.\n  The Nevada Justice Association is a nonprofit, professional \norganization of lawyers, united over their goal of improving the \njustice system. In addition to keeping members and other lawyers \ninformed about Nevada's legal system, the Nevada Justice Association \nseeks ``to educate the public regarding their individual rights and \nresponsibilities as citizens.'' The Nevada Justice Association also \noperates student chapters to help develop the next generation of \nlawyers and prepare them to defend Nevadans' access to justice in the \nfuture. In their effort to educate the public, the Nevada Justice \nAssociation's activities range from debunking legal myths to televising \nlecture series that explain important aspects of the law that people \nwho do not have a legal background can understand. The Nevada Justice \nAssociation's outreach and education programs also encourage citizens \nto play an active role in the lawmaking process and participate in \ncivil society.\n  For 50 years, the Nevada Justice Association has made tremendous \nadvances in educating everyday Nevadans about their legal rights. Their \ncommitment to ensuring that people have equal and lasting access to the \njustice system has helped Nevadans enjoy the protections our system of \ngovernment has to offer. I commend the Nevada Justice Association for \ntheir hard work in educating the public on their rights and protecting \npeople's access to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3635-3"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3635-S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report for June 2016. The report compares current law \nlevels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to \nin the budget resolution for fiscal year 2016, the conference report to \naccompany S. Con. Res. 11, and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, P.L. \n114-74, BBA 15. This information is necessary for the Senate Budget \nCommittee to determine whether budget points of order lie against \npending legislation. It has been prepared by the Republican staff of \nthe Senate Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \npursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  This is the fifth report that I have made this calendar year. It is \nthe second report since I filed the statutorily-required fiscal year \n2017 enforceable budget limits on April 18, 2016, pursuant to section \n102 of BBA 15, and the ninth report I have made since adoption of the \nfiscal year 2016 budget resolution on May 5, 2015. My last filing can \nbe found in the Congressional Record on May 11, 2016. The information \ncontained in this report is current through June 6, 2016.\n  Tables 1-7 of this report, which are prepared by my staff on the \nBudget Committee, remain unchanged from the May report.\n  In addition to the tables provided by the Senate Budget Committee \nRepublican staff, I am submitting additional tables from CBO that I \nwill use for enforcement of budget totals agreed to by the Congress.\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n  Because legislation can still be enacted that would have an effect on \nfiscal year 2016, CBO provided a report for both fiscal year 2016 and \nfiscal year 2017. This information is used to enforce aggregate \nspending levels in budget resolutions under section 311 of the CBA. \nCBO's estimates show that current law levels of spending for fiscal \nyear 2016 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $138.9 \nbillion in budget authority and $103.6 billion in outlays. Revenues are \n$155.2 billion below the revenue floor for fiscal year 2016 set by the \nbudget resolution. As well, Social Security outlays are at the levels \nassumed for fiscal year 2016, while Social Security revenues are $23 \nmillion below levels in the budget.\n  For fiscal year 2017, CBO estimates that current law levels are below \nthe fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing's allowable budget authority \nand outlay aggregates by $974.3 billion and $592.4 billion, \nrespectively. The allowable spending room will be reduced as \nappropriations bills for fiscal year 2017 are enacted. Revenues are at \nthe level assumed for fiscal year 2017. Finally, Social Security \noutlays and revenues are at the levels assumed in the fiscal year 2017 \nenforcement filing.\n  CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate's \npay-as-you-go rule. As part of the fiscal year 2017 enforcement filing, \nthe Senate's pay-as-you-go scorecard was reset to zero, which remains \nits current balance. The Senate's pay-as-you-go rule is enforced by \nsection 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  New to this report are two additional tables that track the Senate's \nbudget enforcement activities. The first table, Enforcement Report of \nLegislation Post-S. Con. Res. 11, fiscal year 2016 Congressional Budget \nResolution, shows the 11 levels-based points of order that were raised \nafter passage of the last budget resolution but before my April 18 \nfiling. The largest budgetary violation during that period was the \nnonappropriations portion of H.R. 2029, the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct of 2016. The final table of this filing, Enforcement Report of \nLegislation Post-Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 Enforcement Filing, \nshows the three points of order that have been raised since my April 18 \nenforcement filing. Two of those three points of order were raised \nagainst emergency designations in an appropriations bill. The first was \nraised against the emergency designation in Senator Blunt's amendment \nNo. 3900, that provided $1.1 billion to address the Zika virus. This \npoint of order was waived with 70 votes. The second was raised against \nthe emergency designation in Senator McCain's amendment No. 4039, that \nwould increase spending by $7.7 billion for the Veterans Choice \nProgram. This point of order was waived with 84 votes.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE\n                   (+) OR BELOW (-)

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a copy of my remarks from earlier today at the Barbara \nBush Foundation for Family Literacy's Conversation on the Future of \nAdult Literacy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n              BARBARA BUSH FOUNDATION FOR FAMILY LITERACY\n\n       Mr. ALEXANDER. I'm glad to be invited to join the \n     conversation on adult literacy and to do as my late friend \n     Alex Haley used to say, ``Find the good and praise it,'' \n     especially about Barbara Bush. Tomorrow, one of the speakers \n     you're going to hear, Jon Meacham, just finished his book, a \n     biography of George H. W. Bush, and had the extraordinary \n     opportunity to go through the personal diaries of Barbara and \n     President Bush going back to the 1960s. I don't know any \n     other biographer who's had that kind of access to that much \n     material. The name of the book is ``Destiny and Power.'' I \n     have a friend in Nashville who says that a better name for \n     the book would be ``The Last Gentleman.'' I think an even \n     better name for the book would be ``The Last Gentleman and \n     His Lady,'' and perhaps the best name for the book would be \n     ``The Last Gentleman and His Very Independent Lady'' because \n     as we all know Barbara Bush was and is a very independent \n     lady. I know that from experience.\n       In 1991, it was a sunny day on the South Lawn of the White \n     House, and President Bush was walking out to announce his \n     program to help give scholarships to low-income children so \n     they could choose schools. It was called the ``GI Bill for \n     Kids'' and President and Mrs. Bush were walking along toward \n     the event, and I was with them and Barbara looked at the \n     president and said, ``You've got on the wrong pants.'' He had \n     one suit coat on and different pants on. She insisted that he \n     turn around and go back into the White House and change his \n     clothes before making his announcement.\n       On another occasion, the President and Mrs. Bush invited \n     Honey and me to go with them one evening to Ford's Theatre. \n     When we arrived there in the presidential limousine, the \n     Secret Service opened the door and the President got out \n     first and Barbara said, ``I'll get the door, George.''\n       On another occasion, I was sitting with them and I forget \n     what it was, he may have been vice president then, but he was \n     called on to speak unexpectedly and he leaned over to Barbara \n     and said, ``What should I speak about?'' and she said, \n     ``About five minutes, George.'' So she is a very independent \n     lady.\n       Before we go much further in this discussion about adult \n     literacy, let's recognize that today is our lady's 91st \n     birthday.\n       As was mentioned, I was education secretary in 1991 when \n     the National Literacy Act was enacted. Let's use Barbara \n     Bush's own words to describe the event--you'll find them in \n     her memoir. She wrote, ``I must say, I got more credit than I \n     deserved.'' I don't agree with that, but, she continued, ``I \n     heard that George was going to give the pen to me, but before \n     he could, Senator Simon spoke up and said, `That pen ought to \n     go to Barbara.' I donated it to the George Bush Presidential \n     Library Center. In the end, however, it's not pens and \n     pictures that count; it's the National Literacy Act that \n     really counts. It was the first piece of legislation--and, to \n     date, the only one--ever enacted specifically for literacy \n     with the goal of ensuring that every American adult acquires \n     the basic literacy skills necessary to achieve the greatest \n     possible satisfaction professionally and personally. But even \n     more than that, the act seeks to strengthen our nation by \n     giving us more productive workers and informed citizens.'' \n     That was Barbara Bush's memoir.\n       Three years before that, in 1988, the year President George \n     H. W. Bush was elected, the Saturday Evening Post did a cover \n     story on Barbara and her passion for literacy. The writer \n     told a story of JT Pace, the 63-year-old son of a former \n     sharecropper who had just learned to read and was invited to \n     read the Preamble to the Constitution on a televised program \n     celebrating the bicentennial of the Constitution as well as \n     the cause of literacy. When Mr. Pace arrived in St. Louis for \n     the event, he discovered there were a few words in the \n     Preamble that he couldn't read. Right when he decided he \n     couldn't participate, Pace was introduced to Barbara Bush. \n     She put him at ease and asked if they might read the Preamble \n     together. The reporter writes: ``That evening, they stood \n     together on the podium and slowly began to read the Preamble. \n     JT mumbled some of the difficult words; gradually Barbara \n     Bush's voice subsided as JT gained confidence and finished \n     his reading in a strong voice, his eyes glistening with \n     tears.'' That was the story from the Saturday Evening Post.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n       How important it is for the future of our country that \n     adult Americans will be able to read our Constitution and \n     understand that we are united by our principles and what \n     those principles are--and not by our ethnicity. It's an \n     important reminder to think about the fact that if you move \n     to say, Japan, you can't become Japanese, really, but if you \n     move to America and embrace our principles, you are an \n     American.\n       In 1989, President George H. W. Bush did an extraordinary \n     thing. He convened a meeting of all the governors in \n     Charlottesville. The governors do not get together for a \n     single purpose like that very much in history. They \n     established voluntary, I underline voluntary, national goals. \n     In 1991, by then I had been invited to be education \n     secretary, the president announced America 2000, to move the \n     nation voluntarily toward those goals state by state, \n     community by community. America 2000 had six goals, and one \n     of those was to increase adult literacy. We said then that a \n     ``Nation at Risk'' must become a ``Nation of Students.'' In \n     1991, Congress passed the National Literacy Act. That act \n     increased authorization of literacy programs, established a \n     National Institute for Literacy, authorized state literacy \n     resource centers, created national workforce demonstration \n     projects, literacy programs for some incarcerated \n     individuals, and required ``Gateway Grants'' to public \n     housing authorities.\n       Today, we continue to focus on literacy. The National \n     Literacy Act was most recently reauthorized, as we say in \n     Congress, in 2014 as a part of the Workforce Innovation and \n     Opportunity Act. Then, in December, as was mentioned, we \n     passed a law to fix No Child Left Behind. That included \n     several references to encourage literacy, by innovative, \n     competitive literacy programs, allowing states and schools to \n     use federal money in all their formula programs on improving \n     the literacy skills of students and defining reading and \n     literacy activities as part of a well-rounded education.\n       We are all very fortunate that Barbara Bush is still as \n     active in her pursuit of literacy for all as she used to be, \n     and we honor her lifetime of work by gathering here for this \n     conversation today. Last year, on her 90th birthday, she \n     announced the $7 million Barbara Bush Adult Literacy XPRIZE. \n     This global competition challenges teams from around the \n     world to develop an app that will help people learn to read \n     by just using their smartphone. There are currently 109 teams \n     from 15 countries working on this. Barbara has always been \n     able to see what's important, what endures--while also \n     looking forward to the future with optimism and wit. It \n     reminds me of the story that Jon Meacham tells in the \n     biography of President H. W. Bush that I had mentioned \n     earlier.\n       He writes of a ``generational controversy'' that Barbara \n     Bush endured in May 1990. ``Generational controversy'' are \n     Meacham's words; he always comes up with good, big words. It \n     was during the visit by Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife to the \n     White House to see the President and Mrs. Bush. According to \n     Meacham, ``Mrs. Bush was invited by Wellesley College to \n     speak at graduation and receive an honorary degree; the First \n     Lady was being criticized by Wellesley's young women, as \n     President Bush put into his diary `because she hasn't made it \n     on her own--she's where she is because she's her husband's \n     wife. What's wrong with the fact that she's a good mother, a \n     good wife, great volunteer, great leader for literacy and \n     other fine causes? Nothing. But to listen to these elitist \n     kids there is.' Mrs. Bush invited [Mrs.] Gorbachev along with \n     her to Wellesley. There, the American First Lady confronted \n     the issues of work versus family and the role of women head-\n     on, delivering a well-received commencement address.'' This \n     is what Barbara Bush said: `` `Maybe we should adjust faster, \n     maybe we should adjust slower,' she told the graduates. `But \n     whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never \n     change: fathers and mothers. If you have children, they must \n     come first. You must read to your children, and you must hug \n     your children, and you must love your children.

Mr. President, today, I wish to commemorate Michael \nFeldman's Whad'Ya Know, the live, 2-hour weekly Wisconsin public radio \nprogram as it nears the end of production after a tremendously \nentertaining 31-year run.\n  Michael, a Milwaukee native, University of Wisconsin graduate, and \nself-described ``kosher beefcake,'' created one of the most successful \nprograms in WPR history. Broadcasting live from their radio home at \nMonona Terrace in my hometown of Madison, WI, Michael and his team have \nfound a home on Saturday morning in the hearts of millions of people. \nThey have brought their listeners a uniquely Wisconsin blend of humor, \ntaking us on a trip into the Whad'Ya Know world of comedy, satire, \nquizzes and interviews. From covering ``all the news that isn't'' to \ndelighting audiences across the country on his road show tours, Michael \nhas established this show as a reason to get out of bed early on \nSaturday and a good excuse to put off shoveling snow.\n  I am pleased to honor the work of Michael Feldman and all who have \ncontributed to the success of Whad'Ya Know. They should all be proud of \nthe joy they have brought to so many. When asked about the show, \nMichael has commented, ``It may be called Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya \nKnow?, but it really has been Everybody Who Listens And Comes To The \nShows's Whad'Ya Know?'' With that being said, after Whad'Ya Know airs \nits final broadcast on June 25, 2016, Wisconsinites across the State \nwill be missing a longstanding part of our community. We may laugh a \nlittle less, but we will never forget all the smiles he put on people's \nfaces.\n  It has been my delight to be a featured guest on Whad'Ya Know several \ntimes, and I will appear for the last time on June 11, 2016. I wish \nMichael and the entire Whad'Ya Know staff all the best for their \nremaining shows and for their future plans.\n  With the end of this show, there is only one question left to ask and \none answer to give:\n  Well, whad'ya know?\n  Not much, you?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3640-1"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOB BURG\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes \nand recognize an outstanding achievement by one of my constituents, Mr. \nBob Burg. His story offers us a good lesson about perseverance and the \nimportance of lifelong learning. His story should inspire others.\n  After dropping out of school in the 11th grade, Mr. Burg went on to \nserve in the Air Force for 4 years. Following his service in the Air \nForce, he worked for 35 years in his family business. Eventually, Mr. \nBurg retired from that position saying, ``I had nothing to do. I have \nplenty of hobbies, but you can only fill up your life so much with \nhobbies.''\n  Instead, he felt that retirement left a void in his life, so Mr. Burg \ndecided to fill the void by enrolling at the University of South \nCarolina in Columbia.\n  Mr. Burg, then age 74, said he wasn't the best student in high school \nmany years ago. In fact, he admitted his academic shortcomings in his \nyounger days.\n  Mr. Burg also shared some humorous observations about what it was \nlike to go back to college and be surrounded by fellow students several \ndecades younger: ``I walked into school and one of the young girls \nsaid, `Mr. Burg, are you over 60?' I laughed and said `honey, you were \nin diapers when I turned 60.' ''\n  Well, I am proud to report that Mr. Burg, now age 78, just graduated \nfrom the University of South Carolina with a degree in history. His \nstory serves as an example to us all that education, whether in life or \nthe classroom, can be a lifelong endeavor.\n  In his nearly eight decades of life he has earned many titles--\nveteran who served his Nation, valued employee in the family business, \nretiree, and now his newest title--college graduate.\n  Job well done, Mr. Burg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3640-2"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3640-S3641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO ANNE GRIFFITH AND RECOGNIZING MAINE'S LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                               COMMUNITY\n\n Mr. KING. Mr. President, this past May, members of Maine's law \nenforcement community gathered with the members of the public at Mount \nHope Cemetery in Augusta to honor the more than 80 officers who have \ngiven their lives in the line of duty.\n  In Maine, where we have more than 2,000 sworn police officers, this \nceremony is both a longstanding and cherished tradition, and this year \nrepresented the 25th consecutive time that the Maine Chiefs of Police \nAssociation and the Maine Sheriffs Association\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nhave come together in commemoration of their fallen brethren.\n  But for one person, this year's ceremony also marked a different \nanniversary.\n  Anne Griffith, whom many of us know more affectionately as Woolie, \nwas just 3 years old when on April 15, 1996, her father, Maine State \ntrooper James ``Drew'' Griffith, was killed in a car accident while \npursuing a speeding vehicle. I first met Woolie in the days that \nfollowed--at her father's funeral, as she endured an experience that no \nchild should have to and as I, then Governor, attempted to convey the \ndeep gratitude of a State that mourned alongside her.\n  She was strong then, just as she is strong now. Woolie is now 25 \nyears old, and this year marks two decades since her father's death--\nand in that time, she has grown into a wonderful young woman--raised by \nher mother, Maine Warden Chaplain Kate Braestrup.\n  In a remarkable testament to her fortitude and strength of character, \nWoolie several years ago made the conscious decision to follow in her \nfather's footsteps by entering the ranks of the Maine State police. \nToday, she serves as an investigative analyst for the Maine State \nPolice Computer Crimes Unit, donning the same blue uniform once worn so \nproudly by her father; surrounded by many of the same dedicated public \nservants who stood beside him years ago.\n  Woolie spoke at the Maine Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Service \nin May. Her words were a powerful tribute to the law enforcement \ncommunity, not only because they speak so well to their constant and \never-present work and vigilance to keep us safe, but also because they \nso aptly capture the unfailing love and kindness that too often is \noverlooked today.\n  I deeply hope that future generations of Americans may look at her \nfather's life, his legacy, and her tribute to him and to the law \nenforcement community and come to more deeply understand and appreciate \nthe sacrifices of those who protect us every day.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Anne Griffith's remarks at the Maine Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Service on May 19, 2016, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                             [May 19, 2016]\n\n                   Good Hope Cemetery--Augusta, Maine\n\n                           (By Anne Griffith)\n\n       Good morning,\n       My name is Anne Griffith. I am the youngest of four \n     children of Maine Warden Chaplain Kate Braestrup and fallen \n     Maine State Trooper Drew Griffith.\n       It is a privilege to stand with you, and honor my father \n     today. On behalf of the families of the fallen, I thank you \n     all for being here.\n       As the youngest of Drew's children, I was three years old \n     when my dad died, too young to form clear memories.\n       I did not have much of a chance to experience him as a \n     father, and my memories of him are vague and uncertain.\n       What I had, growing up, were stories--stories of his \n     intelligence, his kindness, and his humor--told to me by \n     those who had known him well: my mother, and my siblings of \n     course, my family . . . and my blue family, too. Law \n     enforcement officers who worked with Dad supported us, shared \n     our sadness and kept us close over the years, caring for him \n     by caring for us. They, too, gave me my father in stories.\n       And so, two decades later I am still a part of that blue \n     family.\n       In 2014 I worked as a Reserve Patrol Officer. During this \n     time, I thought often of my dad. I got a glimpse of him--his \n     sorrows and satisfactions--through performing the tasks that \n     he performed; I placed handcuffs on offenders while they \n     fought me.\n       I performed CPR on two victims . . . and could not save \n     them.\n       I helped in preventing the suicide of a mentally ill woman.\n       For the past year, I have worked as an Investigative \n     Analyst for the Computer Crimes Unit. During this time I have \n     assisted in a variety of cases from child pornography \n     possession to child molestation offenses.\n       Because of the nature of my work for the Unit, I can \n     definitively point to particular cases and know for certain \n     that I made a difference in the outcome of the investigation. \n     There is a satisfaction in this that my father felt . . . and \n     I have felt it, too.\n       I know there is no greater sense of honor and purpose than \n     participating in the protection of innocent human lives. This \n     is what my father died doing.\n       Besides working with an incredible team, I am fortunate to \n     work closely with those who knew and loved my father--Lt. \n     Glenn Lang who helped to carry his casket, Sgt. Laurie \n     Northrup who once told me her last conversation with my dad \n     was of how much he loved his wife and children; Computer \n     Analyst Andrea Donovan, who worked as a State Police \n     Dispatcher and heard my Dad sign on 10-8, and sign off 10-7.\n       I am able to know my father through them, just as they are \n     able to know him through me.\n       April 15, 2016 marked the 20th Anniversary of my father's \n     line of duty death.\n       To mark the day, I went for a run.\n       A sergeant of the Maine State Police K9 Unit, and a \n     recently graduated State Trooper ran with me, in the area \n     where I grew up--and Dad's patrol area.\n       We ended up at Marshall Point Lighthouse in Port Clyde, \n     where a bench dedicated in my father's name is placed. The \n     sky was clear blue and the air was crisp with salt from the \n     nearby ocean.\n       Neither the sergeant nor the brand-new trooper had ever \n     shaken my father's hand, or laughed at his jokes. Still, they \n     are his family, they are his brothers. They ran with him by \n     running with me.\n       The law enforcement family is large; it crosses state lines \n     and international borders. Though my siblings and I lost our \n     father, we did not lose our connection to his legacy, nor the \n     family he became a part of when he joined the Maine State \n     Police in 1986. I know who my father was because I know you--\n     his brothers and sisters in uniform, intelligent, good-\n     humored and kind--who continue to serve and protect the \n     people of Maine and of the United States. In honoring my \n     father today, I honor you.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3640-3"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3641-S3642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   100TH ANNIVERSARY OF SINCLAIR OIL\n\n Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Mike Crapo, I wish to recognize and celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of Sinclair Oil Corporation. A family-owned company, \nSinclair Oil is one of the oldest continuously operated brands in the \noil business.\n  On May 1, 1916, Harry F. Sinclair founded the Sinclair Oil and \nRefining Corporation. Three years later, the company had grown to four \ntimes its original size. In the 1920s, Sinclair introduced America to \nthe ``first modern service station,'' providing people and families \nwith a place to get an oil change, fix minor vehicle repairs, and \npublic restrooms that motorists could use. By creating a modern service \nstation, Sinclair paved the way for the American road trip.\n  The Great Depression was a time of growth for Sinclair Oil as they \nbought companies that were going under. If not for Sinclair, these \ncompanies would have completely disappeared, taking away countless jobs \nand revenue for local communities. In 1930, Dino the Dinosaur became \nthe company's mascot and logo. To this day, Dino remains a visible \nfixture in Idaho and all across the Rocky Mountain region. During World \nWar II, Sinclair supported the Allies with high-octane fuel, tankers, \nand more.\n  After Harry F. Sinclair retired as president in January 1949, the \ncompany had several different owners including Atlantic Richfield \nCompany and PASCO, Inc., until 1976, when Robert Earl Holding acquired \nSinclair Oil. Known for his steadiness and warmth, Earl Holding made \nSinclair feel like a mom-and-pop business. Further testament to Earl \nHolding and his legacy, Dale Ensign, former executive president of \nSinclair, once said ``the employees learned over a period of time that \nhe would do what he said he would do.''\n  Earl Holding was actively involved in the management and leadership \nof Sinclair Oil until 2009. Currently, the Holding family continues to \nown and run the business under the leadership of Mr. Ross Matthews, CEO \nand chairman of the board of Sinclair Oil Corporation.\n  Today Sinclair Oil Corporation includes more than 1,300 Sinclair-\nbranded stations in 24 States, mostly west of the Mississippi River, \nand is the largest refinery operation in the Rocky Mountain region. In \naddition to being a fully integrated oil company, Sinclair also has \nhospitality and ranching ventures, including the Grand America Hotel in \nSalt Lake City, the Little America hotels and travel centers, the \nWestgate Hotel in San Diego, and Sun Valley Resort in my home State, \nIdaho.\n  So today we recognize Sinclair Oil Corporation for achieving this \nhistoric 100-year milestone and applaud their entire community for the \ncontributions they have made to Idaho and across our country throughout \nthe years.\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3641-1"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO W. EDGAR WELDEN\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Edgar \nWelden of Birmingham, AL, for being named the Alabama Sports Hall of \nFame's 2016 ``Distinguished American Sportsman.'' Edgar is a \ndistinguished businessman and friend whose life has been marked by \nservice to the people of his community, State, and Nation. His untiring \nwork to benefit young people through athletics makes him most deserving \nof this honor.\n  Edgar has an extraordinary record of accomplishment. A Wetumpka \nnative, he grew up with a great passion for sports, playing football, \nbaseball, and basketball in high school before earning a degree from \nthe University of Alabama. His passion for athletics has only grown \nsince then. In fact, he spent 1997 traveling to seven continents and \nall 50 states to attend more than 250 sporting events, and he \nchronicled his journeys in his book ``Time Out! A Sports Fan's Dream \nYear.''\n  One of his most valuable contributions to Alabama was his service as \ndirector of the important Alabama Development Office and the Alabama \nDepartment of Economic and Community Affairs and as special assistant \nto the Governor for Economic Affairs. He has been widely recognized as \none of the key players in Governor Guy Hunt's successful first term. \nThis work for the State, performed on a volunteer basis, earned him \nrecognition in 1987 by the Alabama Broadcasters Association as \nAlabama's Citizen of the Year. In 1988, he was appointed by Governor \nHunt as voluntary chairman of the Alabama Reunion, a 2-year statewide \ncelebration and promotion of the State's heritage and economic \ndevelopment opportunities. As the architect of this nationally \nrecognized program, he was awarded the 1992 National Governor's \nAssociation Award for Distinguished Service to State Government.\n  Despite his impressive accomplishments in government, business, and \npolitics, it is through athletics that he has had perhaps his greatest \ninfluence. Edgar has a special place in his heart for young people, and \nwith his keen insight, he has found ways to utilize athletics to \npromote character and education and improve the lives of young people \nacross our State.\n  His accomplishments in this regard are too many to list \ncomprehensively. His work with high school athletics includes the \nCrippled Children's Foundation, where he currently serves as chairman, \nand the Monday Morning Quarterback Club, where he is a board member. In \n2002, he founded the nonprofit Birmingham Athletic Partnership to \nsupport the city's middle and high school athletic programs. This \nprogram has provided Birmingham city schools with over $3.5 million in \nfinancial support. Edgar believes that children in the inner city \nshould have the same chances for athletic success as better funded \nprograms and his goal is to ensure their athletes, bands, and \ncheerleaders are able to compete on a level playing field. In addition, \nsince 2003, he has served as the chairman and president of the hugely \nsuccessful Bryant-Jordan Scholarship Program, which has awarded over $9 \nmillion college scholarships to more than 2,700 student-athletes in \nAlabama who excelled athletically and scholastically while overcoming \nadversity. In 2006, he was appointed by President George W. Bush to \nserve as a member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness & \nSports.\n  Edgar also serves as chairman of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame \nMuseum, a true State treasure which maintains for generations to come \nthe stories of legendary Alabama athletes whose stories never fail to \ninspire us today. Many say it is the best sports hall of fame in \nAmerica. And in a great victory for the city of Birmingham, he \ncochaired the committee that landed the 2021 World Games. This was a \nhuge effort to land this event, and Edgar used all his energy and \npeople skills to do so. He was inducted into the Alabama High School \nSports Hall of Fame in 2007 and was recently elected to the board of \ndirectors of the National Football Foundation. Indeed, while he would \nnever say so himself, perhaps no other sportsman in the country has \ndone more for their State than Edgar has for Alabama.\n  Edgar also serves on the president's cabinet at the University of \nAlabama and, in 2010, was honored with the Distinguished Alumnus Award. \nHe has accomplished all of this while building a successful business \ncareer in real estate development and property management. An essential \npart of his success has been the support and partnership of his \nwonderful wife, Louise. She is a star in her own right and has always \nenjoyed seeing young people grow and progress. They are a great pair. \nEdgar and Louise get great pleasure out of random acts of kindness. On \na plane flight, Edgar met the wife of a soldier that was returning from \ncombat--so typical of his generosity, Edgar arranged for them to have \nthe honeymoon suite in his hotel for free. Edgar and Louise are people \nof generosity, patriotism, and positive spirit. To know Edgar and \nLouise is to love them.\n  For all of his accomplishments, I commend and congratulate my friend \ntoday. Being named to receive the Distinguished American Sportsman \nAward is a fitting honor indeed. It is appropriate that our Nation \npauses periodically to recognize, celebrate, and give thanks to \ncitizens like Edgar and Louise whose lives make our country so \nwonderful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3642-1"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:20 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 87.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISRAEL \n                   AND THE PALESTINIANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Government has a longstanding \n     position that a peaceful resolution of the conflict between \n     Israel and the Palestinians can only be achieved through \n     direct negotiations between the two parties.\n       (2) The Palestinians have been pursuing a strategy to seek \n     recognition of a Palestinian state through the United \n     Nations, the United Nations specialized agencies, and the \n     United Nations affiliated organizations.\n       (3) On March 17, 2016, the ``State of Palestine'' became a \n     party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change (UNFCCC) as its 197th member.\n       (4) Section 414 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \n     Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law 101-246; 22 U.S.C. \n     287e note) states the following: ``No funds authorized to be \n     appropriated by this Act or any other Act shall be available \n     for the United Nations or any specialized agency thereof \n     which accords the Palestine Liberation Organization the same \n     standing as member states.''\n       (5) Section 410 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, \n     Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995 (Public Law 103-236; 22 U.S.C. \n     287e note) states the following: ``The United States shall \n     not make any voluntary or assessed contribution: (1) to any \n     affiliated organization of the United Nations which grants \n     full membership as a state to any organization or group that \n     does not have the internationally recognized attributes of \n     statehood, or (2) to the United Nations, if the United \n     Nations grants full membership as a state in the United \n     Nations to any organization or group that does not have the \n     internationally recognized attributes of statehood, during \n     any period in which such membership is effective.''\n       (6) The provisions described in paragraphs (4) and (5) may \n     not be waived.\n       (7) The administration of President Barack Obama has \n     asserted that those provisions do not apply to the UNFCCC \n     because, according to Department of State spokesman John \n     Kirby, ``The UNFCCC is a treaty, and the Palestinians' \n     purported accession does not involve their becoming members \n     of any U.N. specialized agency or, indeed, any international \n     organization.''\n       (8) Treaties can create international organizations, as \n     demonstrated by the case of the Charter of the United \n     Nations, which is a treaty that created the United Nations \n     organization.\n       (9) Current United States law often treats entities created \n     by international treaties as international organizations, \n     such as the International Organizations Immunity Act (Public \n     Law 79-291), under which the Executive branch has designated \n     the International Boundary and Water Commission of the United \n     States and Mexico, which was created by United States and \n     Mexico international boundary treaties to assist in their \n     implementation.\n       (10) The UNFCCC established an international organization \n     based in Bonn, Germany that employs approximately 500 people \n     from over 100 countries and has an annual budget in excess of \n     $60,000,000.\n       (11) The operating entities of the UNFCCC constitute an \n     ``affiliated organization of the United Nations'' in that the \n     UNFCCC Secretariat is connected and linked to the United \n     Nations in many ways, including the following:\n       (A) The United Nations Secretary-General appoints the \n     executive secretary of the UNFCCC secretariat.\n       (B) At the first Conference of the Parties, the UNFCCC \n     decided that its secretariat ``shall be institutionally \n     linked to the United Nations''. According to the UNFCCC \n     website, it remains ``institutionally linked'' today.\n       (C) The United Nations serves as Depository for the UNFCCC, \n     the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement.\n       (D) The proposed budget of the United Nations for the \n     biennium 2016-2017 supports the UNFCCC.\n       (E) The United Nations Campus in Bonn, Germany houses the \n     UNFCCC secretariat, which the United Nations lists as one of \n     18 organizations that represent it and that are part of the \n     ``United Nations presence'' in Bonn.\n       (F) The UNFCCC secretariat is subject to United Nations \n     rules and regulations regarding procurement and other \n     matters.\n       (G) The UNFCCC secretariat supports what it describes as \n     the ``largest annual United\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n     Nations conference,'' which is the Conference of Parties.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its longstanding position that the only true \n     and lasting path to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian \n     conflict is through direct negotiations between Israel and \n     the Palestinians;\n       (2) reiterates its strong opposition to any attempt to \n     establish or seek recognition of a Palestinian state outside \n     of an agreement negotiated between leaders in Israel and the \n     Palestinians;\n       (3) strongly opposes the unilateral actions of the \n     Palestinians to seek statehood recognition through the United \n     Nations, United Nations specialized agencies, United Nations \n     affiliated organizations, and United Nations treaties, \n     conventions, and agreements;\n       (4) calls on the President to hold the Palestinians \n     accountable for their actions to undermine and circumvent the \n     peace process;\n       (5) strongly supports the prohibition on United States \n     funding going to any United Nations affiliated organization \n     that grants full membership as a state to any organization or \n     group that does not have the internationally recognized \n     attributes of statehood; and\n       (6) reaffirms that, under United States law, the United \n     States is prohibited from making any disbursements of United \n     States funds to the UNFCCC secretariat, the Green Climate \n     Fund, the Conference of the Parties, and the Conference of \n     the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the \n     Kyoto Protocol after the ``State of Palestine'' was allowed \n     to become a full member of the UNFCCC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4562.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED TO ADDRESS \n                   THE NATIONAL SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF CLIMATE \n                   CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review concluded that--\n       (A) ``[t]he impacts of climate change may increase the \n     frequency, scale, and complexity of future missions, \n     including defense support to civil authorities, while at the \n     same time undermining the capacity of our domestic \n     installations to support training activities''; and\n       (B) the effects of climate change on severe weather, sea \n     levels, and availability of fresh water represent ``threat \n     multipliers that will aggravate stressors abroad such as \n     poverty, environmental degradation, political instability, \n     and social tensions - conditions that can enable terrorist \n     activity and other forms of violence'';\n       (2) in the foreword to the 2014 Department of Defense \n     Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap, former Secretary of \n     Defense Chuck Hagel wrote that climate change ``has the \n     potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing \n     with today - from infectious disease to terrorism. . . . \n     Rising global temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, \n     climbing sea levels, and more extreme weather events will \n     intensify the challenges of global instability, hunger, \n     poverty, and conflict'';\n       (3) the 2014 Climate Change Adaptation Roadmap--\n       (A) found that the effects of climate change could cause \n     instability around the world ``by impairing access to food \n     and water, damaging infrastructure, spreading disease, \n     uprooting and displacing large numbers of people, compelling \n     mass migration, interrupting commercial activity, or \n     restricting electricity availability''; and\n       (B) judged that ``these developments could undermine \n     already-fragile governments that are unable to respond \n     effectively or challenge currently-stable governments, as \n     well as increasing competition and tension between countries \n     vying for limited resources'';\n       (4) the 2015 National Security Strategy states that \n     ``climate change is an urgent and growing threat to our \n     national security, contributing to increased natural \n     disasters, refugee flows, and conflicts over basic resources \n     like food and water'';\n       (5) the 2015 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review \n     asserts that ``climate change exacerbates our greatest \n     vulnerabilities'';\n       (6) the 2013 Department of Homeland Security Climate Action \n     Plan notes that--\n       (A) some weather effects related to climate change, such as \n     warmer temperatures and increasingly severe storms, ``may \n     cause damage or disruptions to telecommunications and power \n     systems, creating challenges for telecommunications \n     infrastructure, emergency communications, and \n     cybersecurity'';\n       (B) ``more extreme weather conditions in parts of the world \n     with limited ability to provide state aid create \n     opportunities for militant groups to become active in their \n     communities''; and\n       (C) ``[c]limate change acts as a `threat multiplier,' \n     aggravating stressors abroad such as poverty, environmental \n     degradation, and social tensions, resulting in conditions \n     that could enable terrorist activity and violence'';\n       (7) in February 2016, the Director of National \n     Intelligence, James Clapper, testified before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate that--\n       (A) ``[e]xtreme weather, climate change, environmental \n     degradation, related rising demand for food and water, poor \n     policy responses, and inadequate critical infrastructure will \n     probably exacerbate--and potentially spark--political \n     instability, adverse health conditions, and humanitarian \n     crises in 2016''; and\n       (B) ``[s]everal of these developments, especially those in \n     the Middle East, suggest that environmental degradation might \n     become a more common source for interstate tensions'';\n       (8) Department of Defense Directive 4715.21 entitled \n     ``Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience'' and promulgated \n     in January 2016 states that--\n       (A) as a matter of policy, the Department of Defense ``must \n     be able to adapt current and future operations to address the \n     impacts of climate change in order to maintain an effective \n     and efficient U.S. military''; and\n       (B) all Department of Defense mission planning and \n     execution must--\n       (i) include ``identification and assessment of the effects \n     of climate change on the DoD mission'';\n       (ii) take ``those effects into consideration when \n     developing plans and implementing procedures''; and\n       (iii) anticipate and manage ``any risks that develop as a \n     result of climate change to build resilience'';\n       (9) in the 2015 report to Congress entitled ``National \n     Security Implications of Climate-Related Risks and a Changing \n     Climate'', the Secretary of Defense--\n       (A) acknowledged ``the reality of climate change and the \n     significant risk it poses to U.S. interests globally''; and\n       (B) recognized that--\n       (i) ``[a] changing climate increases the risk of \n     instability and conflict overseas, and has implications for \n     DoD on operations, personnel, installations, and the \n     stability, development, and human security of other \n     nations''; and\n       (ii) ``[g]lobal climate change will have wide-ranging \n     implications for U.S. national security interests over the \n     foreseeable future because it will aggravate existing \n     problems--such as poverty, social tensions, environmental \n     degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political \n     institutions--that threaten domestic stability in a number of \n     countries''; and\n       (10) leading United States national security experts from \n     both major political parties, including 12 former Senators \n     and Representatives, 10 retired generals and admirals, the \n     Chair and the Vice Chair of the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred \n     to as the ``9/11 Commission''), and Cabinet and Cabinet-level \n     officials from the Carter, Reagan, George H.

Bush, and Obama Administrations, signed an open letter in \n     October 2015, stating that climate change ``is critically \n     important to the world's most experienced security planners. \n     The impacts are real, and the costs of inaction are \n     unacceptable. America's elected leaders and private sector \n     must think past tomorrow to focus on this growing problem, \n     and take action at home and abroad.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that it \n     is in the national security interests of the United States to \n     assess, plan for, and mitigate the security and strategic \n     implications of climate change.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4575.

SALE OF MULTIROLE FIGHTER AIRCRAFT TO BAHRAIN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Actions taken by the Administration have unduly delayed \n     the export of multirole fighter aircraft to Bahrain.\n       (2) Continued defense security cooperation and assistance \n     with Bahrain are critical to regional security and countering \n     the terrorist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n     (ISIS), as well as counterbalancing the influence of Iran and \n     its proxies in the region.\n       (3) Bahrain has made several of its military facilities \n     available for use by the United States military to address \n     past and current threats from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, \n     international terrorism, and piracy and smuggling in the Gulf \n     and Arabian Sea.\n       (4) Outdated Bahraini F-16 aircraft lack certain \n     capabilities, and this limits their utility in coalition \n     operations.\n       (5) For several years, Bahrain has expressed interest in \n     upgrading its existing fleet of 20 F-16 Block 40 aircraft \n     with advanced capabilities, including Active Electronically \n     Scanned Array radars.\n       (6) Bahrain submitted formal Letters of Request for these \n     upgrades, as well as for the sale of a comparable number of \n     new F-16 aircraft in November 2015.\n       (7) The upgrade and sale of F-16 aircraft to Bahrain will \n     help advance military-to-military cooperation between the \n     United States and Bahrain.\n       (8) Recent inroads by European and Russian manufacturers of \n     competitor aircraft in\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\n     the region have the potential to erode United States \n     military-to-military relations with Bahrain, and these \n     potential erosions deepen regional concerns over United \n     States policy in the Middle East generally and towards Iran \n     specifically.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a strong bilateral relationship between the United \n     States and Bahrain is critical to maintaining stability in \n     the Middle East, countering the Islamic State of Iraq and \n     Syria, mitigating further terrorist threats, and \n     counterbalancing Iran and its regional proxies;\n       (2) Bahrain and the United States share a mutual commitment \n     to regional security, counterterrorism efforts, and related \n     coalition operations; and\n       (3) the Bahraini air force needs additional advanced \n     multirole fighter aircraft in order to modernize its fleet \n     and participate in regional security initiatives and counter-\n     Islamic State of Iraq and Syria campaigns.\n       (c) Sale of Multirole Fighter Aircraft.--The President \n     shall carry out the sale of all pending foreign military \n     sales of F-16 fighter aircraft and related upgrades of \n     existing F-16 aircraft to Bahrain by not later than 30 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4586.

Nicholson Jr., former Commander of Resolute \n     Support and United States Forces-Afghanistan, General John F. \n     Campbell, and current Commander of United States Central \n     Command, General Joseph L. Votel--the senior military \n     commanders closest to the fight--have testified that the \n     security situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating and \n     support a withdrawal of United States forces from Afghanistan \n     only when conditions warrant.\n       (7) On April 19, 2016, the Taliban carried out a suicide \n     bomb and gun assault on a government security building in \n     Kabul, Afghanistan, killing at least 28 people and wounding \n     more than 320, marking the single deadliest attack in the \n     capital of Afghanistan since 2011.\n       (8) In the first three months of 2016, the United Nations \n     reported that Afghanistan documented 600 civilian deaths and \n     1,343 wounded, with almost one-third of the casualties being \n     children.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the future trajectory of security and stability in \n     Afghanistan is contingent upon the proper force levels of the \n     United States and coalition partners, which must be \n     conditions-based;\n       (2) adjustments to force levels in Afghanistan should be \n     made with all due consideration to the assessment and advice \n     of military commanders on the ground;\n       (3) decisions on force levels in Afghanistan should take \n     into account the capabilities required to preserve and \n     promote the hard-fought gains achieved over the last 15 \n     years;\n       (4) United States force levels in Afghanistan should be \n     determined in a timely manner and made known to allies and \n     partners to afford adequate planning and force generation \n     lead times;\n       (5) the United States must continue its efforts to train \n     and advise the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) in \n     warfighting functions so that they are capable of defending \n     their country and ensuring that Afghanistan never again \n     succumbs to the fate of being a terrorist safe-haven for \n     groups like the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of \n     Iraq and the Levant (ISIL);\n       (6) the United States must continue, in conjunction with \n     the Afghan National Security Forces, to operate a robust \n     counterterrorism force to deal with evolving and immediate \n     threats to the national security interests of the United \n     States;\n       (7) the decision of the President in October 2015 to \n     maintain the current United States force level of 9,800 \n     members of the Armed Forces in Afghanistan was in the \n     national security interests of the United States; and\n       (8) Congress would support the President if the President \n     decided to maintain the current level of United States forces \n     in Afghanistan and adjust such level based on conditions on \n     the ground.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4595.

Mr. President, I would like to make a couple of comments \nabout the progress of the legislation.\n  As it just happened, the majority leader has filed cloture on the \nbill, which means that if 30 hours are consumed, then we would be here \non Friday. I certainly hope that is not the case. We are negotiating \nseveral contentious issues which, if those negotiations are successful, \nI would anticipate a number of votes tomorrow morning. If we are unable \nto, then it is going to stretch out into the afternoon or even to the \nnext day for final passage.\n\n  I thank every Member who has been engaged in this process. Literally \nevery Member has had an amendment or some involvement in this issue, \nand I think that is the healthiest thing about consideration of this \nbill, which, obviously I say with some bias, is the most important \nlegislation that we take up, given that its responsibilities are to the \nmen and women who are serving in our military in harm's way in a very \ndangerous world.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and hopefully we can \nreach some agreements tonight and tomorrow to expedite the process and \nget final passage.\n  I note the presence of the Senator from Rhode Island, and I wonder if \nhe has any comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I second Senator McCain's comments about the \ncooperation and collaboration. We hope that tomorrow we can move \nforward on several amendments, and I want to join him in commending and \nthanking our colleagues for their help.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I believe we have both yielded the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/06/08/senate-section/article/S3665-4"}, {"day": "08", "month": "06", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
