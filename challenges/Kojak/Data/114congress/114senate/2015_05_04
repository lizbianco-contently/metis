Madam President, every Member of this body wants to keep \nIran from getting a nuclear weapon--everyone--Democrats, Republicans, \nand Independents. But I have to say, a number of my Republican friends \nhave shown an unusual way of showing this. The chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee worked to find a middle \nground on this bill that satisfies congressional Democrats, \nRepublicans, and the administration. It wasn't easy. In fact, it was a \nlong and difficult process. That bill came out of the committee 19 to \n0. But these two good men, the junior Senator from Maryland and the \njunior Senator from Tennessee, were able to strike a delicate balance \nthat allows Congress to vote on a final Iran agreement. They were able \nto build a consensus along the way.\n  The Corker-Cardin bill was reported out of committee unanimously. Yet \nbefore this compromise even came to the floor, certain Senate \nRepublicans were determined to destroy it. A number of Senate \nRepublicans are prioritizing Presidential politics over national \nsecurity. Others are simply trying to undermine President Obama.\n  For example, the junior Senator from Arkansas has been on record for \nmonths stating his desire to see this negotiation fail. Back in \nJanuary, before there was a framework of an agreement, he said the \nfollowing about the ongoing negotiations to stop Iran from getting a \nnuclear weapon:\n\n       The end of these negotiations isn't an unintended \n     consequence of congressional action. It is very much an \n     intended consequence.\n\n  It is there what he said, just as clear as day. The junior Senator \nfrom Arkansas and other Republicans want to see any potential agreement \nwith Iran crash and burn, even before we know what is in the final \nagreement.\n  Some Republicans have proposed poison pills--poison pill after poison \npill--to what was a noble compromise between the leaders of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Republicans have proposed 67 amendments as of \nright now. If they could, they would offer more. Democrats, on the \nother hand, do not want to upset this delicate balance. We have offered \nno amendments. Instead, we have striven to preserve the Corker-Cardin \nbill.\n  The difference, as usual, is that Democrats want to be constructive \nand Republicans continue to want to be destructive. Democrats want to \npass this bipartisan bill right now, even as the junior Senators from \nArkansas, Florida, Texas, and others work to ruin it.\n  The Senate has already voted on two poisonous amendments, and we will \nvote on more if we have to, but we don't have to. It is not necessary. \nIt is now clear opponents of the bill aren't interested in being \nreasonable. The opponents of the Corker-Cardin legislation aren't \nconcerned with finding a\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\nmiddle ground. That is why the majority leader should file cloture now \nto preserve this legislation. Destructive Members within his own party \nhave forced his hand.\n  I support the majority leader in taking this step because it is the \nonly path forward to passing this meritorious legislation. The \nexemplary work done by the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee is too important to be undone by Senators who are \nputting politics before national and global security.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2594-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Honoring Vietnam Veterans and North Dakota's Soldiers Who Lost Their \n                            Lives in Vietnam\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Madam President, today I rise to continue an effort to \nhonor the memory of the 198 North Dakotans who died while serving our \ncountry in Vietnam. As I have said in the past, we are in a period of \n13 years of recognition of the sacrifices of those Vietnam vets based \non a proclamation signed by the President. I think it is only \nappropriate that we recognize not only those who were killed in action \nbut also our living Vietnam vets who add so strongly to the fabric of \nour society and our culture.\n  First, I would like to recognize a Vietnam veteran who is making a \ndifference each and every day, my good friend Rick Olek. He served in \nthe U.S. Army in Vietnam. He spent 20 years in the National Guard and \nover 30 years as a U.S. Postal Service letter carrier. He served on \nNorth Dakota's Administrative Committee on Veterans Affairs and as \npresident of the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council. Today, he \ngrills a top-notch steak at the AMVETS.\n  I also want to again thank the Bismarck High School 11th graders and \ntheir teachers for helping me to research these fallen heroes and to \nreach out to their families. These students contacted the family of \nGeorge Valker III as part of their project and shared their research \nwith my office. I know that this experience for these students has \nenriched not only my efforts here but enriched their lives as well.\n  I want the family members, friends, and fellow veterans of the men I \nhonor today to know that it is not easy to narrow the facts of each \nman's life. In fact, I believe a book could be written about every one \nof them. I am touched that so many family and friends have opened up to \nus to talk about their loved ones.\n\n\n                            Gerald Coulthart\n\n  We are going to start with Gerald Coulthart.

Before leaving for \nVietnam, Gerald shared a premonition with his sister Serene that he \nwould not be alive the next time they would be together. Despite his \nfeeling, Gerald was glad to go, saying it was better it be he than a \nguy with kids and a family and a wife.\n\n  Gerald's fellow soldier, Michael Matthews, recounted that Gerald died \n6 weeks into his tour in Vietnam, when Firebase Carolyn came under \nrocket attack.\n\n\n                          Stephen Eichelberger\n\n  Stephen Eichelberger was from Fargo and was born September 26, 1946. \nHe served in the Marine Corps in the 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. \nStephen died on May 16, 1967.

He served \nin the Army's 1st Infantry Division. He was only 20 years old when he \ndied on January 18, 1967.\n  Thomas was 1 of 11 children. His sister closest in age, Margaret, \nremembers Thomas as a kind, gentle young man. She told of how he would \noften scrub the floors in their home to help his mother.\n  Thomas was such an important part of the sports teams in high school \nthat after he fell off a scaffolding while working on the family's \nhouse, the school superintendent was upset that Thomas chose to have \nsurgery for the chipped bone in his arm and wouldn't be able to play.\n\n\n                             Richard Orsund\n\n  Richard Orsund was from Grafton and was born on July 19, 1947.

He worked a part-time job after school. \nSo, in order to practice for track, he woke up early every morning and \nran 4 miles around the family's section of land.\n  Richard believed he would eventually be drafted. So after 1 year of \ncollege, he enlisted in the Army.\n  At Richard's funeral, the church and basement were both overflowing, \nwith some people standing outside listening.\n\n\n                      Ronald ``Ronnie'' Stoltenow\n\n  Ronald ``Ronnie'' Stoltenow was from Hankinson and was born on June \n29, 1947.

We are so grateful for their \nsacrifice, and it is so important that we remember this sacrifice \nduring this period of remembrance of the Vietnam war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Wasteful Spending\n\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, today I return to the floor of the Senate \nfor my ninth installment of ``Waste of the Week.'' I think the \nPresiding Officer has been here for most of those nine installments.\n  My purpose has been straightforward: to highlight waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Federal spending. So far, we have reached a potential taxpayer \nsavings of almost $50 billion. I have a chart here which shows the \never-increasing amount of red ink, representing waste of taxpayers' \ndollars, caused by fraud and abuse and waste from programs that simply \nhaven't proven their effectiveness. We are on the way to $100 billion. \nToday we are going to reach and go over the halfway mark. We are going \nto continue to do this, and, hopefully, we will be extending this chart \nin the future, which now shows just some examples of what we have \nprovided before.\n  The largest example of waste, fraud, and abuse disclosed was found in \nthe refundable child care tax credit to the tune of $20 billion in \npotential savings.\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\nThese are from people who did not qualify--they were ineligible for \nreceipt--yet over a 10-year period of time, they will receive $20 \nbillion which they are not entitled to.\n  The smallest but by far the most inexplicable--and even laughable and \nludicrous--example of waste was a $387,000 grant for a study to \ndetermine whether massages on New Zealand rabbits after strenuous \nexercise would help their recovery time. Now, anybody who has been out \nin the yard, fixing around the house doing strenuous activity, when \nasked if they think a massage would help them recover, probably is \ngoing to say yes. In fact, the rabbits were getting it four times a \nday. While they couldn't say yes, I think the response clearly was that \nthis is a pretty good deal. Unfortunately, it costs the taxpayer \n$387,000 in grant money to prove that, yes, the massages helped after \nstrenuous exercises. It is not exactly what the taxpayer had in mind. \nWhen they sent their tax dollars to Washington. When they paid their \ntaxes on April 15 and filed their return--that is not exactly what they \nwere sending their money to Washington to do. Is it laughable? Yes. Is \nit tragic? Yes. We are spending significant amounts of money and it is \ngoing to waste, fraud, and abuse. By the way, the rabbits were all \neuthanized after the results, so they enjoyed the massages, but it \ndidn't last and they are no longer with us.\n  Perhaps the most important example of waste was to protect Americans \nfrom identity theft and taxpayers from fraud. By correcting Social \nSecurity records, we could save at least $2 billion. This is the famous \nMethuselah example. The Social Security Administration had not deleted \nthe Social Security numbers of those who had died. The number is \nstaggering. It was 6.5 million, I believe--the number of people who \nwould have exceeded the age of 112 years. In other words, they applied \nfor Social Security back in the early 1930s or mid-1930s when the \nprogram began, but their numbers were never erased. They were then used \nfor fraud. The savings, if we could correct that problem--and I have \nproposed legislation to do so--would be $2 billion.\n  This week, I wish to speak about the Department of Agriculture. Now, \nbeing from a State such as Indiana, agriculture is obviously very \nimportant and I am a strong supporter of Hoosier farming. I fight for \nfamily farms as they seek to survive from generation to generation. I \nsupport cutting redtape and Federal mandates that unnecessarily burden \nHoosier farmers.\n  As a broader issue, I recognize that food production is extremely \nimportant not only for our own benefit but rises to the level of even \nbeing an issue of national security. But that is not what I am talking \nabout today.\n  Today, I wish to speak about taxpayer dollars that are being used to \nfund grants not for farming but for marketing. Let me give some \nexamples. U.S. law currently on the books creates a grant program \nrequiring that the ``Secretary of Agriculture shall award competitive \ngrants in developing a business plan for viable marketing \nopportunities.'' Well, there is a real question as to whether this \nought to be mandated through the Federal Government; that is, should \nthe government select those who apply for grants to develop a marketing \nprogram. The problem is that very few end up with the grants, but for \nthose who do, it is a special deal for them. Winners and losers really \nshouldn't be selected by the Federal Government for a grant that \ndoesn't go directly to production but actually goes to marketing of \nagricultural goods.\n  Let me give an example. One of the winners was a single farm that \nreceived a $44,700 grant to increase sales of its pumpkins and squash, \nincluding pumpkin doughnuts. I am not making this up. The grant was \nthere to promote the marketing of pumpkin doughnuts--they probably \ntaste pretty good--as a nutritious, locally produced food.\n  The farmer down the road didn't get his grant. Maybe he was growing \ncorn. The farmer on the other side of the road was growing soybeans, \nanother was growing wheat, another might be growing tomatoes, another \nmight be growing different types of fruit, and so forth and so on, but \nthe one who was growing pumpkins somehow qualified. The government \nsaid: Hey, that is a winner. Let's put a marketing plan together. Here \nis $44,700 to do so.\n  That is one example.\n  Through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, taxpayers are funding \nthings such as helping to process olives into olive oil. I think that \nis a practice that goes back a few thousand years--just ask the \nItalians. I don't know that we needed a grant to do that. There is a \ngrant for helping to develop and market sparkling wine and hard cider. \nWe have been drinking wine since the beginning of time. I think the \nFrench know how to market sparkling wines. Maybe we can read how to do \nit rather than putting a grant together to promote that. There are \ngrants for the marketing of goat's milk, cheese, and soaps and \nproviding organic chicken meat for restaurants. Look, I am not against \nthe agriculture community marketing its products. Every product maker \nmarkets their products. But do we need all this expenditure of taxpayer \nmoney to prove whether there can be a better marketing program for a \nselect few? What about the many who don't have any basis or ability to \nclaim these grants?\n  Over the past 10 years, grantees under this program have received \nover $290 million. It is a pretty sweet deal for the grant recipients, \nbut it is a pretty expensive deal for the taxpayer. And what does this \ngrant process say about the losers, those not selected? In essence, \nwhat we are doing is promoting a few select products. Why are we \npromoting pumpkin doughnuts over banana nut muffins? What about \nwatermelons and not cantaloupes, carrots, turnips--and on and on we go.\n  Well, the Federal Government is here to protect farmers and \nentrepreneurs so they can compete in a fair and dependable economic \nclimate. But at the end of the day, these government-selected projects \nare not the best use of taxpayer money and are in stark contrast to \nwhat the government ought to be doing. After all, when taxpayers send \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars to Washington, they rightly expect their \nleaders to steward those resources responsibly. I would argue that \ntaxpayer-funded pumpkin doughnuts are not a good use of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I support agriculture, but let's actually support farming, not just \npumping up the sales and profits of a select few. We can do better.\n  Today, I am adding $290 million to our taxpayer savings gauge, which \nputs us over the halfway mark of $50 billion. That is a small amount \ncompared to our budget. That is a small amount in terms of the money \nthat comes flowing into Washington from taxpayers. But we have not been \nable to address the larger issue, the issue that has to be addressed \nand is continually pushed down the road, continually pushed back to the \nnext election, and that is the unbelievable growth of entitlement \nprograms that are squeezing out many essential and necessary things the \ngovernment needs to do, such as health care research.\n  This morning, I was listening to a committee meeting with Francis \nCollins, who heads up NIH, who was talking about the medical \nbreakthroughs they could have if they just had some more funds and \nweren't being sequestered with less and less money each year. We need \nto always--but particularly in difficult fiscal times--direct \ntaxpayers' funding in the most responsible way we can.\n  With that, I will add some more money to our gauge, and we will be \nback next week for ``Waste of the Week'' No. 10.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, in Congress we should be working on \nways to build an economy that works for all of our families--not just \nthe wealthiest few. Unfortunately, once again, instead of standing up \nfor workers, some of my Republican colleagues are bound and determined \nto defend the biggest corporations that have an interest in keeping \nwages low and denying workers a voice to improve their workplace.\n  President Obama vetoed this resolution. I urge my colleagues to \nsustain\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\nthat veto to ensure workers are able to exercise that right. The \nNational Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, helps to ensure that workers \nhave a fair up-or-down-vote. Unfortunately, too often big corporations \ntake advantage of loopholes in the current election process to delay a \nvote on union representation.\n  The NLRB was absolutely right to carry out its mission to review and \nstreamline its election process to bring down those barriers for \nworkers who want a fair vote. These updates will make modest but \nimportant changes to modernize and streamline the process. They will \nreduce unnecessary litigation on issues that will not affect the \noutcome of the election. The new process will bring the election \nprocess into the 21st century by letting employers and unions file \nforms electronically. Instead of attacking workers who just want a \nvoice in the workplace, I hope my colleagues will support President \nObama's veto.\n  I truly hope we can break through the gridlock and work together on \npolicies that do create jobs and expand economic security and generate \nbroad-based economic growth for workers and families--not just the \nwealthiest few.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For 100 years, the Chicago Community Trust has connected \nthe generosity of Chicagoans with the needs of the community.\n  In 1915, 6 years after Daniel Burnham unveiled his visionary plan for \nthe city of Chicago, Norman Harris and his son Albert recognized how \nmuch could be achieved by combining the philanthropy of business and \ncommunity leaders who cared deeply about the future of Chicago. They \nfounded The Chicago Community Trust. As brilliant as Burnham's plan \nwas, Norman and Albert Harris understood that it takes more than steel, \nglass, and concrete to make a great city. A great city needs healthy, \nhopeful people, good schools, culture, and arts--all things that the \ntrust has helped nurture for 100 years.\n  Whether its economic opportunity, education, housing, conservation, \nor health care--the list of important causes in which the Chicago \nCommunity Trust is involved is remarkable. Since its founding, the \ntrust has granted more than $2 billion to nonprofit organizations \nworking to improve the quality of life in the community. The trust has \nhelped develop new audiences to sustain arts organizations, protected \nthe human services safety net for those hardest hit by economic \nchallenges, eased the devastating effects of foreclosures in Chicago \nneighborhoods, and\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\nelevated teaching to meet world-class standards.\n  In the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression, the \ntrust stepped up and distributed $11.4 million in Unity Challenge \ngrants to meet the needs of Chicago's most vulnerable citizens. The \ngrants supplied food to more than 800 soup kitchens and food pantries. \nThe trust helped expand capacity at homeless shelters and bought winter \ncoats for children. The trust put money in community health centers and \nhelped seniors pay for their prescription medications. The recession \nwas hard on Chicago, but the business and community leaders at the \nChicago Community Trust made sure that the community took care of its \nown.\n  This month, the trust is launching its centennial campaign, starting \nwith the return of ``On the Table,'' a forum that brings together \nthousands of Chicago residents to share a meal and talk about how they \ncan work together to make the community stronger, safer, and more \ndynamic. Last year, nearly 12,000 people participated from every \nChicago neighborhood and 11 neighboring counties. This year, the trust \nis expecting to at least double the number of people participating.\n  I congratulate the Chicago Community Trust on 100 years strengthening \nthe community. Thank you for all you have done and continue to do to \nmake Chicago a great and caring community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2598-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VOTER REGISTRATION MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Gillibrand in \nsupport of the introduction of the Voter Registration Modernization Act \nof 2015. This bill would improve the fabric of our democracy and bring \nour election procedures into the 21st century by eradicating barriers \nto voter registration and expanding access to the franchise for \nmillions of voters who were previously unregistered to vote. I thank \nSenator Gillibrand for her leadership on this issue.\n  The right to vote is the bedrock of our democracy. In our \nrepresentative form of government, the right to participate in the \ndemocratic process is fundamental to who we are and what we believe. \nThat is, our belief in being a nation grounded in the idea of equal \njustice under law. Voting is a fundamental right because it is \npreservative of all other rights. Without access to the ballot, our \ncivil rights and freedoms of religion, speech, and press could be \neroded and our faith that those rights will be fully protected lost.\n  In 2012, our Nation witnessed cracks in the foundation of our \ndemocracy. Millions of people watched television coverage of our \npresidential election in disgust as voters stood in lines for hours, \nmainly due to problems with the paper-based voter registration system. \nNo American in the 21st century should have to use paper ballots or \nstand in lines for hours in order to exercise their fundamental right \nto vote. The President's bipartisan commission to improve the election \nprocess concluded that no voter should have to wait more than 30 \nminutes to vote. We should be making voting easier, not harder. We can \nbegin that process by ensuring that States modernize their voter \nregistration process and give citizens the choice to register to vote \nonline.\n  When the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 was passed two \ndecades ago, the revolution in data sharing and integration was just \nbeginning. It is time to incorporate the commonplace experience of \nonline transactions into the election process. By implementing online \nvoter registration, the Voter Registration Modernization Act addresses \na key problem with paper-based systems--the inaccurate transfer of \ninformation to election authorities. This bill would ensure that \nvoters' votes count and help election authorities who rely on accurate \nvoter registration lists to better detect problems.\n  Currently, 20 States have online voter registration systems. One of \nthe greatest benefits we have seen so far is the saving of taxpayers' \nmoney. Arizona, for example, which launched the Nation's first online \nvoter registration system, saved its taxpayers almost $1.4 million. \nKansas noted no expenses at all. It is now time for the Federal \nGovernment to follow their lead and adopt these common-sense, cost \ncutting reforms.\n  The Voter Registration Modernization Act amends the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993 to provide for online voter registration \nsystems. It provides funding for States to implement the bill and \ndirects the National Institute of Standards and Technology to conduct \nan ongoing study on best practices for Internet registration. With \npassage of this bill, States are required to adopt pro-technology \nmeasures, including taking steps to ensure the online availability of \nvoter registration forms, provide online assistance, and allow voters \nto update registration information online.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said ``The arc of the moral universe is \nlong, but it bends towards justice.'' But that arc does not bend \ntowards justice without effort. We must put in the necessary hard \nwork--and build the foundation and infrastructure--for justice to \nprevail. We can improve the health of our democracy by supporting this \ncritical legislation, which would expand the ballot and update our \nvoting technology. I urge all Senators to support the Voter \nRegistration Modernization Act of 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2598-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2598-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2598-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2029.

1179. A bill to exempt the aging process of distilled spirits from \nthe production period for purposes of capitalization of interest costs; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this past Saturday, May 2, saw the \nrunning of the 141st Kentucky Derby, the most exciting 2 minutes in \nsports. Derby day is a cause for celebration across the State and derby \ncelebrations often feature Kentucky's native spirit of bourbon. Bourbon \nis a key ingredient in the legendary Mint Julep, the official drink of \nthe derby. Fittingly, today marks the 51st anniversary of the original \ncongressional bourbon resolution that designated bourbon as a \ndistinctive product of America.\n  Kentucky is the birthplace of bourbon. The drink is named for Bourbon \nCounty, KY, where the product first emerged, and today Kentucky \nproduces 95 percent of the world's supply. The bourbon industry \ngenerates 15,400 jobs with an annual payroll of $707 million statewide. \nIt is a $3 billion industry in Kentucky and a vital part of the State's \ntourism and economy. Simply put, the bourbon industry is a signature \nindustry for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  That is why the legislation I introduce today is so important. I rise \nto introduce the Advancing Growth in the Economy through Distilled \nSpirits Act, or the AGED Spirits Act. Cosponsored by my friend Senator \nRand Paul, it will correct a provision in the tax code to ensure that \nKentucky's bourbon producers are no longer at a disadvantage with their \nglobal competitors.\n  Under current law, unlike most other spirits, bourbon, and whiskey \nproducers in America must capitalize the interest expense incurred to \nfinance inventories, and it is not deductible until the product is \nsold, which could be as long as 23 years after a lengthy aging process.\n  In the United Kingdom, however, all spirit producers are permitted to \ndeduct interest expense the year it is capitalized. This discrepancy is \nharmful to American makers of distilled spirits as it contributes to \nincreased costs that directly create a competitive disadvantage for \nAmerican products in the global marketplace.\n  My bill would fix this discrepancy by permitting American bourbon and \nwhiskey producers to deduct interest\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\nexpense associated with production in the year it is paid by exempting \nthe natural aging process in the determination of the production period \nfor distilled spirits. This legislation will not only put Kentucky's \nbourbon industry on a level playing field with its global competitors, \nit is also a pro-growth measure that will help provide a boost to our \neconomy and help create jobs in Kentucky.\n  Making this change in law is a matter of common sense. The situation \nunder current law, where American bourbon and whiskey producers are not \nallowed to deduct the expenses related to storing and aging their \nproduct until it is bottled and sold, is akin to a homeowner not being \nable to deduct the interest on a home mortgage until the sale of the \nhouse.\n  Over the last several years, high-end premium American bourbons and \nwhiskeys have enjoyed significant growth in volume both here in the \nU.S. and in international markets. Bourbon production has increased \nmore than 150 percent since 1999. Given equitable tax treatment, \nAmerican bourbon and whiskey products, as well as related jobs, could \ngrow even more. Finally, this problem reveals just one of the many \nflaws in our Nation's broken tax code, which ultimately needs to be \ncomprehensively reformed to promote even greater job creation and \neconomic growth in our country.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me in advancing growth in \nKentucky's and America's economy by leveling the tax playing field for \nAmerica's distilled spirits. Fifty-one years after its official \nrecognition, bourbon is responsibly enjoyed by adults all over the \nworld, and not just on Derby Day. The industry has grown and thrived, \nand I am sure it will continue to do so. I want to thank and \ncongratulate all the hard-working Kentuckians who have contributed to \nbuilding our State's vibrant bourbon industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the AGED Spirits Act, and I look \nforward to its swift passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1179\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Growth in the \n     Economy through Distilled Spirits Act'' or the ``AGED Spirits \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PRODUCTION PERIOD OF DISTILLED SPIRITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 263A(f) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5), and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(4) Exemption for aging process of distilled spirits.--\n     For purposes of this subsection, the production period shall \n     not include the aging period for distilled spirits (as \n     described in section 5002(a)(8)).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to the production of distilled spirits that \n     begins on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Hoeven):\n  S. 1186. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor Move America bonds and to allow such bonds to be converted into tax \ncredits to support public-private partnerships; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, modern transportation infrastructure is a \ncritical building block to ensure that the U.S. economy is in a \nposition for long term growth and prosperity. It creates jobs, draws \ninvestment and supports overall global competitiveness. With the \ndeadline for the Highway Trust Fund reauthorization looming just a \nmonth away, we are faced with the reality that our crumbling \ntransportation systems simply are not up to the job.\n  Our aging infrastructure impacts everyone. Every day, Americans leave \ntheir homes to commute to work or school only to be faced with more \nthan just snarled traffic, but roads in dire need of repair. More than \none-fifth of U.S. roads are in poor condition, with nearly one-half \ntrillion dollars in needed repairs across the country over the next \ndecade.\n  U.S. ports, a critical economic doorway, are struggling under the \nweight of increased cargo traffic, leading to congestion and slowing \nexports. They now require nearly $30 billion in landside investment \nalone to keep up with the general demands they are under. Our national \ninfrastructure is in a clear state of decline, demanding $3.6 trillion \nin total investment by 2020, according to the American Society of Civil \nEngineers.\n  For one of the largest economies in the world known for its strength \nand leadership, we are falling behind other countries. Our \ninfrastructure spending has continued to decline since 1960. It is now \nat less than two percent of GDP annually. That falls behind China's \nnine percent and Europe's five. Meanwhile, our population continues to \ngrow, placing new demands on our aging transportation system.\n  How do we get back on track and safeguard the health of our \ntransportation infrastructure? The first step is for Congress to ensure \nthe solvency of the trust funds for highways, transit, airports, ports, \nand waterways. Critical infrastructure projects demand long term \nplanning and certainty, not a continual cycle of start-stop efforts. We \nmust aim for a long-term, bipartisan solution so that every year states \ndon't have to put projects on hold for fear of running out of funds.\n  Second, its time Congress looked beyond Washington and bring the \nprivate sector to the table to spur new financing partnerships that \nsupport our infrastructure needs.\n  There is an untapped opportunity here: Standard and Poor's estimates \nthat private investors could provide more than $100 billion in \ninfrastructure investment each year. Public-private partnerships, P3s, \nare unique in that they offer upfront capital financing, along with the \ntransfer of risk to the private partner, allowing for more efficient \nproject design, construction and maintenance. P3s have been successful \nin the U.S., as well as other countries around the world.\n  Recognizing this pressing need and opportunity, today Senator Hoeven \nand I are introducing the Move America program. Move America is \ndesigned to strengthen our transportation system by making it easier \nfor the states to put together P3s and draw private investment. This \nunique, bipartisan driven proposal complements federal funding efforts, \nby creating cheaper and more effective financing tools to expand \ninvestment in roads, bridges, transit, ports, rail, and airports.\n  Move America expands tax exempt private activity bonds and creates a \nnew infrastructure tax credit, giving stakeholders significant \nflexibility to pursue infrastructure projects that are badly needed in \nstates and localities. And these tools are available for use regardless \nof who owns the project--government or private groups--making \nfinancing, management, and leasing arrangements much simpler. The bonds \nalso exempt the interest income from the alternative minimum tax, \nmaking it an attractive proposal to investors.\n  For states that are hesitant to issue more debt, or that are looking \nto leverage more private equity, Move America credits would be \navailable for the state to attract equity investors for infrastructure \nprojects. The credits are available to the extent there is at least \ntwice as much private investment in the project. This one-to-one match \nleverages additional equity investment at a lower cost to states and \ncities, lowering their capital costs or allowing them to reduce tolls \nor other revenues required for the project.\n  Critical transportation projects come to life in less time and at \nless cost to taxpayers. Americans can travel on safer footing. The \nprivate sector finds a new investment opportunity.\n  Strengthening our country's transportation infrastructure shouldn't \nbe a political issue. It is time we come together and create a path to \nmove America forward and build the 21st century infrastructure that our \ncountry deserves.\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2602-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 166--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \nDOMESTICALLY GROWN FLOWERS SUPPORT THE FARMERS, SMALL BUSINESSES, JOBS, \nAND ECONOMY OF THE UNITED STATES, ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF THE PEOPLE OF \nTHE UNITED STATES TO HONOR THEIR MOTHERS ON MOTHER'S DAY, AND THAT THE \n    WHITE HOUSE SHOULD STRIVE TO SHOWCASE DOMESTICALLY GROWN FLOWERS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, and Ms. Murkowski) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 166\n\n       Whereas the people of the United States have a long history \n     of using flowers and greens grown in the United States to \n     bring beauty to important events and express affection for \n     loved ones;\n       Whereas consumers spend more than $25,000,000,000 each year \n     on floral products, including garden plants, bedding, indoor \n     plants, and cut flowers;\n       Whereas 30 percent of households in the United States \n     purchase fresh cut flowers and greens from more than 16,000 \n     florists and floral establishments each year;\n       Whereas the people of the United States increasingly want \n     to support domestically produced foods and agricultural \n     products, yet 74 percent of the people of the United States \n     do not know where the flowers they purchase are grown, and 58 \n     percent would prefer to buy locally grown flowers given the \n     choice;\n       Whereas in response to increased demand, the ``Certified \n     American Grown Flowers'' logo was created in July 2014, in \n     order to educate and empower consumers to purchase flowers \n     from domestic producers;\n       Whereas as of April 2015, millions of stems of domestically \n     grown flowers are now Certified American Grown;\n       Whereas domestic flower farmers produce thousands of \n     varieties of flowers across the United States, such as \n     peonies in Alaska, Gerbera daisies in California, lupines in \n     Maine, tulips in Washington, lilies in Oregon, and larkspur \n     in Texas;\n       Whereas the 5 flower varieties with the highest United \n     States production are tulips, Gerbera daisies, lilies, \n     irises, and gladiolas;\n       Whereas people in every State have access to domestically \n     grown flowers, yet only 1 of 5 flowers sold in the United \n     States is domestically grown;\n       Whereas the domestic cut flower industry creates almost \n     $42,000,000 in economic impact daily and supports hundreds of \n     growers, thousands of small businesses, and tens of thousands \n     of jobs in the United States;\n       Whereas more people in the United States are expressing \n     interest in growing flowers locally, which has resulted in an \n     approximately 20 percent increase in the number of domestic \n     cut flower farms since 2007;\n       Whereas most domestic cut flowers and greens are sold in \n     the United States within 24 to 48 hours after harvest and \n     last longer than flowers shipped longer distances;\n       Whereas in 2014, President Barack Obama and First Lady \n     Michelle Obama highlighted their support for domestically \n     grown flowers at the White House State Dinner with French \n     President Francois Hollande, the only White House State \n     Dinner that year;\n       Whereas the 2014 White House State Dinner featured quince \n     branch from Mississippi, weeping willow from New Jersey, \n     Scotch broom from Virginia, iris from California, and \n     alocasia, equisetum, nandina, and green liriope from Florida;\n       Whereas flower-giving has been a holiday tradition in the \n     United States for generations;\n       Whereas Mother's Day and Valentine's Day are 2 of the 3 top \n     flower-giving holidays in the United States;\n       Whereas 38 percent of the people in the United States, \n     spending more than $2,000,000,000, buy flowers on Valentine's \n     Day;

which was referred to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 15\n\n       Whereas in 1868, San Diego civic leaders set aside 1,400 \n     acres of land, which became known as City Park;\n       Whereas in 1910, in preparation for the Panama-California \n     Exposition hosted by San Diego, that park was named ``Balboa \n     Park'' in honor of Spanish-born Vasco Nunez de Balboa, the \n     first European to see the Pacific Ocean while exploring in \n     present-day Panama;\n       Whereas the 1915-1916 Panama-California Exposition \n     commemorated the opening of the Panama Canal and was the \n     first of two expositions that added to Balboa Park's dramatic \n     architecture;\n       Whereas in 1914, John D. and Adolph Spreckels donated the \n     Spreckels Organ, one of the world's largest outdoor pipe \n     organs, to the City of San Diego for the Panama-California \n     Exposition, and this unique organ contains 4,530 pipes \n     ranging in length from the size of a pencil to 32 feet and is \n     housed in an ornate vaulted structure with highly embellished \n     gables;\n       Whereas the San Diego Zoo was established in Balboa Park at \n     the close of the Exposition in the fall of 1916, when Dr. \n     Harry Wegeforth, a local physician, conceived the idea of \n     starting a zoo after hearing the roar of a lion, one of the \n     few wild animals displayed in cages at the Exposition, and \n     the Balboa Zoo is now home to more than 3,700 rare and \n     endangered animals representing over 660 species and \n     subspecies and a prominent botanical collection with more \n     than 700,000 plants- a world famous conservation organization \n     where visitors view exotic animals in habitat environments;\n       Whereas in 1926, the Fine Arts Gallery of San Diego, now \n     The San Diego Museum of Art, opened to the public, and its \n     renowned holdings include a fine selection of European old \n     masters, 19th and 20th-century American art, an encyclopedic \n     Asian collection, and growing collections of contemporary and \n     Latin American art;\n       Whereas in 1933, the San Diego Natural History Museum \n     opened within the park and is housed in a building created \n     with Works Project Administration assistance;\n       Whereas in 1935-1936, Balboa Park hosted its second major \n     exposition, the California Pacific International Exposition, \n     which helped boost the local economy during the depression \n     and added additional structures and landscaping, many of \n     which now host cultural institutions and events;\n       Whereas the internationally acclaimed, Tony Award-winning \n     Old Globe, one of the most esteemed regional theaters in the \n     country, was founded within Balboa Park in 1935, and now \n     boasts three unique venues: the historic Old Globe Theatre \n     (built for the 1935 exposition and expanded and rebuilt in \n     1978), the intimate Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre, and the \n     outdoor Lowell Davies Festival Theatre;\n       Whereas Balboa Park helped support military efforts in \n     World War I and World War II, when most of the buildings on \n     the Central Mesa became adjuncts to the adjacent Naval \n     hospital, the House of Hospitality became a nurses' \n     dormitory, the Lily Pond became a rehabilitation pool, and \n     400 hospital beds were placed in the San Diego Fine Arts \n     Gallery;\n       Whereas on December 25, 1946, the California Tower carillon \n     was installed; whose chimes are still heard across the park \n     on every quarter hour;\n       Whereas in 1978, two devastating fires struck Balboa Park, \n     resulting in the destruction of the Electric Building, \n     including the San Diego Aerospace Museum collection, and the \n     1935 Old Globe Theatre, both of which were rebuilt with \n     private donations;\n       Whereas in the 1980's, the San Diego Model Railroad Museum, \n     the Museum of Photographic Arts, the San Diego Automotive \n     Museum and the Veterans Museum and Memorial Center all opened \n     within Balboa Park;\n       Whereas in the 1990's, the beautiful Japanese Friendship \n     Garden, the Mingei International Museum, the San Diego Art \n     Institute: Museum of the Living Artist, the WorldBeat Center, \n     and the Hall of Champions Sports Museum opened;\n       Whereas Balboa Park has grown to become the one of the \n     nation's largest urban cultural parks, encompassing more than \n     1,172 acres, including 14 formal gardens, and the park is \n     home to 15 major museums, nearly 100 arts, education, \n     recreational, social and sports organizations, renowned \n     performing arts venues, as well as the world famous San Diego \n     Zoo;\n       Whereas Balboa Park celebrates history, art, music, \n     science, and culture and has been a city treasure for one \n     century; and\n       Whereas the 2015 centennial anniversary of the Panama-\n     California Exposition and the establishment of Balboa Park is \n     an achievement of historic proportions for the City of San \n     Diego, the State of California, and the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress commemorates the 100th anniversary \n     of the Panama-California Exposition and the founding of \n     Balboa Park in San Diego, California on May 9, 2015.\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2603-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2603-S2608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    FOREIGN TRAVEL FINANCIAL REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following reports for standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n      CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22 U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON\n                                                           AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM JAN. 1 TO MAR. 31, 2015\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Debbie Stabenow:\n    Cuba...................................

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 166, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 166) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that domestically grown flowers support the farmers, \n     small businesses, jobs, and economy of the United States, \n     enhance the ability of the people of the United States to \n     honor their mothers on Mother's Day, and that the White House \n     should strive to showcase domestically grown flowers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nAmerican flower growers, having submitted a resolution designating \nMother's Day, May 10, 2015, as a special day to honor the role that \ndomestically grown flowers play in the ability of Americans to honor \ntheir mothers. This resolution is cosponsored by Senators Barbara Boxer \nand Lisa Murkowski.\n  Americans truly care about where the goods they purchase and the \nfoods they eat are produced. They have a strong desire to support their \nlocal economies and help their communities thrive. And purchasing \nagricultural products grown in our country supports American farmers. \nAmerican-grown agricultural products are often fresher and last longer \nthan imports because they are not shipped as far as products grown \nabroad.\n  This is also the case for American-grown flowers. The majority of \nAmericans would prefer to buy more locally grown flowers if given the \nchoice, yet only one out of every five flowers sold in the United \nStates is grown in the country.\n  Every State has access to domestically grown flowers, but three-\nquarters of Americans do not know where the flowers they purchase are \ngrown.\n  American-grown flowers create almost $42 million in economic impact \nper day. These flowers not only support the flower growers but also the \n16,000 florists and floral establishments across the country that sell \nthem.\n  Many of these growers and florists run small businesses that are \ncritical to our Nation's economic strength. They create jobs and \ncontribute to the\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\neconomy of their respective communities. These businesses produce \nflowers that provide a beautiful and elegant way for Americans to show \naffection for their family members and loved ones.\n  The popularity of American-grown flowers is increasing, and I am \npleased to see that the White House is involved in promoting American-\ngrown flowers as well. Last year, the First Lady highlighted the beauty \nof domestic flowers by displaying a number of varieties at the only \nState Dinner of the year. The dinner featured flowers from Mississippi, \nNew Jersey, Virginia, Florida, and, I am proud to say, California.\n  California is the largest cut flower producer in the Nation. The \nState grows more than 116 types of flowers, including roses, irises, \nlilies, tulips, and gerbera. At my home in San Francisco, I maintain a \ngarden filled with many of the flowers and plants that flourish across \nCalifornia. My garden has beautiful magnolias, azaleas, pansies, and \ndahlias. I also have drought-resistant gazanias, which is more \nimportant than ever given the severe water shortage in the State.\n  When you give someone a California-grown flower, it was most likely \nharvested within the last 48 hours. I am delighted that my State is \nhome to the flowers that help Americans show their loved ones how much \nthey care.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring American-grown flowers \nthis Mother's Day. I hope that this resolution will remind consumers \nabout how they can support local farmers when they shop for flowers \nthis Mother's Day.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 166) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/04/senate-section/article/S2609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 5, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.
