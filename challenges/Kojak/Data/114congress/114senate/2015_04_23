As the new majority, we decided these victims \nhad waited long enough. We wanted to make it an early legislative \npriority. It was time to act and finally to give the victims of modern \nslavery the help and hope they have long waited for.\n  Now, we can finally say that help is on the way. Victims, advocates, \nand all the Members of this body who negotiated in good faith, and \nSenator Cornyn in particular, who never gave up, should take heart in \nyesterday's outcome. I would urge the House and the President to enact \nthis bill quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2361-6", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Finance \nCommittee passed an important bipartisan bill, trade promotion \nauthority, with broad support from both parties, 20 to 6--20 to 6. The \nchairman and ranking member of that committee, Senator Hatch and \nSenator Wyden, worked hard to achieve the result we saw last night.\n  Along with Chairman Ryan in the House, they put together an agreement \nthat reflects the kind of honest compromise they can take pride in. It \nprotects and enhances the role of Congress in the trade negotiating \nprocess, while ensuring that Presidents of either party--and I would \nremind our colleagues that this is a 6-year trade promotion authority \nbill. It will give to the next President the opportunity to negotiate \nadditional trade agreements and send them to Congress for approval.\n  These agreements can boost our economy and support more high-quality \nAmerican jobs. Now, this bipartisan bill will move to the Senate floor. \nIt is my hope to pass it during the current work period.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2361-7", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2361-S2362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REVIEW ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the topic of committees getting back \nto work in the new Congress, we witnessed more evidence of that last \nweek when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously approved \nthe bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. It is a bipartisan \nbill with many Republican and Democratic cosponsors. It will ensure the \nAmerican people are given a voice on one of the most important issues \nof our time.\n  Chairman Corker worked closely with Members of both parties both to \ncraft a compromise bill and to advance it. Many have admired not just \nhis hard work on this issue but his determination as well. After all, \nwho would have imagined that the White House, after trying to kill this \nbipartisan bill for months, would find itself forced to pull a near-\ntotal about-face. It is no wonder, though, because the core principle \nthat has always underlined the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act--that \nCongress and the American people deserve a say in any nuclear deal that \nthe President tries to cut with Iran--is more than just common sense. \nIt is really a no-brainer.\n  After all, preventing the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism \nfrom gaining access to nuclear weapons should be the goal of every \nSenator and every American, regardless of party. It\n\n[[Page S2362]]\n\nis not a partisan issue. It is one of the greatest challenges to \nregional stability, and the stakes are very high.\n  Iran's support of Hezbollah, the Assad regime, Shia militias in Iraq, \nand the Houthi insurgents in Yemen, coupled with its determination to \nexpand not just its nuclear capabilities but also its ballistic missile \nand conventional military capabilities, represents an aggressive effort \nto expand the Iranian sphere of influence throughout the greater Middle \nEast.\n  Iran's belligerent quest for nuclear weapons capabilities, its fierce \ndetermination to undermine America's standing in the region, and its \nviolent pursuit of regional hegemony represent a grave, grave threat--\nnot just to nearby nations in the Middle East, not just to our own \ncountry, but for that matter to the entire world. So the stakes are \nindeed high. As we know, President Obama has been engaged in \nnegotiations with the Iranians for some time now. Initially, we were \nled to believe that the point of these negotiations was to prevent--\nprevent--Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n  But the administration's focus appears to have shifted from reaching \nan agreement that would end Iran's nuclear program to reaching an \nagreement for agreement's sake. That is the only way to interpret the \ninterim agreement we saw recently. It would effectively bestow an \ninternational blessing for Iran to become a nuclear threshold state \nforever--forever on the edge of obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n  The direction these negotiations have taken should be very worrying \nfor Americans of every political stripe. What that simply underlines is \nthe need for a measure such as the bipartisan Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act.\n  Here is what it would do. First, it would require that any final \nagreement reached with Iran be submitted to Congress for review. \nSecond, it would require that Congress be given time to hold hearings \nand, ultimately, take a vote to approve or disapprove any Iran \nagreement before congressional sanctions are lifted.\n  Third, if a final deal ultimately does go forward, it would require \nthe President to certify back to Congress every 90 days that Iran \nremains in compliance with the agreement. And if the President is \nunable to do so, it would empower Congress to rapidly reimpose \nsanctions. In short, passing this bipartisan bill would give Congress \nand the American people important tools to assess any agreement reached \nby the administration before congressional sanctions can be lifted.\n  Remember, it was due in no small measure to the congressional \nsanctions offered by Senator Mark Kirk, which passed this Chamber 100 \nto 0, 4 years ago, that Iran was forced to the negotiating table in the \nfirst place. The Obama administration fiercely opposed those bipartisan \nsanctions back then, just as it opposed the bipartisan bill before us \nsoon until very recently. But those sanctions have been so effective \nthat even the administration has had to embrace them. Congress was \nright then, and Congress is right now.\n  We should not be negotiating away the leverage previous sanctions \nhave given our country for a bad deal especially agreed to for \nagreement's sake. Look, no piece of legislation is perfect. Senators \nwho would like to see this bill strengthened, as I would, will have \nthat chance during a robust amendment process that we will soon have \nright here on this floor. This bill will be open for amendment. Those \nwho seek to improve it will have an opportunity to do that. But what we \ndo know is that this bipartisan bill is underlined by a very solid \nprinciple and a lot of hard work. It represents a real opportunity to \ngive the American people more of a say on this important issue. We look \nforward to a vigorous debate on it next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2362-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Heller).

Mr. President, this morning I would like to extend a warm \nwelcome to the Reverend Dr. Ralph Williamson, of Las Vegas, NV, who \nopened the Senate today with such a beautiful prayer. For a dozen \nyears, Dr. Williamson has served as senior pastor at the First African \nMethodist Episcopal Church in North Las Vegas.\n  During that time, Reverend Williamson has helped shepherd the First \nAfrican American Episcopal Church through an expansion that includes a \nbeautiful new sanctuary. It is brand new. He is a devoted pastor, and \nhe is beloved by a growing congregation, which includes Senator Cory \nBooker's mother.\n  Cory's mom and aunt live in Las Vegas. It was there that his good dad \ndied. I had the opportunity to meet his father before he passed away. \nThey are so proud of their son, Cory--as well they should be--as they \nare proud of having worshiped in this church.\n  The Apostle Paul wrote: ``As we have therefore opportunity, let us do \ngood to all men, especially unto them who are of the household of \nfaith.''\n  Reverend Williamson has heeded this admonition, doing good for the \nmembers of his flock and the people of all southern Nevada. Through \nReverend Williamson's leadership, the First African American Episcopal \nChurch has become a source of faith and vital support for the \ncommunity. Reverend Williamson's tireless efforts have produced \nprograms for youth, seniors, and the underprivileged. He has pioneered \nfood banks, summer lunch programs, tutoring programs, and health \nministries. Just about everything that deals with helping people, he \nhas done it.\n  I appreciate his joining us today. I did not have the chance to tell \nhim. We met earlier today. We had a ``Welcome to Washington'' with 60 \nor 70 people today. He gave the presentation to them and offered a \nprayer for those assembled. It was very warm and nice. But what I did \nnot get a chance to tell him is that I believe the first leader of the \nflock, of this church in southern Nevada, was a man by the name of \nAlbert Dunn. He was responsible for starting this first congregation. \nHe was my friend, Reverend Dunn. He was a very, very devoutly religious \nman. To show you how far he went to help people in the community, this \nwas a conversation with his wife one day. She said: ``You know, I wish \nyou had talked to Reverend Dunn, because, oftentimes, we would get up \nin the morning and he had given away all the food to people who needed \nit.''\n  So I have a warm remembrance of this church and Reverend Dunn.\n  Dr. Williamson, thank you very much for your leadership. I appreciate \nit very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2362-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            IRAN LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I look forward to returning to the debate on \nthe situation dealing with Iran. It is a very difficult issue. It is so \nimportant for the country and the world.\n  I hope there can be some further negotiations when they finish these \nnegotiations in June, at least something that will be received with \npopularity in the Senate. Democrats and Republicans will say: That is \ngreat. We are finally able to get something done. Iran now can no \nlonger use nuclear weapons because we have stopped them from doing so. \nI hope we arrive at that point, but we are not there yet. I wish so \nfervently that the negotiators can arrive at some agreement in the next \ncouple of months.\n  We are going to move to this bill as soon as we can. I hope we can do \nit sooner rather than later.\n  The debate on these amendments that the Republican leader talked \nabout are very significant. As the Republican leader said, there should \nbe amendments offered. If people think they can improve the bill, there \ncan be amendments offered. If people think there is stuff in the bill \nthey simply don't like and they don't like all of this process, let \nthem offer an amendment. We need robust debate. We have to make sure \nthat attention is focused on this issue and nothing else.\n  I look forward to seeing what I can work out with my friend, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky, the majority leader of the Senate, to see \nwhen we can move to this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2362-4", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2362-S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LYNCH NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal had a great \neditorial\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\ntoday. To show you how senseless it was, I will read the headline: \n``The GOP uses its advice and consent power to beat Harry Reid.''\n  Think about that, a major newspaper in this country has the audacity \nto say: ``The GOP [Republicans] uses its advice and consent power to \nbeat Harry Reid.''\n  Reading the editorial, what they are talking about is that the \nRepublicans were very smart in delaying Loretta Lynch to be confirmed. \nThe reason she was delayed is because a very vital issue came up with \nthe trafficking bill. It dealt with women's reproductive rights, and it \ntook a long time to work that out. In fact, it took a long enough time \nto work it out until the Republicans capitulated to what we wanted.\n  We protected the women's right to choose. The Hyde language no longer \nallows, as was in the underlying legislation, the Hyde language to \napply to nontaxpayer money. So for them to say they beat Harry Reid, \nthey didn't beat Harry Reid. What they did was beat up on themselves.\n  To think that they beat Harry Reid, I repeat, all they did was beat \nup on themselves.\n  Later today, the Senate will do something it should have done months \nago, confirm Loretta Lynch as the 83rd Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  She is as qualified a candidate as I have ever seen in this Senate, \nwhich is more than three decades--so qualified, in fact, today will \nmark the third time she has been confirmed by the Senate.\n  Twice before, Loretta Lynch was unanimously confirmed as the U.S. \nattorney for the Eastern District of New York. By all accounts, Loretta \nLynch's confirmation this time around should have sailed through the \nSenate. For a while, it seemed it would. We had Senators, Republican \nSenators, saying what a wonderful woman she is. She is great. They were \nvery vocal in their support. The senior Senator from Utah, the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, the junior Senator from Arizona--but it \nsoon became apparent the Republican leadership pressed these people a \nlittle bit, and suddenly they weren't as interested in moving the Lynch \nconfirmation along, even though that is what they said they should do. \nHer nomination has dragged on for months.\n  In fact, I repeat, she has waited longer to be confirmed than the \nfirst 54 Attorneys General combined, longer than Attorneys General \nnominated by every President from George Washington to Woodrow Wilson.\n  What should have been a quick confirmation would be anything but \nthat. Instead, Ms. Lynch became the first Attorney General nominee in \nhistory to be filibustered.\n  The editorial from the newspaper is very insulting. They said: ``Mr. \nReid accused Republicans of racism and sexism.''\n  I dare--I dare anyone to find a single word that I said dealing with \nrace or sex. I didn't do that, but maybe that is something the \nRepublicans hoped I would do, but I didn't do that.\n  There was even a hunger strike. Now, listen to this, the depth of \nthis editorial from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Al Sharpton's activist group vowed a hunger strike until \n     Ms. Lynch received a vote. (Al, please go through with it.)\n\n  I guess I was naive in thinking my Republican colleagues would treat \nLoretta Lynch with the dignity she and her office deserved. Perhaps my \nmistake was forgetting that for Republicans, this isn't about Loretta \nLynch, it is about President Obama because Republicans will do \neverything, anything they can to make President Obama's life more \ndifficult. They said they would do that when he was elected, and they \nhave stuck with it.\n  President Obama's Cabinet officials have been treated worse than any \nPresident in history. Today's vote on Loretta Lynch marks the seventh \ncloture vote the Republicans have forced on a Cabinet official during \nthe Obama administration.\n  Forcing cloture, that is terminating the filibuster, was something \nthat was rare in the entire history of this country. It used to be \nCabinet officials were filibustered only in the most extreme \ncircumstances, but once Ms. Lynch is confirmed, five sitting members of \nthe President's Cabinet will have been filibustered by Senate \nRepublicans.\n  To put that in contrast, it rarely happened before, rarely. Unlike \ntoday's Senate Republicans, Democrats showed restraint in our \ndisagreements with the President's appointments. We showed great \ndeference to his choices for the President, and by that I am talking \nabout the last President, George W. Bush.\n  Some may say that is water under the bridge. There will be those \nRepublicans who, after confirming Loretta Lynch today, will say all's \nwell that ends well. They are wrong.\n  While I am pleased she will be confirmed as Attorney General, her \nnomination process is proof of all that is wrong with Republican Senate \nleadership. Senate Republicans made Loretta Lynch's nomination linger \nmore than 10 times longer than the average Attorney General--and you \nhave heard what I said before about that--just to spite Barack Obama.\n  The viciousness with which the majority leader's party has treated \nthe President is unconscionable and is bad for our country. Republicans \nhave become so blinded by their nastiness that they have even made \nfilibusters of Cabinet officials the norm around here. The first time \nwe had a Defense Secretary filibustered, they did it. The first time \nfor an Attorney General, they did it.\n  How sad that in the future we can expect delayed and filibustered \nnominations such as Loretta Lynch to no longer be the exception but the \nrule. This is so unfortunate that this is how Republicans portend to \ngovern.\n  Mr. President, what is the order of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2363-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we will be voting soon on confirmation \nof Ms. Lynch to be the Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica. That office is a part of the President's Cabinet, but it also \nis the office of the chief law officer for America. The Attorney \nGeneral is the top official in our government who is required to adhere \nto the law, even to the point of telling the President `no' if he gets \nit in his head, as Presidents sometimes do, to do something that \nviolates the law--just as corporate lawyers sometimes do for the CEO of \ncorporations. `Mr. President, you can't do this. This is wrong. Don't \ndo this.'\n  Some Attorneys General have been known to resign before they would \ncarry out policies that violate the law.\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\nWe are deeply concerned in this country about the President's Executive \namnesty--the unlawfulness of it, the breadth of it, and the arrogance \nof it to the point that it is a direct assault on congressional power \nand legitimacy, a direct attack on laws passed by the People's \nrepresentatives; we have a big problem. Ms. Lynch has said flat-out \nthat she supports those policies and is committed to defending them in \ncourt against any complaint about them.\n  I think Congress has a real role here. We do not have to confirm \nsomeone to the highest law enforcement position in America if that \nperson is publicly committed to denigrating Congress, violating the \nlaws of Congress, or violating even the wishes of Congress and the \nAmerican people. We do not have to confirm anybody. It is a power \nCongress is given. The President is asserting powers he has never been \ngiven anywhere in the Constitution or by the American people, but if we \ndon't confirm Ms. Lynch, we will be doing what we have a right to do, \nand what I think we should do.\n  I am pleased that Mr. Andrew McCarthy, who prosecuted some of the top \nterrorist cases in America as a former U.S. attorney or as an assistant \nU.S. attorney, is very critical and is very strongly of the belief that \nMs. Lynch should not be confirmed. He says this:\n\n       A vote against Ms. Lynch's confirmation is not an \n     assessment that she has performed incompetently or \n     unethically in her prior government positions. It is a vote \n     against the President's blatantly unconstitutional policy and \n     against Ms. Lynch's support of that policy. Senators are \n     bound by oath to uphold the Constitution; Ms. Lynch's prior, \n     laudable record as a federal prosecutor cannot overcome her \n     commitment to violating the Constitution.\n\n  We have a right to assert that. We are paid to make decisions about \nthat. I think that Mr. McCarthy is correct. Congress was given certain \npowers as a coequal branch of government, not only to protect the \nCongress as an institution but to restrain other government branches \nfrom overreaching. One of those powers is the Senate's power to confirm \nor not confirm, and this check on Executive powers can be used as \nCongress sees fit. But it should not be abused, just as the President \nshould not use his nominees to abuse the Constitution or to advance an \nunlawful agenda. The Attorney General is the top law enforcement \nofficer in the country. This is not traditionally a political position. \nIt is a law position. Anyone who occupies the office must serve the \nAmerican people under the laws and the Constitution of the United \nStates. They are not above the law.\n  The Supreme Court has clearly held that the President is subjected to \nthe laws. It has always been the case and always has been a part of the \nlaw of the land. The Senate must never confirm an individual to an \noffice such as this who will support and advance a scheme that violates \nour Constitution and eviscerates established law and Congressional \nauthority. No person who would do that should be confirmed. We do not \nneed to be apologetic about it.\n  Ms. Lynch has announced that she supports and, if confirmed, would \nadvance the President's unlawful Executive amnesty scheme--a scheme \nthat would provide work permits, trillions in Social Security and \nMedicare benefits, tax credits of up to $35,000 a year--according to \nthe Congressional Research Service--and even the possibility of chain \nmigration and citizenship to those who have entered our country \nillegally or overstayed their lawful period of admission. The President \nhas done this even though Congress has repeatedly rejected legislation \nhe supports that would allow this scheme to be implemented. He asked \nfor it, Congress considered it, and Congress said `no.'\n  President Obama's unlawful and unconstitutional Executive action \nnullifies current immigration law to a degree most people have not \nfully grasped. The Immigration and Nationality Act is the law of the \nland, and his actions replace it with the very measures Congress \nrefused to adopt. Even King George III didn't have the power to \nlegislate without Parliament.\n  During her confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, I asked \nMs. Lynch plainly whether she supported the President's unilateral \ndecision to make his own immigration laws.\n  Here is the relevant portion of the transcript:\n\n       Mr. Sessions: I have to have a clear answer to this \n     question--Ms. Lynch, do you believe the executive action \n     announced by President Obama on November 20 is legal and \n     Constitutional? Yes or no?\n       Ms. Lynch: As I've read the opinion,--\n\n  That is, the opinion of the Department of Justice, which would be \nunder her supervision--\n\n       I do believe it is, Senator.\n\n  Of course, the lawful duty of the Attorney General is to enforce the \nlaw that exists, not one that she or the President wish existed. One of \nthe most stunning elements of the President's scheme is the grant of \nwork permits to up to 5 million illegal immigrants--taking jobs \ndirectly from citizens and legal immigrants in our country at a time of \nhigh unemployment and low wages.\n  Peter Kirsanow, Commissioner on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, \nhas written at length about how this undermines the rights of U.S. \nworkers, especially African-American workers, and other minorities \nsuffering from high unemployment. He says: Those citizens who are \nsuffering from high unemployment and low wages have their rights \nundermined when the President ignores plain law that protects them from \nan excessive surge of illegal workers.\n  So at her confirmation hearing, I asked Ms. Lynch about what she \nmight do to protect the rights of U.S. workers. By the way, Attorney \nGeneral Holder, our current Attorney General, astoundingly, in comments \nhe made some months ago, declared that there is a civil right to \ncitizenship in America for people who enter the country unlawfully. How \ncan this possibly be, that the Attorney General can get so removed from \nhis responsibility to enforce the law that he says that if someone \ncomes into the country unlawfully, they have a civil right to \ncitizenship?\n  That was part of the reason I asked her this question:\n\n       Mr. Sessions: Who has more right to a job in this country? \n     A lawful immigrant who's here or a citizen--or a person who \n     entered the country unlawfully?\n       Ms. Lynch: I believe that the right and the obligation to \n     work is one that's shared by everyone in this country \n     regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone \n     is here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they would \n     be participating in the workplace than not participating in \n     the workplace.\n\n  So this individual would be the chief law enforcement of our country, \nand I believe that is a fundamentally flawed statement and comment. It \nis unprecedented for someone who is seeking the highest law enforcement \noffice in America to declare that someone in the country illegally has \na right to a job when the law says if you are here illegally, you \ncannot work.\n  This Nation is--as George Washington University law Professor \nJonathan Turley, who has testified a number of times here, often called \nby a number of our Democratic colleagues, put it--at ``a constitutional \ntipping point.'' Professor Turley, who is a nationally recognized \nconstitutional scholar and self-described supporter of President Obama, \ntestified before the House of Representatives in February 2014, nine \nmonths before the President announced his unprecedented executive \naction, and said:\n\n       The current passivity of Congress represents a crisis of \n     faith for members willing to see a president assume \n     legislative powers in exchange for insular policy gains. The \n     short-term, insular victories achieved by this President will \n     come at a prohibitive cost if the current imbalance is not \n     corrected. Constitutional authority is easy to lose in the \n     transient shift of politics. It is far more difficult to \n     regain. If a passion for the Constitution does not motivate \n     members, perhaps a sense of self-preservation will be enough \n     to unify members. President Obama will not be our last \n     president. However, these acquired powers will be passed to \n     his successors. When that occurs, members may loathe the day \n     that they remained silent as the power of government shifted \n     so radically to the Chief Executive. The powerful personality \n     that engendered this loyalty will be gone, but the powers \n     will remain. We are now at the constitutional tipping point \n     of our system. If balance is to be reestablished, it must \n     begin before this President leaves office and that will \n     likely require every possible means to reassert legislative \n     authority.\n\n  One of those means is the advice and consent power to approve or \ndisapprove nominees for high office. It was created for just such a \ntime as this. It is a legitimate constitutional power of Congress. It \nis not only appropriate but necessary that the Senate refuse to confirm \na President's nominee when\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\nthat President has overreached and assumed the legislative powers of \nCongress. It is particularly necessary when the President's nominee is \nbeing appointed specifically for the improper purpose of advancing the \nPresident's unconstitutional overreach--all through powers of the \noffice to which they have been nominated.\n  Mr. President, we have a number of problems with regard to executive \nbranch overreach and executive branch failure to be responsive to \nCongress. When Members of Congress ask legitimate questions, we often \ndon't get answers from the people who are paid by the taxpayers and who \nare authorized by us. I believe that is another matter we need to \nconsider before we confirm people. The Department of Justice has been \nrecalcitrant too often in producing information it should produce.\n  I wish to go a little bit further because some of this goes to the \ncore of the issues before us. Is this just a policy dispute between \nCongress and the President? No, it goes much deeper than that. The \nactions of the President are stunning--beginning with his so-called \nMorton memos. He had an underling carry out orders to achieve what he \nwanted done, which is often how he has proceeded with these unlawful \nactivities. I will point out some of them.\n  Beginning with the Morton memos in 2011--under the guise of \nprosecutorial discretion based on limited resources--the Administration \nbegan to flaunt clearly written provisions of the Immigration and \nNationality Act, such as section 235, which requires the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to place illegal aliens into removal proceedings to \nbe deported once they are found. Section 235 requires DHS to do that, \nthey do not have any discretion there.\n  In direct contradiction of clearly written law, the Morton memos \ngenerally directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel \nto refuse to initiate removal proceedings against certain aliens, and \nto administratively close or terminate such proceedings if they had \nbeen initiated. Thus began the opening salvo in the Administration's \nassault on our immigration laws. This is huge. Officers respond to the \nPresident's leadership.\n  The following year, June 2012, the Administration created, through \nExecutive fiat, a program that Congress consistently refused to enact \ninto law--the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. This \nprogram not only shielded certain illegal aliens from the threat of \nremoval, but it also provided them with work authorization, the ability \nto travel outside of the United States without fear of being refused \nreentry through grants of advanced parole. It gave them a Social \nSecurity number and a photo ID.\n  By the way, colleagues, this resulted in the Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officers being so concerned at this radical reversal of the \nlaws of the United States that they filed a lawsuit against their \nsupervisors asserting that they were being required to violate the law \nof the United States rather than being allowed to carry out their sworn \nduty, which was to enforce the laws of the United States.\n  The judge was sympathetic to the matter, but for technical and legal \nreasons, concluded that the case would not go forward, but I believe it \nis still on appeal now.\n  This is remarkable. There are law officers--many of them have been in \nlaw enforcement for 10, 20, 30 years--who sued their supervisors \nbecause they were being ordered to violate the law instead of enforce \nthe law. We ought to listen to them. They have repeatedly told us that \nwhat is happening is outrageous and they pleaded with Congress to stop \nit.\n  But then in November of last year, after Congress refused to pass the \nAdministration's preferred legislation providing amnesty to illegal \naliens, the Administration created, through Executive fiat, a number of \nother programs that further eroded enforcement of our immigration laws. \nNotably, the two most visible programs are the Deferred Action for \nParents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, the so-called DAPA \nProgram, and an expanded version of DACA, both of which were blessed by \nthe Department of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel, and the \nAttorney General--wrong, unlawful actions blessed by the chief law \nenforcement officer in the country.\n  Less visible are policies that prevent the enforcement of immigration \nlaws against certain criminal aliens, such as the November 20, 2014 \nmemorandum from Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security, entitled ``Policies for the Apprehension, Detention, \nand Removal of Undocumented Immigrants.'' That memo excludes from \nenforcement priority categories whole categories of criminal offenses \ndefined in sections 2(a)(2) and 237(a)(2) of the INA.\n  We have observed a decimation of law enforcement in this country \ninvolving immigration as a direct result of the President's \ndetermination to create an immigration system that he believes is \nright, but the People, through their elected Congress, have refused to \nmake law. This is a direct threat to who we are.\n  Professor Turley is so insightful about this issue. This is not some \nrightwing extremist. In testimony before the House committee, he said:\n\n       I believe the President has exceeded his brief. The \n     President is required to faithfully execute the laws.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This goes to the very heart of what is the Madisonian \n     system. If a president can unilaterally change the meaning of \n     laws in substantial ways or refuse to enforce them, it takes \n     offline that very thing that stabilizes our system. I believe \n     the members will loathe the day that they allow that to \n     happen. There will be more presidents who will claim the same \n     authority.\n       When I teach constitutional law, I often ask my students, \n     what is the limiting principle of your argument? When that \n     question is presented to this White House, too often it's \n     answered in the first person, that the President is the \n     limiting principle or at least the limiting person. We can't \n     rely on that type of assurance in our system.\n\n  Madison knew no one can be given total power without limits.\n  Professor Turley goes on to say:\n\n       The problem of what the President is doing is that he is \n     not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he \n     is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to \n     avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single \n     branch. This Newtonian orbit that the three branches exist in \n     is a delicate one, but it is designed to prevent this type of \n     concentration.\n\n  When asked explicitly if he believed the President violated the \nConstitution, he said, as I quoted before, ``The center of gravity is \nshifting, and that makes it unstable. And within that system you have \nthe rise of an uber presidency. There could be no greater danger for \nindividual liberty, and I really think that the framers would be \nhorrified by that shift because everything they've dedicated themselves \nto was creating this orbital balance, and we've lost it. . . . ''\n  He goes on to say to Congress as a challenge to us:\n\n       I believe that [Congress] is facing a critical crossroads \n     in terms of continued relevance in this process. What this \n     body cannot become is a debating society where it can issue \n     rules and laws that are either complied with or not complied \n     with by the president. I think that's where we are . . . [A] \n     president cannot ignore an express statement on policy \n     grounds . . . [In] terms of the institutional issue . . . \n     look around you. Is this truly the body that existed when it \n     was formed?\n\n  So he was sitting there in the House of Representatives and he was \ntalking to Members of Congress and said:\n\n        . . . look around you. Is this truly the body that existed \n     when it was formed? Does it have the same gravitational pull \n     and authority that was given to it by its framers? You're the \n     keepers of this authority. You took an oath to uphold it. And \n     the framers assumed that you would have the institutional \n     wherewithal and, frankly, ambition to defend the turf that is \n     the legislative branch.\n\n  I think we need to--without apology--defend the law, and I think this \nis in the Congress' interest. Congress should not confirm someone to \nlead the U.S. Department of Justice who will advance this \nunconstitutional policy. Congress has a limited number of powers to \ndefend the rule of law and itself as an institution and to stop the \nexecutive branch from overreaching. It is unthinkable that we would \nignore one of those powers in the face of such a direct threat to our \nconstitutional order--an escalating pattern of overreach by the \nPresident.\n  Every day that we allow the President to erode the powers of the \nCongress, we are allowing the President to erode the sacred \nconstitutional rights of the citizens we serve. We have a duty to this \ninstitution and to the American people not to confirm someone who is \nnot committed to those principles but rather who will continue to \nviolate them.\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\n  I will oppose this nomination and urge my colleagues to do so. I \nthink we should see a bipartisan vote rejecting this nomination, and in \ndoing so, Congress will send a clear message that we expect the \nPresident to abide by the law passed by Congress, not to violate it.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. For almost 2 months, I have been returning to the Senate \nfloor to urge the majority leader to schedule the confirmation vote for \nour next Attorney General. Yesterday afternoon, we were finally able to \nget an agreement that was long overdue. But even now, this morning, we \nare not voting to confirm Loretta Lynch to be the next Attorney General \nof the United States; we are going to vote on whether to invoke cloture \nin regard to this top law enforcement position.\n  For those not familiar with the rules of the Senate, cloture is a \nrule that allows the Senate to end a filibuster.\n  The fact that Senate Republicans are requiring a cloture vote on her \nnomination acknowledges what we have known all along: Republicans have \nbeen engaged in an unprecedented filibuster of this nomination.\n  When we do vote to confirm Loretta Lynch this afternoon, she will be \nthe first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General. She is a \nhistoric nominee, but it is Senate Republicans who are making history--\nand I would say for the wrong reasons. We have had 82 Attorneys General \nin our Nation's history. Until now, not one of those 82 has had to \novercome a cloture vote. But this one, Loretta Lynch, as I said, the \nfirst African-American woman to serve as Attorney General, became the \nfirst and only to have to overcome a cloture vote.\n  I would have opposed any filibuster on any President. I have been \nhere with President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President \nBush, President Clinton, another President Bush, and President Obama. \nNeither Republicans nor Democrats have seen this.\n  President Obama first announced Ms. Lynch's nomination more than 5 \nmonths ago. At the time, Senate Democrats acceded to the request of \nSenate Republicans not to move her nomination during the lame duck \nperiod. Republicans promised that she would be treated fairly.\n  In fact, last fall, the now-majority leader promised that ``Ms. Lynch \nwill receive fair consideration by the Senate. And her nomination \nshould be considered in the new Congress through regular order.'' But \nshe hasn't been treated fairly. There hasn't been regular order.\n  The nomination of Ms. Lynch has been pending in the Senate awaiting \nconfirmation for 56 days. I went back over the last seven Attorneys \nGeneral. I added up the number of days they waited for confirmation on \nthe floor. She has waited longer than all seven of them put together \ntwice over, so twice as long as the seven preceding Republican and \nDemocratic Attorneys General combined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; \nWilliam Barr, 5 days; Janet Reno, 1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days, Alberto \nGonzales, 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. I \nhave said it repeatedly, but it bears repeating again: this historic \ndelay is an embarrassment for the United States Senate.\n  As the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Ms. Lynch \nbrought terrorists and cyber criminals to justice. She obtained \nconvictions against corrupt public officials from both political \nparties. She fought tirelessly against violent crime and financial \nfraud. Ms. Lynch has protected the rights of victims. She has a proven \nrecord prosecuting human traffickers and protecting children.\n  I am glad that yesterday the Senate was finally able to overcome an \nimpasse on trafficking legislation which, unfortunately, those on the \nother side of the aisle caused by injecting partisan politics into the \ndebate. That Republican leaders tied a vote on the confirmation of Ms. \nLynch to human trafficking legislation never made sense at all, \nespecially given her strong record of prosecuting human traffickers.\n  In a recent article, the Guardian rightly pointed out that the \nRepublican leaderships' use of her nomination as a negotiating chip was \n``painfully wrongheaded--tantamount to holding the sheriff back until \ncrime goes away.'' I could not agree more. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Guardian article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  We all know that Loretta Lynch is eminently qualified to be our next \nAttorney General. She should not have been delayed for so many months \nby the Senate majority. And we should not be forced to vote to cut off \ndebate on this nomination, especially when no other Attorney General \nnominee has ever needed such a vote. This is the complete opposite of \nthe fair treatment that Senate Republicans promised last November. \nAfter this extended delay on the Lynch nomination, I can only hope \nSenate Republicans will show her more respect as Attorney General of \nthe United States than she has received as a nominee. She deserves our \nrespect and gratitude for being willing to continue to serve our \nNation. She has earned this respect.\n  Ms. Lynch's story is one of perseverance, grace, and grit and I \nbelieve this process will only make her stronger. She was born and \nraised in North Carolina. She is the daughter of a fourth-generation \nBaptist preacher and a school librarian. Her proud mother and father \ninstilled in her the American values of fairness and equality, even \nthough as a child those around them were not living up to these values.\n  I must say that meeting Reverend Lynch at these hearings and then \nmeeting him at the time of the markup--I was so impressed with the \nstrength that man showed and his sense of faith in goodness. This is a \npastor and a preacher we can all look up to. In fact, Ms. Lynch recalls \nriding on Reverend Lynch's shoulders to their church, where students \norganized peaceful protests against racial segregation. The freedom \nsongs and the church music that went hand in hand with those protests \nundoubtedly made up the sound track of her childhood. As Attorney \nGeneral, I am sure she will draw upon those childhood experiences and \nthe struggles of her parents, her grandparents, and her great-\ngrandparents when addressing the current protests over too many young \nlives lost on our streets.\n  As I said, the Judiciary Committee was honored to have her father, \nthe Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, with us on both days of her hearing in \nJanuary, as well as at the committee markup when her nomination was \nfavorably reported with bipartisan support. He is here to watch these \nproceedings today. It is clear this undoubtedly proud father instilled \nin his daughter the great resilience she has shown over the past 6 \nmonths.\n  As a Senator, as have other Senators, I have gotten to meet wonderful \npeople from all walks of life, up to and including Presidents, but I \nhave said many times before and I will say again that meeting Reverend \nLynch was really a very special moment in this Senator's life.\n  Throughout Loretta Lynch's life, those who encountered her \nintelligence and her tenacity have not all been prepared to accept her \nand her impressive accomplishments. But at every point, the content of \nher character has shone through and led her to even greater heights.\n  In elementary school, administrators did not believe that Loretta \nLynch could score as high as she did on a standardized test. They \ndemanded that she retake the test. How could this young African-\nAmerican girl score so high? She took the test again and her second \nscore was even higher.\n  In high school, she rose to the very top of her class but had to \nshare the title of valedictorian with two other students, one of whom \nwas White, because school administrators feared an African-American \nvaledictorian was too controversial. But that didn't hold her back, \neither. She kept going forward. She went on to graduate with honors \nfrom Harvard College, and then she went on and earned her law degree \nfrom Harvard Law School.\n  This has been the story of Loretta Lynch's life. While some are not \nready to embrace her distinction, she marches forward with grace to \nprove she is even stronger and more qualified than her detractors can \nimagine. She has dedicated the majority of her remarkable career to \npublic service, and\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\nwe are fortunate as a nation that she wants to continue to serve.\n  Ms. Lynch's record of accomplishments makes me confident she will be \nable to lead the Justice Department through the complex challenges it \nfaces today.\n  One issue the outgoing Attorney General prioritized was the \nprotection of Americans' right to vote. After the Supreme Court's \ndisastrous ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, Republican governors and \nState legislatures exploited the decision and implemented sweeping \nvoter suppression laws that disproportionately affect African Americans \nand other minorities. Ms. Lynch will have to continue the commitment to \nfighting voting rights for all Americans.\n  At a time of severe budget cuts for too many vital programs that help \nvictims and support public safety, something must be done about the \nmassive financial burden that is the Bureau of Prisons. One-third of \nDOJ's budget goes to BOP. This imbalance has largely been driven by our \nreliance on drug mandatory minimum sentences, which do not make us \nsafer but are costing us plenty. These sentences explain why the United \nStates has the largest prison population in the world. We must work \ntogether on more thoughtful solutions to address our mass incarceration \nproblem.\n  Few issues affect communities and families as intimately as \naddiction. Vermont, like many parts of the country, has seen a recent \nsurge in the abuse of heroin and other opioids. The Department must \nwork with States to find solutions to support communities struggling \nwith heroin and other opioids, and help them break the cycle of \naddiction.\n  The Attorney General will also be called upon to build on the \nsometimes strained relationship between law enforcement and communities \nof color, which has been exacerbated by the recent tragic events in \nFerguson, New York, and South Carolina. Restoring that trust will be as \ngreat a responsibility as she will have while in office.\n  Nor are these issues of trust limited to local law enforcement. Just \nthe other day, a Washington Post article detailed the fact that the \nJustice Department and the FBI acknowledged numerous instances of \nflawed testimony by FBI examiners over a two-decade period in \nconnection with hair analysis evidence. This included dozens of cases \ninvolving defendants who were sentenced to death row. This troubling \nrevelation means that the FBI must conduct a comprehensive analysis to \nprevent future breakdowns such as this.\n  The Justice Department must also keep up with the rapid development \nof technology. We must stay ahead of the curve to prevent and fight \nthreats to cybersecurity and data privacy. The growing threat of cyber \ncrime is very real but so is the specter of unchecked government \nintrusion into our private lives--particularly dragnet surveillance \nprograms directed at American citizens. The intelligence community \nfaces a critical deadline this June when three sections of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act are set to expire. We must protect our \nnational security and our civil liberties. We must work together to \nreform our Nation's surveillance laws so we can achieve both goals and \nrestore the public's trust.\n  When President Obama announced his intention to nominate Ms. Lynch \nlast November, I had the privilege of attending the White House \nceremony. At that event, Ms. Lynch noted with admiration that ``the \nDepartment of Justice is the only cabinet department named for an \nideal.'' Just think of that. The Department of Justice is named for an \nideal--the ideal of justice. And having served as a State prosecutor, \nalthough not with the complexity she has encountered, I always felt \nthat was an ideal to uphold, and she has. I believe that when Loretta \nLynch is sworn in as our next Attorney General, she will work \ntirelessly to make that ideal a reality for all Americans.\n  As I said, I am sorry that for the first time, after 82 Attorneys \nGeneral, we have to have a cloture vote. I have great respect for my \nfriends in the Republican leadership, but I must say they sent an awful \nsignal to America in saying that for the first time in 82 Attorneys \nGeneral, we require a cloture vote for this highly qualified woman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Guardian, Apr. 21, 2015]\n\nLoretta Lynch `Led the Nation' on Human Trafficking Despite Republican \n                                Standoff\n\n                           (By Tom McCarthy)\n\n       Republican leaders say they'll hold up Lynch's confirmation \n     until trafficking bill passes--and yet Lynch has been one of \n     America's boldest pursuers of sex traffickers, Guardian \n     review reveals.\n       After almost six months, the Republican blockade on the \n     confirmation of Loretta Lynch as the next US attorney \n     general--once a grand fight over immigration, then banking \n     prosecutions, then abortion--appears headed for a final \n     legislative showdown over protecting victims of sex \n     trafficking.\n       But the biggest Congressional headache of the year--a \n     single cabinet nomination effectively hijacking the \n     legislative calendar--has culminated in ``a very sad irony'': \n     Lynch has been one of the country's premier guardians of \n     victims of sex trafficking, and a tireless scourge of sex \n     traffickers, a review of her record and conversations with \n     current and former colleagues reveal.\n       Lynch--according to prosecutors, officials and victims' \n     advocates familiar with her tenure as US attorney for the \n     eastern district of New York--has a prodigious history of \n     throwing sex traffickers in prison, breaking up prostitution \n     rings, rescuing underage victims forced to work as \n     prostitutes and reuniting mothers held captive by the rings \n     with their long-lost children.\n       Heading into what could be the final day of protracted \n     negotiations over her job as the nation's highest law \n     enforcement officer, Lynch's supporters spoke at length with \n     the Guardian about what they say is one of the most powerful \n     legacies of her tenure.\n       Republicans have not challenged Lynch's record as a \n     prosecutor of sex trafficking--or any other part of her \n     record. But Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has clung \n     to an announcement that he would hold up her nomination until \n     the Senate completed work on the Justice for Victims of \n     Trafficking Act, which would create a compensation fund for \n     victims. Republican and Democratic senators are squabbling \n     over abortion language in the bill.\n       ``I had hoped to turn to her next week, but if we can't \n     finish the trafficking bill, she will be put off again,'' \n     McConnell said. More than a month later, that hold is still \n     in place, although Republicans aides on Friday signaled \n     potential new movement on the nomination, after President \n     Obama called the delay ``embarrassing''.\n       To those with close knowledge of Lynch's record on human \n     trafficking, the hold-up has not been embarrassing, so much \n     as painfully wrong-headed--tantamount to holding the sheriff \n     back until crime goes away.\n       Carol Robles-Roman, who in 12 years as deputy mayor of New \n     York City worked closely with Lynch's office to stop young \n     girls from falling victim to sex traffickers, said Lynch had \n     made ``protecting the most vulnerable members of our society \n     a hallmark of her tenure''.\n       ``The irony that it's a trafficking bill that's holding \n     everything up is just . . . it's a very sad irony,'' said \n     Robles-Roman, who now runs the nonprofit Legal Momentum. \n     ``The fact of the matter is, with this record, she has been \n     one of the top leaders in the country around the fight \n     against human trafficking.\n       ``This is such a difficult area for prosecutors to wrap \n     their hands around. And her office, the eastern district, has \n     really distinguished itself in the cases that they have \n     brought, and the fearlessness that they have shown in \n     prosecuting these cases.''\n\n\n                 `Heinous' cases with real resolutions\n\n       Lori Cohen, director of the anti-trafficking initiative at \n     New York-based Sanctuary for Families, has worked closely \n     with Lynch's office, including to reunite victims of sex \n     trafficking with their children, who in multiple cases have \n     been held in Mexico by members of the trafficking \n     organization.\n       ``The eastern district prosecutors have been exceptional in \n     terms of their willingness to listen to the clients,'' Cohen \n     said. ``And I think that, frankly, that came from the top, \n     that came from the attorney general nominee. I think she has \n     always had a very high degree of professionalism, but also a \n     very strong sense of compassion for victims. And a strong \n     sense of justice, that people who are exploiting these \n     vulnerable immigrant women and children in the commercial sex \n     industry need to be held accountable.''\n       In the typical sex trafficking case prosecuted under Lynch, \n     a community services organization might tip off law \n     enforcement to the presence of a prostitution ring based in \n     Brooklyn or Queens, New York. Investigators would discover \n     many girls and young women living under the control of men \n     who forced them to work in brothels or who drove them around \n     the city, sometimes to as many as 20 assignments a day.\n       Anne Milgram, a former prosecutor on human trafficking \n     cases in the eastern district, who went on to serve as \n     attorney general of New Jersey and is now a senior fellow at \n     the New York University school of law, said one after another \n     of the trafficking cases were prosecuted because Lynch made \n     them a ``personal priority''.\n       ``Under her leadership, the eastern district has really led \n     the nation in this area,''\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n     Milgram said. ``I really couldn't say enough good things \n     about both the office and Loretta Lynch's record on human \n     trafficking. If you look nationally to find a US attorney who \n     was as thoughtful and progressive in prosecuting human \n     trafficking cases, I don't think you could find one.''\n       Lynch's office has specialized in breaking up rings that \n     share a remarkable similarity. Members of family-based crime \n     syndicates in Mexico, in a repeated pattern, would seek out \n     young girls in poor, rural areas and make them promises of \n     love and a better life in the United States. Sometimes a \n     marriage would follow. And then the girls would be introduced \n     to a new life, in which they were coerced to work as \n     prostitutes. Obedience was enforced with rape, beatings, \n     imprisonment, and, in some cases, by threatening the lives of \n     children born of the corrupt ``love'' affairs.\n       ``Any trafficking victim is going to be suffering in a \n     tremendous physical and emotional harm, and pretty extensive \n     sexual abuse,'' Cohen said. ``But these particular Mexican \n     trafficking cases are so difficult for our victims because \n     usually the trafficker is an intimate partner. So it could be \n     a man who held himself out to be a boyfriend, or a fiance, \n     and in at least one case it's been a husband. Who courted a \n     client, who won her trust, and her love, and in a number of \n     cases had children with her.''\n       ``You just pull the facts of one of these cases, and \n     they're heinous,'' Robles-Roman said. ``They almost don't \n     sound real.''\n\n\n                 The most active record in the country\n\n       Lynch's office has specialized in breaking up these rings. \n     The eastern district of New York has delivered more than 55 \n     indictments in human trafficking cases and rescued more than \n     110 victims, including at least 20 minors, in the past 10 \n     years.\n       Under Lynch, the eastern district is currently prosecuting \n     at least five cases relating to the prostitution of US minors \n     or sex trafficking--more active prosecutions than any other \n     US attorney's office in the country, according to \n     knowledgeable observers.\n       In 2012, Lynch's office reunited a child and mother who had \n     been separated for more than 10 years when the woman was \n     taken from Mexico to New York and forced to work as a \n     prostitute. It was one of 18 such mother-and-child reunions \n     completed by the eastern district.\n       Cohen worked with a client who was reunited with her child \n     after a conviction by Lynch's office.\n       ``It was really very moving,'' Cohen said. ``My client had \n     been separated from her child for a number of years and was \n     really frantic about her child's safety. Frankly it's \n     terrifying for a victim to come forward and report the abuse, \n     when she is afraid that if word of her cooperation gets back \n     to her traffickers, there's very little protection available \n     for her child back in Mexico.\n       ``These clients, when they have children, they are mothers \n     first. And they'll do anything to protect their children. In \n     fact some of them continue to be trafficked because they were \n     afraid that if they stopped or refused, that their children \n     would be harmed.''\n       In December 2012, Lynch announced the extradition and \n     arraignment of four suspects from Mexico in two separate sex \n     trafficking cases. In 2013, Lynch sent a New York bar owner \n     and two co-defendants to prison for dozens of years each for \n     running a sex-trafficking ring between Central America, \n     Mexico and two bars on Long Island. In 2014, three brothers \n     convicted of sex trafficking were sentenced to double-digit \n     prison terms for enticing victims as young as 14 to be \n     transported illegally into the United States and forced to \n     work as prostitutes in New York City and elsewhere.\n       ``It's horrible to think that children in the United States \n     are being exploited sexually,'' said Robles-Roman. ``They \n     are. [But Lynch's] office has shown that they have the \n     courage, the know-how, and the expertise to prosecute these \n     people--some of them involving international criminal \n     enterprises.\n       ``From my perspective, somebody who has that vision, and \n     that eye, to protect our most vulnerable, can protect us all. \n     It is a fearlessness that we need in our attorney general.''\n       As of Monday, after what minority leader Harry Reid called \n     ``164 very long days'', there was still no Senate deal over \n     the abortion language in the trafficking legislation, \n     although signs emerged that a deal may be close.\n       If Republicans stick to their promise, it will then be \n     Lynch's turn. And if she is confirmed, to hear Lynch's former \n     colleagues tell it, the Senate will have made a difference on \n     behalf of society's most vulnerable.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, today I rise to talk about what has come to \ndefine the Obama administration, which is a consistent pattern of \nlawlessness that disrespects the Constitution, that disrespects the \nCongress, and that disrespects the people of the United States.\n  In any administration, under any President, the person charged with \nbeing the chief law enforcement officer is the Attorney General. I have \nbeen blessed to work in the U.S. Department of Justice, and there is a \nlong, bipartisan tradition of Attorneys General remaining faithful to \nthe law and to the Constitution and setting aside partisan \nconsiderations and politics. Unfortunately, that tradition has not been \nhonored during the Obama Presidency.\n  Attorney General Eric Holder has been the most partisan Attorney \nGeneral the United States has ever seen. The Attorney General has \nsystematically refused to do anything to seriously investigate or \nprosecute the IRS for targeting citizens for expressing their First \nAmendment rights. Indeed, he has assigned the investigation to a major \nDemocratic donor and partisan Democrat who has given over $6,000 to \nPresident Obama and the Democrats. Eric Holder has abused the office \nand has turned it, in many respects, into a partisan arm of the \nDemocratic Party. He is the only Attorney General in the history of the \nUnited States to be held in contempt of Congress.\n  So there are many, including me, who would very much like to see Eric \nHolder replaced. There are many, including me, who would very much like \nto see an Attorney General who will return to the bipartisan traditions \nof the Department of Justice of fidelity to law, and that includes most \nimportantly the willingness to stand up to the President who appointed \nyou even if he or she is from the same political party as are you.\n  During the confirmation hearings, I very much wanted to support \nLoretta Lynch's nomination. Bringing in a new Attorney General should \nbe turning a positive page in this country. But, unfortunately, the \nanswers Ms. Lynch gave in the confirmation hearing, in my opinion, \nrendered her unsuitable for confirmation as Attorney General of the \nUnited States. That was a shame.\n  Ms. Lynch's record as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of \nNew York had earned her a reputation as a relatively no-nonsense \nprosecutor, so it was my hope that we would see a similar approach and \nsimilar answers from Ms. Lynch at the confirmation hearing. Instead, \nshe chose to embrace the lawlessness of the Holder Justice Department.\n  When she was asked whether she would defend President Obama's illegal \nExecutive amnesty, which President Obama has acknowledged no fewer than \n22 times that he had no constitutional authority to undertake and which \na Federal court has now enjoined as unlawful, she responded \naffirmatively, saying she thought the administration's contrived legal \njustification was ``reasonable.''\n  The nominee went on to say that she sees nothing wrong with the \nPresident's decision to unilaterally grant lawful status and work \nauthorizations that are explicitly barred by Federal law to nearly 5 \nmillion people who are here in this country illegally.\n  When asked further who has ``more a right to a job, a United States \ncitizen or a person who came to this country illegally?'' she \nresponded, ``I believe that the right and obligation to work is one \nthat is shared by everyone in this country, regardless of how they came \nhere.'' Well, a very large majority of American citizens would beg to \ndiffer. Rule of law matters.\n  When she was asked about the limits of prosecutorial discretion--the \ndubious theory President Obama has put forth to justify his illegal \nexecutive amnesty--she could give no limits to that theory.\n  When asked if a subsequent President could use prosecutorial \ndiscretion to order the Treasury Secretary not to enforce the tax laws \nand to collect no more income taxes in excess of 25 percent, she \nrefused to answer.\n  When asked if a subsequent President could use that same theory to \nexempt the State of Texas--all 27 million people--from every single \nFederal labor law and environmental law, she refused to answer.\n  When asked if she agreed with the Holder Justice Department that the \ngovernment could place a GPS sensor on the car of every single American \nwithout probable cause, she refused to answer. That extreme view was \nrejected by the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously.\n  When asked if she agreed with the Holder Justice Department that the \nFirst Amendment gives no religious liberty protection whatsoever to a \nchurch's or synagogue's choice of their own pastor or their own rabbi, \nshe\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nagain refused to answer. Likewise, that extreme view was rejected \nunanimously by the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, Justice Elena Kagan--\nappointed by President Obama--said at the oral argument that the Holder \nJustice Department's position that the First Amendment says nothing \nabout the religious liberty of a church or a synagogue--Justice Kagan \nsaid, ``I find your position amazing.'' Well, I am sorry to say that \nMs. Lynch was unwilling to answer whether she holds that same amazing \nposition, that the First Amendment does not protect the religious \nliberty of people of faith in this country.\n  When asked in her hearing if she believes the Federal Government \ncould employ a drone to kill a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil if that \nindividual posed no imminent threat, she refused to answer.\n  When asked if she would be willing to appoint a special prosecutor to \ninvestigate the IRS's targeting of citizens and citizen groups for \ntheir political views--something which President Obama said he was \n``angry about and the American people had a right to be angry about''--\nand when asked if she would appoint a prosecutor who was at a minimum \nnot a major Obama donor, she refused to answer.\n  This nominee has given every indication that she will continue the \nHolder Justice Department's lawlessness. That was her testimony to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee.\n  I wanted to support this nomination. I wanted to see a new Attorney \nGeneral who would be faithful to law. But her answers made that \nimpossible.\n  I would note that there is a difference. Eric Holder began \ndisregarding the Constitution and laws after he was confirmed as \nAttorney General. Ms. Lynch has told the Senate that is what she is \ngoing to do. That means each and every one of us bears responsibility. \nIn my view, no Senator can vote for this confirmation consistent with \nher or her oath given the answers that were given.\n  I would note that a particular onus falls on the new Republican \nmajority. For several months, I have called on the Republican majority \nto block the confirmation of President Obama's executive and judicial \nnominees other than vital national security positions unless and until \nthe President rescinds his lawless amnesty. I am sorry to say the \nmajority leadership has been unwilling to do so.\n  The Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this \nnomination, but the Republican majority has chosen to go forward and \nallow Loretta Lynch to be confirmed.\n  I would note that there are more than a few voters back home who are \nasking: What exactly is the difference between a Democratic and \nRepublican majority when the exact same individual gets confirmed as \nAttorney General promising the exact same lawlessness? What is the \ndifference? That is a question each of us will have to answer to our \nconstituents when we go home.\n  In my view, the obligation of every Senator to defend the \nConstitution is front and center why we are here. We have a nominee who \nhas told the Senate she is unwilling to impose any limits whatsoever on \nthe authority of the President of the United States for the next 20 \nmonths. We are sadly going to see more and more lawlessness, more \nregulatory abuse, more abuse of power, more Executive lawlessness.\n  Now more than ever, we need an Attorney General with the integrity \nand faithfulness of law to stand up to the President. Attorneys General \nin both parties, Republican and Democratic, have done so. When credible \nallegations of wrongdoing by Richard Nixon were raised, his Attorney \nGeneral, Elliot Richardson, appointed a special prosecutor, Archibald \nCox, to investigate regardless of partisan politics. Likewise, when \ncredible allegations by Bill Clinton arose, his Attorney General, Janet \nReno--a Democrat--appointed Robert Fisk as the independent counsel to \ninvestigate those allegations. Eric Holder has been unwilling to \ndemonstrate that same faithfulness to law, and unfortunately Ms. Lynch \nhas told us that she, too, is unwilling to do so. For that reason, I \nurge all of my colleagues to vote no on cloture and to insist on an \nAttorney General who will uphold her oath to the Constitution and to \nthe people of the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to vote \nand to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of confirming Loretta Lynch \nas Attorney General.\n  I disagree with my colleague from Texas. I serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee, as does the Senator from Texas. I listened to her questions. \nI asked her questions. I listened to her answers. In my view, she \npassed her senatorial interview. She has picked up support from several \nRepublicans. She answered questions for 8 hours during her confirmation \nhearing and submitted detailed responses to 900 written questions.\n  What I would like to focus on today are the claims I just heard from \nthe Senator from Texas that she is somehow lawless.\n  Let's look through the facts. She has earned the support of Members \nof both parties. Do the Republicans who support her for this position \nthink she is lawless? I don't think so. She has earned the support of \ntop law enforcement groups and 25 former U.S. attorneys from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n  Now let's start with the obvious. She is supremely qualified for \nAttorney General. She has a world-class legal mind, an unwavering \ncommitment to justice, an unimpeachable character, and an extraordinary \nrecord of achievement.\n  During her time as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New \nYork, she tackled some of our Nation's hardest cases, from public \ncorruption, to civil rights violations, to massive crime rings. She \ncurrently leads the U.S. attorney's office that has been charged with \nprosecuting more terrorism cases since 9/11 than any other office in \nthe country, including trying the Al Qaeda operative who plotted to \nattack New York City's subway system. Would you hand this over to a \nlawless person? No. You would hand this over--this important job of \ngoing after terrorists--to someone who respects the law, who enforces \nthe law, not, as my colleague from Texas said, to someone who is \nlawless.\n  This is a concern in my State. Just this week, our U.S. attorney, \nAndy Luger, indicted six people--six people--in the Twin Cities area \nwho were plotting to go back to assist ISIS, to assist a terrorist \ngroup. So I care a lot about having an Attorney General in place who \nactually knows how to handle these terrorism cases, who is going to \nlead the Justice Department and understands the importance of going \nafter these cases. Loretta Lynch is exactly the type of tough and \ntested leader we need at the Justice Department to lead the effort.\n  She has been endorsed by leaders ranging from the New York police \ncommissioner--I don't know if my colleague from Texas considers him \nlawless--to the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, to the president of the National Association of Chiefs of \nPolice. Alberto Gonzales says it is time to vote on Ms. Lynch. Rudy \nGiuliani says it is time to confirm her. These are not people my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle normally say are lawless.\n  This is the story of Loretta Lynch and why I think she has been able \nto wait out this long process. Loretta Lynch has a lot of patience. \nWhen she was a little girl, she took a test and did incredibly well on \nthat test. She did so well that they didn't believe she took that test. \nThey asked her to take that test again, and she scored even higher. \nWhen she was valedictorian of the class, the principal came up to her \nand said: You know, this is a little awkward. You are African American, \nand we might want another White student to share the honor. That is \nwhat happened to her. She said: All right. That is a woman who has been \nthrough something and can wait this out. She will wait no longer after \ntoday.\n  The other thing I heard from our friends on the other side of the \naisle--from Senator Cruz--was that somehow she is lawless because she \nsupported something that every President since Dwight Eisenhower has \nsupported, has asked their Attorney General to do. The Attorney General \nhas looked at the legal issues surrounding the issuance of an Executive \norder regarding immigration. Every Attorney General since Eisenhower's \nadministration has advised their President on these issues. The first \nGeorge Bush, the second George Bush, Ronald Reagan--with\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\nevery single one of these Presidents, there was some kind of Executive \norder issued involving immigrants.\n  I know because we have Liberians in Minnesota who, because of unrest \nin their country, have been there for decades under an Executive order, \nsomething that sometimes Congress gets involved and sometimes the \nPresident reissues. But that is one example of a group of people who \nhave been able to stay in our country legally, work in our hospitals, \nwork in our industries, and raise their families in this country \nbecause of Executive orders.\n  So to say that it is sometimes lawless--how lawless for her to \nsupport this simple idea that a President can issue an Executive order. \nOf course, we can debate the merits of that. We can talk about the fact \nthat of course we would rather have comprehensive immigration reform. \nThat is why I voted it. Of course that would be better, so the \nPresident could just tear up his Executive action. He said he would be \nglad to do that.\n  But the point of this is that every Attorney General in the \nRepublican administrations since Dwight Eisenhower has supported their \nPresident when they issued an Executive order. So this idea that by \nsomehow saying that is legal makes this nominee lawless is just plain \nwrong.\n  We look forward to another robust debate on immigration policy. \nComprehensive immigration reform should be debated and passed by \nCongress. But Ms. Lynch should be judged on her record and her record \nalone. When we look at her record, we should be proud to have her as \nour next Attorney General of the United States of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks \nabout Loretta Lynch. While she should have been confirmed as Attorney \nGeneral months ago, I want to make the following points: Her \nqualifications are sterling. Her education, her experience as a U.S. \nattorney under two Presidents, as well as her accomplishments are \nunassailable.\n  I have never seen a nominee in my 22 years handle a confirmation \nhearing with such poise and answer questions with such command. During \nher hearing, I said Loretta Lynch was a combination of steel and \nvelvet, and that, to me, sums her up perfectly.\n  I met with her prior to her hearing and was deeply impressed. I \nreviewed her stellar record and found her to be a firm yet fair \nprosecutor--as a matter of fact, probably the prosecutor in one of the \ntoughest districts--the Eastern District of New York--that exists in \nAmerica.\n  Having led this very large and important U.S. Attorney's Office under \ntwo Presidents, she is a proven leader and she also knows how to bring \npeople together to get the job done. I think that is important.\n  Let me just talk about national security. The Eastern District of New \nYork, where Ms. Lynch served as U.S. attorney, has led the Nation in \nterrorism convictions among all U.S. Attorney Offices since 2001. She \nhas overseen these cases. The six individuals connected to Najibullah \nZazi, who was part of an Al Qaeda plot and planned to set off bombs on \nthe New York subway system; Rezwanul Nafis, who attempted to use a \nweapon of mass destruction against the New York Federal Reserve Bank; \nfour individuals, including Russell Defreitas, who plotted to attack \nJFK Airport; an individual who tried to go to Yemen to join Al Qaeda in \nthe Arabian Peninsula; and two individuals who allegedly were members \nof Al Qaeda and attacked U.S. military forces overseas.\n  In February, her office announced that three individuals had been \ncharged with attempting and conspiring to provide material support to \nISIL. Two were planning to fly to Syria to join ISIL. The third was \narrested while boarding a flight to Turkey at JFK. Her office has also \ncharged 11 individuals, alleging that they illegally worked to secure \nmore than $50 million in high-tech equipment for Russian military and \nintelligence agencies.\n  At her confirmation hearing, Lynch emphasized the importance of the \ngovernment having the ``full panoply of investigative tools and \ntechniques to deal with the ever-evolving threat of terrorism.'' In \nsum, I am confident she is going to be a very strong voice leading the \nJustice Department on issues of national security. I can only say I \nthink, as those of us on the Intelligence Committee see--and the \nPresiding Officer is one of them--this becomes more important every \nday.\n  Her experience is just as deep on domestic issues. As U.S. attorney \nfor a major urban district, she clearly understands the importance of \nprotecting us from gangs and organized crime, issues that are front and \ncenter in my home State of California.\n  Her work in this area shows she understands local and international \ncriminal organizations.\n  In the last year, under her leadership, three individuals connected \nto a major organized crime family pleaded guilty to a racketeering \nconspiracy.\n  A gang leader was found responsible, after a five-week trial, ``for \nsix murders, two attempted murder[s], armed robberies, murder-for-hire, \nnarcotics, distribution, and gambling on dog fighting.''\n  Another gang leader was convicted and sentenced to 37 years in prison \nfor ordering the murder of two individuals, one of whom was believed to \nbe associated with a rival gang.\n  Three individuals in a New York cell of an international cybercrime \norganization were also convicted on charges stemming from cyberattacks \nthat resulted in $45 million in losses.\n  She has also made combatting human trafficking a priority. Over the \nlast decade, her office's anti-trafficking program has indicted more \nthan 55 defendants in sex trafficking cases and rescued more than 110 \nvictims of sex trafficking, including more than 20 minors.\n  Simply put, Loretta Lynch has been on the frontlines in investigating \nand prosecuting a range of perpetrators, and I believe she will \ncontinue that work as Attorney General.\n  I would be remiss if I did not express my extreme disappointment in \nthe delay over Ms. Lynch's confirmation. We have before us a nominee \nwith impeccable credentials to serve as the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer. During her confirmation, Senator Leahy asked a \npanel of witnesses who were pro and supposedly con to raise their hands \nif they opposed her. Not a single witness raised their hand. To me, \nthat spoke volumes.\n  Even Republicans who will vote against her because they disagree with \nthe President praise her credentials and personal qualifications. But \ndespite all of that, the Senate subjected her to, I think, an \ninexcusable delay. It is particularly sensitive because this would be \nthe first African-American woman as Attorney General in the history of \nthe United States.\n  If you look at race relations today and the impartial and important \nrole that the Department of Justice plays, it seems to me that her \nappointment may well be the most important possible appointment at this \nparticular point in time. Her nomination has been pending for 56 days \non the floor. That is more than twice as long as the seven most recent \nAttorneys General combined.\n  So, hopefully, it is done now. I recognize the other side will say \nthey could not move the nomination because of the trafficking bill or \nfor some other reason. But the fact remains that, historically, we \ncustomarily move back and forth between executive and legislative \nbusiness. We could have done that here as well. We have confirmed \ndistrict judges, we have confirmed individuals who serve in various \nother executive capacities, including subcabinet positions. So we could \nhave easily considered the nominee for one of the most important posts \nin this government.\n  Let me conclude with this. I regret that a vote on her nomination \ncannot be unanimous. I hope it will be close to that. I do not think \nthat will be possible. She is that good. She deserves a unanimous vote. \nShe is as fine as I have seen in my time in the Senate.\n  Senator Durbin remarked in committee that her confirmation will be a \ntruly momentous occasion for the Senate and for our Nation. He said \nthis should be a ``solemn, important, and historic moment for \nAmerica.'' I truly believe he was right. I truly believe this is an \nuncommon nominee at an uncommon time who can display a tremendous will, \ndrive, motivation, and sense of justice as our U.S. Attorney\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\nGeneral. I am very honored to cast my vote in favor of her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, briefly, this should be a happy day \nfor America. This should be a day that is circled on the calendar as \nanother day, as the Presiding Officer of this Senate knows, that this \nis about the American dream. This woman is the embodiment of the \nAmerican dream in action. We should be celebrating her confirmation to \nthe most important law enforcement position in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  So why am I not happy? I am sad. I am depressed, because what we are \ngoing to witness in a few minutes is base politics at its ugliest. It \ndoes not get any uglier than this because what we are saying today--\nwhat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are saying today is \nthat it does not matter if you are qualified. It does not matter if you \nare one of the most qualified nominees for Attorney General in the \nhistory of our country. That makes no difference. We have a new test: \nYou must disagree with the President who nominates you. Let me say that \nagain because we love common sense in Missouri. This defies common \nsense. You must vote against a nominee for the Cabinet of the duly \nelected President of the United States because she agrees with the duly \nelected President of the United States. Think of the consequences of \nthat vote. Think what that means to the future of advise and consent in \nthis Senate.\n  If we all adopt this base politics ``place in the cheap seats,'' I \ncan't get elected President unless I am against Loretta Lynch, if we \nall adopt that in the future, how is any President elected in this \ncountry going to assemble a Cabinet? Because it will be incumbent on \nall of us to be against Cabinet members who have the nerve to agree \nwith the President who has selected them for their team.\n  It is beyond depressing. It is disgusting. She is so qualified. She \nhas worked so hard all of her life. She is a prosecutor's prosecutor. \nShe has prosecuted more terrorists than almost anybody on the face of \nthe planet. The notion that this has occurred because she agrees with \nthe man who selected her--I think everyone needs to understand what \nthat means to the future if all of us embrace that kind of base \npolitics in this decision. It is not a happy day. It is a very sad day.\n  I am proud of who Loretta Lynch is. I am proud she will be Attorney \nGeneral of this country. I am sad it will be such a close vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Loretta Lynch is an historic nominee. What \nI worry about is this body is making history for the wrong reasons. \nSenate Republicans have filibustered her. She becomes the first out of \n82 Attorneys General in our Nation's history to face a filibuster.\n  On one hand she is an historic nominee for the right reason; the \nfirst African-American woman for Attorney General, a woman who is \nhighly, highly qualified. Everybody agrees with that. But what a shame \nthat we have the second part of history, to have her be the first out \nof 82 Attorneys General to be filibustered--to be held to this very \ndisturbing double standard. This woman has had to face double standards \nall her life--why one more? I will proudly vote for her.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination \n     of Loretta Lynch to be Attorney General.\n         Mitch McConnell, Richard Burr, John Cornyn, Lamar \n           Alexander, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake, Susan M.

On this vote, the yeas are 66, \nthe nays are 34.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Cloture having been invoked, under the previous order, there will be \nup to 2 hours of postcloture debate equally divided between the two \nleaders prior to a vote on the Lynch nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1191\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, last week the Senate entered a \nunanimous consent agreement to get on the bipartisan Iran congressional \nreview act at a time to be determined by the two leaders. Now that the \nSenate has passed the antitrafficking bill and the Lynch confirmation \nvote has been scheduled for later today, it is my intention to turn to \nthe Iran legislation.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. today the Senate \nagree to the motion to proceed to H.R. 1191, as under the previous \norder, with debate only during today's session of the Senate following \nthe offering of a substitute amendment by Senator Corker or his \ndesignee, as under the previous order.\n  I further ask that following leader remarks on Tuesday, April 28, \n2015, Senator Corker be recognized to offer an amendment to the pending \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that on Monday \nthere will be opportunity for debate.\n  Is that right, Mr. Leader?\n  We will do that at closing tonight. That would be good.\n  Madam President, I appreciate very much the understanding of the \nRepublican leader, the majority leader, about how to proceed on this. \nThis is a really important piece of legislation. I don't know of a \npiece of legislation in recent years that is more important than this. \nSo I look forward to the Senate turning to this legislation.\n  I again applaud and commend Senators Corker and Cardin for the \ndelicate and very good work they have done on this. This measure, I \nrepeat, is important. It deals with matters of international affairs \nand Congress's role in carrying out the constitutional responsibilities \nwe have. This bill will take some time. I hope we can finish it as \nrapidly as possible. That is what I want.\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n  I also want to comment that I think it is important we have the \nopportunity--and I am sure the Republican leader--to have our caucus on \nTuesday, so that we by that time will have an idea how we are going to \nproceed forward on this.\n  I have heard some Senators want to offer amendments really to hurt \nthis bill. I hope that, in fact, is not the case. I hope people are \ntrying to be constructive. Regardless of that, the leader has assured \nus that there will be an open amendment process. So no matter how a \nperson feels about this bill, they will have an opportunity to offer \namendments. In my opinion, we need to support the Corker-Cardin \nagreement. Those Senators worked so we can get the bill passed as soon \nas possible.\n  So I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today the Senate takes up the \nnomination of the 83rd Attorney General.\n  We all know the former Democratic leadership could have processed \nthis nomination during last year's lame duck. But in the limited time \nwe had, they chose to concentrate on confirming a number of judges and \ngetting a losing vote on NSA reform. Ms. Lynch, at that time, wasn't \nhigh on the priority of the Democratic majority, but now I am pleased \nthat the Senate was finally able to come to an agreement on the sex \ntrafficking legislation, so we can turn to the Lynch nomination.\n  I voted against Ms. Lynch's nomination in committee and will oppose \nher nomination again when it is time to vote this afternoon. I will \nspend a few minutes now explaining my reasons to my colleagues.\n  This nomination comes at a pivotal time for the Department of Justice \nand our country. The next Attorney General will face some very \ndifficult challenges--from combatting cybercrime, to protecting our \nchildren from exploitation, to helping fight the war on terror. But \nbeyond that, the new Attorney General has a mess to clean up. The \nJustice Department has been plagued the last few years by \ndecisionmaking driven by politics--pure politics. Some of these I have \nmentioned before, but I would like to give just a few examples.\n  The Department's own inspector general listed this as one of the top \nmanagement challenges for the Department of Justice: ``Restoring \nConfidence in the Integrity, Fairness, and Accountability of the \nDepartment.'' That is quite a major management challenge the Department \nfaces.\n  This inspector general cited several examples, including the \nDepartment's falsely denying basic facts in the Fast and Furious \ncontroversy. The inspector general concluded this ``resulted in an \nerosion of trust in the Department.''\n  In that fiasco, our government knowingly allowed firearms to fall \ninto the hands of international gun traffickers, and, I am sorry to \nsay, it led to the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.\n  Then how did the Department respond to all this obviously wrong \naction on their part? They denied, they spun, and they hid the facts \nfrom Congress. And if you hide the facts from the American Congress, \nyou are hiding the facts from the American people.\n  They bullied and intimidated whistleblowers, members of the press, \nand, you might say, anyone who had the audacity to investigate and help \nus uncover the truth.\n  But Fast and Furious isn't the Department's only major failing under \nthe Holder tenure. It has also failed to hold another government agency \naccountable, the Internal Revenue Service.\n  We watched with dismay as that powerful agency was weaponized and \nturned against individual citizens who spoke out in defense of faith, \nfreedom, and our Constitution. What was the Department's reaction to \nthe targeting of citizens based on their political beliefs? They \nappointed a campaign donor to lead an investigation that hasn't gone \nanywhere, and then, after that, the Department called it a day.\n  Meanwhile, the Department's top litigator, the Nation's Solicitor \nGeneral, is arguing in case after case for breathtaking expansions of \nFederal power.\n  I said this before, but it bears repeating: Had the Department \nprevailed in just some of the arguments it pressed before the Supreme \nCourt in the last several years--and I will give five examples:\n  One, there would be essentially no limit on what the Federal \nGovernment could order States to do as a condition for receiving \nFederal money.\n  Two, the Environmental Protection Agency could fine homeowners \n$75,000 a day for not complying with an order and then turn around and \ndeny that homeowner any right to challenge the order or those fines in \ncourt when the order is issued.\n  Three, the Federal Government could review decisions by religious \norganizations regarding who can serve as a minister of a particular \nreligion.\n  Four, the Federal Government could ban books that expressly advocate \nfor the election or the defeat of political candidates.\n  And five, lastly, the way this Solicitor General argued, as I said, \nwould bring the most massive expansion of Federal power in the history \nof the country. The Fourth Amendment wouldn't have anything to say \nabout the police attaching a GPS device to a citizen's car without a \nwarrant and constantly tracking their every movement for months or \nyears.\n  Now, I have given five reasons of expansion of the Federal \nGovernment. These positions aren't in any way mainstream positions. At \nthe end of the day, the common thread that binds all of these \nchallenges together is a Department of Justice which has become deeply \npoliticized. But that is what happens when the Attorney General of the \nUnited States views himself--and these are his own words--as the \nPresident's ``wingman.''\n  Because of all the politicized decisions we have witnessed over the \nlast few years, I have said from the very beginning of this process \nthat what we need more than anything else out of our new Attorney \nGeneral is independence. Ever since she was nominated, it was my \nsincere hope that Ms. Lynch would demonstrate that sort of \nindependence. It was my hope that she would make clear that, while she \nserves at the pleasure of the President, she is accountable to the \nAmerican people, because the job of Attorney General is defined by a \nduty to defend the Constitution and uphold the rule of law. The job is \nnot simply to defend the President and his policies.\n  I voted for Attorney General Holder despite some reservations and \nmisgivings, but I have come to regret that vote because of the \npolitical way he has led the Department. I realize that the quickest \nway to end his tenure as Attorney General is to confirm Ms. Lynch, but, \nas I have said, the question for me from the start has been whether Ms. \nLynch will make a clean break from the Holder policies and take the \nDepartment in a new direction.\n  Some of my Democratic colleagues have said that no one has raised any \nobjection to Ms. Lynch's nomination. This, of course, is inaccurate. No \none disputes that she has an impressive legal background. It was her \ntestimony before the committee that caused concerns for many Senators, \nincluding me. After thoroughly reviewing that testimony, I concluded \nthat she won't lead the Department in a different direction. That is \nvery unfortunate. After 6 years of Attorney General Holder's \nleadership, the Department desperately needs a change of direction.\n  I would like to remind my Democratic colleagues that it was not too \nlong ago that a majority of Democrats voted against Judge Mukasey for \nAttorney General--not based on his records but instead based upon his \ntestimony before the committee. In fact, then-Senator Obama had this to \nsay about Judge Mukasey: ``While his legal credentials are strong, his \nviews on two critical and related matters are, in my view, \ndisqualifying.''\n  I asked Ms. Lynch about her views on Fast and Furious, on the IRS \nscandal, and other ways the Department has been politicized. She did \nnot demonstrate that she would do things differently. Instead, she gave \nnonanswers.\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\nShe was eloquent and polished but nonresponsive.\n  The bottom line is that Ms. Lynch does not seem willing to commit to \na new, independent way of running the Department. That surprised me \nvery much. Based on everything we were told, I expected Ms. Lynch to \ndemonstrate a bit more independence from the President. I am confident \nthat if she had done so, she would have garnered more support.\n  As I said when the committee voted on her nomination, to illustrate \nthis point, we need to look no further than the confirmation of \nSecretary Carter to the Department of Defense earlier this year. When \nhe testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Secretary \nCarter demonstrated the type of independent streak that many of us were \nhoping we would see in Ms. Lynch.\n  Most of the media reporting on the two nominations seemed to agree. \nHeadlines regarding the Carter nomination in the New York Times and the \nWashington Post commended his shift from the President's policies with \nheadlines such as ``Defense nominee Carter casts himself as an \nindependent voice,'' which was in the Washington Post, and in the New \nYork Times, ``In Ashton Carter, Nominee for Defense Secretary, a Change \nin Direction.'' But on the Lynch nomination, those same newspapers \nhighlighted that she defended the President's policies on immigration \nand surveillance with headlines such as ``Lynch Defends Obama's \nImmigration Action,'' which was in the New York Times, and from the \nHuffington Post, ``Loretta Lynch Defends Obama's Immigration Actions.''\n  Secretary Carter was confirmed with 93 votes. Only five Senators \nvoted against Secretary Carter's nomination. That lopsided vote was a \nreflection of his testimony before the Senate, which demonstrated a \nwillingness to be an independent voice within the administration. \nUnfortunately, Ms. Lynch did not demonstrate the same type of \nindependence.\n  I sincerely hope Ms. Lynch proves me wrong and is willing to stand up \nto the President and say no when the duty of office demands it. But \nbased upon my review of her record, I cannot support the nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the nomination \nof Loretta Lynch, a proud New Yorker and soon-to-be Attorney General of \nthe United States of America. She was born in North Carolina, and her \nfather was a fourth-generation Baptist minister, a man who grew up in \nthe segregated South, and her mother picked cotton when she was a girl \nso her daughter would never have to. Their daughter grew up to be one \nof the keenest legal minds our country has to offer, someone who has \nexcelled at every stage of her education and her career while \ncultivating a reputation--well deserved--as someone who is level-\nheaded, fair, judicious, and eminently likable.\n  If there is an American dream story, Loretta Lynch is it. Still, \ndespite her intellectual and career achievements, Ms. Lynch has always \nbeen a nose-to-the-grindstone type, rarely seeking acclaim, only a job \nwell done.\n  Throughout her career, she has had a yearning to serve the public, \nwhich began when she took a 75-percent pay cut to join the Eastern \nDistrict as a prosecutor. There, she found her calling, handling some \nof the toughest litigation cases in the country on cyber crime, public \ncorruption, financial fraud, police abuse, gang activity, organized \ncrime, and especially terrorism.\n  When you look at the breadth and the depth of the cases she has \nhandled, it is clear that Loretta Lynch is law enforcement's \nRenaissance woman. Because of her judicious, balanced, and careful \napproach to prosecuting on complex and emotional community-police \nrelations matters, Ms. Lynch has always emerged with praise from both \ncommunity leaders and the police. America needs this kind of leadership \nin our top law enforcement position.\n  In this age of global terrorism, the Attorney General's role in \nnational security has never been more important.\n  I know her well. I was the person who recommended her to the \nPresident to be U.S. attorney twice. I know how good she is. In some of \nthe most difficult cases--cases where the community was on one side and \nthe police were on the other--she emerged with fair decisions that made \nboth sides praise her. In this difficult world we are in, where we have \nso much tension, she is going to be great. That is why I was so proud \nwhen the President nominated her for Attorney General. She is just \ngreat. But one sad note--there is one cloud on this sunny day, and that \nis the long time it took to confirm her. We heard about a whole lot of \nissues completely unrelated to her experience or her qualifications. No \none can assail Loretta Lynch--who she is, what she has done, how good \nan Attorney General she would be.\n\n  One quick story about Ms. Lynch. As I mentioned, I originally \nrecommended Loretta Lynch for the position of U.S. attorney in 1999 \nbecause I thought she was excellent. Sure enough, she was.\n  When President Bush took office, Ms. Lynch went to the private sector \nto earn some money. When I had the opportunity to recommend a candidate \nfor U.S. attorney again when President Obama became President in 2009, \nI was certain I wanted Ms. Lynch to serve again. She had only served \nfor about 1\\1/2\\ years. She had done such a good job, I said, we need \nher back. But she had a good life. She was making a lot of money and \nhad gotten married in the interim.\n  Knowing what a great person she is, I decided I would call her late \non a Friday afternoon. I was confident that with the weekend to think \nit over, she would be drawn to answer the call to public service. When \nI called her Friday afternoon, she said to me, I was dreading this \ncall, because she was happy in her life. But sure enough on Monday \nmorning she called me back and said, I cannot turn this down because my \ndesire to serve is so strong.\n  She is a great person in every way. On top of decades of experience \nat the highest levels of law enforcement and a sterling track record, \nLoretta Lynch brings a passion and deep commitment to public service \nbefitting of the high office she is about to attain.\n  She will make an outstanding Attorney General. I believe every Member \nof this body will be proud of her, and I look forward to voting for her \nwith great enthusiasm.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I underscore my opposition to the \nnomination of Loretta Lynch to be the next Attorney General of the \nUnited States. While her experience is extensive, both her judgment and \nindependence were called into question by her expressed views on \nPresident Obama's clearly unconstitutional actions on immigration, and \nthis is something that cannot be overlooked when considering a nominee \nto be our Nation's chief law enforcement officer.\n  Let's review Ms. Lynch's testimony before the Judiciary Committee on \nwhether she believes the President's actions are constitutional. During \nthat hearing, Ms. Lynch stated that she ``thought the legal opinion was \nreasonable'' and that the President's actions were a ``reasonable way \nto marshal limited resources to deal with the problem.'' When asked for \na yes or no answer on whether she thinks Obama's executive actions on \nimmigration were legal and constitutional, she stated, ``[A]s I've read \nthe opinion, I do believe it is.''\n  What do these statements tell us? On the specific question of whether \nshe thought the executive action was constitutional, Ms. Lynch was, at \nbest, ambiguous. She attempted to obfuscate by saying that she found \nthe underlying legal opinion ``reasonable.'' In my view, all \nobfuscation aside, she sufficiently conveyed to the committee that she, \nin fact, thought the executive actions were legal and constitutional.\n  Many have asked me: But, Senator McCain, wouldn't you expect a \nPresidential nominee to support a position being taken by the President \nwho is nominating her? In most cases, the answer is yes. And, it is \nwell known that, historically, I have been deferential to the \nPresident's prerogative to select his senior advisors--even those who \nrequire Senate confirmation. But, on\n\n[[Page S2374]]\n\nmatters regarding the U.S. Constitution--particularly those that \nimplicate the separation of powers between the executive and \nlegislative branches, the Attorney General is different.\n  It is the job of the U.S. Attorney General to represent the people of \nthe United States and to ``do justice.'' It is not to serve as a policy \ninstrument or cheerleader for the President. We have had years of that \nwith Attorney General Holder. It has to stop with this nomination. \nInasmuch as, by her own testimony, Ms. Lynch sees merit in a position \nthat impinges on the constitutional prerogatives of the branch of \ngovernment that I serve, I must vote in opposition to her nomination.\n  By the President's own repeated appraisal, the executive actions on \nimmigration are unconstitutional. At least 22 times in the past few \nyears, President Obama claimed he did not have the authority to \nunilaterally change the law in the way he did. For years, he pointed to \nCongress as the only way this change could take place, but reversed \nthat position last November with his executive actions declaring the \nlaw as currently drafted to be inapplicable to millions of people. The \nfollowing is a just a sampling of these oft-repeated statements:\n  ``Comprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve this problem. \n. . . Anybody who tells you it's going to be easy or that I can wave a \nmagic wand and make it happen hasn't been paying attention to how this \ntown works.''\n  ``I can't simply ignore laws that are out there. I've got to work to \nmake sure that they are changed.''\n  ``I am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by \nmyself.''\n  ``But there's a limit to the discretion that I can show because I am \nobliged to execute the law. That's what the Executive Branch means. I \ncan't just make the laws up by myself. So the most important thing that \nwe can do is focus on changing the underlying laws.''\n  ``With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations \nthrough executive order, that's just not the case . . .''\n  ``Believe me, the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I \npromise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that's not how our \nsystem works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how \nour Constitution is written.''\n  Whether you call it prosecutorial discretion or prioritizing \nenforcement, the argument does not survive scrutiny. With the stroke of \na pen, the President's Executive action on immigration unilaterally \nchanged the law as he saw fit, in violation of our Constitution and the \nway our system of government wisely provides for laws to be changed.\n  To the extent Ms. Lynch is willing to characterize this as reasonable \nand even constitutional, I cannot support her nomination. For all these \nreasons, I cast my vote in opposition to her confirmation to be U.S. \nAttorney General and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the fast-\ntrack bill the Finance Committee approved last night, and that I think \nwill be on the floor next week or the following week, on the Trans-\nPacific Partnership.\n  I think the most important aspect of this debate is that what we are \ndiscussing with the TPP is not a new concept. It is not as though \nsomebody came and said, I have a great idea; let's try this trade \nagreement, and it is going to be really good for the American worker \nand the American middle class and the American people. The truth is \nthat we have seen this movie time and time and time again. Let me tell \nmy colleagues that the ending of this movie is not very good. It is a \npretty bad ending. I think most Americans understand that our past \ntrade agreements have failed our American workers and have led to the \nloss of millions of decent-paying jobs.\n  What I simply don't understand--if we were going forward in the first \nplace, with a new idea, maybe we should give it a shot. But when we \nwent forward with NAFTA, when we went forward with CAFTA, when we went \nforward with Normal Permanent Trade Relations and there were all of \nthese folks telling us how great these agreements were going to be and \nit turned out that virtually everything they said was inaccurate--not \ntrue--why in God's Name would we go forward with another trade \nagreement which is, in fact, larger than previous trade agreements?\n  Let me give an example of what I mean. On September 19, 1993, \nPresident Bill Clinton said the following:\n\n       I believe that NAFTA will create 200,000 American jobs in \n     the first two years of its effect. . . . I believe that NAFTA \n     will create a million jobs in the first five years of its \n     effect.\n\n  So President Clinton was pushing the NAFTA agreement very hard, and \nthat is what he said.\n  In 1993, the same year, the Heritage Foundation, which is one of the \nmost conservative think tanks in the country--so here we have a liberal \nPresident, Bill Clinton, and we have a conservative think tank, the \nHeritage Foundation--this is what they said: ``Virtually all economists \nagree that NAFTA will produce a net increase of U.S. jobs over the next \ndecade.''\n  In 1993, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, who is now our \nmajority leader, Mitch McConnell, said: ``American firms will not move \nto Mexico just for lower wages.'' Mitch McConnell: ``American firms \nwill not move to Mexico just for lower wages.''\n  Well, was President Clinton right? Was the Heritage Foundation right? \nWas Senator McConnell right? No. I think the evidence is pretty clear \nthey were all wrong.\n  According to a well-respected economist at the Economic Policy \nInstitute--and their facts usually hold up pretty well--NAFTA has led \nto the loss of more than 680,000 American jobs. What President Clinton \nsaid was wrong, what the Heritage Foundation said was wrong. We lost \nsubstantial numbers of jobs.\n  In 1993, the year before NAFTA was implemented, the United States had \na trade surplus with Mexico of more than $1.6 billion. Last year, the \ntrade deficit with Mexico was $53 billion. We had a trade surplus of \n$1.6 billion; last year we had a deficit of $53 billion. Now, how is \nthat a success? I don't know.\n  In other words, NAFTA has been a disaster for American workers.\n  What about the Chinese trade agreement? I remember hearing all of the \ndiscussions about how great it would be if we had a trade agreement \nwith a huge country such as China; thinking about all of the American \nproducts they would be buying, manufactured here in the United States. \nHere is what President Bill Clinton said about PNTR with China back in \n1999. It is important to remember what people said because they are \nsaying the same thing about this trade agreement. But this is back in \n1999, Bill Clinton, President, PNTR with China:\n\n       In opening the economy of China, the agreement will create \n     unprecedented opportunities for American farmers, workers and \n     companies to compete successfully in China's market. . . . \n     This is a hundred-to-nothing deal for America when it comes \n     to the economic consequences.\n\n  Once again, that is a liberal President.\n  Now, we have the conservative think tanks that love unfettered free \ntrade. In 1999, discussing PNTR with China, the conservative economists \nat the Cato Institute--these are really conservative guys and this is \nwhat they said:\n\n       The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports \n     would overwhelm U.S. industry. In fact, American workers are \n     far more productive than their Chinese counterparts. . . . \n     PNTR would create far more export opportunities for America \n     than the Chinese.\n\n  Well, what can we say about that? The Cato Institute wrote in 1999: \n``The silliest argument against PNTR is that Chinese imports would \noverwhelm U.S. industry.''\n  Sure. Right.\n  If we go out to any department store in America and we buy products, \nwhere\n\n[[Page S2375]]\n\nare those products made? Guess what. They are made in China. It appears \nthat, in fact, Chinese imports did overwhelm U.S. industry. The Cato \nInstitute was dead wrong.\n  Again, nobody is really surprised at this. There is no more debate \nabout this. Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, that trade \nagreement, was a disaster.\n  The Economic Policy Institute has estimated that trade agreement with \nChina has led to the loss of 2.7 million American jobs. The trade \ndeficit with China has increased from $83 billion in 2001 to $342 \nbillion in 2014.\n  Now, in terms of China, I don't know that the American people have \nany doubt about it. Every time we go shopping, the products \noverwhelmingly are made in China. People look in their own towns and in \ntheir own States--my State--and see losses of more and more \nmanufacturing jobs. Since 2001, we have lost 60,000 manufacturing \nfacilities in America. Not all of it is attributable to trade; there \nare other reasons, but a lot of it is attributable to trade. Millions \nof decent-paying jobs are gone; people thrown out on the street as \ncompanies move to China, Vietnam, and other low-wage countries. There \nis not a debate about it. That is exactly what has happened. \nCorporation after corporation has said, Why do I want to pay an \nAmerican worker $15, $20 an hour? Why do I want to deal with the union? \nWhy do I have to obey environmental regulations? I can move to China, I \ncan move to Vietnam, I can move to Malaysia or Mexico and I can pay \npeople pennies an hour and bring the product back into the United \nStates. That is what they said, and that is what they have done.\n  Major corporation after major corporation has reduced employment in \nAmerica at the same time as they have increased employment in other \ncountries.\n  Not only is it the loss of jobs, it is the race to the bottom. It is \nemployers saying to workers, Look, I am cutting your health care, I am \nnot giving you a raise, and if you don't like it, I am moving to China \nbecause there are people all over the world who are prepared to work \nfor wages a lot lower than you are receiving. You can take it or leave \nit. That is one of the reasons why today the typical American worker is \nworking longer hours for lower wages than he or she used to and why \nwages have gone down in America. That is what the global economy has \ndone. That is what these horrendous unfettered free-trade agreements \nhave pushed on American workers. That is the Chinese trade agreement: \nan estimated 2.7 million American jobs lost.\n  Then we have the Korea Free Trade Agreement, which has led to a loss \nof some 60,000 jobs. Our trade deficit with that country has gone up \nfrom $16.6 billion in 2012 to $25 billion in 2014.\n  So we have a history of failed trade agreement after failed trade \nagreement after failed trade agreement and people say, Hey, we failed, \nwe failed, we failed; let's do the same thing again and this time we \nare really, really, really going to succeed. I don't think anybody \nreally believes that.\n  I do understand that Wall Street loves this trade agreement and they \nare staying up nights worrying about ordinary Americans; and I \nunderstand that the major corporations in this country love this \nagreement and the truck companies love this agreement, which gives us \nenough reason to hold this agreement in doubt.\n  Now, the Obama administration says, Well, trust us. Forget about the \nother trade agreements. This TPP is something different. It is a better \nagreement. This time will be different. This time it will support about \n650,000 American jobs. Well, supporters of unfettered free trade were \nwrong about NAFTA, they were wrong about CAFTA, they were wrong about \nPNTR with China, and they were wrong about the Korea Free Trade \nAgreement and--surprise of all surprises--they are wrong again.\n  If the fast-track is approved, it would pave the way for the passage \nof the TPP--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--trade agreement. As my \ncolleagues know, this trade agreement is poised to be the largest free-\ntrade agreement in history, encompassing 12 nations that account for \nroughly 40 percent of the global economy. This is a very big deal.\n  Let me speak about two of those countries that are involved in the \nTPP; those are Vietnam and Malaysia. We are fighting here--and I \nunderstand there are differences of opinion--we are fighting here in \nthe U.S. Congress to raise the minimum wage. I happen to believe a \n$7.25 minimum wage, which is what it is federally, is a starvation \nwage. I would like to see it go up over a period of years to $15 an \nhour. The Presiding Officer may disagree, and there are others who \ndisagree.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what the minimum wage is in Vietnam. The \nminimum wage in Vietnam is 56 cents an hour--56 cents an hour. So we \nhave American workers being forced to compete against people who make \n56 cents an hour. And we have a situation, just as one example of many, \nwhere the Nike company--a company which produces over 365 million pairs \nof athletic shoes each year--goes all over the world. Do you know how \nmany of those athletic shoes are manufactured in the United States of \nAmerica? Fifty million? Twenty million? Ten million? One million? Zero. \nOn the other hand, they employ 330,000 workers in Vietnam--mostly young \nwomen--and while they refuse to tell us, give us the detailed \ninformation, our supposition is that most of those women make very low \nwages.\n\n  Let's be clear about what is going on. According to a November 11, \n2014, article in the Vietnamese newspaper Thanh Nien News: ``Analysts \nacknowledge that Vietnam's abundance of cheap labor has played an \nincreasingly pivotal role in wooing foreign firms looking to set up \noverseas manufacturing operations in a country with a population of 90 \nmillion.''\n  In other words, that is what this is all about. Wages are very low in \nVietnam. Companies from the United States and all over the world will \ngo to that country. Allowing the TPP to pass will make it easier for \nmultinational companies to shut down in America and move to Vietnam. \nThat is wrong.\n  When we talk about free trade, it is important to understand what is \ninvolved. Whom are we competing against? Are we competing against \nCanadian workers whose standard of living is as high or higher than \nours? Are we competing against workers in Germany whose standard of \nliving may be higher than ours? No. We are competing against people who \nare struggling to stay alive, earning the lowest possible wages that \nkeep a human being alive.\n  Last year, the Human Rights Watch published a report on Vietnam. Here \nare some of the quotes from that report:\n\n       The human rights situation in Vietnam deteriorated \n     significantly in 2013, worsening a trend evident for several \n     years. The year was marked by a severe and intensifying \n     crackdown on critics, including long prison terms for many \n     peaceful activists whose ``crime'' was calling for political \n     change.\n\n  In other words, in Vietnam, if you speak up, you want political \nchange, there is a likelihood you will end up in jail.\n\n       Vietnam bans all political parties, labor unions and human \n     rights organizations independent of the government. . . . The \n     authorities require official approval for public gatherings \n     and refuse to grant permission for meetings, marches, or \n     protests they deem politically or otherwise unacceptable.\n\n  It is not my point to beat up on Vietnam. They are a struggling \ncountry--a poor country that went through a terrible war with the \nUnited States that caused them incredible harm. But when we look at a \ntrade agreement, when we say to American workers: This is your \ncompetition, people who are making 56 cents an hour in some cases, \npeople who can't form an independent trade union, people who \npolitically can't stand up and speak up for their rights, is that \nreally appropriate and fair to the American worker? I don't think it \nis. I don't think it is.\n  Let me say a word not just on Vietnam but another country in that \nconsortium of partners in the TPP; that is, the country of Malaysia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na New York Times article, dated September 17, 2014.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 17, 2014]\n\n      Report Cites Forced Labor in Malaysia's Electronics Industry\n\n                         (By Steven Greenhouse)\n\n       Nearly one in three migrant workers in Malaysia's thriving \n     electronics industry\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n     toils under forced labor conditions, essentially trapped in \n     the job, a factory monitoring group found in a report issued \n     on Wednesday.\n       The monitoring group, Verite--which conducted a two-year \n     investigation commissioned by the United States Department of \n     Labor--found that 32 percent of the industry's nearly 200,000 \n     migrant workers were employed in forced situations because \n     their passports had been taken away or because they were \n     straining to pay back illegally high recruitment fees.\n       The report said those practices were prevalent among the \n     migrants from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Vietnam and \n     other countries who work in Malaysia's nearly 200 electronics \n     factories. Those factories, which produce consumer \n     electronics, motherboards, computer peripherals and other \n     electronic goods, account for a third of Malaysia's exports \n     and produce for many well-known companies, including Apple, \n     Flextronics, Samsung and Sony.\n       The Verite report said that 92 percent of the migrant \n     workers in Malaysia's electronics industry had paid \n     recruitment fees and that 92 percent of that group had paid \n     fees that exceeded legal or industry standards, defined as \n     more than one month's wages.\n       The report said about half of the migrant workers who \n     borrowed for their recruitment fees spent more than a year \n     paying off those fees. According to the report, 94 percent of \n     the migrants did not have their passports when Verite's \n     investigators interviewed them, and 71 percent said it would \n     be impossible or difficult to get their passports back when \n     needed.\n       ``This most modern of industrial sectors is characterized \n     by a form of exploitation that long ago should have been \n     relegated to the past,'' said Daniel Viederman, chief \n     executive of Verite. ``The problem is not one of a few \n     isolated cases. It is indeed widespread.''\n       Labor Department officials commissioned the study because \n     the federal government frowns on the importation of goods \n     made by forced labor. They sought an investigation after \n     seeing evidence that the problem was serious in Malaysia.\n       Twelve investigators working for Verite interviewed a total \n     of 501 workers from nearly 200 Malaysian factories. According \n     to the study, ``92 percent reported feeling compelled to work \n     overtime hours to pay off their debt, and 85 percent felt it \n     was impossible to leave their job before paying off their \n     debt.'' Seventy-seven percent had to borrow money to pay \n     their recruitment fees.\n       ``Workers are paying too much to get their jobs,'' Mr. \n     Viederman said. ``That leaves them vulnerable to being \n     trapped in their jobs.''\n       He told of a migrant worker from Nepal who spoke good \n     English and was the only one of five children with a college \n     degree. His family paid a recruitment agent $1,500 for his \n     job, which was more than twice the annual income in Nepal, \n     and they borrowed much of that at a 36 percent annual \n     interest rate.\n       When the Nepali arrived in Malaysia, his passport was taken \n     from him at the airport, and he has not seen it since, he \n     told the Verite interviewer. ``He has now completed 14 months \n     of a three-year contract, and he has not been able to save \n     any money'' because he is still paying back the recruitment \n     fees, Mr. Viederman said. The Nepali works 12 hours a day, \n     often seven days a week, and said it would take two years to \n     finish repaying the loan.\n       ``He doesn't want to be in Malaysia anymore,'' Mr. \n     Viederman said. ``He wants to quit and return home, but then \n     he would have to pay a hefty fine and purchase his own plane \n     ticket and still have the loan payment hanging over his head. \n     He wasn't sure if he could get his passport back.''\n       The report found that 30 percent of foreign workers said \n     they slept in a room with more than eight people, and 43 \n     percent said there was no place where they could safely store \n     their belongings. Twenty-two percent of the workers said they \n     had been deceived about their wages, hours or overtime \n     requirements during the recruitment process.\n       Mr. Viederman said many workers faced a ``one-two punch''--\n     being charged high recruitment fees and then being paid less \n     than they had been promised. He said many workers were told \n     that their wages would be withheld or they would be reported \n     to authorities if they complained or protested.\n       The Malaysian Embassy in Washington did not respond to \n     inquiries--Tuesday was a national holiday.\n       Officials from Samsung and Sony did not respond to \n     questions about Malaysia.\n       Asked about the reports of forced labor, Chris Gaither, a \n     spokesman for Apple, said: ``This is an issue we have paid a \n     lot of attention to and done a lot of work on. We were the \n     first electronics company to mandate reimbursement to workers \n     who were charged excessive recruitment fees.''\n       Mr. Gaither said Apple's supply chain, which employs 1.5 \n     million workers worldwide, employs 18,000 in Malaysia, \n     including 4,000 migrant contract workers. He said that since \n     2008, Apple had helped migrant workers in Malaysia and \n     elsewhere to reclaim $19.8 million in excessive recruitment \n     fees, which he defined as more than one month's wages. Apple \n     uses about 30 factories in Malaysia, and Apple had audits \n     done at 18 of them in the last year to investigate forced \n     labor and other problems.\n       Mr. Viederman said companies should strengthen their codes \n     of conduct to bar payment of recruitment fees for workers at \n     any factories they use and to prohibit supplier factories \n     from taking migrant workers' passports. He said companies \n     should make sure their factory monitors engaged in aggressive \n     investigations to unearth such practices. In addition, he \n     called for a grievance procedure for workers that would hold \n     the companies, suppliers and labor brokers accountable.\n       The Verite report found 62 percent of migrant workers said \n     they were unable to move around freely without their \n     passports. Fifty-seven percent said they could not leave \n     their job before their contract was finished because they \n     would be charged an illegally high fine, lose their passport \n     or be denounced to the authorities.\n       Forty-six percent reported having encounters with police, \n     immigration officials or a volunteer citizens security corps. \n     Most of the 46 percent said they had to pay a bribe, were \n     detained or were threatened with detention or physical harm. \n     Twenty-seven percent of the foreign workers said they could \n     not come and go freely from their housing.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what the New York Times article talks \nabout is that today there are nearly 200 electronics factories in \nMalaysia where high-tech products from Apple, Dell, Intel, Motorola, \nand Texas Instruments are manufactured and brought back into the United \nStates. It turns out Malaysia is a major center for the manufacturing \nof electronics, and some of the largest electronics manufacturers in \nthe world are centered or have plants in Malaysia. If the TPP is \napproved, that number will go up substantially. Now, what is wrong with \nthat?\n  Well, let's talk about what is going on in Malaysia, where American \ncompanies in this country and American workers will have to compete as \npart of the TPP. Well, it turns out that many of the workers at the \nelectronics plants in Malaysia are immigrants to that country and are \nforced to work there under subhuman working conditions.\n  According to Verite, which conducted a 2-year investigation into \nlabor abuses in Malaysia, which was commissioned by the U.S. Department \nof Labor--this report was commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n  This report tells us that 32 percent of the electronics industries' \nnearly 200,000 migrant workers in Malaysia were employed in forced \nsituations because their passports had been taken away or because they \nwere straining to pay back illegally high recruitment fees.\n  According to the New York Times article commenting on the study, 92 \npercent of the migrant workers in Malaysia's electronics industries had \npaid recruitment fees, and 92 percent of that group had paid fees that \nexceeded legal or industry standards defined as more than one month's \nwages.\n  Ninety-four percent of the migrants did not have their passports when \nVerite's investigators interviewed them. Let me repeat that. The \npassports were taken away from 94 percent of the people whom these \ninvestigators interviewed. Now, if you are a migrant in a foreign \ncountry and your passport is taken away, you have no rights at all. You \ncan't leave. You may not be able to travel. You have no rights at all. \nIn other words, many of these workers who wanted to leave Malaysia were \nunable to do so. They were forced to stay and continue to work under \nthese subhuman conditions.\n  Mr. President, 30 percent of foreign workers--this is again in the \nreport from Verite, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor--30 \npercent of foreign workers said they slept in a room with more than \neight people, and 43 percent said there was no place where they could \nsafely store their belongings.\n  Well, when we talk about competition and a competitive global \neconomy, I do not believe the American worker should be forced to \ncompete against workers who are literally held in slave-like \nconditions, unable to leave the country, having their passports taken \naway, working for pennies an hour.\n  Let me conclude simply by saying this: This trade agreement is being \npushed on the Congress by the largest corporations in the United States \nof America. They love unfettered free trade because it enables them to \nshut down in America and move to low-wage countries where they can \nemploy workers at pennies an hour. This trade agreement is pushed on us \nby Wall Street, that wants to make sure that around the world they will \nhave financial regulations that make it easier for them to do what they \ndo, rather than serve the economies of countries around the world.\n\n[[Page S2377]]\n\n  This legislation is strongly supported by the pharmaceutical industry \nthat will have the opportunity to prevent poor countries around the \nworld from moving to generic drugs and make medicine affordable to the \npoor people in these countries. So all of the billionaire class, all of \nthe powerful corporate world is supporting this trade agreement.\n  Who is opposing this trade agreement? Well, virtually every trade \nunion in America whose job it is to stand up for American workers. They \nare in opposition. I was just at a rally with them the other day. They \nare united. They are in opposition. You have many environmental groups \nthat understand this is a bad agreement. You have medical groups that \nunderstand this is a bad agreement for poor people in developing \ncountries, and you have millions of workers in this country who do not \nwant to compete. They are not afraid of competition. We are a \nproductive country. They do not want to compete against people making \n56 cents an hour or against forced labor in Malaysia. That is where we \nare today.\n  Where we are today is, Do we go forward with a failed trade policy or \ndo we take a deep breath and say enough is enough? Let us rethink trade \npolicy. Let us figure out a way we can grow the American economy, \ncreate decent jobs in the United States, and, by the way, help poor \npeople around the world. All of us want to see wages go up in poor \ncountries around the world, but that does not mean wages have got to go \ndown in the United States of America. We need a trade agreement that \nworks for our people, works for people around the world but is not a \ntrade agreement that only works for the Big Money interests in the \nUnited States.\n  I hope very much the Senate will take a real hard look at this trade \nagreement, take a hard look at what people have been saying for years \nabout previous trade agreements and say we are not going down this \nfailed path anymore.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Remembering Dr. Irwin Schatz\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I came across an article in the New York \nTimes on Sunday that called my attention to the passing of an amazing \nman, a man who has a connection to the U.S. Senate.\n  I rise to pay my respects to a man of uncommon integrity. Dr. Irwin \nSchatz passed away on April 1 at the age of 83. Beloved and respected \nin the medical community, Dr. Schatz spent his career helping people. \nHe was a major contributor to the Honolulu Heart Program, a landmark \nstudy with half a century of followup on Japanese American men in \nHawaii.\n  Dr. Schatz was the rare critic of the notorious Tuskegee, AL, \nsyphilis medical experiments.\n  From 1952 to 1972, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted the \nTuskegee clinical study on poor African-American sharecroppers. They \nwanted to know about untreated syphilis on African Americans. There \nwere 600 men enrolled in the study. Almost two-thirds had syphilis, \nwhile the rest were used as control subjects. Between 1932 and 1947, \nthe date when penicillin was determined to be the cure for the disease, \nat least seven men died, and their wives, children, and untold number \nof others had been infected.\n  Men participating in the study were told they were being treated for \nbad blood. Bad blood wasn't running in the veins of these men, it was \nrunning in the veins of those who decided this study was worth more \nthan their humanity.\n  Dr. Irwin Schatz was 4 years out of medical school working as a \ncardiologist at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit when he came across the \nDecember 1964 issue of the journal ``Archives of Internal Medicine,'' \nwhich mentioned the Tuskegee study. We cannot be sure how many other \npeople read this issue, but Dr. Schatz read it, and he was horrified.\n  Dr. Schatz wrote to the study's senior author, Dr. Donald Rockwell. \nHis letter was only three sentences long. These three sentences could \nhave put his career at risk. Here was this young doctor criticizing an \ninvestigation overseen by some of the leading figures in the American \nPublic Health Service.\n  Here is what he wrote:\n\n       I am utterly astounded by the fact that physicians allow \n     patients with a potentially fatal diseases to remain \n     untreated when effective therapy is available. I assume you \n     feel the information which is extracted from observations of \n     this untreated group is their sacrifice. If this is the case, \n     then I suggest the United States Public Health Service and \n     those physicians associated with it in this study need to \n     reevaluate their moral judgment in this regard.\n\n  The sad reality is that the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention buried Dr. Schatz' letter, and it would sit in their \narchives until 1972. A Wall Street Journal reporter found the letter \nthe same year that Peter Buxtun, health service employee turned \nwhistleblower, told the world about this horrific study.\n  Dr. Schatz went on to serve in a variety of hospitals. In 1975 he \njoined the University of Hawaii and eventually became chairman of their \ndepartment of medicine. In 2009, he was named a medical hero by the \nMayo Clinic because of his career but also because of the moral fury he \nexpressed in that three-sentence letter.\n  Irwin Schatz was truly a hero. My prayers and thoughts go out to his \nsons, Jacob, Edward, Stephen, and our colleague Senator Brian Schatz, \nhis nine grandchildren and his family.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on a separate topic very \nbriefly.\n  The moment is going to finally arrive in just a few minutes when we \nare going to, I hope, approve by a bipartisan vote the nomination of \nLoretta Lynch to be our next Attorney General. This is a milestone in \nthe history of the United States--the first African-American woman to \nbecome Attorney General of this country.\n  I would like to say that I am sorry--and I am--for the delay in \nbringing this nomination before the Senate. It should have been done \nlong ago. She is an extraordinary person from an extraordinary family. \nWe have been blessed with her public service for so many years, and now \nshe has reached the top in her career to be able to serve as our next \nAttorney General.\n  I will, with a great deal of admiration and respect, be voting in \nfavor of this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I eagerly echo the words of my dear friend, \nthe senior Senator from Illinois. This is a great, historic moment. \nEarlier today, we ended the filibuster on this woman, Loretta Lynch. We \nended the filibuster of her nomination to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  The good news is that we ended the filibuster. The bad news is that \nfor the first time in our Nation's history, we had to overcome a \nfilibuster for an Attorney General nominee--of either party. Eighty-two \nprior Attorneys General, going back to George Washington straight \nthrough, and not one of them has been treated the way Loretta Lynch has \nbeen treated.\n  I have come to know what a strong and good woman she is from her time \nas U.S. attorney and straight through to her confirmation hearing. At \nher confirmation hearing, those opposed to her brought witnesses but \nwhen I asked them, are there any of you who would vote against her, not \na single hand went up.\n  You see, I know her strengths. I know she has persevered through much \nmore difficult circumstances in her life. I believe this will make her \neven stronger. But do I hope after this extended delay, that Senate \nRepublicans will show her more respect as Attorney General of the \nUnited States than she has received as a nominee.\n  She deserves all of America's respect and our gratitude for being \nwilling to continue to serve our Nation. Loretta Lynch is eminently \nqualified to be Attorney General. She has twice been unanimously \nconfirmed by the Senate to be U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of \nNew York. Her record as a top Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn is \nunimpeachable.\n  I have no doubt that as Attorney General, Ms. Lynch will effectively, \nfairly, and independently enforce the law.\n\n[[Page S2378]]\n\n  She has received the highest praise from those on both sides of the \naisle. A group of 26 former United States Attorneys from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations have written, ``Ms. Lynch has \nthe experience, temperament, independence, integrity, and judgment to \nimmediately assume this critically important position.'' A former \nAssociate Attorney General serving at the Justice Department under \nPresident Bush wrote to me saying that ``[Ms. Lynch is] uniquely \nqualified to serve as Attorney General.'' Former Republican mayor of \nNew York City, Rudy Guiliani, said, ``If I were in the Senate, I would \nconfirm her,'' and Louis Freeh, former director of the FBI and Federal \njudge, has written ``[i]n my twenty-five years of public service--23 in \nthe Department of Justice--I cannot think of a more qualified nominee \nto be America's chief law enforcement officer.'' This is just a glimpse \nof the broad support she has received.\n  Loretta Lynch deserves to be considered by this Chamber based on her \nrecord, her accomplishments, and her extraordinary character. Let us \ncome together. Let us make history by confirming Loretta Lynch to be \nthe first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Thursday marked the 100th day of \nthe new Republican-led Senate. While it is still very early, and there \nis still much to be done, we can report there has been bipartisan \nprogress in a number of important areas. So I am optimistic. I am \noptimistic that the momentum we have seen over the last several months \nis going to translate into further successes on behalf of Americans.\n  It is interesting to read from last Thursday's USA TODAY: The first \n100 days of Republican Congress. The headline is: ``Lawmakers try to \nprove it's possible to be productive.'' So people are noticing the fact \nthat we are keeping our campaign promises.\n  During the last campaign season we told people all across the country \nthat if they just gave us the opportunity to govern, we would do it in \na bipartisan way. In November, the American people did send an \nunmistakable message to Washington. Voters across the country said they \nwere tired of gridlock and tired of a lack of action. They said it was \ntime for a new majority--a Republican majority--a majority to get the \nSenate working again and to get America on a better course.\n  Republicans have responded, and we are working hard to make the \nSenate accountable again to the people who sent us here. And you don't \nhave to take my word for it. Just the other day, the Bipartisan Policy \nCenter came out with its healthy Congress index. This is a group of \nformer Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress. They talked about \nhow the new Senate has been showing signs of life. The total number of \ndays worked, they report, is up from that of previous years--43 days in \nthe first 100 calendar days of this Senate versus 33 days at the same \npoint last Congress, and 33 days in the Congress before that.\n  Also, the number of bills reported out of committee is way up. In the \nfirst 100 days we had 15 bills reported out of committees in the Senate \ncompared to just 8 in the first 100 days of the previous two \nCongresses. Imagine that, our committees are working, and we are \npushing out bipartisan bills, such as the Iran congressional review \nbill that passed unanimously in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  The number of amendments voted on is larger than it has been in \nprevious Congresses. In the first 100 days of this Congress, we voted \non more than 100 amendments. These are amendments by both Republicans \nand Democrats. For all of last year there were only 15 up-and-down \nvotes on amendments--just 15 for the entire year. This year we topped \nthat number of amendment votes by January 22.\n  That is just one more way the Senate is working again. In the first \n100 days we passed a dozen bipartisan bills. We passed the bipartisan \nKeystone XL Pipeline jobs bill. We passed a bill to make much-needed \nreforms to the Medicare program and to reauthorize the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. We passed the Clay Hunt Veterans Suicide \nPrevention Act. We reached an agreement to help victims of modern \nslavery who are abused and exploited by human traffickers. These \nimportant bills are just part of our commitment to work together to \nsolve problems for the American people.\n  On top of all that, we passed a budget that actually balances over \nthe next 10 years. Even former Democratic Senate leader Tom Daschle \nrecently said that ``there's been more open debate and\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\nconsideration of issues'' under Senator McConnell's leadership. Well, \nthat is exactly right. The Senate is working again, and we are just \ngetting started.\n  I am hopeful we can continue to work together to find solutions for \nmore issues that matter to the American people. As chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, I can say that we have made real progress on \nbills to improve the lives of people across Indian Country. We have \npassed bills to improve irrigation projects, to help protect children \nin foster care, and to increase self-governance by Indian tribes. It \nhas been a positive agenda, and I am grateful for the hard work and \ndedication of all the committee members.\n  Along with a group of six Democrats and six Republicans who are \nworking as cosponsors, I introduced a bill to speed up exports of \nAmerican liquefied natural gas. We have bipartisan agreement on the \nneed to streamline the permitting process for the sale of this clean \nAmerican energy.\n  This week we also made great progress on a bipartisan bill on the \nwaters of the United States. I am optimistic we can reach an agreement \nwith Senators on the other side of the aisle to get that issue behind \nus.\n  The American people want an honest debate on important issues such as \nthese. The American people want their representatives in the Senate to \nbe able to offer amendments. The American people want to see their \nSenators take a stand and cast a vote up or down. That is how the \nSenate should work. That is how the Senate has been working for the \nfirst 100 days under Republican leadership.\n\n  I am pleased with how productive the Senate has been over the first \n100 days. Of course we want to do more, and we will have the chance \nshortly. I look forward to more votes, more debate, and more \nconsideration of ideas from both sides of the aisle. This is the \ncommitment Republicans made to the American people, and we are keeping \nthat commitment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am happy to stand here today knowing \nthat the Senate has had a pretty good week of getting its work done--or \nI should say the people's work done--and overwhelmingly passing \nimportant legislation that will actually help, first of all, victims of \nhuman trafficking, but generally speaking, help make the lives of our \nconstituents, the American people, just a little bit better. I am \ntalking about the antitrafficking legislation in particular--something \nI am particularly excited about--the unanimous, 99-to-0 vote yesterday. \nWe passed this piece of legislation after a hard-fought few weeks of \ndebate. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act was a bill we all \nagree was worth fighting for. Why? Is this important to the rich and \npowerful, the people who have a lot of influence here in Washington and \naround the country? No. We thought it was worth fighting for because it \nwould help the people who, frankly, need a voice. They need somebody to \nspeak up for them because they can't speak for themselves. This \nantitrafficking bill, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, \nprotects the most vulnerable people in our country.\n  I thank the majority leader for his tireless help and commitment to \nmaking sure we got this job done to fight this monstrous crime and \npunish those who seek to hold our children in what has been \nappropriately called nothing less than modern-day slavery.\n  As the majority leader said yesterday, today is a new day. Under his \nleadership, the Senate is now in a new era of bipartisanship and \nfunctioning. If there is one thing I heard last year as I was \ncampaigning for reelection in Texas or traveling around the country--I \nam sure the Presiding Officer had the same experience--it is that \npeople would tell me how frustrated they were with Washington and the \nfact that no one seemed to be working together to try to solve the \nproblems that were making their lives more difficult. ``Dysfunction'' \nwas the word most commonly used.\n  But now, after this first 100 days of a new Congress, I think we are \ndemonstrating that we are capable of functioning and working together \nin the best interest of the American people. Does that mean we are \nsacrificing our principles? People are Republicans or Democrats for \ngood reason: They have a different point of view. But what is \ninexcusable is for Republicans and Democrats to refuse to work together \nand get nothing done.\n  We have a colleague, a very conservative colleague who years ago told \nme, while working with a very liberal colleague--I asked him: How is it \nthat somebody who really represents the book ends in terms of \nideology--Republican versus Democrat, liberal versus conservative--how \nis it that you actually are able to get things done?\n  He said to me: Well, it is easy. It is the 80-20 rule. We take the 80 \npercent we can agree on and we leave the 20 percent we can't agree on \nfor another day and another fight.\n  As we are celebrating, in a sense, a new era of bipartisanship and \nfunctioning here in the Senate, it is clear we can't rest on our \nlaurels. We still have a lot of work to do, and I would like to spend a \ncouple minutes talking about that.\n  Our upcoming agenda will include some very important and weighty \nmatters, including the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which will \ngive Congress the ability and time to scrutinize any agreement reached \nbetween the Obama administration and the P5+1 nations, while also \nprohibiting the President from lifting sanctions on Iran during this \nperiod of review.\n  This commonsense bill was unanimously reported out last week by the \nForeign Relations Committee. I think that is a little bit of a surprise \nto many given the fact that the President initially said that if \nCongress were to pass this sort of legislation giving the American \npeople a voice in this nuclear agreement, he would veto it. Well, when \nthis came roaring out of the Foreign Relations Committee with unanimous \nsupport and when it became clear that enough Democrats were going to \njoin together with Republicans to pass this legislation and prevent a \nveto by having enough votes to override a veto, then the President very \ncommonsensically said: Well, I think I will sign it. I will agree to go \nalong with that.\n  So the President finally agreed with Republicans and Democrats in the \nSenate that congressional oversight was warranted and admitted last \nweek that he would not stand in the way of this legislation.\n  We are here not to guard our own prerogatives or privileges as \nindividual Senators. That means essentially nothing. What we are here \nfor is to stand in the shoes of our constituents--the 26.9 million \npeople whom I represent in Texas, the people of Arkansas whom the \nPresiding Officer represents--and it is absolutely critical that we, as \nthe representatives of the American people, have the opportunity to \nreview this Iran deal and to consider its implications, to debate it, \nand to make that entirely transparent to the American people because \nthis is about not just the national security of the nation of Israel, \nthis is about our national security as well as that of our other \nallies.\n  We will spend much of the next few days and perhaps through next week \ndiscussing this bill, so I won't belabor my thoughts on that at this \ntime, but I did want to express a few concerns on the current state of \nthe proposed framework with Iran.\n  On April 2, President Obama announced not a deal with Iran but a \n``historic understanding with Iran.''\n  Well, people naturally asked: What does that understanding look like? \nWhat does it consist of? Where can I get a copy of it so I can read it?\n  To our surprise, there wasn't a deal. Nothing was written. It was \nsomehow a historic understanding that--even the parties who negotiated \nit disagreed about the details. So it should come as no surprise that \nthe President and the P5+1 countries have not been able to secure an \nactual deal with Iran, which is our biggest threat and most dangerous \nadversary in the Middle East. After all, let's think about whom we are \ntalking to and with--the nation of Iran. This is the No. 1 state \nsponsor of international terrorism, a country that has repeatedly lied \nto and deceived inspectors in the past as a matter of\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\nstandard operating procedure. As Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel \nreminded us just last month, for more than 30 years Iran has been \nhostile to America and her allies. In fact, Iran first killed Americans \nback in the early 1980s and has subsequently killed Americans mainly \nthrough proxies since that time until the present time. This is the \nsame regime that has continued to target the United States since 1979. \nIt is the same regime that has been on the State Department's terrorism \nblacklist since 1984 following an Iran-backed terrorist attack that \nresulted in the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen, including \nmany from my State. Given this track record, does anybody really wonder \nwhat Iran would do with a nuclear weapon?\n  As these important negotiations continue for the next months, there \nremain a lot of question marks about Iran's true intentions and about \nwhether the deal--once it is done--the Obama administration is \nfinalizing will essentially cement Iran's status as a nuclear threshold \nnation.\n  I remember Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to a joint meeting of \nthe Congress. He said the framework he has seen doesn't prevent Iran \nfrom gaining a nuclear weapon. What he said is that essentially the \nframework paves the way or paves the path to a nuclear weapon, which, \nof course, would represent a tremendous change in American policy.\n  Our policy has been--the administration's policy has been, as stated, \nno nukes for Iran, none. But at least according to the framework that \nhas been leaked, there appears to be more of the nature of a pathway \ntoward a nuclear weapon as opposed to a prohibition. I look forward to \ncontinuing the discussion in the coming days, but Iran is only one \nissue we will be turning to as the Senate continues to work on \nbipartisan legislation to get work done for the American people.\n  We will be working on the very important issue of trade. Trade is \nimportant to my State, and it is important to the United States. \nAnytime we can open new markets to the things we grow in our \nagricultural sector or the livestock we raise--the beef, pork, poultry \nsector--anytime we can create and open new markets to the things we \nmanufacture and we make in the United States, it strikes me it is a \ngood thing, because while we occupy only 5 percent of the world's \nterritory, we constitute 20 percent of the purchasing power in the \nworld. That means 95 percent of the population--80 percent of the \npurchasing power in the world--lies beyond our shores. It just makes \nsense to me that we would want to open our markets, our goods that we \nmake and grow and raise to markets overseas; in this case, primarily to \nAsia. But once we take up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, once it is \nnegotiated, then at some future point we will turn to Europe and the \nso-called TTIP negotiation.\n  Last night, I am glad to report that the Finance Committee reported \nout the trade promotion authority piece of this legislation. This is \nsomething that has been a little bit misunderstood and, frankly, it is \na little confusing. People have asked, Why in the world would you want \nto give the President authority to negotiate this Trans-Pacific \nPartnership negotiation? The simple answer is this trade promotion \nauthority is not just for President Obama and his administration--he is \nonly going to be there for the next 20 months. This will last for 6 \nyears and go into the next Presidential administration.\n  The fact is, you can't negotiate something as complex as a trade deal \nlike the Trans-Pacific Partnership with 535 negotiators; in other \nwords, all the Members of the Senate and all the Members of the House. \nBut what this does provide is that once a deal is reached, it has to be \nlaid before the Congress and it has to be laid before the American \npeople so they can read it and understand it.\n  After about 6 months, then there will be a debate in the Senate, and \nwe will have an up-or-down vote. If we do not think it serves the \ninterests of the United States, of our citizens and of our country, we \ncan vote it down. But conversely, if we think this does improve trade \nand the economic prospects, jobs and wages for the American people, \nthen we can vote to approve it. This bill will open American goods and \nservices to global markets, which is good for our economy, good for \njobs, and good for better wages, something that has been under a lot of \nnegative pressure over the last few years.\n  To sum up this week, we passed legislation that will help thousands \nof victims of modern-day slavery--typically, a girl between the ages of \n12 and 14--who are routinely sex trafficked in our own backyards. This \nwill provide real resources. It will not only help rescue them but \nbegin to help them heal and to begin the path to restoration.\n  I think this should be a proud accomplishment for the Senate. But the \nbottom line is, we still have a lot of work to do, and I look forward \nto more accomplishments with my colleagues and for the new spirit of \nbipartisanship to continue as we tackle real problems for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2380-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2380-S2381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the \nimportance of trade and the Nebraskans who depend upon it. Since 1989, \nU.S. agricultural exports have nearly quadrupled in value. This is a \ndirect result of our trade agreements, which have opened foreign \nmarkets to our goods. In 2014 alone, the value of U.S. agriculture \nexports was $152.5 billion, yielding a trade surplus of more than $43 \nbillion. This surplus is the result of hard work by millions of \nAmerican farmers and ranchers.\n  My home State of Nebraska is leading the way in progress as a top \nproducer and exporter of agriculture and manufacturing products. In \n2013, Nebraska exported $7.3 billion in products tied to agriculture \nand the processing industries. By trading internationally, we are \ncreating jobs and long-term income here at home. From farms and ranches \nto food processing, transportation, and manufacturing industries, \ncountless parts of our economy rely on flow of goods across our Nation \nand around the world.\n  Nebraska's Governor, director of agriculture, and 22 Nebraska \nagriculture stakeholders echoed the necessity of these trade \nagreements, urging congressional leaders to quickly pass important \nlegislation for these agreements to materialize. This point was \nreinforced in a recent Omaha World-Herald Editorial, which noted that \nNebraska producers operate on a global scale and therefore understand \nthe economic benefit of robust free-trade agreements.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that every $1 billion of \nU.S. agricultural exports generates $1.3 billion in economic activity \nand supports the full-time work of approximately 6,600 Americans \nthroughout the economy. Simply put, international trade is an essential \ncomponent of opening foreign markets to U.S. agriculture and food \nproducts. The best avenues we have to open new markets, increase that \nproductivity, and create jobs are through strong, fair, and inclusive \nfree-trade agreements.\n  With more than 95 percent of the world's population located outside \nthe United States, economic growth and job creation depend on trade \nopportunities that allow our U.S. companies and our producers to tap \ninto new markets to sell more American products.\n  As we debate, the world's population continues to grow. In more and \nmore countries, we see a growing middle class with a mounting appetite. \nWhat do they want to eat? They want high-quality meat, produce, and \nfood products from the United States of America. What a tremendous \nopportunity for American producers to capture new markets and reach \nmore consumers worldwide, but these new markets cannot be developed \nunless the United States is at the table and at the table negotiating \nfor comprehensive free-trade agreements that ensure producers and \nexporters receive that fair deal.\n  In order to accomplish this goal, the Senate must first pass trade \npromotion authority or the TPA. TPA effectively combines Congress's \nauthority to regulate foreign commerce alongside the President's \nauthority to negotiate treaties. It reinforces the role of Congress to \nset negotiation priorities, and it requires the President to consult \nextensively with legislators throughout\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\nthis entire negotiation process. Under TPA, Congress retains its \nauthority to review and determine whether the proposed trade agreement \nwill be implemented through an up-or-down vote.\n  TPA has been granted to every President since Gerald Ford. This \nlongstanding and proven partnership between the legislative and \nexecutive branches is essential to finalizing those free-trade \nagreements that create countless opportunities for American enterprise. \nTPA will allow us to actually complete the trade negotiations that are \ncurrently underway. America is on the brink of some very ambitious and \nprogrowth deals. It will also provide our negotiators with the \ncredibility they need in order to conclude those trade agreements. Our \ntrading partners must be certain the United States is serious about its \ntrade priorities and that we are serious about our commitments. To get \nthe best deal, there is no doubt our trade negotiators need this vital \nnegotiating tool.\n  Furthermore, as this administration negotiates the two largest \nregional trade agreements in history, we must position ourselves to \nextract the best deals possible. The Trans-Pacific Partnership or the \nTPP includes countries such as Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia, which have \ngreat, tremendous opportunities for our exports. This agreement will \ngive us greater access to the fastest growing economic region in the \nworld. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership is between \nthe European Union and the United States, which together account for \nnearly half of global GDP.\n  I support the negotiations for each of these regional trade \nagreements. Both agreements hold enormous potential for continued \nprogress in agricultural exports, and they will create jobs here at \nhome. The United States has negotiated free-trade agreements with 20 \ncountries over the past three decades. These trading partners only \nrepresent 10 percent of the global economy, but they consume nearly \nhalf of the U.S. exports. Economic growth and American job creation \nwould only expand under TPP, where negotiating countries represent the \nfastest growing economies in the world.\n  That said, it is critical trade agreements eliminate barriers and \nlevel the playing field for American businesses. Fair, two-way market \naccess that eliminates tariffs is essential to any comprehensive trade \nagreement.\n  We are in the 21st century, and our trade agreements should reflect \n21st century principles. TPA is critical to providing our trade \nrepresentatives with the necessary tools to finalize these pending \nnegotiations, while also ensuring that the unsung heroes of the \nAmerican dinner table--our farmers, our ranchers, our food processors--\nreceive the greatest benefit.\n  Nebraska's farmers and ranchers are global leaders and the very best \nat producing safe, high-quality food to feed the world. It is \nimperative that foreign markets are open, balanced, and that they \nprovide a level playing field for all of our U.S. products. One of best \nways we can do this is by expanding free trade and authorizing TPA.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this very important legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2381-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2381-S2389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PROTECTING VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS AND EMERGENCY RESPONDERS ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am thrilled to be here on the floor with \nmy partner, Senator Ben Cardin, who is the ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee. We had an outstanding week last week in \nour Foreign Relations Committee in passing out this bill that is now \nbefore us on a 19-to-0 vote. I thank all of the members of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, which obviously includes Senator Cardin, \nSenator Risch, Senator Menendez, Senator Rubio, Senator Kaine, Senator \nJohnson, Senator Coons, Senator Flake, Senator Udall, Senator Gardner, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Perdue, Senator Shaheen, Senator Isakson, \nSenator Murphy, Senator Paul, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Markey.\n  Also, before we get into discussing the text, I wish to thank Senator \nBob Menendez and Senator Mark Kirk, who have been all things Iran. From \nthe very beginning, these two Senators have led this body to put in \nplace sanctions--crushing sanctions--that have led us to this place. I \ncannot thank them enough for their leadership in dealing with the issue \nof Iran.\n  Last year, we did a significant amount of work on creating some kind \nof review process relative to a final agreement that might be worked \nout with Iran. I thank Senator Lindsey, Graham who has been a stalwart \nin ensuring that Congress play a role in the ultimate final deal that \nmay or may not occur. Senator Graham has been steadfast in wanting \ncongressional review. Senator John McCain has joined in that effort and \nhas been outstanding to work with, as well as Senator Jim Risch and \nSenator Marco Rubio, who have also pushed for this type of legislation.\n  When we began this process, there were some original--or when we \nmoved to the process we are now in, there were some original supporters \nof this current bipartisan bill who really caused us to have the \nleverage, if you will, to move to the place where we are today. Again, \nSenator Menendez certainly was one of those who led us in that effort; \nSenator Graham; Senator Tim Kaine, who came here as a former Governor \nof Virginia and who has been so focused on Congress playing its \nappropriate role. Obviously, Senator McCain, as he has been a leader \nfrom the beginning, Senator Joe Donnelly, Senator Marco Rubio, Senator \nHeidi Heitkamp, Senator Kelly Ayotte, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Jim \nRisch, and Senator Angus King have played a role in creating the \nleverage, if you will, to get us where we are today.\n  As Senator Cardin knows, we now have 62 cosponsors of this \nlegislation that is now before us, obviously from both parties. So I \nthink this is quite an accomplishment.\n  Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of work in front of us with \nthis bill now on the floor. I know Senator Cardin and I hope that \npeople will come to the floor and begin offering their amendments, \nbegin debating, begin discussing. Obviously, we won't be taking up any \namendments, per the order that is before us, until Tuesday, but we hope \npeople will begin bringing their ideas and amendments to the floor and \ncertainly begin discussing the important issue of Iran.\n  Let me speak a little bit about what this bill does. First of all, I \nthink everyone knows the administration is part of the P5+1. It is \ntoday negotiating an agreement to try to keep Iran from obtaining a \nnuclear weapon. I think all of us know there was a political agreement \nthat was achieved the first part of April that was more of a verbal \nagreement about how the P5+1 and Iran might interact in a manner that \nhopefully would keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n  One of the things that I think everyone in this body knows and many \npeople on the outside may not is that Congress has played a substantial \nand\n\n[[Page S2382]]\n\nmaybe the biggest role in getting Iran to the table in the first place. \nThere were three sets of sanctions, three types of sanctions that have \nbeen instrumental in making this happen. They include the U.N. Security \nCouncil sanctions that have been put in place. The executive branch has \nput some sanctions in place as well. But Congress especially has four \ntranches of sanctions which have been put in place since 2010 which \nreally have had a crushing effect on Iran's economy. They haves created \nall kinds of inflation, and they have caused them not to be able to \nexport the amount of oil--the 40 percent of the oil that they produce. \nThat has hurt them in manufacturing.\n  I see Senator Menendez has just come to the floor. He may not have \nheard me, but I cannot thank him and Senator Kirk enough for their \nleadership on each set of those tranches--putting them in place, taking \nthe leadership, and bringing Iran to the table.\n  I think the second thing people may understand is that on the U.N. \nSecurity Council sanctions, the White House has the ability, with the \nother members of the permanent Security Council, to lift those at any \ntime they wish. They can obviously lift the executive sanctions. One of \nthe things that all of us have been concerned about, though, is that \nCongress put in place the sanctions that really brought them to the \ntable. We want to ensure that Congress has the ability, before \nthose sanctions are lifted, to be able to voice an opinion through a \nvote.\n\n  What this legislation does--and we will be talking about it a great \ndeal over the next week--is four things:\n  First of all, it forces the administration, in the event a final deal \nis agreed to, to bring all of those details to Congress, including the \nclassified annexes we would likely not see until 6 months or so after \nan agreement is reached, without this legislation, if we can pass it.\n  Secondly, it keeps the executive branch from being able to lift the \ncongressionally mandated sanctions that we put in place, while we have \na reasonable period of time to go through the documents that have been \nprovided to us.\n  Thirdly, it allows Congress to take a vote. The vote can take all \nkinds of forms. It can be a vote of approval. It also allows the leader \nto decide not to take a vote at all or we could take a vote of \ndisapproval. If we decided that this was not something that was good \nfor our country, not good for the Middle East, then we could cause this \nvote of disapproval to take place, and if it passed, it would keep the \nexecutive branch from being able to lift the congressionally mandated \nsanctions we have put in place.\n  The fourth and very important component is that it causes us to know \nwhether Iran is in compliance. This bill stipulates, if passed, that \nthe President would have to certify to us every 90 days as to whether \nIran is in compliance. If there are significant violations, on a 10-day \nbasis, let us know that is taking place so we can respond accordingly.\n  Let me close by saying this: I believe everybody in this body hopes \nwe are able to achieve a negotiated agreement that will keep Iran from \ngetting a nuclear weapon. I think everyone understands that is the best \nthing for our country. I think everybody also understands that Iran is \na country in which we have little trust. Iran is a country that is the \nmajor exporter of terrorism in the region. Iran is a country that has a \nterrible human rights record. Iran is a country that is really moving \nahead relative to its ballistic missile design. And, obviously, Iran is \na country that has been doing some things in its nuclear program that \ngive us reason to believe they are moving toward a nuclear weapon.\n  One of the worst things we could possibly do is enter into an \nagreement with Iran that doesn't keep them from getting a nuclear \nweapon--in other words, one that is faulty, that has flaws, and that \nallows them to get a nuclear weapon. What that would mean is we would \nhave a situation where the No. 1 exporter of terrorism in the region \nhad access to not just a nuclear weapon but very quickly had access to \nthe $130 billion-plus that they have trapped overseas to conduct even \nmore terrorism in the region, which could allow their economy to all of \na sudden be growing at more rapid rates and, again, to have resources \navailable to conduct even more terrorism in the region. As we can \nimagine, having an actor such as Iran has acted--and we hope at some \npoint that behavior will change--having access to a nuclear weapon \ncertainly would create the possibility of nuclear proliferation in the \nregion.\n  So I think this is a very important piece of legislation. I thank \nSenator Cardin for the way he has come into this and worked with us in \na manner to reach an accommodation so that we have sufficient, ample, \nactually extraordinary support on both sides of the aisle to ensure \nthat Congress has its rightful role in this agreement. It is one of the \nbiggest geopolitical agreements we will deal with probably during the \ntime we are here in the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my good friend Senator Cardin. Again, \nhe has done exemplary work in bringing us to this point. I thank him \nfor all of his efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank and congratulate Senator \nCorker for his extraordinary work in reaching this moment where we have \nbrought to the floor of the Senate a bill that deals with congressional \noversight of the nuclear discussions and agreements taking place \nbetween the P5+1, our negotiating partners in Iran.\n  It was just 3 weeks ago that the framework was announced by the White \nHouse and that Senator Corker and I started our discussions to see \nwhether we could find a common path forward on a bill which, to say the \nleast, was very controversial; a bill which the President of the United \nStates had threatened to veto; a bill in which there were Democrats and \nRepublicans lined up on different sides of this issue, and it appeared \njust about impossible that we would be able to reach a bipartisan \nagreement on a path forward for the legislation.\n  Senator Corker exercised the greatest leadership and diplomacy. He \nmentioned all the members of our committee. Each of those members has \npretty strong views on this issue. This was not a simple matter of \npeople saying: Gee, I will just yield to the thoughts of others. The \nonly way we could reach this moment was to ask and solicit and listen \nto each member of the committee, and that is what Senator Corker did. \nHe encouraged me to do the same in regard to not just the Democratic \nmembers, because Senator Corker talked to some of the Democratic \nmembers and I talked to some of the Republican members. We had to have \nthat type of confidence.\n  I again congratulate Senator Corker on his leadership. It has been a \nreal pleasure to work with him. I am proud that we bring this bill \nforward with a 19-to-0 vote from the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  We have a long history in this country of putting aside partisan \ndifferences on foreign policy issues. I know we often quote from one of \nour former colleagues, but I think it is worth putting into the Record \nthe comments of Senator Arthur Vandenberg, Jr.\n  He was a Republican Member of this body who said 63 years ago:\n\n       To me ``bipartisan foreign policy'' means a mutual effort \n     under our indispensable two-Party system, to unite our \n     official voice at the water's edge so that America speaks \n     with maximum authority against those who would divide and \n     conquer us and the free world. It does not involve the \n     remotest surrender of free debate in determining our \n     position. On the contrary, frank cooperation and free debate \n     are indispensable to ultimate unity. In a word, it simply \n     seeks national security ahead of partisan advantage.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what the Foreign Relations Committee \ndid. We had a very robust debate, there were many different views, but \nat the end of the day we spoke with unity. In speaking with unity, our \ncountry today is stronger, and that is exactly where we needed to be.\n  What we are trying to do, and I think as a result of the actions of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee--and I hope it will be approved \nby this body and by the House and sent to the President for signature--\nwe are in a stronger position to accomplish our goal. Our goal is \npretty simple, to prevent Iran from ever acquiring a nuclear weapon \nbecause we know that is a game changer in the region--a game changer in \nregard to not just one country in that region but to just about every \ncountry in\n\n[[Page S2383]]\n\nthat region. Their security is threatened and the U.S. security is \nthreatened.\n  So what we did in the bill that we bring forward to you is a \ncompromise--a compromise. Each of us gave and listened and we found \ncommon ground. We could use more compromise on the issues that confront \nthis country in the work we do. I would hope my colleagues would look \nat how we worked out these issues and use it as a model for other \nopportunities to move forward on issues that are important.\n  Senator Corker pointed out why we are here--why we had a bill for \ncongressional review. It started in the 1990s, when Congress passed \nsanctions against Iran because we saw, at the time, that Iran was \ndeveloping the nuclear capacity to develop a nuclear weapon, and we \nsaid that could not happen. We imposed sanctions against Iran. Congress \ndid this on several occasions in an effort to prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear weapons state, telling them there would be an \neconomic price to pay until they changed course.\n  Administrations--including President Obama's administration--worked \nwith the international community and we were able to get U.N. \nsanctions. Congress's action was responsible for leading Iran to being \nwilling to negotiate, and that is where we are today. Only Congress--\nonly Congress--can permanently remove those sanctions or permanently \nchange those sanctions.\n  So Congress must be involved in the sanctions and in the discussions. \nThat is exactly what this legislation does. It provides an orderly \nprocess for us to review any agreement reached by the President and our \nnegotiating partners with Iran. No congressional action will take place \nuntil and unless the President submits an agreement that he has made \nwith our negotiating partners and Iran.\n  The April 2 framework that was recently announced is not an agreement \nand is not subject to review. There would be a 30-day review period, \nduring which Congress would have the opportunity to review the \nagreement. No sanctions or additional sanction relief could be imposed \nduring that 30-day period. If you read the April 2 framework, the \nPresident has made it clear that Iran will only get sanction relief if \nthey earn sanction relief, if there is concrete progress made in \ndismantling their nuclear program. It is hard to believe that could \ntake place within 30 days. So this 30-day period is a very reasonable \nperiod for Congress to be able to review any agreement.\n  As Senator Corker pointed out, all information--all information--\nwould be presented to us, and we would have an opportunity for full \nhearings and debate as to what we should do. It would follow the \nregular congressional order as far as committee hearings and potential \naction on the floor of the Senate and the House. Senator Corker pointed \nout the options we would have. We could approve the agreement, we could \ndisapprove the agreement, we could pass legislation affecting the \nsanctions, we could take whatever action we think is appropriate, but \nno action is required.\n  The agreement can commence without congressional action. If we do \ntake congressional action, the President has the prerogative of a veto, \nand if the President vetoes, we have the prerogative of an override of \nthe veto. That is how the checks and balances system of our country \nshould operate.\n  There is a second major component to this legislation and that is for \nthe oversight of an agreement after it is reached; that is, there would \nbe a quarterly certification by the President of the United States to \nCongress that Iran is in compliance with the agreement. If there is a \nmaterial breach, it would trigger an expedited process so Congress \ncould act, that we could not only snap back sanctions that may have \nbeen relieved, but if appropriate, we could impose additional sanctions \nif Iran had a material breach of the agreement. That is very important \nbecause I think we all agree, if we are going to have an effective \nagreement, that agreement must give us time before Iran can become a \nnuclear weapons country; that we can, through full inspections, \ndetermine if they have breached the agreement because, quite frankly, \nno agreement is going to be based on trust because we don't trust Iran. \nIt is going to be based upon inspections and being able to confirm \ntheir compliance with the agreement. If they don't comply with the \nagreement, we need to make sure we have adequate time and take adequate \nsteps to prevent them from becoming a nuclear weapons state. This \nreview process and an expedited process in Congress puts Congress in \nthe position of working with the administration to make sure we take \nthose effective steps.\n  As Senator Corker pointed out, there are other issues with Iran in \naddition to the nuclear proliferation issues. We have serious concerns \nabout Iran. It sponsors terrorism. Its human rights violations against \nits own citizens is horrible. Its ballistic missile program is of great \nconcern. The threats against Israel and other countries in that region \nare all of direct interest to the United States. So, in this \nlegislation, we provide for regular reports twice a year to the \nCongress of the United States about the activities that Iran is \nparticipating in, in regard to terrorism and human rights.\n  I call our colleagues' attention to the detailed requirements, on \npages 37 and 38 of the bill, concerning issues about whether Iran's \nfinancial institutions are engaged in money laundering, whether Iran is \nadvancing its ballistic missile program, an assessment of whether Iran \nhas directly supported, financed, planned or carried out any terrorism \nagainst the United States, ``whether, and to the extent to which, Iran \nsupported acts of terrorism . . . all actions, including international \nfora, being taken by the United States to stop, counter, and condemn \nacts by Iran'' involving terrorism; ``the impact on the national \nsecurity of the United States and the safety of United States citizens \nas a result of any Iranian actions reported under this paragraph. . . . \n'' It is all required that that information be given to us because we \nmay want to use that for other strategies against Iran.\n\n  An amendment that was added requires ``an assessment of whether \nviolations of internationally recognized human rights in Iran have \nchanged, increased, or decreased, as compared to the prior 180-day \n[period].''\n  We are going to monitor their human rights record, and we will have \nthat information. So, yes, we are concerned about issues beyond nuclear \nproliferation, but this agreement that is now being negotiated by the \nPresident deals with preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons \nstate.\n  It is clear. I want to underscore this because Senator Corker was \nvery strong to make sure it got into the bill. It says that ``United \nStates sanctions on Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and \nballistic missiles will remain in place under an agreement. . . .'' We \nare not talking about actions we have taken against Iran for terrorism \nor human rights violations. That is a separate issue--a major concern \nto us. What we are talking about is how do we implement oversight and \nreview an agreement concerning nuclear weapons programs.\n  And lastly, we make it very clear in this agreement that ``the \nPresident should determine the agreement in no way compromises the \ncommitment of the United States to Israel's security, nor its support \nfor Israel's right to exist.'' Israel is a key ally of the United \nStates and our friendship is deep. Our commitment is solid. We make \nthat very clear in the bill that is before you.\n  Let me conclude with two additional points--one dealing with the \namendment process. As Senator Corker pointed out, we asked Members who \nbelieve they can approve this bill to come forward. Let's see the \namendments and try to work with you on the amendments. Let's maintain \nthe bipartisan cooperation we have. Let's maintain a strong bill that \naccomplishes its purpose. Come down and let us take a look at it. \nRemember, we have a lot of strong views in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and we came together. Let's keep that same spirit, and I \nwould just urge those who may have amendments to come on down and let \nus see them. We have today and up to before next Tuesday. Share them \nwith us so we have an opportunity to keep the unity we have.\n  Then, lastly, I just want to join where Senator Corker began, and \nthat is to thank the incredible effort that took place on behalf of \nthis bill. Senator Corker already mentioned all my colleagues who were \ninvolved here.\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\n  Senator Menendez and Senator Kaine are both on the floor. On the \nDemocratic side, they are the authors of this bill. They are the ones \nwho drafted it. They are the ones who are responsible for why we are \nhere today--from the Democrats. I thank both of them. From the \nbeginning they said: We want a process to review. We are not talking \nabout the merits. The merits are something we will pick up later. We \nwant to preserve the normal prerogatives of the Senate, and we want to \nkeep politics out of it. That was their intent from day one. Quite \nfrankly, working with Senator Corker, that is what I carried out in my \nnegotiations with Senator Corker; to maintain that balance that was the \nintent of the legislation. So I thank both of them and the other \nmembers of our committee who were involved.\n  Lastly, on a point of personal privilege right now, because I might \nforget to do this later, I want to thank Jodi Herman of our staff and \nMargaret Taylor, Algene Sajery, and Chris Lynch for the extraordinary \namount of time they put in.\n  I want to thank President Obama. I want to thank President Obama for \ngiving me his time so I understood what he was trying to achieve and \nhow we could work together in order to achieve the objectives of the \nUnited States, and I thank Katie Fallon and Denis McDonough of his \nstaff for the work they put in so we could reach this moment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I want to rise in support of this \nbipartisan legislation, with a sincere hope that we can pass the Iran \nNuclear Agreement Review Act as it was unanimously voted out of the \ncommittee.\n  I have worked tirelessly with the chairman and with the ranking \nmember and with members of the committee--Senator Kaine, who had so \nmuch input in the conceptualization of what we wanted to do to bring \nthis bill to the floor with the strongest bipartisan support.\n  In my view, the best way to send a clear message to Tehran about our \nexpectations is for Congress to pass the Corker-Menendez Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act as it was voted out of committee. The spirit of \nbipartisanship that underscores Congress's critical role in the highest \npriority, national security, the nuclear nonproliferation challenge of \nour time, was unanimously passed out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I hope we can send this same message from the Senate floor.\n  Countering Iran's nuclear ambitions has been something I have worked \non passionately for a long time. Senator Corker and I fashioned \nlanguage that became the framework of this final bill to ensure that \nCongress remains engaged in reviewing and, if there is an agreement, \noverseeing its implementation.\n  So I want to thank Chairman Corker. He has just done an exceptional \njob. He had this concept before any of us were agreed to it, and he was \nwilling to work with us--and was dogged, I must say--until we got to \nthe point that we would come together and offer the legislation in a \nbipartisan way. That has been the hallmark of his chairmanship and it \nwas the hallmark of his time as ranking member when I was chairman. I \nappreciate the fashion in which he has worked to continue to move the \ncommittee, as I started it, in a bipartisan way, because as the ranking \nmember Senator Cardin says, that is when we are most powerful in terms \nof foreign policy.\n  I thank Senator Cardin for his work in helping to forge a deal that \nboth sides of the aisle can come to this floor and support with a clear \nconscience, knowing that we have sent a clear message to Tehran and \nthat we are united, as we have always been, on Iran policy, and on this \nissue we speak with one voice.\n  The simple fact is, if the P5+1 and Iran ultimately achieve a \ncomprehensive agreement by the June deadline, at the end of the day, \nCongress must make a judgment on it and have oversight responsibility. \nThis legislation provides it. It establishes a managed process for \ncongressional review and a framework for congressional oversight.\n  Now, I differentiate between this agreement and others the \nadministration has cited for exclusive Executive action because the \nsanctions relief that is at the heart of this deal was crafted by \nCongress and enacted by Congress into law. It is primarily statutory. \nAs the author of those sanctions, working with others, I can tell you \nwe never envisioned a wholesale waiver of sanctions without \ncongressional input and without congressional action.\n  The limited sanctions relief provided in the law was intended to \nprovide the President with discretion to waive specific sanctions in \nspecific circumstances, such as if a country was making real progress \nin reducing their oil purchases from Iran. So my goal has always been \none goal; that is, to make certain Iran does not have the \ninfrastructure to develop a nuclear weapon.\n  I have worked on that goal since my earliest days in Congress. Now, \nas we approach the witching hour for an agreement, the best way to \nachieve our goal is with bipartisan support on this legislation that \nstrengthens the U.S. hand in moving from a political framework to a \ncomprehensive agreement and sets out clear and decisive expectations \nfor Iranian compliance.\n  The message we send to Tehran is that sanctions relief is not a \ngiven, and sanctions relief certainly is not a prize for signing on the \ndotted line. This bill ensures that Iran must fully comply with all \nprovisions of an agreement that effectively dismantle its nuclear \nweapons program and provide robust inspection and verification \nmechanisms to ensure its compliance with every word of that deal.\n  If Iran breaches an agreement, Congress will have the ability to \nrestore sanctions on an expedited basis. Now, as I have said, I have \nbeen outspoken on this issue from the beginning, for years, for as long \nas I have been here. Frankly, I have many questions about the framework \nagreement. I have questions about the divergent understandings of the \nagreement.\n  I have questions about the pace of sanctions relief. I do not believe \nIran should get a signing bonus. I am concerned by the President's most \nrecent statement that greater sanctions relief could come upfront for \nIran. I have questions about Iran's retention of research and \ndevelopment authorities and to what extent they can advance their \nresearch and development, because greater research and development \nmeans more sophisticated centrifuges that can spin faster and, \ntherefore, dramatically reduce breakout time toward a nuclear bomb.\n  I am concerned about the ability to snap back sanctions if there are \nviolations of the agreement. From what I can see, we have a committee \nprocess that will not guarantee that the snapback will take place or \nthat it will take place expeditiously. I am concerned about the \nInternational Atomic Energy Administration's ability to obtain \n``anytime-anywhere'' snap inspections. What happened to Iran having to \ncome clean about the possible military and weapons dimensions of their \nprogram?\n  More than anything else, I am concerned about what will happen when \nthe critical elements of the proposed agreement expire after 10 years. \nAre we relegated to accepting Iran as a nuclear weapons state? The \npresumption that Iran will become a compliant Nuclear Non-Proliferation \nTreaty state in that time for me is not borne out when you see their \ninsistence and our acquiescence to keeping key nuclear infrastructure \nand key nuclear facilities under the agreement.\n  It is not borne out by history. Iran has been on a single path toward \nnuclear weapons for more than 20 years. By deceit and deception--\nsometimes without detection until there were well-established covert \nfacilities--they have advanced their drive for nuclear power to the \nprecipice of achieving a nuclear bomb. For me, these are all issues \nthat speak more forcefully to the reasons for having congressional \nreview and oversight of any potential agreement.\n  Now, I did not fashion, along with colleagues, a sanctions regime for \nthe sake of sanctions. It was for the sake of getting Iran to deter its \ncourse. There is no one who would want to see the successful result of \nthat design more than I. But by the same token, I do embrace what the \nadministration has said time and time again that no deal is\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\nbetter than a bad deal. I will independently judge what that deal is \nwhen and if there is a final deal.\n  At a minimum, this legislation gives us the oversight role to monitor \nand address our concerns. So I urge my colleagues, when the bill comes \nfor a vote, to vote for it as it was voted out of committee, because it \ndoes what all of us want to do: provides a clear opportunity for a \nreview of any agreement, so we can express, if desired, our support or \nopposition to any agreement and have a clear oversight role with \nestablished parameters for compliance.\n  Let's vote on what the agreement does, not what it might have done or \ncould have done if we had different amendments to it. I respect \neverybody's views and everybody's rights to have amendments. I hope \nthose who have ideas will work with the chairman and the ranking \nmember. But I will oppose amendments, at least with my own vote, that I \nconsider to be poisonous and that undermine the very essence of what we \nhave accomplished in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Sometimes you have to know when you hit a home run and be able to \ncross the plate and say, We hit a home run--and not think that you are \nstill stuck in the dugout. What we did in the committee is pretty close \nto a home run as far as I can see it. So let's vote on the merits of \nthe bill that give us the oversight and the ability to pass the \njudgment that we need to send a clear message that we are united in our \ndetermination to prevent Iran from ever becoming a nuclear weapons \nstate, potentially igniting a nuclear arms race in the most dangerous \ntinderbox of the world.\n  So I urge my colleagues to suppress any intentions that will drive us \nto a point that we can't have that strong vote, that we can't send that \nstrong message to Iran. There is no stronger message to Iran, \nparticularly in this critical time, in which I think we strengthen the \nadministration and the P5+1's hand by saying there is a congressional \nreview and potential judgment.\n  So that final agreement we get, hopefully, can be one we can all \nembrace. We can do that--we can actually have an effect by passing this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I just want to again thank Senator \nMenendez for his tremendous leadership on this issue. He brought up a \npoint I wish I had made in my opening comments. I have made it every \ntime I have presented this bill elseways. But a lot of people do not \nrealize that at present, because of the waivers that are part of the \nsanctions that we put in place--some of them through independent pieces \nof legislation, some of them through NDAAs--in each case the President \nwas given a national security waiver.\n  Again, as the Senator mentioned, it was never thought that waiver \nwould be utilized to waive things ad infinitum. At present--a lot of \npeople do not realize this--but the President today has the power, \nwithout this legislation, to go straight to the U.N. Security Council, \nwithout coming to Congress, and implement whatever deal he wants to \nimplement with Iran. He has that ability.\n  So when you think about what is happening here, and this is what is \nso powerful about this bipartisan effort, is that we together--we \ntogether--have said: Wait a minute. If we pass this legislation, we \nwant to retake the ability ourselves to lift those sanctions or to have \nthem lifted; we do not want the President going straight to the U.N. \nSecurity Council.\n  I know Senator Kaine is on the floor. I cannot thank him enough for \ngetting involved at the time he did. I remember distinctly in the \ncommittee meeting, where we had testimony from our Secretary of State, \nhim articulating, better than anyone yet, the fact that at some point \ndown the road we are going to have to permanently lift the sanctions, \nwhich, by the way, could be 5, 6, 7 years down the road, long after the \nsanctions regime has totally imploded. We are going to have to do it \npermanently down the road.\n  Would it not make sense for us to go ahead and review this on the \nfront end and have the opportunity, if we think it is not something \nworthy of this, to disapprove or to approve if we decide to do that.\n  So I know Senator Kaine wants to speak. I cannot thank him enough for \nhis knowledge of congressional responsibilities as it relates to these \nkinds of issues and his input, which was invaluable at the time it \noccurred. He really created the momentum for us to move ahead.\n  I will yield the floor, thanking him very much for his efforts in \nthis regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Corker-\nMenendez bill. I thank Chairman Corker for his kind words and for the \nopportunity to work together on something, in what I believe to be the \nbest traditions of our committee and the Senate. I thank my ranking \nmember, Senator Cardin, for being a great facilitator at the end to \nhelp us get over a number of challenging issues, to a point of \nunanimity on the committee, and to Senator Menendez, whose long-term \ninterest on this issue has been so consistent and so helpful and whose \nwork on this particular piece of legislation was critical.\n  I believe Senator Corker began, and I want to begin as well, with a \ncondolence to the family of Dr. Weinstein, a Marylander who--the \nannouncement today about his death in Afghanistan in a drone strike \nsort of reminds us of the stakes that are involved in these kinds of \nissues. When we are talking about American military action or about \ndiplomacy around a nuclear weapons program, it is not a bill we are \ntalking about, it is not a concept we are talking about, we are talking \nabout human lives; that even in the best of circumstances there will be \ndays like today when there will be sad news and Americans who are in \nharm's way because of the dangerous nature of the world--and I feel \nlike the announcement today about Dr. Weinstein--our condolences to his \nfamily should remind us of the seriousness of our obligation.\n  Senator Cardin started with that great wisdom of Senator Vandenberg \nthat ``politics stops at the water's edge.'' Now, we probably all know \nthat was never 100 percent true. I know a little bit about some of the \nchallenges Jefferson and other Virginians had early. There is always \npolitics, but there is a core wisdom to that principle, a very \nimportant wisdom.\n  Of course, we are going to battle because we see things differently, \nand people seeing things differently can sometimes get to a greater \nunderstanding. That is what we hope to do. But the reason politics \nshould stop at the water's edge is because we want to send a unified \nmessage to our allies as they depend on us. We need to send a unified \nmessage to our adversaries about our intentions.\n  But I would say in a personal way, because of maybe representing the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, we have to send a unified message to the men \nand women in our armed services who serve, who are serving in \nbattlefields, who are serving in theaters of military operations around \nthe world. When we are contemplating decisions about something so big \nthat could potentially lead to war--we just deployed Virginia-based \nships like the Theodore Roosevelt to Yemen to potentially check Iranian \nambitions vis-a-vis the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Those are Virginians, \nmany from other States, who are deployed on those ships.\n  We owe it to those who are serving and risking their lives to try to \nbe as nonpartisan as we can, so they know they are not serving just \nbecause one party thinks they should or the other party thinks they \nshould, but the missions they are undertaking are missions of national \nconsensus. I feel that very strongly. That is why I am so gratified \nthis bill now reaches the floor on a fundamental matter in a bipartisan \nway.\n  With respect to our negotiations with Iran, there was a view out \nthere on the table that if Congress wanted to be involved, it must be \nbecause we are against diplomacy. In the committee I said that notion \nwas offensive to me. There were those even who suggested that those who \nwanted a congressional oversight role were prowar, which was highly \noffensive and insulting.\n  I am prodiplomacy. I supported the President's commencement of these \nnegotiations in November of 2013. I think America has a wonderful \ndiplomatic\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\ntradition where we have been able to achieve a lot when diplomacy is \ndone right.\n  I actually think the negotiation period from November 2013 to today \nhas produced tangible benefits for the United States, our allies, and \nthe world because Iran has rolled back its stockpile of 20-percent \nenriched uranium. They have allowed inspections they didn't allow \nbefore. And even nations and leaders who were skeptical about whether \nthe negotiation would work have admitted to me: Maybe I shouldn't have \nbeen skeptical. The negotiation period has produced some benefits.\n  In the framework announced on April 2, I see some items I like and I \nsee some other things I have some deep questions about. But a \ncommitment by Iran, for example, to roll back uranium stockpiles from \n10,000 kilograms to 300 kilograms--just a fraction of what would be \nnecessary to produce even one weapon--would be very positive.\n  But I say all that just to say that as a prodiplomacy Senator, as \nsomeone who would love to find a negotiation that would work to a \npositive end, I believe strongly that a congressional review role of a \nmatter such as this is necessary, it is helpful, and it is something, \nfrankly, that the American public deserves. It is necessary for the \nreasons that have been described.\n  Now, a President, under article II powers, has significant ability to \nconduct foreign policy and even strike agreements without congressional \napproval. There are many things a President can do in the foreign \npolicy sphere without congressional approval.\n  But this is fundamentally a negotiation about what Iran must do to \nget out from under sanctions that Congress has constructed, that \nCongress has imposed, and that Congress has perfected and approved over \nthe years. If that is the negotiation, there is no way to have an \nultimate deal about the unwinding and eventual repeal of a \ncongressional sanctions statute without congressional review. So \nCongress is necessary to this deal.\n  Second, congressional review is helpful. It is helpful for the \nnegotiators, as they are in this final chapter, to know that they must \nnegotiate to their very best because they will have to sell this deal \nto Congress as the elected representatives of the American people. That \nis a helpful discipline for our negotiators. It is helpful for the \nIranians who want to get out from under congressional sanctions to have \nsome sense of how Congress might ultimately look at this deal.\n  Put yourself in the Iranian shoes. We want them to make huge \nconcessions, not modest ones. But what is their incentive to make big \nconcessions to get out from under congressional sanctions if they have \nno idea what Congress will likely do? We have put a process in place \nthat will give them some sense of what Congress would do in an orderly \nway, and that will be an incentive, I believe, for larger concessions.\n  Not only is this review bill necessary, not only is it helpful, but \nit is what the American public expects and deserves. I think we have \nall been looking at the way the American public has been reacting to \nthis negotiation.\n  The American public is like all of us. They are deeply worried about \nan Iranian nuclear weapons program. They are like all of us. They would \nlove it if we could find a diplomatic end to the Iranian nuclear \nweapons program. They are like all of us. They are skeptical about \nwhether Iran will follow an agreement, and they overwhelmingly believe \nthat if there is an agreement, it should be an agreement that Congress \napproves.\n  Why do they think Congress should approve it? Is it because we have \nfantastic approval ratings? Absolutely not. We don't have great \napproval ratings. But, the American public says: In our anxiety about \nwhether we can trust Iran on a deal, we will feel better if both the \nexecutive and the legislative have looked at this deal and concluded--\nlike you would try to get a second opinion from a doctor on something \nthat was very important--that it is a good deal for our country and our \nnational security. They are going to feel more comfortable, given the \nnatural anxiety they have about Iranian compliance.\n  That is why this bill is so important.\n  Finally, I want to talk about how the bill got here because I do \nthink there is a lesson for the floor activity on the bill but also for \nthe body, more generally.\n  This bill was filed in original version in 2014, and I did not sign \nonto it.\n  Our chairman, Senator Corker, and I were in the Middle East in \nJanuary with five other Senators, in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Israel.\n  As we returned after a set of discussions with governmental leaders, \nmilitary leaders, civil society, and political leaders about many \ntopics, including the Iranian negotiation, Senator Corker, a friend, \nsort of challenged me a little bit: Hey, you are the guy who likes to \nsay that Congress needs to play a role. I have been pushing hard for \nCongress to play a role in an authorization of military force against \nISIL. If that is what you think, why aren't you on this bill about \ncongressional approval of a deal with Iran?\n  I said: You are absolutely right congressional approval, but there \nare some aspects of the bill I don't like.\n  The chairman said to me: Then, fine, you rewrite it or propose \namendments, and let's see if we can work together.\n  So I did and others did, and we put our best good-faith proposals \ndown on the table. We found a listening ear, a staff, and a set of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle who were willing to try to exercise \nthat congressional approval role--but do it in the right way, not the \nwrong way.\n  When we filed this bill on September 27, there were two Democratic \noriginal sponsors and two Republican original sponsors. Then there were \nfive additional Democratic cosponsors and five additional Republican \ncosponsors.\n  So from the very day this bill hit the floor, we were trying to build \nit in a bipartisan way to show that the Vandenberg maxim, although it \nis not as true even when it was stated and it certainly is not as true \ntoday as we would like it, still had some power. And we wanted to show \nthe body that we could do it in a bipartisan way so that our allies, \nour adversaries, and our troops would see that we could act in a \nbipartisan way on something so important.\n  There were steps between the filing of the bill and the Foreign \nRelations Committee action that threatened to push the bill off of the \nbipartisan rails into partisanship in ways that might have served the \nshort-term purpose but that would have probably killed the bill. The \nchairman and others made sure that did not happen.\n  So when we got to the vote in the Foreign Relations Committee--and it \nwent from 2 plus 2, to 7 plus 7, and eventually, 19 to zero--we \ncarefully worked at every step along the way to make this bipartisan \nand, hopefully, to send an example on the floor that this is what it \nshould be. Robust debate and amendment, of course, is what this body is \nabout. But we want to make sure that review of this most important \nmatter is done in a way that is careful, prompt, and deliberate, \naccording to rules that all can respect and all can understand.\n  I conclude with thanks to my colleagues on the committee, to the \nleadership of the chair--both as the original drafter of the bill, then \nas the drafter willing to entertain other ideas, and then as the chair \nof this committee, trying to bring this to a productive place.\n  I thank Senator Cardin for his great role in helping us bridge \ndifferences and, especially, for his communication with the White \nHouse. The White House threatened to veto this bill, but Senator \nCardin, probably better than most, was able to listen to the concerns \nand then try to respond to the concerns in a way that we could make the \nbill productive.\n  This matter is so important that we just cannot tackle it in any way \nother than trying to follow--the best we humanly can--that Vandenberg \nmaxim. I hope, as we get into deliberations on the floor next week, \nthat this would be the spirit of all the colleagues who tackled this \nmost important matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kaine. I appreciate his \noutline of how this legislation went from unlikely to have much impact, \nbecause we didn't have the consensus and the numbers necessary to get \nit through the finish line. It would have had a very, very difficult \ntime getting through the committee--let alone the floor of the Senate, \nthe House, and\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nsigned by the President--but for how people listen to each other.\n  So I am pleased the two of you went on the trip together because I \nthink we need to do more of that in the Senate.\n  Senator Kaine and Senator Corker are both individuals who have a deep \nrespect for the proper role of the Senate, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and the Senators.\n  I am proud to serve with both of you. I am pleased to see that we \nhave found ways that we really can bridge differences in order to \nachieve a common purpose. We were not interested in scoring political \npoints. We are interested in doing what our responsibility is all \nabout.\n  So Senator Corker is now probing a way in which we can reauthorize \nthe State Department, the role that our committee should have, and, \ntherefore, to directly deal with our responsibilities in the Senate \nthrough the appropriate committee. I think all of these are efforts \nwith which, working together, we can have the Senate perform the proper \nrole in this government of ours to make sure that the legislative \nbranch weighs in where it is appropriate on foreign policy issues.\n  I thank Senator Kaine and Senator Corker for giving us a good model \nas to how legislation should be developed. I was proud to work with \nSenator Corker so that we could get the White House and get some of our \nMembers who didn't quite share the enthusiasm of this legislation to a \nplace where they are comfortable in supporting the bill--not only \nsupporting the bill but enthusiastically supporting the bill in order \nto get it done.\n  I also appreciate your mentioning Warren Weinstein. Warren Weinstein \nwas a resident of Maryland. His wife, Elaine, I talked to on frequent \noccasions. She is a very brave woman and did everything she could to \nbring her husband home. Warren Weinstein was a USAID worker in \nPakistan. He did that because he wanted to do good for the world.\n  He was very well respected, carrying out his mission in a most \nprofessional way. He was on his way home, basically, when he was \nkidnapped in 2011 by Al Qaeda. As we know, the President announced \ntoday that he was killed in January, along with an Italian national who \nwas also serving. Our thoughts and prayers first go out to the \nfamilies. Our hearts are broken.\n  Senator Mikulski, Congressman Delaney, and I have frequently met with \nthe family over the years to try to put a spotlight at the appropriate \ntime in dealing with the hostage situation. It is very difficult to \ndeal with a hostage situation when it is not a government that is \nholding the person, and it makes it much more complicated.\n  But I do think that in addition to doing everything we can to keep \nour Americans safe who go to these countries on our behalf, using \ndiplomacy, basically, and developing assistance for a more stable \ncountry, we have to do everything we can to keep them safe. We have to \nrecognize the risk factors in circumstances such as this. We have to \nhave strategies to do everything we possibly can to bring these people \nback home safely.\n  I know you all share that. But then we have to make the world a \nlittle bit safer, and that is what this review statute is all about. I \ndo believe it does give us a better opportunity to get the right \nagreement from Iran that would prevent it from becoming a nuclear \nweapons power, which is a game changer for the security in that region.\n  I wish to mention just one other example. There was an enormous human \ntragedy when another boat carrying desperate refugees and migrants \ncapsized in the Mediterranean Sea. In the most recent instance over 850 \nmen, women, and children have died. Now these are very desperate \nsituations when you take these dangerous voyages.\n  The number of people who have died in the Mediterranean--in 2014 we \nknow that well over 218,000 refugees and migrants crossed the \nMediterranean Sea, many fleeing violence, conflicts, and persecution in \nSyria, Iraq, and Eritrea. We also know that Yemen is involved here. \nLast year's death total surpassed 1,750 victims.\n  I mention that because what Iran is doing in this region is adding to \nthe migration and refugee issues. Its support of terrorism, its \ninvolvement in Yemen, its involvement in Syria, and its involvement in \nother countries are causing people to take desperate action in order to \nstay safe. So we are here today to do something about that.\n  It is just another motivation for us to do everything we can to \nprovide the types of policies that are necessary in that region of the \nworld to make people safer and to have sustainable countries that can \nprotect all of their citizens.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, today we will begin the most important \ndebate this Congress will have this year, probably this Congress, \nperhaps in the entire tenure any Member of this Senate has. This debate \nis not just about this piece of legislation but about a nuclear Iran \nand the consequences a nuclear Iran would create for the world.\n  Iran is today the greatest threat to the world. Iran already is the \nworld's leading state sponsor of terrorism, according to the Obama \nadministration's own State Department. We see their regional aggression \non display in Syria, in Lebanon, in Iraq, and now in Yemen. They have a \nvery bad habit of killing Jews around the world, from Israel, to \nBulgaria, to Argentina. They hold four U.S. citizens hostage today \nwithout just cause or due process. They do all those things without a \nnuclear weapon and with tens of billions of dollars frozen overseas.\n  What could we expect if Iran is able to develop nuclear weapons \ncapabilities?\n  First, we will see more regional aggression as they use their nuclear \numbrella to continue their drive for regional dominance throughout the \nMiddle East. They would use the tens of billions of dollars sanctions \nrelief would give them not to build hospitals or schools or roads or to \nimprove the lives of their people but, rather, to prop up their \nproxies, such as the Hezbollah or the Houthis or the Shiite militia \ncurrently at risk of tearing Iraq apart.\n  Second, they are likely to use those nuclear weapons. Ayatollah \nKhamenei, the original Supreme Leader, upon taking power said the \nIslamic revolution did not care about Iran or the Persian nation or its \nhistory, they cared about spreading worldwide Islamic revolution. This \nis not a normal state, and these are not normal leaders.\n  Third, we will see a nuclear arms race throughout the Middle East. As \nmany Senators in this institution have heard from senior government \nofficials of Sunni states throughout the gulf, they cannot tolerate a \nPersian Shiite nuclear power. Whether they develop with their \nindigenous capabilities, in some instances, or whether they purchase it \nfrom overseas, we will see the world's most dangerous and volatile \nregion strung with nuclear tripwires.\n  Fourth, these countries may provide nuclear weapons to terrorists to \nbe used against American troops in the region, against our allies, such \nas Israel, or other countries or in one of the harbors on America's \ncoasts, if not in America's heartland.\n  Fifth, terrorists or insurgents could get their hands on nuclear \nmaterials if they were able to destabilize or topple the wrong regime, \nas has tended to happen in the Middle East in the last 4 years and in \nrecent decades.\n  The President started these negotiations on the grounds that we would \nstop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Yet he has consistently \nbackpedaled, conceded, and reversed himself. Rather than now trying to \ndismantle and disarm Iran's nuclear arms program, we are content to \ntrying to manage it, to limit its breakout time to 1 mere year, if \nthat.\n  The United Nation's Security Council has passed multiple resolutions \nsaying that Iran has no right to enrich uranium. Yet now we are going \nto concede Iran the right to keep thousands of centrifuges, to continue \nadvanced research into centrifuges, and to keep its stockpile of \nuranium.\n  The President said barely more than a year ago, after the \nnegotiations started, that Iran had no reason to\n\n[[Page S2388]]\n\nhave a hardened underground military bunker in which they kept \ncentrifuge cascades in Fordow. Yet, according to our own proposed fact \nsheet--much of which Iran disputes--we are going to concede the Fordow \nissue.\n  The President said at the very same time after negotiations had begun \nthat Iran had no reason to keep its uranium stockpiles, and Iran had, \nin fact, reportedly agreed to tentatively export those to a third \nparty. At the last minute, in Switzerland earlier this month, they \nreversed themselves, saying they were going to insist on keeping their \nstockpile, and we conceded on that front as well.\n  We have insisted throughout the period of these negotiations that we \nwould not grant Iran immediate sanctions relief. The President's own \nterm sheet said we wouldn't grant such relief. Iran's term sheet says \ndifferently. Just Friday, when confronted with this discrepancy, the \nPresident said we may have to find creative ways around this \ndisagreement--creative ways to give Iran, the world's leading state \nsponsor of terrorism, on its way to becoming a nuclear threshold power, \ntens of billions of dollars and reportedly even a $50 billion signing \nbonus, as if Iran were not a theocratic dictatorial regime but a blue \nchip prospect in the NFL draft.\n  These negotiations have also excluded most of Iran's outlaw \nbehavior--currently developing intercontinental ballistic missiles for \nwhich there is no reason other than striking the United States; holding \nthose four hostages without due process or fair trials--and stopping \nits regional aggression and stopping its support for terrorism.\n  This legislation has some good elements in it. It would suspend the \nPresident's ability to waive any sanctions for approximately 7 weeks \nwhile we consider any proposed bill if such a deal is reached at some \npoint in the future. It would also require the President to certify \nevery 90 days that Iran is living up to its obligations under any such \ndeal. But it only goes into effect after such a deal is announced. Any \ndeal along the lines the President proposed 2 weeks ago is dangerous \nfor the United States and dangerous for the world, and it is Congress's \njob to stop such a deal before it happens.\n  The sponsors of this bill didn't upend the constitutional baseline. \nThis bill should be submitted for a treaty. The President should have \nto get 67 votes for a major nuclear arms agreement with an outlaw \nregime. Instead, Congress has to get 67 votes in the Senate to block \nsuch a bill. That is why I intend to support Senator Johnson's \namendment that would require this to be submitted as a treaty.\n  This legislation omits most of Iran's outlaw behavior, and it doesn't \nlay out the terms on which Congress would insist, before there is \nsanctions relief, in addressing this outlaw behavior. And it may allow \nthe President to argue in the future--if a mere 34 Senators vote \nagainst a resolution of disapproval--and say that Congress has \nacquiesced in his agreement and that he now has support from the \nCongress and is not just acting on his own whim.\n  Therefore, I expect to offer and I expect to support amendments that \nare offered in three main categories--first, an amendment that would \ntreat any resolution of disapproval as a privileged amendment subject \nnot to a 60-vote threshold but to a 51-vote threshold. We should not \nlet 34 Senators block a resolution of disapproval from going into \neffect. We certainly shouldn't allow 41 Senators to impede the will of \n59 Senators who disagree with any future deal from forcing the \nPresident to veto it and depriving him of the ability to claim that \nCongress has acquiesced to his action.\n  The second main category would be to limit the administration's \ndiscretion in the future on reporting about breaches of an agreement, \nshould an agreement be reached and should it not be blocked by the \nCongress.\n  This legislation says the administration should report potentially \nsignificant breaches to the Congress and then determine whether those \npotentially significant breaches are a material breach, which is \ndefined as substantially reducing Iran's breakout time or improving \nIran's nuclear program. We should strike those lawyers' vague terms. \nThey should submit every breach to us. They should submit every time \nthe breakout time is decreased or Iran's nuclear program improves its \nposition. It is our job as the people's representatives to decide \nwhether it is material, whether it is significant.\n  The third category of amendments is that Iran should not get \nsanctions relief until they live up to their international obligations, \nuntil they meet the very baseline terms the President himself laid out \nat the beginning of these negotiations or even after the negotiations \nhad begun, and until Iran acts like a civilized country.\n  There should be no sanctions relief until the President can certify \nthat the hardened underground military facility at Fordow is closed. He \nhimself said Iran had no need for it.\n  There should be no sanctions relief until Iran has lived up to its \ninternational obligation to the IAEA--the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog--and \ndisclosed the past military dimensions of its nuclear program, without \nwhich inspectors have no baseline to know what the status of their \nprogram is today.\n  There should be no sanctions relief until the President can certify \nthat Iran is not developing intercontinental ballistic missiles. They \nhave missiles that can defend their own territory and that can strike \nmost of their neighbors in the Middle East. They are developing \nintercontinental ballistic missiles for one reason: to strike the \nUnited States with a nuclear warhead.\n  There should be no sanctions relief until the President can certify \nthat Iran is no longer sponsoring terrorism because it goes to the \nheart of the threat Iran poses. Other countries in the world are a \nnuclear threshold power--Japan, Germany, and South Korea. We don't have \ndebates about those countries being a nuclear threshold power because \nthey are normal countries with normal leaders who do not call us the \nGreat Satan and Israel the Little Satan and threaten to wipe Israel off \nthe map. Until the nature of the Iran regime changes, we cannot allow \nthem to have weapons of this nature. And they will not change until \nthey have renounced terrorism.\n  Next, the President should have to certify that Iran is not \ncooperating with North Korea--as it has done countless times on \nballistic missile programs and nuclear technology--an outlaw regime \nwhose current nuclear status foretells the future of this deal. In \n1994, the agreed framework was supposed to stop North Korea from \nbecoming a nuclear power. Yet, just 12 years later, they have developed \nnuclear weapons. Now, by most estimates, they have 20--a number that \ncould double in just a few years--with much of the United States \nfalling underneath the threat of a North Korean nuclear attack.\n  Next, there should be no sanctions relief until all four American \nhostages are released--Pastor Saeed Abenini; Amir Hekmati, a decorated \nmarine; Robert Levinson; and Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter. \nThat should have been a term before we even sat down at the table, that \nno American citizen will be held hostage by an outlaw, third-rate \nregime like Iran--before we started negotiating with them. They and \ntheir families deserve no less.\n  There should be no sanctions relief until the President can certify \nthat Iran has agreed to anytime, anywhere inspections. This is an \nongoing point of major dispute between President Obama and Iran's \nleaders, but if we can't go to their military facilities, if we can't \ninspect any facility instantly, without notification, we will be \nengaged in the same kind of cat-and-mouse regime that has caused \ninspection regimes to fail time and time again.\n  Finally, Iran should recognize Israel's right to exist. It is not too \nmuch to simply say that Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish and a \ndemocratic country. This is a country that just a few months ago was \ntweeting--tweeting--nine different reasons why Israel should be \nannihilated from the world.\n  These are very simple terms, most of which President Obama himself \noutlined before these negotiations began or which are clear and binding \ninternational obligations on Iran. They are good amendments that would \nstrengthen this bill--a bill that touches on the most important issues \nthat most of us will address during our time in the Senate.\n  When we considered the Keystone Pipeline bill--an important bill but \na\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\nbill that dealt with a single pipeline--we considered almost 250 \namendments, and we voted on 40. Surely, we should have the same kind of \nrobust consideration, debate, and voting on this bill. I strongly \nsupport the majority leader's call earlier this morning for exactly \nthat kind of robust process. Most of these amendments touch directly on \nthe heart of this legislation. I look forward to casting up-or-down \nvotes on a 51-vote threshold on all of these amendments and many more \nthat my colleagues may offer.\n  I regret that I may miss some of this debate. I may have to ask some \nof my colleagues to submit amendments for me. My first child is due \ntoday. By the time this bill gets to the floor next week for debate and \nvoting, I expect my first child will have arrived. But I will not allow \nmy son to live under the threat of a nuclear Iran--the threat of \nnuclear attack and ultimate nuclear war--any more than I will allow the \nsons and daughters of all Americans to live under that threat.\n  So I look forward to this debate. I look forward to stopping Iran \nfrom getting a nuclear weapon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to continue our efforts to \nhonor the Nation's and North Dakota's Vietnam veterans and specifically \nthose brave servicemembers who were killed in action during the Vietnam \nwar.\n  Mr. President, 198 soldiers from North Dakota died while serving in \nVietnam. Today, I am honored to speak about some of these brave men and \nthe stories their families have shared with us.\n  I need to credit David Erbstoesser of Bismarck, a Vietnam veteran, \nfor his service and for his years of reaching out to the family members \nof these fallen North Dakota patriots. Over the past 20 years, David \ncontacted each family to obtain a photo of every servicemember and a \nphoto of their gravestone. I am grateful to David for meeting with my \nstaff to share his collection of obituaries, news articles, and photos \nhe has collected.\n  The Bismarck High students and their teachers are also researching \nNorth Dakota's servicemembers who didn't come home from Vietnam. Today, \nI am happy to include research from BHS's 11th grade students about two \nsuch men: Gary Myers and David Bujalski.\n\n\n                         Raphael ``John'' Frost\n\n  The first of our soldiers is John Frost. John was from Hunter. He was \nborn on March 16, 1948. He served in the Army's 196th Infantry Brigade. \nJohn was 20 years old when he was killed on December 20, 1968.\n  John was the oldest of three children and helped his dad on the \nfamily farm. During high school, John participated in the school \nnewspaper, choir, the Letterman's Club, a school play, and was a class \nofficer. He was also an all-around athlete who earned letters in track, \nbaseball, football, and basketball. His mother Lois still remembers how \nproud she was the day he scored 33 points in one basketball game in a \nwinning effort.\n  After high school, John enrolled at Valley City State College. He was \na quiet, fun-loving boy who dreamed of returning to his hometown to \nwork as a teacher and basketball coach.\n  John's mother and brother Kevin remember John's kindness, especially \ntoward his Grandma Alice while she was staying with the family \nrecuperating from breaking her hip. While his parents were out of town, \nJohn stayed home caring for his grandmother, even making potato \npancakes for her.\n\n\n                              Jon Greenley\n\n  Jon Greenley was from Fargo. He was born on January 30, 1942. He \nserved in the Air Force's 774th Tactical Aerial Flight Squadron. Jon \ndied on January 7, 1966. He was 23 years old.\n  Jon was one of three sons. His brother Doug remembers that Jon \nrespected authority. Jon sent Doug a letter stating that the only time \nhe questioned their parents' judgment was when he was buying a \nlawnmower and they suggested he buy a type he didn't like.\n  From a young age, Jon had an interest in planes and in the military. \nHe joined the North Dakota Air National Guard. When his parents \nwouldn't take him to see the Air Museum in Ohio, he hitchhiked there.\n  Jon attended North Dakota State University and became president of \nthe international relations group there. He was named Outstanding ROTC \nof the Air Force and was the first alternate to the Air Force Academy. \nThe Fargo AMVETS post, founded in 1980, was named after Jon.\n  His body has never been recovered.\n\n\n                              Dan Herdebu\n\n  Dan Herdebu was from Baldwin. He was born on July 21, 1948. He served \nin the Army's 1st Aviation Brigade. He was 19 years old when he died on \nMarch 10, 1968.\n  Dan and his two brothers attended their two-room school through the \neighth grade and attended Bismarck High School.\n  Dan planned to put his aviation experience to good use by flying \nhelicopters for law enforcement or medical facilities someday.\n  Dan's older brother Eugene was in basic training when Dan was killed \nin a helicopter crash in Vietnam. After Dan's death, Eugene also served \nin Vietnam in the Army.\n\n\n                             Alan Hinzpeter\n\n  Alan Hinzpeter was from Minot. He was born on May 12, 1949.

He was a jokester who \nliked everyone and whom everyone liked. His oldest sister Jean tells \nabout the time he wanted to watch the World Series, so he smoked a \ncigarette at school so he would be suspended. Jean says that Alan was 5 \nfeet 4 inches but had a big personality. Many people attended his \nfuneral and still to this day remember him fondly.\n\n\n                      Gerald Allen ``Al'' Iverson\n\n  Al Iverson was from Oakes. He was born on May 26, 1947.

Three of \nhis brothers also served our country in the military.\n  His friends, both in the Army and from high school, remembered \nNorbert as a friend who stuck by them through thick and thin. His \nbrother Don says that Norbert was wounded in Vietnam and was supposed \nto be on R in Australia but chose to stay in Vietnam to\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nhelp his fellow soldiers. His church in Belfield recognizes him every \nyear on the anniversary of his death. After his death, the Army \npromoted Norbert to corporal.\n\n\n                             Gerhardt Just\n\n  Gerhardt Just was from Wishek and was born October 31, 1925.

He was survived by his wife Lillian, \ndaughters Oteeka and Cora, and his son Butch.\n  Gerhardt joined the Army, served in Korea, and then reenlisted in the \nArmy to provide for his family.\n  Gerhardt's oldest child, Oteeka, remembers that it was so important \nfor her dad to support his family financially that after his pickup \ncaught fire and burned the driver's seat, he put a kitchen chair in the \ncab so he could drive to his second job.\n  His kids have memories of spending their last time together working \non the house he bought them, installing grass in the yard and painting \nthe house days before his deployment.\n  Gerhardt was killed just a month after arriving in Vietnam.\n  Gerhardt's children appreciate how after his death, Gerhardt's \nparents and siblings always welcomed his widow and children into their \nfamily with open arms.\n\n\n                               Gary Myers\n\n  Gary Myers was from Fort Yates and was born on November 4, 1947. He \nserved in the Marine Corps's 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion. Gary was 20 \nyears old when he died on May 13, 1968.\n  Gary's father served in the Army during the Korean war and was \nstationed in Germany, where Gary was born. Gary spent 1 year at \nDickinson State University before enlisting.\n  Gary's sister Linda remembers him as an outgoing person who loved to \nhelp people when he had a chance. He was an honor student and enjoyed \nplaying sports, including wrestling, football, and rodeo. When we \nwasn't busy with sports, Gary was helping his father work on their \ncattle ranch.\n  Gary's hometown friends and fellow soldiers reported that Gary was \nkilled in Vietnam while leading a mission to retrieve his lieutenant's \nbody 1 month before Gary was scheduled to return home to his family in \nthe United States.\n\n\n                              Larry Olson\n\n  Larry Olson was from McHenry.

His sister Rita remembers him \nas the big brother who always watched out for her and kept bullies \naway.\n  Larry was a hard worker and a good friend. Fellow soldiers from his \nregiment loved Larry so much that they asked Rita to show them his \ngrave.\n\n\n                        Richard ``Rick'' Borgman\n\n  Rick Borgman was from Minot and was born on January 23, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 101st Airborne Division. He was 21 years old when \nhe died on March 3, 1968.\n  Rick's mother Anita and sister Pat remember him as a loving, gentle \nperson. He participated in Boy Scouts, worked at the Red Owl grocery \nstore, and enjoyed fast cars and life in general.\n  Rick left behind his widow Linda, his son Shannon, and daughter \nLaura. Linda learned that she was pregnant with Laura shortly after \nRick's funeral. Linda remembers Rick's big heart, great sense of humor, \nand that he was loved by many. She says she can see Rick whenever she \nlooks at Shannon and Laura and that Shannon's laugh is contagious, just \nas his dad's was.\n  Linda is grateful that her second husband, Bruce Sullivan, a Vietnam \nveteran, adopted Shannon and Laura and lovingly helped her raise them.\n\n\n                             David Bujalski\n\n  David Bujalski was from Carrington.

He was 27 years old.\n  David was the youngest of six children, lovingly called ``Little \nDavid.'' But after reaching the height of 6 foot 2 inches, his family \nmore often referred to cheerful and friendly David as a gentle giant.\n  He graduated in the top third of his class from West Point and \nmarried Barbara. They had a daughter Elizabeth while David was \nstationed in Germany. They moved to Arizona, and David became a \ncommander. His first sergeant there was quoted saying, ``He was revered \nby his cadre, loved by his students, and respected by his superiors.''\n  David felt a duty to serve in Vietnam, and 8 days after arriving \nthere, he was killed by a sniper. His second daughter Kathleen was born \n6 weeks later.\n  David's brother Jack, also a West Point graduate, wrote the following \nabout his brother:\n\n       David's life was too short for him to have reached his full \n     potential. We can only conjecture as to what he would have \n     achieved, but we do know that he influenced the lives of all \n     who knew him.\n\n\n                             Leslie Carter\n\n  Leslie Carter was from Jamestown.

He loved hunting \nwith his father, grandfather, and uncles. He also loved cars and \nplaying basketball. David helped construct a figure 8 racetrack in \nGrand Forks and was happy to be able to race his own cars on the track \na few times before being deployed.\n  Wanting to serve his country like his World War II veteran father, \nDavid joined the Army at age 17. His family hoped he would not be \nassigned to a combat unit because he was only 17, but a day after his \n18th birthday, he received his orders to Vietnam.\n\n\n                             Wilbert Fleck\n\n  Wilbert Fleck was from Breien and was born November 22, 1949.

Six of the seven \nboys served in the military.\n  Wilbert's brothers and sisters remember him as a selfless and caring \nperson. He was always willing to help out a neighbor. He was dedicated \nto caring for his aging parents and was extremely protective of those \nhe loved.\n  Wilbert died taking charge of his platoon after his platoon leader \nwas killed. His sister Pauline says that this was just the kind of \nperson he was--always willing to put the needs of others before his \nown. Wilbert was Pauline's best friend.\n\n\n                            Lowell Hardmeyer\n\n  Lowell Hardmeyer was from Mott. He was born on February 16, 1949.

He was 35 years old when \nhe went missing on March 29, 1972.\n  Merlyn was one of nine children, six boys and three girls. Five of \nthe boys served their country, three in World War II and two in \nVietnam.\n  Merlyn's brother Bob remembers him as a wonderful boy who people \ncouldn't help but love. Bob jokes that Merlyn had personality to burn.\n  Merlyn went missing when his plane was shot down by a surface-to-air \nmissile. Fourteen years later, in 1986, his body was finally recovered. \nYears later, his family was finally able to lay him to rest in \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  These are just a few stories that, by sharing today with the Senate \nand sharing today on the floor of the Senate, I hope will remind us all \nof the tremendous sacrifice that not only these young men have provided \nfor their country but the sacrifice also of their families, their \nchildren, and the wives they leave behind, the parents they leave \nbehind, and that it is a constant reminder that we must never forget \nthe duty to our country and we must never forget those among us who \nhave paid the ultimate price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the last Congress, I came to the Senate \nfloor to express my concern about the state of the Senate as an \ninstitution, how it had been beset by dysfunction, destructive \npartisanship, and corrosion of its vital characteristics.\n  Today, I wish to reflect on some of the progress we have made in the \nfirst few months of this Congress in restoring this great institution \nto its essential role in our constitutional system. While significant \nprogress has been made, there still remains much more to be done.\n  Central to properly understanding our responsibilities as Senators is \nan appreciation of the Senate's role in our system of government. \nConsider the particularly distinct purposes of the two Houses of \nCongress. The House of Representatives is the organ of government \ndesigned to embody the will of the people. Its small constituencies and \nshort terms allow its Members to be as closely in touch with the voters \nas possible. With 435 Members, robust participation by every Member in \neach debate is impossibly cumbersome. Thus, the House's work is defined \nby majority rule as logically befits a body that represents the popular \nwill.\n  By contrast, the Framers designed the Senate to serve as what they \ncalled ``a necessary fence'' against the ``fickleness and passion'' \nthat sometimes drives popular pressure for hasty and ill-considered \nlawmaking--or, as Edmund Randolph put it, ``the turbulence and follies \nof democracy.'' Similarly, James Madison described its purpose as \n``protect[ing] the people against the transient impressions into which \nthey themselves might be led.''\n  Through its character and its institutional structure, the Senate not \nonly checks transient and occasionally intemperate impulses but also \nrefines the popular will with wisdom and sound judgment. Perhaps the \nmost important characteristic that guarantees this key function is the \nSenate's relatively small size, which enables each and every Senator to \ncontribute meaningfully in debate.\n  The primacy of individual Senators' rights has long guided the \ndevelopment of the Senate's rules and traditions, including the right \nto extend debate, open amendment consideration, and a committee system \nthat gives all Members, from the most seasoned chairman to the newest \nfreshman, a hand in drafting and improving legislation. Moreover, there \nis the reality that to function efficiently and effectively, the Senate \nfrequently requires temporary modifications to the institution's \noftentimes complex and cumbersome rules--agreements that require the \nunanimous consent of all Senators to take effect.\n  The expansive rights of Senators are a double-edged sword--at once \nboth the great genius of the institution and the source of some of the \ngreatest pitfalls that may befall it. By giving a minority of \nSenators--sometimes even a minority of one--great sway over the \nbusiness of the whole body, each one of us is entrusted with enormous \npowers that can be used to grind the Senate to a halt. These powers can \nbe used to do enormous good when used wisely and judiciously--from \nforcing a majority to reconsider misguided legislation to extracting \nimportant guarantees from the executive branch in exchange for allowing \na nomination to go forward.\n  The former Senator from Oklahoma, Dr. Tom Coburn, was a leading \nexponent of these rights. During his time in the Senate, he was \nlegendary for his use of the rules to stop wasteful spending and limit \nthe expansion of the Federal Government. While we may not always have \nagreed on particular matters, it is beyond question that his \nwillingness to stand up for what he believed in--even in the face of \noverwhelming opposition--did enormous good for our Nation. Dr. Coburn's \nservice demonstrates exactly why the Senate allows a minority to hold \nsuch a sway over this body.\n  Nevertheless, while the whole Republic has benefited time and again \nfrom a Senate minority's judicious exercise of its rights, we know all \ntoo well how these rights can be abused. Today, the Senate's procedures \nhave become bywords for mindless obstruction. In the minds of many of \nour fellow citizens, what drives the exercise of minority rights is not \nthe interests of thoughtful legislating or productive oversight but, \nrather, reflexive partisanship and political grandstanding.\n  From various quarters, including some within this very body, we often \nhear calls to eliminate the various rights of the minority. Although \nthese calls may be instinctively appealing, we should decisively reject \nthem. After all, without these minority rights, the Senate would lose \nits unique character, which has allowed it to serve the Republic so \nwell for so many years. The Senate, stripped of its minority rights, \nwould merely duplicate and needlessly frustrate the work of the House \nof Representatives.\n  Those of us in the present day should recall that we are not the \nfirst in our Nation's history to confront the potential for great \ndysfunction. In particular, we should recall the example of the late \nSenator from Montana, Mike Mansfield. Senator Mansfield served as \nmajority leader from 1961 until 1977, holding that position longer than \nany other Senate leader. These were turbulent times for the Nation and \nthe Senate alike, when the issues of the day could hardly have been \nmore divisive and problematic.\n  Near the beginning of his tenure, when a determined minority stalled \nPresident Kennedy's legislative priorities, Senator Mansfield faced \ngreat pressure from within his own party to exert the majority's power \nmore assertively. In an act of great courage, Mansfield resisted these \ncalls to bend the Senate's rules. Although tempted by the prospect of \nimportant policy and political victories, he instead counseled that the \nremedy to gridlock ``lies not in the seeking of shortcuts, not in the \ncracking of nonexistent whips, not in wheeling and dealing, but in an \nhonest facing of the situation and a resolution of it by the Senate \nitself, by accommodation, by respect for one another, [and] by mutual \nrestraint.''\n  Senator Mansfield was absolutely right, and his wisdom is perhaps \nmore relevant now than ever. For the Senate to function effectively, \nSenators of all stripes must practice mutual restraint--Republican and \nDemocrat, conservative and liberal, majority and minority alike.\n  In practice, restraint requires different sacrifices of different \nSenators, depending on their position. For the majority leadership, it \nis measured in part by what sort of measures are brought before the \nSenate for consideration. Do they tend to be divisive and partisan \nmessaging bills, or do they tend to be measures that can gather \nbipartisan support--those that may offer less prospects of a messaging \nvictory but greater prospects for actually becoming law? Have the \nmeasures typically been considered by the committee of jurisdiction, \nallowing for a\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\nthorough vetting and best chance for bipartisan consensus?\n  Restraint is also measured in how the majority conducts its \nconsideration of a particular measure. Is there an open amendment \nprocess that allows all Senators to contribute to the Chamber's work \nand seek means of mutual accommodation, or does the majority leader \nfill up the so-called amendment tree, thereby freezing legislation in \nthe exact form that he demands? Is the full Senate allowed sufficient \ntime for full and free debate on a measure important enough for \nconsideration on the floor, or does the majority leader move to end \ndebate as soon as it begins?\n  The need for mutual restraint also creates correlative obligations \nfor the minority. From filibusters, to poison-pill amendments, to \nobjections, to routine unanimous consent requests--an often \nunderappreciated but incredibly important tool to chew up this body's \nvaluable time--Senators in the minority have numerous ways in which \nthey can grind this body to a halt and derail a measure. Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle--myself included--have relied on these means \nbefore. Their use can be quite legitimate when employed judiciously and \nmotivated by serious policy disagreement; however, when employed \nindiscriminately for the purpose of frustrating the operation of the \nSenate for partisan gain, the use of such tactics is deeply improper.\n  The appropriateness of the minority's behavior hinges in large part \non the actions of the majority. With the power to decide the Senate's \nbusiness, including what the Senate considers as well as how it \nconsiders it, the majority's behavior rightfully shapes the minority's \nresponse. Majority restraint invites minority restraint, begetting \nproductive legislating, whereas majority overreach invites minority \nintransigence, causing only dysfunction.\n  The Senate's dysfunction over the past few years resulted from \nexactly that--repeated instances of overreach by the majority in direct \ncontradiction to the restraint counseled by Senator Mansfield. This \noverreach occurred along a wide variety of fronts, many of which my \ncolleagues and I spoke out against in great detail.\n  In the last Congress, many bills that received floor consideration \nhad completely bypassed the committee process. In fact, each of the \npast four Congresses set a new record for the use of this extraordinary \nprocedure. The unfortunate but predictable result was the waste of the \nSenate's valuable floor time on partisan messaging bills that no one \nseriously expected to become law.\n  Instead of allowing an open amendment process, the previous majority \nused the procedural maneuver known as filling the tree to deny Senators \nthe right to offer an amendment. By refusing to allow amendments out of \na desire to prevent a vote on commonsense bipartisan ideas, such as \nbuilding the Keystone XL Pipeline and rolling back bureaucratic red \ntape, the previous majority invited minority opposition to the \nunderlying measures, killing important bipartisan legislation such as \nthe energy efficiency bill and the sportsman's bill.\n  In the last Congress, almost a year went by during which the majority \nallowed votes on only 11 minority amendments. During that period, all \n45 Senators in the minority together got fewer votes on amendments \nthan, for example, one House Democrat, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson \nLee. In fact, the Congressional Research Service confirms that the \nprevious majority leader used his position to block the consideration \nof amendments more than twice as often as the previous six majority \nleaders combined.\n  The previous majority also frequently moved to end debate on a \nmeasure at the very same time it was brought up for consideration, \nemploying this tactic far more often than previous majorities. Its \neffect is not to end debate on legislation but to prevent it all \ntogether. Whenever those of us then in the minority resisted this \ndemand that we end debate as soon as we began consideration, the \nmajority wrongfully labeled it a ``filibuster.'' Worst of all, the \nmajority used this supposedly unprecedented level of obstruction to \ntake the drastic step of abolishing extended debate all together on \nmost nominations using the so-called nuclear option.\n  With the new leadership of the Senate under the senior Senator from \nKentucky, we have made enormous progress toward restoring this sense of \nmutual restraint. Consider the sort of legislation the current majority \nleader has brought up for floor consideration so far this Congress: the \nbipartisan Hoeven-Manchin bill to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline; \nthe permanent solution for Medicare's Sustainable Growth Rate and \nreauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which \npassed 92 to 8; and the Cornyn-Klobuchar bill to fight the scourge of \nmodern-day slavery known as human trafficking.\n  These are not Republican messaging bills. The majority leader has \nadmirably avoided the temptation to fill our agenda with partisan bills \njust to score cheap political points. Instead, we have focused on bills \nthat command broad bipartisan support. Moreover, consider the bills \nthat the majority leader has indicated are next up for floor \nconsideration: the Corker-Menendez Iran nuclear agreement legislation \nthat passed the Foreign Relations Committee with unexpected and \nimpressive unanimity; the bipartisan Alexander-Murray rewrite of No \nChild Left Behind; and our bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities \nand Accountability Act, which passed out of the Finance Committee last \nnight with the support of 13 Republicans and 7 Democrats. By \nidentifying these priorities, the majority leader has indicated that \nhis focus on bipartisan committee-vetted legislation is not a fleeting \nillusion but a long-term commitment to responsible leadership.\n  The way in which the majority leader has conducted our consideration \nof these bills also demonstrates this commitment to restraint. We have \nseen committee consideration of legislation restored as the norm. We \nhave also seen a renewed commitment to an open amendment process. In \nJanuary, for example, the Senate voted on more amendments in 1 week \nthan in all of last year. By my count, we have voted on 114 individual \namendments in less than 4 months, the majority of which were offered by \nthe minority. Many of these were tough votes, but the need to govern \nresponsibly far outweighed any political cost. Instead of cutting off \ndebate before it even begins, we have moved at a deliberate pace to \nallow the amendment process to flourish, tempering our own desire to \nmove legislation faster in order to legislate according to the best \ntraditions of this body.\n  This is not to say that the past 4 months have been perfect. There \nhave been times when the sailing has been a bit rocky. While the \ncurrent minority has repeatedly displayed admirable cooperation--the \nsort of mutual restraint that Senator Mansfield wisely lauded so many \nyears ago--there have been times when some of my colleagues have fallen \nprey to the temptation of partisan obstruction.\n  In particular, I was extremely disappointed by the logjam that \ndeveloped over the Hyde amendment and impeded progress on the \nbipartisan human trafficking bill. The gridlock over what should have \nbeen an uncontroversial provision indicated a troubling willingness on \nthe part of some to derail our efforts to legislate responsibly and \ninstead resort to tired and discredited war-on-women rhetoric to win \ncheap political votes.\n  I was so encouraged by this week's resolution of that impasse. The \nwillingness on the part of leaders on both sides of the aisle to break \nthe gridlock reflected the best of the Senate's great tradition of \nstatesmanship. I want to extend my sincere thanks and respect to the \nsenior Senators from Washington, Minnesota, and Texas, Senators Murray, \nKlobuchar and Cornyn, as well as everyone else who helped craft the \ncompromise.\n  By putting partisanship aside, they have not only benefitted the \nvictims of human trafficking; they have also helped reinvigorate the \nethos of accommodation and mutual restraint that is at the heart of \nthis institution. We should all look to this example as a model of \nleadership worthy of the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  It is incumbent on all of us to get the Senate back to work for the \nAmerican people. By returning to the spirit of comity that served this \nbody so well for so long, we have already made real and meaningful \nprogress. I urge all of my colleagues to continue in this noble \npursuit. It is undoubtedly worth the cost.\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the millions of \nArmenians who were deported during the Armenian genocide in 1915, and \nthe 1.5 million men, women, and children who were killed. April 24, \n2015, marks the Centennial Remembrance Day of the Armenian genocide, \nand my thoughts go out to the descendants of the victims and all of the \nArmenian people as the world commemorates this tragedy.\n  As we reflect upon this horrific period in history, we are reminded \nof the importance of promoting tolerance and standing firm against \nhatred and discrimination. That is why I have always recognized the \nterrible atrocities that took place in Armenia as genocide and why I \nconsistently support resolutions in the Senate to remember the \nanniversaries of the Armenian genocide. I will continue to support \nthese resolutions and speak about this issue so we never forget the \nfamilies who were torn apart and destroyed due to brutal intolerance.\n  Nevada is home to a vibrant community of thousands of Armenian \nAmericans. Through churches and other organizations, Armenians in \nNevada have demonstrated a commitment to working to improve their \ncommunities and serve others. For instance, the Armenian Relief \nAssociation in Las Vegas has dedicated years to serving the Las Vegas \ncommunity and providing Saturday school for children to learn Armenian \nhistory. Kirk Kerkorian, an immensely successful Armenian American \nbusinessman and philanthropist, has shaped Nevada's booming tourism \nindustry and created jobs with his investments on the Las Vegas Strip. \nKirk has also generously donated to organizations across the Nation and \nin Armenia through his charitable foundation, the Lincy Foundation, to \nsupport important causes such as public education, health care, and \ninfrastructure development. Another well-known Armenian American, the \nlate Jerry Tarkanian, will long be remembered in Nevada not only for \nhis success leading the University of Nevada, Las Vegas basketball \nteam, but also for his dedication to teaching young college athletes to \nbe better people and proudly represent their city.\n  I am proud that, for years, Nevada has officially recognized the \nArmenian genocide, and that Nevada continues to find ways to honor this \nstrong community and Armenian history. I am grateful for the efforts of \nthe Armenian American Cultural Society of Las Vegas, which raised \nthousands of dollars for an Armenian Genocide Monument at Sunset Park \nin Las Vegas, Nevada. The monument will represent the 12 provinces \nwhere Armenians were slaughtered during the genocide, and will provide \nNevadans with a place for reflection for years to come.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th anniversary \nof the Armenian genocide.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire carried out genocide \nagainst the Armenian people. Over the course of 8 years, more than 1.5 \nmillion Armenians were marched to their deaths in the deserts of the \nMiddle East, murdered in concentration camps, drowned at sea, and \nforced to endure unimaginable acts of brutality.\n  Over the years, this deliberate massacre of the Armenians has been \nwell-documented and confirmed by scholars and experts. And there are \ncountless testimonies from victims who lived to tell of their harrowing \nexperiences.\n  In his memoirs, Henry Morgenthau, the American Ambassador to the \nOttoman Empire between 1913 and 1916, wrote: ``When the Turkish \nauthorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely \ngiving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, \nand in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to \nconceal the fact.''\n  Despite an irrefutable body of evidence, the U.S. Government has \nrefused to call the deliberate massacre of the Armenians by its \nrightful name. Mr. President, 100 years have passed since the beginning \nof the Armenian genocide. It is long past time for our government to \nfinally acknowledge one of the greatest atrocities of the 20th century \nfor what it was--genocide.\n  This year, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of a Senate \nresolution calling on the President to ``ensure that the foreign policy \nof the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity \nconcerning issues related to human rights, crimes against humanity, \nethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the United States record \nrelating to the Armenian Genocide.''\n  But each day that goes by without full acknowledgement by the United \nStates prolongs the pain felt by the descendants of the victims of the \nArmenian genocide, as well as the entire Armenian community.\n  By affirming the Armenian genocide, the United States would join \ncountries across the globe--including Argentina, Canada, France, Italy, \nPoland, Russia, Switzerland, and Venezuela--as well as the Holy See and \n43 U.S. States in standing on the right side of history.\n  For years, I have urged both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations to finally acknowledge the truth of the Armenian \ngenocide. Today, I reiterate my call and I hope that this year the \nUnited States will finally correct this century-old injustice.\n  During a recent mass commemorating the 100th anniversary of the \nArmenian genocide, Pope Francis said:\n\n       It is necessary, and indeed a duty, to honour their memory, \n     for whenever memory fades, it means that evil allows wounds \n     to fester. Concealing or denying evil is like allowing a \n     wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it!\n\n  On this April 24, as we take time to remember and honor the victims \nof the Armenian genocide, I hope the United States will heed the \neloquent words of Pope Francis by formally and unequivocally affirming \nthe incontestable fact of the Armenian genocide.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to solemnly observe the 100th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide.\n  One hundred years ago, one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th \nCentury began when the young Turk leaders of the Ottoman Empire \nexecuted more than 200 Armenian leaders and intellectuals. What \nfollowed was an 8-year systematic campaign of oppression, which by \n1923, left an estimated 1.5 million Armenians dead and over a half a \nmillion survivors exiled.\n  These atrocities affected the lives of every Armenian living in Asia \nMinor and, indeed, across the globe, and many called for the United \nStates to take action. The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire during \nthis dark time, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., unsuccessfully pleaded with \nPresident Wilson to take action, and later remembered the events of the \ngenocide, saying:\n\n       I am confident that the whole history of the human race \n     contains no such horrible episode as this. The great \n     massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost \n     insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian \n     race in 1915.\n\n  Former President Theodore Roosevelt also called for an American \nresponse, saying, ``Until we put honor and duty first, and are willing \nto risk something in order to achieve righteousness both for ourselves \nand for others, we shall accomplish nothing; and we shall earn and \ndeserve the contempt of the strong nations of mankind.''\n  Unfortunately, the United States and the world did not intervene. It \nis a testament to the unbreakable spirit of the survivors of the \nArmenian genocide that they persevered and went on to enrich their \ncountries of emigration, including the United States. That is why today \nwe not only commemorate this grave tragedy, but we celebrate the \ntraditions, the contributions, as well as the bright future of the \nArmenian people. Indeed, my home State of Rhode Island continues to be \nenriched by our strong and vibrant Armenian-American community.\n  Denial of this history is inconsistent with our country's values and \nas we mark this centennial, I once again join with my colleagues on a \nresolution that encourages the United States to recognize the Armenian \ngenocide. We must continue to guard against hatred and oppression so \nthat we can prevent such crimes against humanity. I would\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\nnote that, earlier this month, Pope Francis held a mass to recognize \nthis centennial and described this mass atrocity against Armenians as \nthe first genocide of the 20th century. On this, the 100th anniversary, \nthe United States should similarly recognize this horrific tragedy as \ngenocide, joining the ranks of the many countries that have already \ndone so.\n  I remain committed to supporting efforts, as ranking member on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and as a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, to provide assistance to Armenia to promote \neconomic growth, strengthen security, and support democratic reforms \nand development.\n  I am pleased that on May 7, at my invitation, His Holiness Aram I, \nCatholicos of the Worldwide Armenian Apostolic Church and the Great \nHouse of Cilicia, will serve as guest Chaplain before this body and \ncontinue this important message. We must find a way to come together to \nrecognize what happened a century ago and show our unwavering support \nto those facing persecution today. I hope we can do that.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate and reflect on \nthe centennial anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide. \nWith great sadness, we remember the beginning of the genocide of 1.5 \nmillion Armenians, Assyrians, and Greeks who died 100 years ago. On \nApril 24, 1915, the campaign targeting the Armenian people began. They, \nalong with Assyrians and Greeks, were viewed as threats to the Ottoman \nEmpire and driven from their homeland. The persecuted minorities were \nuprooted from their way of life leaving behind generations of family \nhistory, property, and memories. The Armenians were then force-marched \ninto the desert without proper rations and supplies, with most dying \nalong this brutal passage. The remaining survivors were detained in \nconcentration camps rampant with disease and hunger. These mass \nkillings are historically documented and served as a tragic prelude to \nthe Holocaust.\n  This solemn anniversary offers us a chance to renew our commitment to \nthe principle of ``never again,'' a vow that surfaced after the \nHolocaust. And so today I rise to proclaim never again can an ethnic \ngroup be targeted due to race, religion, or ethnicity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2394-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2394-S2395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BANGLADESH RANA PLAZA ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, April 24 marks the 2-year anniversary of \nthe Rana Plaza building collapse which resulted in the death of over \n1,130 Bangladeshi workers and the injury of approximately 2,500 more. \nTo date, this remains the single largest disaster of its kind. Since \n2013, many in the governmental, nongovernmental, private, and business \nsectors have pledged their financial resources and time to addressing \nthe numerous issues and problems surrounding the ready-made garment \nindustry. Even though progress has been made, many promises remain \nunfulfilled, especially in providing Bangladeshi workers the rights \nthey deserve.\n  As a long-term U.S. ally, I want Bangladesh to be prosperous because \nonly through a growing economy that delivers shared prosperity to its \npeople can stability be ensured.\n  The country's garment industry is now, and will be for the \nforeseeable future, the engine of economic growth as it accounts for \nclose to 80 percent of foreign exchange earnings. The United States, \nwhich remains the single largest country buyer of Bangladeshi garments, \nhas an important responsibility to ensure that those garments are made \nin a way that do not put people's lives at risk and that fairly rewards \nworkers for their labor.\n  Domestically, while there has been progress in conducting safety \ninspections and hiring additional inspectors, much work remains in \nproviding for freedom of association. On this front, I have been very \ndisappointed by the role played by the government of Bangladesh. The \nrecord over the past 2 years shows that the Bangladeshi government has \nfailed to keep promises it made to our Government and to the European \nUnion.\n  It has failed to pass a labor law in line with international labor \nstandards and has not promulgated implementing regulations for the law \nthat exists.\n  Workers still have no rights to form unions in Export Processing \nZones and once again the government is saying it has no power to change \nregulations because of contractual obligations to companies.\n  The government of Bangladesh has made little progress with regard to \nthe inspection of well over a thousand factories that it agreed to \ninspect for fire safety.\n  The government of Bangladesh personnel responsible for investigating \nunfair labor practices are not doing so and some police have refused to \naccept cases filed by labor organizers who experience violence from \nmanagement-hired thugs. Such antiunion behavior on the part of \nemployers is common throughout many developing countries but in the \ncase of Bangladesh, it is compounded by the government's actions which \nactively abet such behavior. For that, the government of Bangladesh \nmust be held responsible.\n  There needs to be a clear, consistent and transparent union \nregistration process. While approximately 300 factory-level garment \nunions have been registered in the last 2 years, more than 100 unions \nthat filed for registration have been rejected by the government, many \nfor arbitrary or unfair reasons.\n  The people of Bangladesh need mechanisms where workers can swiftly \nget the justice they deserve when their rights are violated. \nBangladeshi authorities need to properly investigate, address and, if \nnecessary, penalize employers for unfair labor practices to end the \nculture of impunity that surrounds employer resistance to legally \nprotected union activity.\n  So as my colleagues can see, much work remains.\n  Until substantial progress is made, the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative has rightfully decided to keep in place the suspension \nof Bangladesh's Generalized System of Preferences--GSP--trade benefits \nwith the United States. I support this decision.\n  The ``Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh'' and the \n``Alliance on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh'' are two private \nsector initiatives made up of American and European retailers which \nhave conducted safety inspections in more than 2,500 factories. As a \nresult, some factories have adopted new safety practices and have made \nphysical improvements such as the installation of fire doors to make it \nsafer for workers to evacuate when fires occur. These inspections have \nresulted in the full or partial shutdown of a number of unsafe \nfactories. The private sector has a critical role to play in changing \nthe RMG culture in Bangladesh and I strongly urge both coalitions to \nfocus on how workers' rights can be improved in the coming years.\n  Aside from ensuring that improvements are made to prevent another \nRana Plaza, it is critical that full compensation is paid to the \nvictims and their families. As of today, the ``Rana Plaza Donors Trust \nFund'' has received roughly $21 million from a variety of donors, \nincluding both large global brands and the Bangladeshi Prime Minister's \nFund. While $21 million sounds impressive, the fund is suffering from \nan approximate $9 million shortfall. Because of this, some victims and \ntheir families have only received approximately 70 percent of the money \nthey are entitled to. I am happy to hear that Benetton has recently \nagreed to donate to the Fund. I hope that other companies that had \nbusiness at Rana Plaza come forward and contribute, or continue \ncontributing, their fair share.\n  It is encouraging to see different elements of the international \ncommunity come together to support the garment factory workers in \nBangladesh. Real progress in the RMG sector will require continued \nvigilance on the part of the international community. Earlier this \nyear, we were once again saddened by the news of yet another tragedy \ninvolving the collapse of a building in Bangladesh. On March 12, in the \ntown of Mongla, a cement factory collapsed and tragically killed eight \npeople while injuring approximately 60 others. Whether in a garment \nfactory or cement factory, we must remain vigilant to ensure that \nworkers' safety and workers' rights are top priorities of the U.S. \ngovernment and international buyers in Bangladesh.\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2395-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          REFUGEE AND MIGRANT DEATHS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss an enormous human \ntragedy: another boat carrying desperate refugees and migrants capsized \nin the Mediterranean Sea and, in this most recent instance, over 850 \nmen, women, and children have died. It is profoundly heartwrenching to \nview the anguished images of innocent refugees and migrants, men and \nwomen, old and young, who embarked on this desperate journey bound for \na more hopeful future, but which instead ended in death on the \nMediterranean Sea for so many people.\n  In 2014, we know that well over 218,000 refugees and migrants crossed \nthe Mediterranean Sea, many fleeing violence, conflict, and persecution \nin Syria, Iraq, Eritrea and elsewhere, traveling on overcrowded and \nunseaworthy boats. Last year, over 3,500 women, men, and children died \nor went missing in their desperate attempts to reach Europe. According \nto the International Organization on Migration, IOM, this year's death \ntoll in the Mediterranean Sea is believed to have surpassed 1,750 \nvictims already--a drastic spike when compared to the same period last \nyear. During the first 3 weeks of April alone, more than 11,000 people \nhave been rescued.\n  This is a journey of unimaginable peril, and only the most despairing \nfamilies with nothing to lose would sacrifice their lives in the hopes \nthat this voyage will deliver an escape from misery. From Syria to \nIraq, from South Sudan to Yemen, multiplying conflicts, gross human \nrights violations, statelessness, the effects of climate change, and \nfood and water insecurity are all contributing to millions of people \nbeing forced from their homes in search of safety and survival.\n  The international community is witnessing the enormous costs of \nunending wars and the failure to resolve or prevent conflict. The \nnumber of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people \nworldwide has, for the first time in the post-World War II era, \nexceeded 50 million people, according to the United Nations High \nCommission on Refugees, UNHCR.\n  This massive increase is largely driven by the war in Syria, which is \nnow in its fifth year. The Assad regime's ruthless attacks on Syrian \ncivilians--compounded by horrific violence by armed extremists--has led \nto Syria's disintegration and massive internal and external \ndisplacement of its people.\n  Europe, facing conflicts to its south in Libya, east in Ukraine, and \nsoutheast in Syria, Iraq and the Horn of Africa, is currently seeing \nthe largest numbers of refugees and migrants arriving by boat across \nthe Mediterranean. To confront this enormous challenge, European \nCouncil President Donald Tusk called on member states on Monday, April \n20, to meet their funding commitments for Trident, the European \nUnion's, EU, naval operation in the Mediterranean. EU leaders also \nagreed to meet on Thursday, April 23, to consider increasing resources \nfor rescue operations and the 10-point action plan on migration \nproposed by the Joint Foreign Affairs and Home Council.\n  The proposed plan would alleviate pressure on the member states \nreceiving the majority of those rescued and also aims to combat \ntrafficking and smuggling.\n  The EU's proposed 10-point plan is an important first step, but a \nbold and comprehensive response is urgently needed. First, rescue at \nsea is and should be the top priority. It is a moral imperative based \non European values, as well as a fundamental principle of maritime law. \nA robust search and rescue operation, comparable to Mare Nostrum, that \nfocuses on saving lives must be reinstated. While the reinforcement of \nthe Joint Operations in the Mediterranean is welcomed, border \nsurveillance operations are not an answer to this crisis.\n  Second, there needs to be a credible and firm commitment from \ncountries both in Europe and across the globe to resettle significant \nnumbers of refugees. Moreover, efforts to encourage legal alternatives \nto such dangerous voyages must be pursued. These include enhanced \nfamily reunification, private sponsorship programs, and study and labor \nmigration programs for people in need of international protection.\n  Finally, I urge the U.S. Government to provide robust assistance, and \nto work closely with our European partners, so that we might all rise \nto the demands presented by this humanitarian crisis and commit to the \nmeasures needed to prevent tragedies such as the drowning deaths of 850 \nmen, women, and children off the coast of Libya this past weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2395-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2395-S2396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL MINORITY HEALTH MONTH\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing April as National Minority Health Month. 2015 marks the \n30th anniversary of this event, which provides us with an opportunity \nto celebrate the progress we have made in addressing minority health \nissues and health disparities in our country and to renew our \ncommitment to continue this critically important work.\n  Minorities now make up more than 35 percent of the American \npopulation and that number is expected to rise in the future. However, \nstudy after study has shown that minorities, especially African \nAmericans and Latinos, continue to face significant health disparities \nin diseases such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, and asthma.\n  Currently, over 26 million Americans suffer from diabetes. But \nAfrican Americans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with, and to die \nfrom, diabetes compared to non-Hispanic whites. African Americans are \nalso more than 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to suffer from diabetes-related \nend-stage renal disease than non-Hispanic whites, and are more likely \nto have other complications, such as lower extremity amputations.\n  Obesity, which increases the risk of developing diabetes, is also \nmore prevalent in minority communities. Nearly 4 out of 5 African-\nAmerican women are overweight or obese, as well as 78 percent of \nHispanic men. It is no coincidence that, nationwide, 27.2 percent of \nAfrican Americans and 23.5 percent of Latinos lived below the Federal \npoverty line in 2013. Limited means and the lack of access to fresh \nfruits and vegetables in ``food deserts'' prevent many people from \naccessing the nutrition they need to lead healthy lives.\n  Those living in impoverished areas are also much more likely to be \nexposed to polluted air, which exacerbates respiratory conditions like \nasthma. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, in \n2012, African Americans were 20 percent more likely to have asthma \nversus non-Hispanic whites.\n  HIV and AIDS, which are especially prevalent in low-income \nneighborhoods with widespread drug use, continue to devastate \nminorities across the country. African American women are 23 times more \nlikely to have AIDS than their white counterparts and Hispanic women \nare four times more likely to be infected. In Maryland, African \nAmericans are diagnosed with HIV at more than 10 times the rate of \nwhite Marylanders.\n  The role that access to resources, proper nutrition, and clean air \nplays in our well-being cannot be overstated. According to a 2012 \nreport about Baltimore neighborhoods from the Joint Center for \nPolitical and Economic Studies, those living in higher-income parts of \nthe city live, on average, nearly 30 years longer than their neighbors \nin impoverished areas.\n  Fortunately, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, ACA, we have recently \nmade health coverage more accessible and affordable than it has been in \ndecades. By reducing the number of uninsured Americans across the \ncountry, the ACA is working to address health inequalities. Between \n2013 and 2014, the percentage of uninsured Latinos dropped by 7.7 \npercent, and the percentage of uninsured African Americans fell by 6.8 \npercent.\n  Also, as a result of the ACA, increased funding is available for \ncommunity health clinics. Mr. President, 300,000 Marylanders, including \nmore than 140,000 African Americans and 38,000 Latinos, are served by \nthese clinics.\n  Under the ACA, preventive services, which are critical to the early \ndetection and treatment of many diseases that disproportionately affect \nminorities, are now free for 76 million Americans, including 1.5 \nmillion Marylanders.\n  In 2011, African American women in Maryland died from cervical cancer \nat\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nnearly twice the rate of white women. This disparity is simply \nunacceptable and illustrates the importance of access to preventive \nhealth care services: cervical cancer is preventable through regular \nscreening tests and follow-up and, when detected and treated early, it \nis highly curable.\n  In our country, we are incredibly fortunate to have the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, which works tirelessly to improve the health \nof all Americans, and the NIH's National Institute for Minority Health \n& Health Disparities, NIMHD, has the specific mission of addressing \nminority health issues and eliminating health disparities. I am proud \nof my role in the establishment of the NIMHD, which supports \ngroundbreaking research at universities and medical institutions across \nour country.\n  This critically important work ranges from enhancing our \nunderstanding of the basic biological processes associated with health \ndisparities to applied, clinical, and translational research and \ninterventions that seek to address those disparities.\n  Some examples of recent NIMHD-funded projects include exploring \nracial disparities in sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS, to inform \nhealth education interventions about safe infant sleep practices, which \nhistorically have been shown to be less effective among African \nAmericans; evaluating a community-based intervention to promote follow-\nup among uninsured minority women with abnormal breast or cervical \ncancer screening results; and developing a culturally tailored \nlifestyle intervention to prevent diabetes among African American and \nHispanic adults.\n  Enhancing our understanding of the complex disparities across racial, \nethnic, and other minority populations and their specific risk factors \nwill help us develop better preventive health care, reduce long-term \nhealth care costs, and improve the quality of life for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Minority health disparities cost many of our constituents their \nhealth and even their lives, and they cost our health care system and \neconomy, as well. A 2009 joint center study found that direct medical \ncosts resulting from health inequities among minorities totaled nearly \n$230 billion between 2003 and 2006. With indirect costs such as lowered \nwork productivity and lost tax revenue added to the equation, the tab \namounts to more than $1.24 trillion.\n  We owe it to our constituents to do everything in our power to fight \nfor affordable, high-quality health care for everyone. One's ethnic or \nracial background should never determine the quality of his or her \nhealth or the length of his or her life. This month, let us renew our \ncommitment to ensuring access to affordable, high-quality health care \nfor all Americans, and pledge to do everything we can to eliminate \nhealth disparities in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2396-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROSE BAUMANN\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my chief of \nstaff, Rose Baumann, and to pay tribute to her hard work on behalf of \nthe people of Minnesota as a member of my staff for the past 9 years.\n  For anyone who has met Rose, it will come as no surprise to you that \nRose went from being a junior staffer in my office in 2006 just after \ngraduating from Gustavus Adolphus College to my chief of staff just 7 \nyears later. For the first 4 of those 7 years, Rose handled health care \nissues first as an outreach director in the Twin Cities and then as a \nlegislative assistant in Washington. Rose approached every challenge \nwith dedication and grace, regardless of whether she was helping a \nconstituent access their Medicare benefits or talking with Minnesota \nphysicians about health care reform proposals or organizing and \nexecuting a health care summit. Rose's intelligence, strong Minnesota \nwork ethic, tenacity, and optimism always seemed to ensure success.\n  During the health reform debate, Rose played a critical role in \nhelping me highlight cost-saving health care delivery models like the \nMayo Clinic uses and worked to ensure we reward quality, not quantity, \nof care. She worked tirelessly to advocate for Minnesota's hospitals, \nproviders, patients, and industries, and that hard work is reflected \ntoday as we watch these policies being implemented.\n  As my legislative director for 3 years, Rose advanced my legislative \nagenda while successfully managing 12 people and every policy area. My \nwork on consumer safety, transportation, international adoptions, \nprotection of our natural resources and cutting redtape at our Federal \nagencies all became law under Rose's leadership. Her natural ability, \norganization, and plain old hard work ensured that my legislative ideas \nbecame reality, while crucial events such as the confirmation hearing \nfor Justice Elena Kagan were a success.\n  Rose has been a remarkable chief of staff. She is a natural leader \nwho quickly adapts to any situation, no matter how large or small. Her \nenthusiasm has been a motivating force in my office, and her compassion \ntoward the people of Minnesota and understanding of the problems they \nface has been instrumental to my ability to serve them in the Senate.\n  Rose Baumann--a proud native of St. Louis Park, MN--will soon begin a \nnew professional adventure with new challenges, and I have no doubt \nthat she will succeed. She is also getting married later this year, and \nI am so happy to see her so excited about this new phase of her life.\n  Mr. President, I hope you will join me as I say thank you to Rose \nBaumann for her 9 remarkable years of service to my office, the Senate, \nthe people of the State of Minnesota, and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2396-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2396-S2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TENNESSEE NISSAN STORY\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of my remarks at the Nissan plant in \nSmyrna, Tennessee earlier this week.\n\n\n                         TENNESSEE NISSAN STORY\n\n       Thank you Randy, Gov. Haslam, Mr. Martin, ladies and \n     gentlemen of Nissan.\n       When Randy invited me, he suggested I tell a little history \n     of the Tennessee Nissan story in 5 minutes. And I am \n     delighted to have that opportunity, and I would like to do it \n     by putting a few human faces on the story that is usually \n     told in cars and trucks and dollars and cents. And the best \n     face is the one that Randy told me of his mother.\n       I remember sitting up with her one night and the boys had \n     gone to their rooms, and she said to me she was sad. And I \n     said, ``Why would you be sad?'' She said, ``Because I've got \n     smart boys and they will never find a job around here, and I \n     will never see my grandchildren.'' Well as Randy said, two \n     years later, here came Nissan.\n       There were many faces that had to do with the history of \n     this company in the last 35 years. One was President Jimmy \n     Carter. Two months after I was elected, I was at a White \n     House dinner, and he said, ``Governors, go to Japan. Persuade \n     the Japanese to make in the United States what they sell in \n     the United States.'' And at that time, Nissan made no cars \n     and trucks in the United States, and Tennessee had almost no \n     auto jobs.\n       So I took a photograph of the United States at night, taken \n     at night from a satellite, to see Mr. Kawamata, the Chairman \n     of Nissan. I showed it to him. He said exactly where is \n     Tennessee? I said right in the middle of the lights, which is \n     where you want to be if you're building a plant with lots of \n     heavy things that you want to ship around the country.\n       I thought Tennessee and Japan were a perfect match. They \n     had no cars here, and we had almost no auto jobs here.\n       In Detroit in 1980 at the Republican Convention, the \n     country was in a recession. Everybody was gloomy. As I looked \n     around at all the gloomy faces, I said, ``You guys have so \n     much more money than we do. You've got higher teacher \n     salaries. You've got better universities. You have all these \n     things because you've got the auto industry.''\n       So I skipped a meeting with Ronald Reagan, came home to \n     meet with Takashi Ishihara, the CEO of Nissan. He was a big \n     bluff chief executive. He knew exactly the depth of the lock \n     in Dickson County. And he knew he wanted 400 acres in \n     Rutherford County, where the McClary's had a farm. So one of \n     the faces of Nissan was sitting on the back porch with the \n     McClary family, they were in their 70's, and persuading them \n     to sell their farm to Nissan and then Mr. Ishihara wanted to \n     get the next 400 acres, which was owned by Maymee Cantrell. \n     She wouldn't sell because she promised her tenant farmer that \n     he could live there for his whole life. And she said, ``I am \n     a woman of my word.'' We found 400 acres in Williamson County \n     for her tenant farmer to live on, so Maymee could be a woman \n     of her word and Mr. Ishihara got 800 acres, which you have \n     about filled up, 35 years later.\n       The faces of Nissan include Marvin Runyon and the Ford team \n     that came from Detroit to a different part of the country to \n     start from scratch in a new environment. They knew they \n     didn't have another advantage. That every state north of \n     Tennessee did not have a Right To Work law, and if they could\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\n     work in the environment in which they could be competitive.\n       The faces of Nissan include the 300 Middle Tennesseans, who \n     never once built a car who went to Japan and spent several \n     weeks learning to build cars the Nissan way. It includes the \n     governors, the local officials, and the legislatures who for \n     35 years, whether Republican or Democrat, have kept a \n     consistent level of support for an environment that permits \n     the workers of Nissan to produce quality products. It \n     includes the faces of employees at places like Calsonic which \n     was the first tier-one supplier, but now there are hundreds \n     of them in 80 counties across this state, the wealth of \n     Nissan, the family incomes, don't just belong in Middle \n     Tennessee.\n       And, more than anything else, it includes the men and women \n     of Nissan. It includes you. Those of you who proved early on \n     that Tennesseans could not only build cars and trucks as of a \n     high quality as those in Japan, but could build them better \n     and produce the most efficient auto plant anywhere in North \n     America.\n       So, look at those 35 years. Look at how Nissan has \n     transformed Tennessee. Tennessee had almost no auto jobs. \n     Today, one-third of its jobs in manufacturing are auto jobs. \n     Then, Tennessee was the third poorest state. Today, \n     Tennessee's family incomes have grown rapidly. Then, Nissan \n     made no cars and trucks in the United States. Today, 85% of \n     what it sells in the United States, it makes in North \n     America.\n       But, the real story of Nissan and its transformation of \n     Tennessee is the story of the faces of Nissan.\n       There's no better or more memorable face for me than the \n     face of Lillian, sitting there late one evening in Melton 37 \n     years ago saying that she was afraid that her boys who were \n     talented would never have a chance to get a job around here, \n     and she would never be able to see her grandchildren.\n       Think how proud she would be today.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2397-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STEVE PITTS\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Steve \nPitts on his retirement after over 35 years of service to the Reno \nPolice Department. It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years of \nhard work and dedication to creating a safe environment in the local \nReno community.\n  Mr. Pitts stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted his \nlife to serving his State. He earned his bachelor's degree in \norganizational studies from California State University, Long Beach, \nand later pursued his master's in public administration from Golden \nGate University. He is also a graduate of the National Academy at the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, the Leadership Program at the Center \nfor Public Leadership at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at \nHarvard University, and the Naval Postgraduate School Homeland Security \nProgram. His career in police services began in the early 1980s, \nbuilding all the way to the top of the department in 2011. Mr. Pitts \ndedicated his work to major case and homicide investigations, emergency \nmanagement, and crisis intervention. He also built upon his skills in \nspecial weapons and tactics over a span of 25 years, as well as gained \ncommand-level experience for over 15 years of his career. His \nunwavering work ethic is commendable, and his undeniable concern for \nthe Reno community is greatly respected.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Pitts was promoted to deputy chief in January \nof 2008. He then served as interim police chief from March 2010 until \nMarch 2011, at which point he accepted the permanent position of police \nchief. As the leading voice of the police department, Mr. Pitts \nemphasized the importance of moving the organization toward what best \nbenefitted the community. His positive legacy will be felt for years to \ncome.\n  It is the brave men and women who serve in the local police \ndepartment who keep our communities safe. These heroes selflessly put \ntheir lives on the line every day. I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. \nPitts for his courageous contributions to the people of Reno and to the \nSilver State. His sacrifice and courage earn him a place among the \noutstanding men and women who have valiantly put their lives on the \nline to benefit others.\n  Mr. Pitts has demonstrated professionalism, commitment to excellence, \nand dedication to the highest standards of the Reno Police Department. \nI am both humbled and honored by his service and am proud to call him a \nfellow Nevadan. Today I ask all of my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Mr. Pitts on his retirement, and I give my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada a safer place. I \noffer him my best wishes for many successful and fulfilling years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2397-2", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING WESTCARE FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize WestCare \nFoundation, WestCare, for its commitment to providing important \nservices to Nevadans across the State and specifically for its \ndedication to our veterans, military servicemembers, and their \nfamilies. WestCare offers programs to help with substance use \ndisorders, mental health disorders, domestic violence, sexual assault, \nhomelessness, criminal justice, and HIV and AIDS, and provides \nadditional youth and veteran-specific programs. The foundation is \nlocated throughout the State, including campuses in Las Vegas and \nPahrump, as well as centers offering specific services in Reno and Las \nVegas. Its commitment to improving lives across Nevada does not go \nwithout notice.\n  WestCare's veteran programs include assistance in transitional living \nand case management and offer support to veterans' and active military \nmembers' families. The foundation recognizes the increasing diversity \nof our veteran population and works to accommodate this change. The \ntransitional living program provides separate facilities for both male \nand female veterans, as well as for their children. As our Nation's \nmilitary continues to adapt to a new force, it is particularly \nimportant services offered also adapt to reflect these changes. There \nare countless distinguished women veterans who have made sacrifices \nbeyond measure and deserve nothing but the best treatment and services \nthat address specific female needs. I commend WestCare for its \ncommitment in accommodating all veterans and their individual needs.\n  WestCare also helps the families of those who have so bravely \ndefended our freedoms. All too often, returning veterans and their \nfamilies struggle with financial uncertainty. The foundation is a \npositive light in the Nevada community, working to change this reality \nby providing families with supportive services in times of need. \nWestcare stands as a shining example of an organization that has gone \nabove and beyond to positively impact the lives of our heroes. It is \nimportant we thank not only the brave men and women that protect our \nfreedom but also their families making so many sacrifices.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I know the \nstruggles that our veterans face after returning home from the \nbattlefield. Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these \nbrave individuals but also to ensure they receive the quality care they \nhave earned and deserve. I remain committed to upholding this promise \nfor our veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the \nNation. I am very pleased that veterans service foundations, like \nWestCare, are committed to ensuring the needs of our veterans are met.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nWestCare Foundation, an organization with a mission that is both noble \nand charitable. I am humbled and honored to recognize WestCare for its \ntireless efforts in helping our veteran community, and I wish it the \nbest of luck in all of its future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2397-3", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2397-S2398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS 125th ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to pay special \ntribute to the General Federation of Women's Clubs. This year is very \nspecial as they celebrate their 125th anniversary tomorrow, April 24.\n  The General Federation of Women's Clubs is an international women's \norganization dedicated to community improvement by enhancing the lives \nof others through volunteer service. It was founded in 1890 when Jane \nCunningham Croly, a professional journalist, attempted to attend a \ndinner in New York City honoring British novelist Charles Dickens. \nCroly was denied admittance based on her gender. In response, she \nformed a woman's club for the purpose of educating women. In 1889, Jane \nCroly invited women's clubs throughout the United States to pursue the \ncause of a federation by attending a national convention. On April 24,\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n1890, 63 clubs officially formed the General Federation of Women's \nClubs.\n  I am very proud to recognize a third-generation clubwoman, Babs J. \nCondon from Westminster, MD, as the 2014-2016 International President \nof the General Federation of Women's Clubs. And, I am very pleased that \nthe 2016 international convention will be held in Baltimore next June. \nFor the record, there are 34 clubs in Maryland and almost 1,500 club \nmembers statewide.\n  By ``Living the Volunteer Spirit'', clubwomen transform lives each \nday, not simply with monetary donations, but with hands-on, tangible \nprojects that provide immediate impact. With nearly 90,000 members in \naffiliated clubs in every State, the District of Columbia, and more \nthan a dozen countries, GFWC members work in their own communities to \nsupport the arts, preserve natural resources, advance education, \npromote healthy lifestyles, encourage civic engagement, and support \ninternational efforts to feed the hungry, encourage immunizations and \nimpact other lifesaving and economic development initiatives.\n  GFWC history includes many powerful examples such as advocacy for \nchild labor laws, promotion of nationwide outreach that led to passage \nof the Pure Food and Drug Act, and working to pass the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  GFWC has been instrumental in shaping our Nation. As it celebrates a \nhistory of 125 years, let's hope they continue to build upon their \ntraditions and pave the way for a future filled with even greater \nsuccess through volunteerism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2398-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FORREST COLE\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to \nthe forthcoming retirement of U.S. Forest Service official Forrest \nCole, who for the past 12 years has served as the supervisor of the \nNation's largest National Forest, and probably unfortunately its most \ncontroversial one, the 16.9-million acre Tongass National Forest in \nsoutheast Alaska.\n  Mr. Cole, a four-decade employee of the U.S. Forest Service, began \nhis career, following receipt of a bachelor of science degree in \nforestry from Northern Arizona University, working on fire-related jobs \nin Arizona forests. In 1979 he began what he thought at the time would \nbe a 2-year posting working in the Tongass forest in southeast Alaska, \na forest that covers an area just slightly larger than the State of \nWest Virginia. The Coles, however, found the beauty, wildlife, and \nresources of southeast Alaska too attractive to leave, and the family \nstayed. Over the past 36 years, Mr. Cole has served as the presale \nforester and small sales forester on the Petersburg Ranger District in \nthe central Tongass; as timber management assistant on the Juneau/\nYakutat Ranger Districts in the northern Tongass; as the timber \nminerals, special uses management assistant on the Juneau Ranger \nDistrict; as the timber and fire management staff officer and resources \nstaff officer on the Stikine administrative area, and later as the \nForest and Fire Management staff officer for the entire Tongass \nNational Forest based in the southern Tongass in Ketchikan.\n  Mr. Cole also served in the regional office as director of forest \nmanagement, and as part of the planning team for the Tongass land \nmanagement plan, with responsibility for the timber, vegetation, and \nsubsistence programs in all of southeast Alaska--the land plan being \nthe key document that guides all activities in the forest. In 2003 he \nwas named as the forest supervisor for the Tongass, a key supervisory \npost, second only to the Regional Forester.\n  Mr. Cole during his years in Alaska has been in the midst of many \ncontroversial issues such as of how much timber should be allowed for \nharvest; how to protect wolves and goshawks, bald eagles, salmon and \nbear while harvesting timber; and how to provide the recreation that \nAmericans increasingly demand. Mr. Cole arrived in Alaska the year \nbefore Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct, ANILCA, that cut the allowable timber harvest in the Tongass by \nseveral hundred percent, from 1.35 billion board feet a year--a level \nthat was considered its biological, sustainable yield level when modern \ntimber harvesting began in the 1950s--to 450 million board feet that \nmandated by Congress in 1980. A decade later he was involved in \nimplementing the next Tongass timber ``reform'' bill that once again \nnearly cut the forest's allowable timber forest in half, creating \nanother six areas of wilderness, and designating another 12 new areas \nas congressionally protected lands, bringing to 6.48 million acres the \namount of the Tongass protected from development.\n  As forest supervisor, Mr. Cole was required to implement the national \nInventoried Roadless Area rule last decade that took another 9.5 \nmillion acres of the Tongass out of the timber base. And just this \nyear, with passage last December of the Sealaska Native Corporation \nfinal land conveyance act, Mr. Cole has started the process of revising \nwhat lands will remain in the region's slimming federal timber base. He \nhas had to wrestle with how to guide the timber industry's survival \ngiven that only 1.8 percent of the Tongass is still ``open'' to the \nharvesting of older-growth trees--80 percent of them having been \npermanently protected, and how to manage guiding, recreation, tourism, \nutility and infrastructure access and development in a forest that \nstretches 500 miles from near Ketchikan to Yakutat.\n  More than any other individual Mr. Cole has been a referee between \nmany forces. And I know it can't have been a pleasant experience \nimplementing policy set by Congress and the executive branch, more than \n3,000 miles away. It has been a hard, often thankless job managing the \nTongass. I wish to publicly thank Mr. Cole for his tireless service to \nAmerica in doing that job well. We have not always agreed, but I truly \nappreciate that he has labored long and hard to be fair. He has \nlistened to all sides. Given the legal, political and budgetary \nmandates he has faced, he deserves all of our thanks for all of the \ndifficult phone calls he has returned, all of the complaints he has \npatiently fielded, and for all of the tough decisions he has been \nforced to make. It is no wonder that Mr. Cole was the recipient of the \n2008 Regional Forester Award. He deserves the gratitude of the entire \nSenate for doing his best to meet all of the competing demands \nAmericans make of our national forests. And I personally thank him for \nhis contributions and commitment to public land stewardship, community \nstability and for keeping the public's trust in one of America's most \nhotly contested regions.

A bill to amend titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security \nAct and title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act to improve \ncoverage for colorectal screening tests under Medicare and private \nhealth insurance coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Supporting \nColorectal Examination and Education Now, SCREEN, Act. This legislation \npromotes access to colorectal cancer screenings in an effort to help \nprevent colorectal cancer and save lives.\n  Colorectal cancer affects far too many Americans. The American Cancer \nSociety, ACS, estimates that 1 in 18 Americans will be diagnosed with \ncolorectal cancer in 2015, totaling an estimated 133,000 new cases. \nColorectal cancer is expected to take the lives of nearly 50,000 \nAmericans in 2015, making it the second leading cause of cancer deaths \nin this country.\n  Fortunately, colorectal cancer is also highly preventable, and \ncolorectal cancer screening tests rank among the most effective \npreventive screenings available. Colonoscopy screenings are different \nfrom other types of preventive or screening services because pre-\ncancerous polyps found during a screening can be removed during the \nsame visit, before they progress to colorectal cancer. Early detection \nand intervention are key to preventing colon cancer. A 2012 study in \nthe New England Journal of Medicine found that removal of precancerous \npolyps during a screening colonoscopy may prevent up to 53 percent of \ncolorectal cancer deaths.\n  The need to address barriers to colorectal cancer screening, \nparticularly in the Medicare population, is clear. The Medicare \npopulation makes up approximately two-thirds of all new cases of \ncolorectal cancer. However, according to the Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Service, CMS, only about half of Medicare beneficiaries have \nhad a colorectal cancer screening test, and less than two-thirds of \nMedicare-aged adults are up to date with recommended screenings. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, American Cancer \nSociety, ACS, American College of Gastroenterology, ACG, and more than \n200 national, State and local organizations have committed to work \ntoward eliminating colorectal cancer through a national goal of \nscreening 80 percent of eligible adults in the United States for \ncolorectal cancer by 2018.\n  Currently, Medicare waives cost-sharing for colorectal cancer \nscreenings recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \nUSPSTF, including screening colonoscopies. However, if the doctor finds \nand removes a pre-cancerous polyp during a screening colonoscopy, the \nprocedure is no longer considered a ``screening'' by Medicare, and the \nbeneficiary is required to pay the Medicare coinsurance. Because it is \nimpossible to know in advance whether polyps will be found and removed \nduring a screening colonoscopy, Medicare beneficiaries do not know \nwhether the procedure will be fully covered until it is over. In \nFebruary 2013, the administration announced that private insurers \nparticipating in State-based health insurance exchanges are required to \nwaive all cost-sharing for screening colonoscopies during which a polyp \nis removed. Similarly, the SCREEN Act would waive Medicare's cost-\nsharing requirement for screening colonoscopies during which polyps are \nremoved in order to prevent the development of colorectal cancer. In \naddition, the SCREEN Act would waive cost-sharing for follow-up \ncolonoscopies necessary to complete the ``screening continuum'' \nfollowing a positive finding from another recommended colorectal cancer \nscreening test.\n  The SCREEN Act also seeks to improve coordination of care and promote \nother important age-based recommended screenings for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, such as Hepatitis C virus, HCV, screening, by creating a \ndemonstration project. The demonstration project would allow \nreimbursement for an office visit or consultation so that a Medicare \nbeneficiary may sit down and discuss the screening with a doctor prior \nto the colonoscopy procedure. According to the National Institutes of \nHealth, ``fear of the procedure itself'' is a barrier to increasing \ncolorectal cancer screening utilization rates. This pre-procedure visit \nwould allow providers to allay patient anxiety about the procedure, \naddress any questions related to the colonoscopy, assess the patient's \nfamily history and risk factors for developing colorectal cancer, and \neducate the patient about the importance of following the pre-procedure \ninstructions. In addition, this visit would provide an opportunity to \neducate Medicare beneficiaries about the importance of HCV screening. \nThe CDC and the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend \na one-time HCV screening for all individuals born between 1945 and \n1965, and a recent study suggests offering the HCV screening in \nconnection with colonoscopies may be an effective means of increasing \nHCV screening rates.\n  Finally, the SCREEN Act would provide incentives for Medicare \nproviders to participate in nationally recognized quality improvement \nregistries to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are receiving the \nquality screening they deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the SCREEN Act, in \norder to help prevent colorectal cancer and save lives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Budget neutrality.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     death among men and women combined in the United States.\n       (2) In 2015, more than 130,000 Americans will be diagnosed \n     with colorectal cancer, and nearly 50,000 Americans are \n     expected to die from it.\n       (3) Approximately 60 percent of colorectal cancer cases and \n     70 percent of colorectal cancer deaths occur in those aged 65 \n     and older.\n       (4) Colorectal cancer screening colonoscopies allow for the \n     detection and removal of polyps before they progress to \n     colorectal cancer, as well as early detection of colorectal \n     cancer when treatment can be most effective.\n       (5) According to a 2012 study published in the New England \n     Journal of Medicine, removing precancerous polyps through \n     colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer \n     deaths by 53 percent.\n       (6) Although colorectal cancer is highly preventable with \n     appropriate screening, one in three adults between the ages \n     of 50 and 75 years are not up to date with recommended \n     colorectal cancer screening.\n       (7) Over 200 organizations have committed to eliminating \n     colorectal cancer as a major health problem in the United \n     States and are working toward a shared goal of screening 80 \n     percent of eligible Americans by 2018.\n       (8) Hepatitis C is a liver disease that causes inflammation \n     of the liver and results from infection with the Hepatitis C \n     virus. Chronic Hepatitis C infection can lead to serious \n     health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis, and liver \n     cancer. It is the leading cause of liver transplants in the \n     United States.\n       (9) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), more than 75 percent of adults infected \n     with the Hepatitis C virus in the United States were born \n     between 1945 and 1965.\n       (10) The CDC estimates that up to 75 percent of individuals \n     with Hepatitis C do not know that they are infected.\n       (11) The CDC and the United States Preventive Services Task \n     Force (USPSTF) recommend a one-time screening for Hepatitis C \n     for all individuals born between 1945 and 1965.\n       (12) A recent study suggests that offering Hepatitis C \n     screening to patients in connection with screening \n     colonoscopies may be an effective means of increasing \n     Hepatitis C screening rates among individuals born between \n     1945 and 1965.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote transparency by permitting the Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board to allow its disciplinary \nproceedings to be open to the public, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Grassley in \nreintroducing the PCAOB Enforcement Transparency Act. This bill permits \nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, PCAOB, to make public \nthe disciplinary proceedings it has brought against auditors and audit \nfirms earlier in the process.\n  Over 10 years ago, our markets were victimized by a series of massive \nfinancial reporting frauds, including those involving Enron and \nWorldCom. These and other public companies had produced fraudulent and \nmaterially misleading financial statements, which artificially drove \ntheir stock prices up. Once the fraud was discovered, investor \nconfidence plummeted.\n  In response to this crisis, the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs conducted a series of hearings, which produced \nconsensus on a number of underlying causes, including weak corporate \ngovernance, a lack of accountability, and inadequate oversight of \naccountants charged with auditing public companies' financial \nstatements.\n  In order to address the gaps and structural weaknesses revealed by \nthe investigation and hearings, the Senate passed the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct of 2002 in a 99 to 0 vote.\n  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act ensured that corporate officers were directly \naccountable for their financial reporting and for the quality of their \nfinancial statements. This law also created a strong, independent \nboard, the PCAOB, to oversee the conduct of the auditors of public \ncompanies.\n  The PCAOB is responsible for overseeing auditors of public companies \nin order to protect investors who rely on independent audit reports on \nthe financial statements of public companies and operates under the \noversight of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissioner, SEC.\n  To conduct its duties, the PCAOB oversees more than 2,400 registered \nauditing firms, as well as the thousands of audit partners and staff \nwho contribute to a firm's work on each audit. The Board's ability to \ncommence proceedings to determine whether there have been violations of \nits auditing standards or rules of professional practice is an \nimportant component of its oversight.\n  However, unlike other oversight bodies, such as the SEC, the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the \nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority, and others, the Board's disciplinary proceedings \nare not allowed to be public without consent from the parties involved. \nOf course, parties subject to disciplinary proceedings have no \nincentive to consent to publicizing their alleged wrongdoing and thus \nthese proceedings typically remain cloaked behind a veil of secrecy. In \naddition, the Board's decisions in disciplinary proceedings are not \nallowed to be publicized until after the complete exhaustion of an \nappeals process, which can often take several years.\n  The nonpublic nature of these PCAOB disciplinary proceedings creates \na lack of transparency that invites abuse and undermines the \nCongressional intent behind the establishment of the PCAOB, which was \nto shine a bright light on auditing firms and practices, and to bolster \nthe accountability of auditors of public companies to the investing \npublic.\n  Over the last several years, some bad actors have taken advantage of \nthe lack of transparency by using it to shield themselves from public \nscrutiny and accountability. PCAOB Chairman James Doty has repeatedly \nstated in testimony provided to both the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives over the past two years that the secrecy of the \nproceedings ``has a variety of unfortunate consequences'' and that such \nsecrecy is harmful to investors, the auditing profession, and the \npublic at large.\n  In one example, an accounting firm that was subject to a disciplinary \nproceeding continued to issue no fewer than 29 additional audit reports \non public companies without any of those companies knowing about the \nPCAOB disciplinary proceedings. In other words, investors and the \npublic company clients of that audit firm were deprived of relevant and \nmaterial information about the proceedings against the firm and the \nsubstance of any violations.\n  There are several reasons why the Board's enforcement proceedings \nshould be open and transparent. First, as I have already noted, the \nclosed proceedings run counter to the public proceedings of other \ngovernment oversight bodies. Indeed, nearly all administrative \nproceedings brought by the SEC against those it regulates, including \npublic companies, brokers, dealers, investment advisers, and others, \nare open, public proceedings. The PCAOB's secret proceedings are not \nonly shielded from the public, but also from Congress, making it \ndifficult, if not impossible, to effectively evaluate the Board's \noversight of auditors and audit firms, and its enforcement program.\n  Second, the incentive to litigate cases in order to continue to \nshield conduct from public scrutiny as long as possible frustrates the \nprocess and requires the expenditure of needless resources by both \nlitigants and the PCAOB.\n  Third, agencies such as the SEC have found open and transparent \ndisciplinary proceedings to be valuable because they inform peer audit \nfirms of the type of activity that may give rise to enforcement action \nby the regulator. In effect, transparency of proceedings can serve as a \ndeterrent to misconduct because of a perceived increase in the \nlikelihood of ``getting caught.'' Accordingly, the audit industry as a \nwhole would also benefit from timely, public, and non-secret \nenforcement proceedings.\n  Our bill will make hearings by the PCAOB, and all related notices, \norders, and motions, transparent and available to the public unless \notherwise ordered by the Board. This would more closely align the \nPCAOB's procedures with those of the SEC for analogous matters.\n  Increasing the transparency and accountability of audit firms subject \nto disciplinary proceedings instituted by the PCAOB is a critical \ncomponent of efforts to bolster and maintain investor confidence in our \nfinancial markets, while better protecting companies from problematic \nauditors.\n  I hope our colleagues will join Senator Grassley and me in supporting \nthis legislation to enhance transparency in the PCAOB's enforcement \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/04/23/senate-section/article/S2405-1", "month": "04", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2405-S2406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 148--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN'S STATE-\n    SPONSORED PERSECUTION OF ITS BAHA'I MINORITY AND ITS CONTINUED \n        VIOLATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANTS ON HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KIRK (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Rubio) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Numerous issues flagged by the General \n     Assembly, the United Nations human rights mechanisms and the \n     Secretary-General persist, and in some cases appear to have \n     worsened, some recent overtures made by the Administration \n     and the parliament notwithstanding.'';\n       Whereas, on December 18, 2014, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/69/190), which \n     ``[e]xpresse[d] deep concern'' over ``[c]ontinued \n     discrimination, persecution and human rights violations \n     against persons belonging to unrecognized religious \n     minorities, particularly members of the Baha'i [F]aith. . \n     .and the effective criminalization of membership in the \n     Baha'i [F]aith,'' and called upon the Government of Iran to \n     ``emancipate the Baha'i community. . .and to accord all \n     Baha'is, including those imprisoned because of their beliefs, \n     the due process of law and the rights that they are \n     constitutionally guaranteed'';\n       Whereas, since May of 2008, the Government of Iran has \n     imprisoned the seven members of the former ad hoc leadership \n     group of the Baha'i community in Iran, known as the Yaran-i-\n     Iran, or ``friends of Iran''--Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. \n     Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. \n     Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, and Mr. Vahid \n     Tizfahm--and these individuals are serving 20-year prison \n     terms, the longest sentences given to any current prisoner of \n     conscience in Iran, on charges including ``spying for Israel, \n     insulting religious sanctities, propaganda against the regime \n     and spreading corruption on earth'';\n       Whereas, beginning in May 2011, officials of the Government \n     of Iran in 4 cities conducted sweeping raids on the homes of \n     dozens of individuals associated with the Baha'i Institute \n     for Higher Education (BIHE) and arrested and detained several \n     educators associated with BIHE, and 12 BIHE educators are now \n     serving 4- or 5-year prison terms;\n       Whereas scores of Baha'i cemeteries have been attacked, \n     and, in April 2014, Revolutionary Guards began excavating a \n     Baha'i cemetery in Shiraz, which is the site of 950 graves;\n       Whereas the Baha'i International Community reported that \n     there has been a recent surge in anti-Baha'i hate propaganda \n     in Iranian state-sponsored media outlets, noting that, in \n     2010 and 2011, approximately 22 anti-Baha'i articles were \n     appearing every month, and, in 2014, the number of anti-\n     Baha'i articles rose to approximately 401 per month--18 times \n     the previous level;\n       Whereas there are currently 100 Baha'is in prison in Iran;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran is party to the \n     International Covenants on Human Rights and is in violation \n     of its obligations under the Covenants;
