Mr. President, on a different matter, as the Senate \ncontinues debating President Obama's deal with Iran today, I think it \nis appropriate to consider a quote from the President himself. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       I believe Congress owes the American people a final up-or-\n     down vote. We need courage. You know, in the end, this debate \n     is about far more than politics.\n\n  When it comes to the Iran deal, you would have to say the President \nis right. After all, do Senators think it is right for the world's \nleading sponsor of terror to be able to maintain an American-recognized \nnuclear program? Do Senators think it is right that this deal would \neffectively subsidize Hezbollah, Hamas, and Bashar al-Assad by \nchanneling literally billions of dollars to their benefactors in \nTehran? Do Senators approve of a deal that would leave Iran with an \nenrichment capability just as the Iranian leadership is again calling \nfor Israel's destruction and praying for ours as well? It is hard to \nsee how Senators could agree with these things.\n  Many Democratic colleagues, including the top Democrats on the \nForeign Affairs Committees in both Houses of Congress who are among the \nmost familiar with the President's deal with Iran, have already come \nout in opposition. A strong bipartisan majority of the House of \nRepresentatives voted to reject the deal. A strong bipartisan majority \nof the Senate would vote to reject it as well, if only Democratic \nSenators would stop blocking the American people from even having a \nfinal vote on one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of \nour time.\n  Democratic Senators will have a chance to vote on behalf of their \nconstituents later today. Perhaps they will consider the President's \nwords I quoted earlier. It is from a 2010 speech about ObamaCare. If \nthe President was so insistent on ``courage'' and a ``final up-or-down \nvote'' back then on ObamaCare, how can he justify blocking a vote now \non an issue of such immense magnitude as the Iran deal? It is part of a \nlarger retreat to campaigning instead of engaging on this important \nissue, ad hominem attacks instead of serious debate, campaign one-\nliners instead of intellectual arguments, and simply ignoring reality \nwhen it becomes inconvenient. That is why you see the President \nclaiming ``strong support of lawmakers and citizens'' for his Iran \ndeal.\n  Well, here is what the Washington Post's Fact Checker had to say \nabout that:\n\n       Any way you slice it, it is difficult to support the claim \n     that there is ``strong support'' for the Iran deal among \n     lawmakers and citizens. This is clearly a case of winning \n     ugly, in the face of minority support among lawmakers and \n     increasing opposition among American citizens.\n       The White House certainly did better than many analysts \n     expected, since enough Democrats supported the agreement to \n     prevent a final Senate vote on the merits. And Obama avoided \n     a veto fight. But that's different than having ``strong \n     support'' for the deal.\n\n  That is the Washington Post Fact Checker.\n  So if Democrats share the President's determination to ``win ugly'' \non this important issue, then they have sufficient numbers to do that, \napparently, but I would remind my colleagues of something. This debate \nshould not be about a President who will leave office in 16 months. It \nshould be about where our country will be in 16 years.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n  Consider this advice from an editorial that appeared in Bloomberg \nlast month:\n\n       Tactics aside, it would be far better to win this fight \n     fairly. The pact is not a treaty: A future President and \n     Congress might overturn it, arguing that it was sealed \n     without proper consideration. And history often looks with \n     disgust at causes built on fear, especially if they go awry.\n\n  This is an important moment for the Democratic Party, but more \nimportantly it is an important moment for our country. Let's stand up \nfor the people we represent. Let's allow them to vote on what is one of \nthe most consequential foreign policy issues of our age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6616-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader, among other \nthings, said he wanted an intellectual argument. The outline he just \ngave has nothing to do with intellectual credibility.\n  The agreement that was finalized last week dealt with one subject and \none subject only: whether Iran should have a nuclear weapon, and that \nanswer was resoundingly no. That is what it was all about. All the \nother rhetoric my Republican friend talked about is not in keeping with \nwhat the agreement is all about.

Mr. President, it comes as no surprise to anyone watching \nthe Senate that the Republican leader and I disagree on many things, \nbut I was very glad to hear the Republican leader say last week that he \nbelieves any government funding bill must be clean and that using the \nappropriations process as a vehicle to attack women's health is, as he \nsaid, ``an exercise in futility.''\n  I am sure not everyone on his side of the aisle agrees with him, but \nthere is no doubt it is the right thing to do. I agree that any budget \ndeal must be clean; that is, no riders--nothing with Planned \nParenthood, nothing with repealing what the Environmental Protection \nAgency has done, no repealing what the Dodd-Frank bill put into effect \nto stop us from having another Wall Street meltdown, no riders dealing \nwith immigration--just a clean continuing resolution for a short period \nof time to allow us to do a more full and more complete deal in the \nvery near future.\n  I agree any budget bill must be clean. I say that again. I am glad to \nsee the Republican leader coming around to that. Democrats will not \nsupport a continuing resolution that has all these riders on it and \nespecially a Planned Parenthood rider that was talked about so much in \nthe House.\n  I read in the paper today that there are 32 Republicans in the House \nwho have signed a letter to the Speaker saying they are not going to \nvote for anything unless it defunds Planned Parenthood. That is a \nnonstarter and the Republican leader rightly has acknowledged that. I \nam glad the Republican leader wants a clean continuing resolution \ninstead of one that attacks women's health.\n  I am disappointed by his refusal at this stage to negotiate with the \nWhite House or any Democrats in the House or in the Senate dealing with \nthe budget. We have a looming government shutdown. It is right before \nour eyes. The Republican leader has already wasted far too much time \ndithering and doing nothing on that. We know from experience 2 years \nago that the Republicans actually did shut down the government for \nalmost 3 weeks. For months, we have overheard them calling for \nbipartisan budget negotiations. We have 9 session days left before the \ngovernment shuts down. Now is the time to sit down--Democrats, \nRepublicans, getting the White House involved--and negotiate a \nbipartisan funding measure for the rest of the year, but by the look of \nthis week's schedule, the Republican leader doesn't seem to be in any \nhurry to avoid a shutdown. That is truly unfortunate.\n  The Republican leader has not scheduled any budget votes today. \nInstead, the Senate will waste precious time on another failed vote. \nAnd then what comes next? What is the Republican leader's plan for the \nrest of the week? Political show votes on abortion that have nothing to \ndo with keeping the Federal Government open. There is no reason why we \ncan't pass a bipartisan funding measure as soon as possible--this week, \neven. But that depends on the Republican leader's willingness to sit \ndown and negotiate, and sooner rather than later. Then, Congress can \nmove on to our next budget priority: reversing sequestration and its \nharmful cuts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6616-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6616-S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today, September 15, marks the beginning of \nHispanic Heritage Month, a celebration that dates back to 1968.\n  This month also includes the anniversary of independence for many \nLatin American countries. Hispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity for \nus as a nation to recognize, celebrate, and honor the history, culture, \nand contributions of America's Latino community.\n  We see those contributions in all facets of our society, from the \nbattlefields to the boardrooms and from the classrooms to the halls of \ngovernment. Every segment of American life has been enriched by Latinos \nand their proud culture. Without the contributions made by generations \nof Latinos, Nevada and the United States would not be what we are \ntoday.\n  In Nevada, Hispanic influence and history is everywhere. Consider the \nname of my State and the name of our most famous city. ``Nevada'' means \nsnow covered. ``Las Vegas'' means the meadows. Las Vegas, one of the \nmost famous cities in the world, has a Hispanic name. Today, more than \none-quarter of Nevada's population is Hispanic.\n  Nationally, Latino Americans number nearly 60 million and are \nexpected to make up to 60 percent of the population growth in coming \ndecades. America's future depends on a strong and prosperous Hispanic \npopulation.\n  That is why Democrats have fought hard for policies to protect \nHispanic families and strengthen Hispanic communities. We passed the \nAffordable Care Act, which allows millions of Latinos to have access to \naffordable health care. Because of the Affordable Care Act, 4.2 million \npreviously uninsured Latinos now have health insurance. An estimated \n8.8 million Latinos are newly covered for expanded preventive services, \nwith no cost-sharing, including mammograms, colonoscopy screenings, and \nimmunization vaccines under the Affordable Care Act.\n  Democrats also passed the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform \nbill out of the Senate a couple years ago. That legislation, which \nHouse Republicans refused to consider, even though it would have passed \noverwhelmingly--all Democrats would have voted for it and enough \nRepublicans would have voted for it to be an overwhelming victory--but \nit didn't happen. The Republicans refused to consider something that \nprotected families, reduced the deficit, and strengthened our national \nsecurity.\n  We also supported President Obama's Executive actions, which, as we \nspeak, are protecting immigrant families from the threat of deportation \nand taking criminals off the streets. Meanwhile, Republicans are doing \neverything in their power to undermine Hispanic families. A person need \nonly watch 5 minutes of a Republican Presidential debate to see how \nRepublicans really feel about America's Latino communities. Republicans \nare clamoring to amend the Constitution to repeal birthright \ncitizenship. Republicans want to roll back President Obama's Executive \nactions that are keeping families together and preventing DREAMers from \nbeing deported.\n\n  Republicans are constantly attacking the Affordable Care Act, which \nhas covered 4.2 million previously uninsured Latinos with health \ninsurance. Republicans refuse to boost the minimum\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\nwage, blocking millions of Latino families from earning a livable wage.\n  These are the priorities of the Republican Party--a Republican Party \nthat has abandoned Latino families. We as Democrats will do everything \nin our power to stop the Republican attack on these families. Democrats \nwill continue to fight for Latino families to help them tackle the \nchallenges they face every day.\n  Today, as we celebrate the first day of Hispanic Heritage Month, we \nhonor the many incredible contributions Latino Americans make every day \nto our Nation. We also recommit ourselves to protecting Hispanic \nfamilies and communities from the likes of Donald Trump and the \nRepublican Party and treating them with dignity and respect because a \nprosperous America needs a strong and thriving Hispanic community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6617-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, as you know, today we are going to have a \nnumber of speakers coming down to talk about the deal that has been \nnegotiated between the P5+1 countries--China, Russia, Great Britain, \nGermany, France, and the United States--and Iran. What is before us \ntoday is something called a resolution of disapproval. I know the \nprocedures we deal with sometimes here on the Senate floor can be very \nconfusing to the public. We are going through a process where we are \ntrying to seek cloture. Cloture is a vote where people decide whether \nthey are going to end debate on a topic and move toward the final vote, \nto cast their vote on the substance of what is before us.\n  We had a similar type of vote before we left on Thursday. We had 58 \nSenators--a bipartisan majority--who wanted to move to a final vote. As \na matter of fact, we had Senators from both sides of the aisle on the \nfloor for some time debating the issue. It was one of the most sober, \nrespectful debates we have had since I have been in the Senate. But a \nminority of the Senators voted not to end the debate. In other words, \nthat is what the general public believes is a filibuster. And it kept \nus from being able to move to a final vote.\n  Because there has been some confusion, what I thought I would do is \nlay out what exactly is happening here and how we got to this process.\n  Under our form of government, when the President enters into an \ninternational agreement, he decides as to whether that is going to be a \ntreaty, which, as we know, requires a two-thirds approval by the \nSenate, or whether it is something called a congressional-executive \nagreement, which is a little bit lower threshold, or whether it is just \na pure executive agreement, in other words, the President himself has \nthe ability, if he so decides, to enter into an executive agreement. \nOne of the problems with an executive agreement is that it doesn't live \nbeyond that President's term.\n  When you invoke an executive agreement, what you are really doing is \nbypassing the buy-in of Congress. As a matter of fact, last week on the \nfloor, I thought Senator Flake made one of the most salient points that \nhave been made; that is, since the President and his team decided to \ncut out Congress and to attempt to do an executive agreement, they made \nno attempt whatsoever to get the buy-in of Congress. That is why we \nhave ended up in the situation we are in.\n  When I realized that the President, through this process, was going \nto enter into this agreement solely by himself--an executive agreement, \nwhich he has the ability to do--but that he was also going to use \nsomething called a national security waiver to do so--again, this gets \na little complicated, and foreign policy can sometimes be complicated. \nCongress, on four different occasions, passed overwhelmingly in this \nbody and overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives something that \nputs sanctions in place on Iran to try to bring them to the negotiating \ntable. We did it four times.\n  I have to say that in almost every instance, the administration \npushed back against us putting sanctions in place. They said, ``Oh, the \nother countries won't be with us, and this will create problems.'' What \nhappened as a result of us saying ``No, we are going to sanction Iran; \nwe are going to do what we can to bring them to the table to end their \nnuclear program'' was that the other countries fell in line. They put \nin place similar sanctions to the ones Congress put in place.\n  When we passed those four sets of sanctions, we gave the President \nsomething that is common, and that is called a national security \nwaiver, where, if a crisis came up, he had the ability to waive those \nsanctions if he thought it was in our country's national interest.\n  So when he decided to enter into an executive agreement around these \nnegotiations with Iran and bypass Congress, what he also decided he was \ngoing to do is to use his national security waiver to waive the \nsanctions Congress put in place.\n  Some of us on this side of the aisle realized that was very \nproblematic, that because we brought Congress to the table and because \nwe put the sanctions in place, we thought it was inappropriate for the \nPresident to use the national security waiver.\n  By the way, we realize now that he was going to put a national \nsecurity waiver in place for 8\\1/2\\ years and come to Congress 8\\1/2\\ \nyears down the road to waive those sanctions permanently. That would \nhave been long after the essence of this deal was done and over.\n  So we were able to work with the other side of the aisle and pass a \nbill that has put us in the position we are in today, and that is \nallowing Congress to weigh in before those congressionally mandated \nsanctions are waived. Of course, if those sanctions are not waived, \nthen, in essence, the Iranian deal cannot go forward under the terms \nthat have been laid out.\n  A lot of people have said: Well, Congress gave away authority. They \nenabled the President to do this without entering into a treaty.\n  That is totally untrue. The President has the ability to decide to \nenter into an international arrangement through an executive \narrangement, as he has done, if he so chooses. Now, again, the problem \nwith that is, it doesn't stand the test of time because the next \nPresident can come in and alter that.\n  As a matter of fact, this is the first time I can remember that \nCongress has\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\ntaken back authority from the President because what we really did was \nsaid: Mr. President, no, you cannot go forward with this deal until we \nhave all of the information, both classified and unclassified, and it \nis paused for 60 days while we go through this review process, which we \nknow ends--it is debatable because we don't have all the materials, but \nthey would say it ends this week.\n  So this process wouldn't even be occurring if Congress hadn't taken \nback the authority that we took back from the President, put this pause \nin place, and given ourselves the ability to either approve or \ndisapprove--disapprove in this case because many people believe the \nPresident squandered this opportunity. Here we had brought this rogue \nnation to the table, had a boot on its neck, its economy was suffering, \nand here we have this rogue nation that somehow has ended up in a \nsituation where the President and others have negotiated to allow them \nnot to end their program, which is what was said in the beginning.\n  By the way, let me just say that had the President held to what he \nsaid on the front end, which was that we are going to end Iran's \nnuclear program, what we would be having today is almost unanimous \nsupport for this agreement. But instead they squandered that \nopportunity--squandered it--and instead have agreed to allow them to \nindustrialize their program and a whole host of other things that had \nnothing to do with the nuclear file.\n  Let me go back to the process. The President decided he was going to \ngo straight to the United Nations. Congress said: No, you are not going \nto do that. You are going to come to us, and we are going to decide \nwhether we approve or disapprove.\n  So we have a lot of people out there. Some, I guess, just don't \nunderstand. Some, I think, do understand, but they are trying to \nsomehow or another create this narrative that Congress is enabling the \nPresident. The fact is, we would have liked to have had more of a say \nin this. I would have liked for this to have been a treaty. But since \nthe President determines whether these are treaties or executive \nagreements--and he decided in this case it was an executive agreement--\nagain, what Congress has done is said no and taken back a degree of \nauthority.\n  Unfortunately, what is happening is we have a minority of 42 Senators \nwho have decided they are not going to allow an up-or-down vote. That \nis what has happened.\n  What was dismaying to me was that during August the minority leader \ndecided he was going to filibuster. I have a lot of respect--I think \npeople know we have worked closely together in trying to make the \nSenate work here. But I was very disappointed that somehow or another \nthis was going to take on sort of a Tammy Wynette feel to it, if you \nwill, that, you know, ``We are going to stand by our man. We are not \ngoing to cause him to have to veto a resolution of disapproval.'' \nSomehow or another, instead of this being the sober, serious debate we \nthought it was going to be where a majority of Senators were going to \nbe able to express themselves, in order to protect the President from \nhaving to veto something that the majority of the Senate in a \nbipartisan way disapproves of, somehow or another, we have this process \nunderway.\n  I do wish to say to the leader of the Senate that I appreciate very \nmuch the fact that up until this point, what he has agreed to do and \nhas done is he has filled the tree--again, another term that I am sure \nsounds very unusual to people who are watching the Senate floor and \ndon't understand the process. What he has done is he has said: No--up \nuntil this point anyway--we are not going to have a bunch of amendments \nthat are tough for people to vote on; we are going to keep the debate \nto one topic, and that is the resolution of disapproval. That is what \nthis is for.\n  So tonight, in a second effort, beginning at 6 o'clock this evening, \nwe are going to have a vote. The vote is going to be about whether--I \nmean, this is what the essence of it is--it is about whether we should \nend the debate and move to final passage. I think plenty of people have \nhad their say. Others are going to be coming to the floor today to talk \nabout the merits of this deal and the demerits of this deal. But I \nwould hope, again, that the minority, which seems intent on trying to \nkeep the President from getting a resolution of disapproval, which the \nmajority of people in this body believe should be the case--in order to \nkeep him from having to veto the will of the Senate, a minority of \npeople here are keeping that vote from taking place.\n  I close by thanking my friends on the other side of the aisle for two \nthings. I actually want to thank everybody in this body. Since 2010, \nfour times the Senate has weighed in to put crippling sanctions on \nIran. Those sanctions brought them to the table. That was something \nwhich was done in spite of the fact that the administration was pushing \nback.\n  Secondly, this body, with a vote of 98 to 1, passed the Iranian \nreview act--in short, now called Corker-Cardin. We passed that on a 98-\nto-1 basis knowing that the President was issuing a veto threat up to \n1\\1/2\\ hours before the committee vote took place. When they realized \nthey were going to be crushed--I hate to use that word--overwhelmed in \nthat committee vote, they lifted their veto threat about 1\\1/2\\ hours \nbefore that took place.\n  But, again, on a 98-to-1 basis, this body said: No, we want to weigh \nin. We want to have the right to approve or disapprove. We want to \npause. We want to see all of the documents.\n  By the way, we have had 12 hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee--12--and all kinds of other one-on-one briefings. So we have \nhad plenty of time to look at this. As a matter of fact, the American \npeople know more about this deal than they ever would have had that \nprocess not been put in place. Again, it was put in place because the \nPresident decided he wasn't going to cause this to be a treaty; he \nwasn't going to ask for us to weigh in; he wasn't going to ask us on \nbehalf of the American people to approve it; he was going to do it \nhimself and go directly to the U.N. Security Council. As a matter of \nfact, he has done that. As a matter of fact, they moved the \nimplementation date back so we could have our chance of weighing in in \nthis way. Certainly, we would love to have much greater power and \nauthority over this.\n  So thank you to everyone here for putting the sanctions in place. \nThank you for allowing us to weigh in.\n  Let me remind people that if the President had achieved the goals he \nset out to end Iran's nuclear program--in other cases, he said \ndismantle Iran's nuclear program--what would be happening on the floor \ntoday is there would be an overwhelming, I would say unanimous vote in \nsupport of what the President did. But what is happening is we have a \nbipartisan majority that opposes this. And even those people who have \ncome out in support of this have done so tepidly. They have talked \nabout all the problems in the agreement. As a matter of fact, now there \nis a huge push to try to come up with a Middle East policy because we \nknow we have none to push back against what is in this agreement.\n  I am going to have more to say, but I realize my good friend Senator \nHoeven is here. I wish I had known 4 minutes ago he was here. I have \ngone 4 minutes into his time, and I yield the floor.\n  But I want to remind people in closing: Had the President done what \nhe said the goal of the negotiation was--to end their program--we would \nhave unanimous support. Instead, we have a bipartisan majority that \nopposes this bill, and we have a minority that has kept us, once, from \nbeing able to vote up or down. I hope with tonight's vote that will not \nbe the case. I hope we will have the opportunity to send a resolution \nof disapproval to the President. I know he has said he would veto that, \nbut I think it is important for us and the will of the body and the \nwill of the country to be heard, and for it to reach the President's \ndesk.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the Iran \nnuclear agreement and my support for the resolution of disapproval.\n  Although there are many arguments related to President Obama's \nagreement with Iran, I would like to focus on the subject of sanctions. \nI think it is important to consider why we sanctioned Iran, what \nhappens to our sanctions if the deal is implemented, and the prospects \nfor snapping back sanctions in the future.\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\n  First, we imposed sanctions because we wanted to dismantle Iran's \nnuclear program. Again, I want to emphasize that. We imposed sanctions \nbecause we wanted to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. As Secretary \nKerry said in December of 2013, we imposed sanctions ``because we knew \nthat it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That \nwas the whole point of the [sanctions] regime.''\n  These were very serious and are very serious sanctions. According to \nthe Treasury Department, sanctions reduced Iranian oil exports by 60 \npercent--by 60 percent--from 2.5 million barrels per day in 2012 to \njust over 1 million barrels per day in 2015. In 2014 alone, the \nTreasury Department believes Iran lost $40 billion in oil revenue. \nSanctions also blocked Iran from accessing most of its billions in \nforeign currency reserves. In short, Iran's economy today is 15 to 20 \npercent smaller than it was projected to be back in 2012.\n  We know these sanctions were having the desired effect because Iran \ndecided to negotiate. The mullahs in Iran would not have come to the \nbargaining table if they are not feeling the effect of our sanctions. \nThe opportunity to dismantle Iran's nuclear program was in sight, but \nthen we let Iran off the hook. We agreed to a negotiations process that \ngave Iran room to maneuver.\n  Instead of boxing them in with relentless economic pressure, we \noffered sanctions relief in return for mothballing Iran's nuclear \ninfrastructure for a few years. The end result is that the deal \nundermines the whole point of the sanctions regime. We instituted \nsanctions to pressure Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, but this \nagreement provides sanctions relief and leaves the nuclear program \nintact.\n  The terms of the agreement will give Iran access to more than $100 \nbillion located in frozen bank accounts. Some estimates put that figure \neven higher. The windfall Iran expects to receive from foreign \ninvestments will strengthen Iran's economy even further.\n  But let us focus on the initial more than $100 billion in sanctions \nrelief, which is an enormous number. It is equivalent to 25 percent of \nIran's annual gross domestic product. For perspective, one quarter of \nU.S. GDP would amount to more than $4 trillion. So you can see what a \nhuge sum this is to Iran and how much it means to Iran and their \neconomy and, ultimately, to their military. One analyst even pointed \nout that $100 billion for Iran in 2015 is roughly equivalent to the \ninvestment the United States made across Europe over the 4-year \nMarshall Plan to rehabilitate Europe after World War II. So you realize \nwhat a huge impact this will have, what a huge benefit it is for Iran, \nfor its economy, and for its military.\n  In short, handing Iran $100 billion gives the mullahs incredible \nflexibility. It is hard to imagine that Iran won't divert billions of \nthese funds to Hezbollah in Lebanon, along with a billion or two for \nYemen, and another billion or two or more for operations in Iraq and \nSyria.\n  Remember, Iran is the No. 1 state sponsor of terror in the world \ntoday. This agreement will provide Iran with money to spend on its \naggressive agenda across the Middle East. So one thing is clear--one \nthing is clear--the world's foremost state sponsor of terror and one of \nthe worst violators of human rights on Earth will receive a huge \nwindfall of cash.\n  It is also clear Iran's economy and its military would be \nstrengthened. As I said previously, Iran's economy today is 20 percent \nsmaller than it would have been without 4 years of sanctions. Four \nyears from now, without sanctions, Iran's economy will be larger and \nthe regime will have not only more financial strength but also more \nflexibility to carry out its agenda.\n  That flexibility will come at a very opportune time for them. Five \nyears into this agreement, the conventional arms embargo will end, per \nthe agreement, and it should be clear to all of us that Iran will then \nhave the money, the resources to buy arms at that point. Three years \nlater, or a total of 8 years after the agreement is implemented, the \nballistic missile embargo will be lifted. So in 5 years they can buy \nconventional weapons and within 8 years they can buy advanced missile \ntechnology. And restrictions on Iran's nuclear program will begin to \ndisappear a few years later.\n  Iran's leaders are probably very pleased with that timing. First, \nthey get sanctions relief, allowing them to grow their economy. That \ngrowth will create the investment capital for conventional arms \npurchases, which the deal permits in 5 years. By then they will be \nready to acquire advanced ballistic missile technology--ballistic \nmissiles the agreement allows Iran to purchase in 8 years.\n  In fact, because their nuclear program will remain intact, at that \npoint Iran could opt out of the deal, finish developing a nuclear \nweapon, and mount it on a ballistic missile. In short, the President's \nIran agreement actually allows Iran a path to finance and develop an \nadvanced nuclear weapon.\n  Further, the agreement is not only bad on its merits, it is a \nstrategic mistake. It hurts our long-standing Middle East alliances and \npositions Iran to be the dominant power in the Middle East. We know \nwhat Iran will do from a position of strength. It destabilizes Yemen, \nSyria, and Iraq, foments terrorism against Israel, and opens the door \nfor countries such as Russia and China to meddle in regional politics. \nEven if Iran never developed a nuclear weapon, the agreement will \nposition Iran to further undermine regional security for years to come. \nLeaving its nuclear infrastructure in place only makes things worse.\n  What if Iran violates the agreement? It is interesting to note that \nmany supporters of the deal have argued we must approve the agreement \nbecause our allies are already lifting their sanctions and that our \nsanctions will not be successful on their own. Yet these same \nsupporters of the agreement believe sanctions could somehow be \nreimposed if Iran cheats on the deal.\n  Unfortunately, the procedures in the agreement make snapping back \nsanctions very difficult. Under the terms of the deal, it would take \nmonths to establish Iranian violations of the agreement and put new \nsanctions back in place. Suppose Iran begins to cheat on the deal in a \nyear or two. Under the terms of the agreement, it would take months to \nestablish that Iran had violated the agreement and approve those new \nsanctions. That is hardly enough of a threat to keep Iran from \ncheating, but more importantly, the deal permits Iran to withdraw from \nthe agreement if sanctions are reimposed. So snapping back sanctions \nwould effectively kill the deal. Remember, they could kill the deal \nafter they have already gotten more than $100 billion.\n  The agreement makes it in Iran's interest to cheat on the deal \nknowing sanctions either won't be imposed or will allow them to pocket \nthe $100 billion in sanctions relief, jump-starting their nuclear \nprogram, before any kind of sanctions are reimposed. For this reason, I \nbelieve if the agreement goes into effect, it will very likely die \nslowly from a thousand Iranian cuts, leaving behind a richer and \nnuclear-powered Iran.\n  Voting to support the deal essentially means putting faith in Iran. \nIt means believing that Iran will allow the inspections to occur. It \nmeans believing that Iran does not have any nuclear facilities that we \nare unaware of. It means believing that Iran will keep its nuclear \ninfrastructure without attempting to build a nuclear weapon.\n  I don't believe any of these things. Why? Because over the last 15 \nyears Iran has blocked inspections, revealed the existence of secret \nnuclear sites only when forced to, and pushed for a nuclear weapon even \nwhen claiming they only wanted a peaceful program.\n  But it doesn't have to be this way. We could seek a stronger \nagreement. We could make it clear that Iran does not have the right to \nnuclear weapons and cannot be allowed to obtain them. We could return \nto our original goal, which was the dismantlement of Iran's nuclear \nprogram, instead of negotiating away the leverage that sanctions \ncreated.\n  For these reasons, I cannot support the President's agreement with \nIran. Instead, I favor immediate additional sanctions to pressure Iran \nto dismantle its nuclear program, which was the objective when the \nnegotiations began.\n  We should not let Iran off the hook. We should not throw away the \nleverage we developed in recent years through\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\nthese sanctions. It takes time for sanctions to work, but the relief is \nimmediate when sanctions are lifted. We need to keep our sanctions, \nkeep the pressure on, and get a deal that actually dismantles Iran's \nnuclear program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum but also request \nthat the time be equally divided.\n  I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. It is my understanding that we are equally dividing the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided, but quorum calls \nare not equally divided unless requested.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum \ncall be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I have an inquiry relative to the \nremaining time.\n  I am not understanding what the quorum call time is doing relative to \nthe splitting of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By precedent, quorum calls are charged to the \nside that requests the quorum call, unless there is a request that the \nquorum call be equally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. CORKER. And my understanding was that request was made and \ngranted; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that request was made and granted in this \nparticular request, but it only applies to the particular request \nunless it is made on the next quorum call request or unless the \nunanimous consent would apply to all quorum calls.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I know the public is greatly confused by \ncloture motions, and I will say, even as the person in charge of the \nbill, I am confused also, but I will let that stand, and I thank the \nChair.\n  I know the next speaker we are hoping to hear from will be Senator \nCornyn at 2 p.m., Senator Scott at 2:20, Senator Blunt at 2:30, and \nthen Senator Heller at 3 o'clock. I hope they will be down soon, and I \nwill let the time be accruing against both sides by suggesting the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  I ask unanimous consent that during the period of time there is a \nquorum call, it be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last week we experienced what I would \nthink was a dark day in the history of the United States Senate where, \non one of the most important national security issues that has \nconfronted the country in the last 25 years--and perhaps longer--our \nfriends across the aisle, led by the minority leader, decided to \nfilibuster the resolution of disapproval on the President's nuclear \ndeal with Iran.\n  So everybody understands what that means. Rather than cast a vote \neither in favor or against the resolution of disapproval, Democrats \nbanded together and decided not to have a vote. Presumably they did \nthat for two reasons: One is they didn't want the personal \naccountability associated with having to cast a vote for or against \ndisapproval because they know at some point Iran is going to continue \nits pattern of misbehavior and people might come back and say: Why did \nyou vote for this deal when in fact all the evidence pointed toward how \nbad a deal it was?\n  The second reason I believe our Democratic friends decided to \nfilibuster the vote on the resolution of disapproval is they simply \nwanted to protect the President because they knew that had the \nresolution of disapproval passed, the President had threatened to veto \nthe legislation. Having done so under that circumstance, the President \nwould in fact own this bad deal.\n  As I said, it is a sad day when a political party decides to put \npartisan concerns ahead of the national security interests of the \nUnited States. This is especially true in light of the fact that we \nvoted just a short time earlier to provide a mechanism for there to be \nthat up-or-down vote following debate and review. It also had the \neffect of freezing the President's ability to lift sanctions on Iran \nduring that timeframe.\n  This legislation, negotiated by the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, was called the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act. This was not a partisan product, nor should any of this \ndebate be a partisan activity. It didn't sneak through the Chamber in \nthe dark of night. It wasn't the product of closed-door negotiations by \none political party against another. Rather, it was a product of \nbipartisan concern over the President's deal with Iran and was \nspecifically designed to make sure Congress had possession of all the \nrelevant documents that laid out this agreement between the President \nand the Iranian regime. It would ensure a process by which the American \npeople could be informed--and the Senate itself debate--through their \nelected representatives, whether this deal was a good deal or a bad \ndeal in terms of the national security interests of the American \npeople.\n  Most significantly, that legislation which sets up that process \npassed overwhelmingly--as a matter of fact, I think it was nearly \nunanimously--with not one Democrat in the Chamber voting against that \nlegislation.\n  So having voted for legislation to create a process by which there \nwould be transparency and accountability, and rather than partisanship \nthe national security interests of the country would be elevated, our \nDemocratic friends, listening to the White House, including the \nPresident of the United States, decided to block that very vote they \nhad earlier agreed to have.\n  Ironically, the same day the minority leader and his colleagues \nblocked the up-or-down vote on the resolution, he lambasted Republicans \non this side of the aisle for ``slowing down the legislation,'' and \nsuggested we ought to move on to other matters. We could be well on our \nway to finishing this resolution and moving on to other pieces of \nlegislation that we need to consider if in fact our Democratic friends \nwould, consistent with their earlier vote, just allow us to have an up-\nor-down vote on the resolution of disapproval, but I think what our \nDemocratic friends began to realize is this is an enormously unpopular \nagreement between the President and the Ayatollah in Tehran. As a \nmatter of fact, only 21 percent of the American people have said they \nwant to see this deal be turned into a reality. Many of them are \nconcerned, as am I, that rather than a traditional treaty process that \nrequires two-thirds vote of the United States Senate, this has somehow \nbecome more of a political document rather than a legal document, \nbinding only this President and the Iranian regime, under some \ncircumstances, during the remainder of the 16 months or so of President \nObama's Presidency.\n  Almost 80 percent of the country has said they are not sold on the \ndeal. Their voices deserve to be heard, and Members of Congress and the \nSenate should be on record whether they are listening to the American \npeople or whether they are listening to the siren song of the White \nHouse and a President who is focused on his legacy, to the detriment of \nthe national security of the United States.\n  Even supporters of this deal were some of its biggest critics. Yet \nthese are some of the same people who voted to filibuster an up-or-down \nvote on this resolution of disapproval. Many of them made the case as \nwell as or better than I could; that an agreement made with a \ntheocratic regime that continues to call the United States the\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nGreat Satan and threatens the very existence of our friend and ally in \nthe region, Israel--there should be real reason for pause and certainly \ndebate and an up-or-down vote.\n  Here is just one example. The junior Senator from New Jersey, as a \nprelude to his announcement that he would vote against the resolution \nof disapproval, said:\n\n       With this deal, we are legitimizing a vast and expanding \n     nuclear program in Iran. We are in effect rewarding years of \n     deception, deceit, and wanton disregard for international \n     law. . . .\n  That is the junior Senator from New Jersey on September 3, 2015. Does \nthat sound like somebody who is for this deal or against this deal? \nWell, miraculously, this is from a Senator who voted not just for the \ndeal but voted to even prohibit us from having an up-or-down vote in \nthe Senate. I couldn't agree with these comments more. Our colleague \nclearly understands the nature of the regime and the pattern of \ntroubling behavior characterized by outright deception. Last week, \nalthough headlines emphasized the support of several of our Democratic \ncolleagues for the President's deal, it was clear that many of them \nharbored deep reservations--and those reservations are entirely \njustified.\n  Here is a comment of the senior Senator from Oregon, who said:\n\n       This agreement with the duplicitous and untrustworthy \n     Iranian regime falls short of what I had envisioned. . . .\n\n  This statement was made on September 8, 2015, by somebody who said \nthey were going to vote against the resolution of disapproval but in \nfact filibustered our ability to have an up-or-down vote on the \nresolution itself, and I couldn't agree with the statement quoted from \nthe senior Senator from Oregon any more. This is not exactly a \nresounding endorsement.\n  Then there is the senior Senator from Connecticut, who said, on \nSeptember 8, before he announced his agreement with the President's \nnuclear deal:\n\n       This is not the agreement I would have accepted at the \n     negotiating table. . . .\n\n  I presume by saying that, that means he would have rejected it. But \nyet, again, deferring to the President and deferring to the leadership \nof the Democratic leader in the Senate, not only did the Senator who \nmade that statement indicate his approval of the deal, this Senator \nvoted to block an up-or-down vote on the deal in the Senate--in other \nwords, participated in the filibuster of this vote.\n  (Mr. SCOTT assumed the Chair.)\n  This debate is one the American people deserve to hear. I know the \npress, as they typically do, likes to keep score and move on to other \nthings, but this is one the American people deserve to hear, and it is \none they have demanded--and, frankly, from what they know so far, they \ndon't like this deal. Twenty-one percent have said they approve of it.\n  Rather than listen to their constituents, our friends across the \naisle have decided to essentially block a vote that prevents the kind \nof accountability our constituents deserve and move on to other issues. \nBut with the future security of our country hanging in the balance, we \ncan't just move on, and we can't disregard the will of our own \nconstituents or what common sense or our own investigation and inquiry \ntell us; that this deal is an unenforceable deal. It ignores the fact \nthat Iran remains the primary state sponsor of international terrorism. \nIt releases about $100 billion of money that is going to help finance \nthat proxy war against the United States and our allies that has been \ngoing on since 1979, when the Iranian regime came into power.\n\n  Then there is the bogus verification process. First of all, under the \nagreement, 24 days' notice along with various--the appeals process, \nwhich is a process that only Rube Goldberg would have been able to \ndevise. And then there is the self-monitoring process. It is sort of \nlike a selfie stick that the Iranian regime is going to carry around, \nwhere they conduct their own test on their military sites, and then \nthey turn that over to the IAEA--the International Atomic Energy \nAgency--at the front gate because the so-called independent monitoring \nagency will not even have access to the military sites where breakouts \nin violation of this agreement are most likely. It is hardly one that \ngives you confidence that is going to be conducted with any sort of \nintegrity. Then there is the dramatic change in U.S. policy.\n  When Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress a \ncouple of months ago, he said it used to be U.S. policy to deny Iran a \nnuclear weapon, but this agreement, as he correctly points out, paves \nthe way to a nuclear weapon. Again, this is not a rational actor on the \ninternational stage. This is an extremist regime--a theocratic regime--\ndriven by a desire to wipe Israel off the map and to conduct this proxy \nwar against the United States and our allies as the primary sponsor of \ninternational terrorism. But then there is the final insult to injury. \nJust as our Democratic colleagues filibustered the opportunity to have \nany real accountability with an up-or-down vote in the Senate, we \nlearned that the Supreme Leader in Iran has insisted that the Iranian \nParliament have the final vote and say-so on the deal in Iran.\n  Try to fix that picture in your mind. The Iranian regime--the main, \nprincipal state sponsor of international terrorism, a theocratic regime \ndetermined to wipe Israel off the map and conduct war against what they \ncall the Great Satan, the United States--will have a chance for an up-\nor-down vote, but our Democratic colleagues have blocked an up-or-down \nvote in the U.S. Senate. That ought to be deeply troubling to anyone \nwho cares about the Senate and any sort of sense of democratic \naccountability.\n  It is beyond irresponsible for our Democratic colleagues to again \ndeny the Senate the very same thing the Ayatollah has said the Iranian \nParliament will have a chance to do--especially when they all supported \nthis process by which an up-or-down vote would be facilitated.\n  Later today my colleagues and I will have another opportunity to move \nthis bill closer to an up-or-down vote on the merits of the President's \nagreement with Iran. I hope the same senders who clearly supported a \nthorough review of this deal will join me in moving this bill forward \nso the American people can get the sort of debate they deserve about \nthe No. 1 national security threat affecting this generation of \nAmericans, and the American people can get the kind of accountability \nthey deserve when it comes from their elected officials casting a vote \non their behalf on such an important agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Portman). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I watched in absolute amazement as the \nObama administration attempted to justify what is clearly a misguided \ngamble and a bad deal with Iran. We saw the signs of how bad this deal \nwas almost immediately, as during the same speech in which he announced \nthe deal, the President threatened to veto any legislation that opposed \nit. I have been a business owner. When you lead with threats, you \ntypically are covering for a very bad deal, because when you are \nbuilding support for your product--in this case the Iran deal--you \ndon't tell the folks you are talking to who disagree with you that they \nare crazy. That is simply something you don't do when you have \nconfidence in the deal.\n  If you are leading with threats, you are showing your hand. The \nPresident is trying to bluff by holding a 2, a 5, an 8, and a 10, and \nwe didn't even bring a fifth card to the table. I use a poker reference \nbecause that is exactly what the President of the United States is \ndoing--gambling with our security, gambling with Israel's security, \nand, frankly, gambling with the future of the Middle East. He was also \ngambling that his National Security Advisor, Susan Rice, would not \nadmit that the Iranian Government would use resources from lifting the \nsanctions to fund terrorists, but as we saw on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, \nshe did. He was gambling that his own Press Secretary would not tell us \nthat we should trust the Iranian Government because they would use \n``common sense'' and use sanctions relief to help their economy and to \nhelp the Iranian people, but he did--even though we have seen no signs \nwhatsoever previously that the Iranian Government cares about actually \nhelping the Iranian people, and their horrific record on human rights \nhas only worsened in recent years.\n  The President is gambling that he could use international pressure to\n\n[[Page S6622]]\n\nconvince people he was on the right side of the issue, along with \nRussia and China, and by bringing the deal to the United Nations before \nthe U.S. Congress, that would somehow show Congress the deal was \nacceptable--another bad gamble, but it didn't work. The longer we have \nto study the deal, the worse the deal gets. The longer the American \npeople have to learn about the deal, the stronger their opposition \nbecomes to the deal.\n  There is not much good news as we look at this deal, as we look at \nthe polling information 2 to 1 in opposition to the deal, the American \npeople. Yet the President refers to those on the opposite side of the \ndeal as crazies--referring to the American people, the vast majority of \nthose folks around our country, so many of us, almost unanimously on \nthe Republican side and even some good friends on the left.\n  As I said earlier, the President gambles with our security, and we \nhave seen how bad his hand truly is. As I suggested, he has a 2, a 5, \nan 8, and a 10--a 2 because Iran will be able to double their oil \nexports and therefore double their oil revenues, increasing by more \nthan 1 million barrels a day--in other words, $15 to $20 billion of \nadditional revenue to fund nefarious behavior in the Middle East. That \nis more terrorism in the Middle East; a 5 because, without any \nquestion, in year 5 of the deal they gain access to more weapons as the \nweapons embargo is lifted; an 8 because in year 8 of the deal Iran will \nbe able to purchase ballistic missiles; and a 10--yes, a 10--because in \nyear 10 Iran can begin installing advanced centrifuges for enriching \nuranium. Simply put, this deal legitimizes Iran's nuclear program and \nguarantees a timeline for Iran to secure the bomb.\n  If Congress signs off on this deal, we can all take a big red pen and \nmark on our calendars almost the exact day that Iran will have a \nnuclear weapon. This isn't a Republican or Democratic issue. Just \nlisten to some of the quotes from my friends on the other side of the \naisle: ``The JCPOA, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, legitimizes \nIran's nuclear program.''\n  Another quote: ``Whether or not the supporters of the agreement admit \nit, this deal is based on `hope'--hope is a part of human nature, but \nunfortunately it is not a national security strategy.''\n  And, finally, ``To me, the very real risk that Iran will not moderate \nand will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goal is \ntoo great.''\n  In what the administration would call an exchange for this, we see \nthe economic sanctions will be lifted, arms embargoes will be lifted, \nand Iran will have more money and more dangerous weapons to route to \ngroups like Hezbollah and insurgents in Iraq--both groups responsible \nfor the deaths of many American soldiers. That is not a gamble; that is \nthe wrong direction at the wrong time, the wrong deal, and absolutely, \npositively, unequivocally not in the best interests of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am glad to be here and hear the comments \nfrom my friend from South Carolina, Senator Scott. It made me glad that \nI get to sit by him on the Senate floor and hear the reasons--and they \nare good and they have been repeated many times--about why this is not \na way forward for the United States. It is not a way forward for the \nMiddle East. In fact, Senator Scott did a great job talking about what \nwas in the deal, but what wasn't in the deal was what the President \nsaid would be there when the negotiations started.\n  When the negotiations started, the administration said Iran would \nnever be allowed to have nuclear weapons, that we would find out \neverything Iran had ever done to try to develop nuclear weapons, that \nwe would have anywhere, anytime inspections, and the sanctions would \nonly be lifted when real progress was made in those first three areas. \nThat was the framework. That was what we were negotiating for. None of \nthose things happened. None of those things are in this agreement.\n  I think the question that you, I, and others in the Senate are \nhearing from people, when we are home and when we are talking to people \nabout this agreement is, Is the Congress giving away its power? How is \nit possible that something like this could happen and the majority of \nthe Congress couldn't do anything to stop it? Of course, the other \nquestion is, Is the President giving away the power of the United \nStates of America to lead?\n  I think it is as clear from this agreement as it is so many other \nthings that leading from behind doesn't work. A view that the United \nStates of America is just any other country in the world is not a view \nthat leads to a peaceful, more stable world. In fact, our friends don't \ntrust us and our enemies aren't afraid of us in a world where there is \nvast agreement there are more potential bad things that could happen \nfrom more potential places than any time ever before. That is not just \nRepublicans; that is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that is \nthe Director of National Intelligence, and that is the head of the CIA. \nThey all come up with that same conclusion.\n  We look at the President's foreign policy, that this is just one \nsymptom of--remember the redline in Syria that if the Syrians do this, \nwe are going to do that? The Syrians did what we said we wouldn't allow \nthem to do. Basically, we didn't do much of anything. In fact, what \nhappens is that when the United States of America takes that kind of \nposition and does not move forward, Assad is emboldened. I think the \nlatest number of Syrians who have been killed by Assad is now around \n250,000 people, from chemical weapons to barrel bombs, to every way \nthey can think of to massacre their own population--a population that \nhas been displaced in the millions, both inside and now outside the \ncountry--so an emboldened Assad. Putin looked at this. Before you know \nit, Putin took control of Crimea, and Putin has Russian troops in \nUkraine. And this week Putin put Russian troops and tanks in Syria.\n\n  Every American President since President Truman--I am standing at one \nof the desks President Truman used as a Senator on the floor, and it \nhas his name carved in it. In 1946 President Truman did whatever was \nnecessary to force the Soviets out of Iran. Every other President until \nnow has done whatever was necessary to keep the Russian influence in \nthe Middle East to a minimum. The Russians are building a base and \nunloading equipment right now. Why are things happening now? Because \nthey think they can get away with it. That is the Russian reset. The \nChinese--the Asian pivot--are building an island on an atoll in the \nSouth China Sea that is within striking range of the Philippines. Why? \nBecause they think they can get away with it.\n  The more we look at the consequences of the agreement, the more we \nwonder about it. Why aren't we able to stop it? No future \nadministration is bound by it. For weeks now on this floor and around \nthe country, people have talked about the destabilizing impact this \nagreement will have on the Middle East and the world, and the only \nadministration that is bound by it is this one. It is not a treaty. If \nit were a treaty, as it should be, we would be voting in the Senate on \na treaty and two-thirds of the Senators would have to approve the \ntreaty and the next administration would be bound by it as well.\n  When Presidential candidates say ``I will reverse this the first \nday,'' they absolutely can reverse it the first day. What kind of \npolicy is that to put in place, a policy that has this kind of \ndestabilizing effect without even a sense that the United States for \nthe long term is committed to it?\n  I am sure the President believes that by the time he leaves, every \nother President would surely want to keep this agreement. But I don't \nknow how one could listen to this debate and think that. It does \ndramatically change the Middle East. Neighboring countries don't trust \nIran, and they will want to have whatever weapons Iran has.\n  Senator Scott just made the point--and made it well--that you can \ncircle the date on the calendar of when Iran is likely to have a \nnuclear weapon if this agreement goes forward, and more importantly, \nthe hope that maybe the government would change--it might, but that \nwon't keep the neighbors from deciding they have to defend themselves.\n  As if the 1994 agreement with North Korea wasn't bad enough--they had \na missile announcement today, I believe,\n\n[[Page S6623]]\n\nand said they have a better delivery system for the weapon they were \nnever going to have--we have truly let the nuclear genie out of the \nbottle here. Their neighbors will believe they will have to have a \nweapon when Iran has one, and they also all believe Iran will cheat.\n  Even though Iran is theoretically on a 12-month clock, it might not \nbe 12 months from the day they say: We are now going into full weapons \nmode and 12 months from now we will have one. So even if Iran were to \nchange its mind, we will have three or four countries in a very short \nperiod of time, in my view, that will have nuclear weapons and nuclear \nweapons capability that don't have it right now.\n  We met with Secretary of State John Kerry at the Munich Security \nConference in 2014--a conference a handful of Senators normally go to, \nand I went to that conference that year. John Kerry said: We will be \nable to know everything the Iranians are doing. We will be able to \nmonitor this with such detail that there is no way they will be able to \ndo anything we don't know about.\n  At the time, I said to Secretary Kerry: Even if that is true--and I \nsaid I don't believe that will be true--you won't be able to contain \nenrichment. Once you let Iran do this, other countries that are \nperfectly happy with where they are right now will feel as if they have \nto do the same thing. There are well over one dozen countries that have \nnuclear power that don't do what we are about to allow Iran to do. We \nhave been able to control this because the world has understood that it \nneeded to be controlled, but we are now at the beginning of letting \nthis get out of control.\n  What is the vote all about? It is not a treaty. Why are we voting at \nall if it doesn't bind the next administration? Why are we having a \ndebate if the administration would like to have the Congress involved \nin about 2023? That was another great comment that was often made \nbefore the law was passed to allow us to do what we are doing today. \nThey said: Well, Congress will eventually have to be involved because \neventually they will decide whether to extend the sanctions regime.\n  By the way, the one that went into effect in 2013 is on the books \nuntil 2023. So the ideal day for the Congress to be involved was about \n7 years after the administration left office. That would have been the \ninvolvement we would have had if Congress had not stepped up and said: \nWe are going to insist that we get involved.\n  In 2006 Congress took back some of the authority--this is not the \nfirst Congress to lose authority to the President--the President had, \nand we put into law the sanctions that had been imposed by the \nPresident at that time. We made them not just President Bush's idea but \na law. I was there when that was negotiated, and one of the things we \ndid when we negotiated that was to insist that that be codified and \nbecome the pattern--and it did--for all the sanctions to follow.\n  But the pattern that Congress followed was also a pattern that had \nbeen followed since World War II, which is, here is what we are going \nto do and here is what we believe the President and the country should \ndo, but we are going to give the President national security waiver \nauthority. That is the authority the President has decided to use \nwithout congressional approval, without changing the law. He has \ndecided he is going to waive these sanctions and the Congress could \nweigh in again in about 2023--if the President had totally had his way.\n  What are we doing here? The President of the United States is about \nto prop up the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world. That is \nan inarguable point. Nobody argues that Iran is not the No. 1 state \nsponsor of terrorism in the world. They clearly look stronger at the \nend of this deal than they did at the beginning because they are \nstronger.\n  The President of the United States is about to release billions of \ndollars that the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism in the world can use \nfor terrorist causes, with the support of a minority of the Congress--\nnot only a minority of the Congress, but that minority happens to all \nbe on one side. There is nothing like this in the post-war history of \nthe country where the country stepped forward in this way on this big \nof an issue. Not only is a majority against it, but a bipartisan \nmajority is opposed to it. A partisan minority is blocking the Congress \nfrom even having a vote while a bipartisan majority wants to vote, and \nthey want to vote to disapprove this deal. Even then the President \ncould still veto the disapproval, but the President doesn't want to do \nthat. The President doesn't want this on his desk.\n  I think I read the stories the other day when we for the first time \ncouldn't get the 60 Senators necessary to have the vote. The White \nHouse announcement was something like this: The congressional vote \ntoday ensured that the President's Iranian deal would go forward. The \nwhole time, my concern about this process is that by not stopping it, \nsomehow it would look as if the Congress was for it. We may not be able \nto stop it, but I can guarantee that Congress is not for it, and \nanybody who has been paying attention knows that.\n  A question I think we can ask ourselves: Would Congress and the \ncountry be better off without this poor substitute for overseeing a \nmeaningful foreign policy? This is clearly not producing the kind of \nresult a democracy should produce in foreign policy. I think one could \nargue that it is a weak response. But why did it have to happen?\n  I cosponsored the initial bill that required Congress to approve the \ndeal, but, of course, a piece of legislation has to be signed by the \nPresident. Senator Corker and Senator Cardin finally came up with a \npiece of legislation that the President would sign, but it was almost \nalways guaranteed to ensure that the debate would go forward. So would \nwe have been better off without it? I have had people ask me: What are \nyou guys doing? Why can't you get the foreign policy of the country \nunder some control?\n  I have wondered several times whether we would have been better off \ngoing forward without it. As I have thought about that, it does seem to \nme that the Corker-Cardin bill has produced a number of things, and one \nof those is that we have 60 days of debate that we wouldn't have had \notherwise. When would the Congress have gotten to weigh in? Eight years \nfrom now. We would have had the debate 8 years from now. We have had 60 \ndays of debate. Well over 50 percent of the people in the country are \nopposed to going forward with this deal. Only about 21 percent are for \ngoing forward.\n  This process has produced bipartisan opposition to a bad deal. \nSenator Cardin, a top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and \nSenator Menendez, the other most knowledgeable Democrat on foreign \naffairs, Senator Schumer, and Senator Manchin voted with the 54 \nRepublicans. So 58 Senators don't want this to happen, and 60 percent \nof the House of Representatives are opposing this agreement. The White \nHouse would have liked to have Congress have a say almost a decade from \nnow.\n  We have had our say, and we should have our vote. We should be \nallowed to put this bill on the President's desk, and if he wants to \nveto it and defend that veto, that is how this process should work.\n  I hope there is still a chance that two more of our colleagues will \nstep forward and say: While I am going to be on the other side of the \nfinal vote, I think the Congress should vote. We had 98 Members vote \nfor this bill that said Congress should vote to either approve or \ndisapprove this agreement. Let's have that vote, and let's have that \nvote today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri in every respect, and I hope we get our wish to have that \nmeaningful vote later on today.\n  I thought I would take a few moments to explore a history lesson. \nEdmond Burke once famously said: ``Those who don't know history are \ndestined to repeat it.'' I think most people agree with that statement, \nwhich is why we find so many variations of that quote. One of my \nfavorite variations is by Mark Twain: ``History doesn't always repeat \nitself, but it does rhyme.''\n  I think the history of events leading up to World War II is an \nappropriate\n\n[[Page S6624]]\n\nperiod for examination during today's Iran debate, and I believe it is \nimportant to explore the question of whether the disastrous history of \nthe Munich Agreement can be instructive to Americans and even to our \nallies during the current debate. Munich has been cited numerous times \nin opinion pieces about the Iran agreement, and it has been mentioned \non both sides of the debate in this Chamber. Furthermore, we have been \ncautioned, even scolded by various opinion-makers around the country \nthat we dare not make comparisons between Munich and the current \nsituation. In this view, even uttering the words ``Neville \nChamberlain'' or ``Munich'' brings to mind such painful memories from \nthe dark past that we simply should not go there. I do not agree. If \nhistory does rhyme, perhaps it is helpful to examine history and look \nfor parallels today.\n  For those who may not have recently studied the years leading up to \nWorld War II, let's review the Munich Agreement. In September of 1938, \nHitler's aggression was fully underway. In his sights at the moment was \nCzechoslovakia. Leaders met in Munich, Germany, in an ostensible effort \nto avoid war. Those leaders were Adolf Hitler himself, French Prime \nMinister Edouard Daladier, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, and \nBritain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The agreement they \nannounced with much fanfare at the end of September 1938 was that Nazi \nGermany would be given control of the German-speaking portion of \nCzechoslovakia, known by some as the Sudetenland. In return, Hitler \nagreed to stop his advance and to not make war. Against the backdrop of \nall of Germany's aggression to date, of its violations of the \nVersailles treaty, the Fuhrer gave his solemn assurance in writing that \nthere would be no more expansionist activity.\n\n  We all know that upon his return to London, Chamberlain announced \ntriumphantly that there would be ``peace for our time.'' The bold \nheadline across the top of the Daily Express displayed the word \n``peace'' with an exclamation point.\n  Of course, a number of wise people immediately saw the false dream \nfor what it was. Soon after, Winston Churchill rose in passionate \nopposition on the floor of Commons. He first made it clear that he held \nthe opponents of the agreement in high personal regard, as many of my \ncolleagues have also done already during this debate. Then he launched \ninto a scathing denunciation of the bad deal, characterizing it as a \ntotal and unmitigated defeat for Britain and France, not to mention a \nbetrayal of defenseless Czechoslovakia. He went on to predict correctly \nthat rather than preventing war, the Munich accord would assure war.\n  Sadly, for millions and millions around the globe, Winston Churchill \nwas correct and Neville Chamberlain was tragically mistaken. Within \nmonths, Hitler was at it again, annexing the rest of Czechoslovakia and \nsetting his sights on Poland and beyond.\n  I think it is appropriate to ask ourselves: What would Churchill have \nsaid about today's debate? And what would Chamberlain be saying if he \ncould speak to us today?\n  Let's look at the parallels. At Munich, Britain and France abandoned \na steadfast ally. Similarly, today's agreement has been reached over \nthe strenuous objections of Israel, our most reliable partner in the \nMiddle East. I must emphasize that this opposition comes not only from \nthe current Prime Minister and his Likud governing majority, but also \nfrom his opponents in previous elections--from virtually every point on \nIsrael's political spectrum, from labor and from center-left voices. \nHere is the near unanimous outcry from our Israeli friends: Iran poses \nan existential threat to Israel, and this bad deal makes matters worse. \nIt makes us less safe. It makes our friends, our neighbors less safe.\n  As the whole world watched, the Munich agreement sent a chilling \nmessage to the rest of Europe and to the rest of the world about what \ncould now be expected from France and England. Today, our Sunni Arab \nfriends in the Middle East are mystified and dismayed by this Iran \ndeal. Understandably, their public reaction has been guarded and even \nmuted. Most are hedging their bets, but make no mistake, this is not \nthe strong anti-proliferation nuclear agreement they had hoped for.\n  This current deal and the Munich deal are also similar when we \nconsider the history and behavior of the parties to the agreements. \nLike Hitler, the current Iranian regime has repeatedly demonstrated \nthat they have evil motivations and that they cannot be trusted. \nConsider the most recent activities and pronouncements of the Iranian \nSupreme Leader and his team.\n  This deal has been made with a regime that still leads cheers saying \n``Death to America'' and believes in the destruction of the Jewish \nState. The mullahs, the ayatollahs, and the people in charge of Iran \nhave shown no indication that they are trustworthy. Ayatollah Khamenei \nlast month published a new book that once again makes it explicit that \nit is Iran's foreign policy to obliterate the State of Israel. Just \nlast week, he called America the Great Satan and said Israel would not \nexist in 25 years. Israel would not exist in 25 years, according to the \nother party to this agreement.\n  Under this agreement, embargoes on arms and ballistic missiles will \nbe lifted in 5 and 8 years respectively, allowing the biggest exporter \nof terrorism to build up conventional weapons. And have we forgotten \nthe fact that Iran has been cooperating with North Korea on ballistic \nmissiles for years?\n  Of course, the scene in 1938 is not entirely similar with that of \ntoday, as has been pointed out. Seventy-seven years ago, Nazi Germany \nat least gave lip service to leaving the rest of the world alone. Wise \npeople knew this to be a lie, but at least the Nazi dictator signed \nsuch a promise. Today, the Iranian dictatorship makes no pretense of \nabandoning its goal: the complete elimination of Israel from the map. \nAnd this bad deal gives them the wherewithal to do just that: a $100-\nbillion stimulus. The lifting of sanctions, which the United States and \nour eager European allies have agreed to, will expand Iran's gross \ndomestic product by roughly one-fifth, not to mention relief from \nsanctions on deadly conventional weapons and ballistic missiles.\n\n  In 1938, Chamberlain said, ``Peace for our time.'' We may wish he had \nbeen correct, but such an outcome was so unlikely, the deal so risky \nand ill-advised, that it was merely a wish, albeit a dangerous and \ndeadly wish.\n  In 2015, Secretary John Kerry has called the current deal ``a plan to \nensure that Iran does not ever possess or acquire a nuclear weapon.'' \nDid my colleagues hear that: Not just for our time or for a decade, but \nnever, according to the distinguished Secretary of State.\n  President Obama says this agreement marks ``one more chapter in this \npursuit of a safer, more helpful, and more hopeful world.'' Such \nstatements have a familiar and troubling ring. Such words could have \nbeen uttered in 1938. And I wonder if Mr. Chamberlain's followers ever \nsaid, in defense of the Prime Minister's action: This isn't a very good \ndeal, but what other agreement is out there? What other choice do we \nhave? I am willing to bet some people actually said that. The other \nchoice might have been to stand up against a murderous bully, to stand \nby a friend.\n  This resolution of disapproval is not just an opportunity to sound \noff. It has not been about sending a message. This procedure was \ndesigned, as the distinguished Senator from Missouri said before me, as \nthe only way to prevent a bad Iran deal from actually going into \neffect. We always realized it would take a bipartisan majority to \nsucceed. There are currently 58 Democrats and Republicans who are \nwilling to say officially to the President: Start over and get our \nNation a better deal. We, frankly, need nine more courageous Senators \nto step forward and say no to this deal. We are told the die is now \ncast, that the votes simply are not there. But I will say to my \ncolleagues today, there is still time to do better for the American \npeople. The doubts have repeatedly been expressed by Senators who have \nsaid they will nevertheless vote with the President.\n  Senator Booker, in announcing that he will support the President, \nsaid: We are legitimizing Iran's nuclear program and rewarding years of \nbad behavior. Yet, he will vote to support the President.\n  Senator Coons: I am troubled and deeply concerned.\n  Senator Bennet: None of us knows . . . and I have deep concerns.\n\n[[Page S6625]]\n\n  Senator Wyden: It is a big problem, having to deal with Iranian \nleadership that wants a nuclear enrichment program.\n  Senator Peters: Enrichment of uranium is a stark departure from \nAmerica's nonproliferation policies. Indeed it is. Senator Peters goes \non to say: The agreement could set a dangerous precedent.\n  We need these Senators to change their vote and to vote for the \nresolution of disapproval.\n  Senator Blumenthal said: Not the agreement I have sought.\n  Senator Merkley said: Significant shortcomings.\n  According to Senator Gillibrand: Legitimate and serious concerns are \nthere.\n  Senator Franken acknowledges it isn't a perfect agreement.\n  Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard law professor emeritus and expert on the \nMiddle East--and hardly a neo-con--summed up the President's deal with \nIran in his book, ``The Case Against the Iran Deal.'' He said this:\n\n       Hope is different from `faith,' though neither is an \n     appropriate basis on which to `roll the dice' on a nuclear \n     deal that might well threaten the security of the world.\n\n  ``That may well threaten the security of the world,'' according to \nProfessor Dershowitz.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The deal as currently written will not prevent Iran from \n     obtaining nuclear weapons. In all probability, it will merely \n     postpone the catastrophe for about a decade, while \n     legitimizing its occurrence. This is not an outcome we can \n     live with.\n\n  I appreciate people such as Alan Dershowitz having the courage to \nwrite a book and explain chapter and verse, page by page, the \nlegitimate reasons why this threatens the security of the world and why \nAmerica should not be willing to live with this deal.\n  I say we should heed the warnings of people such as Alan Dershowitz. \nWe should heed the warnings of history. There is still time to reject \nthis ill-advised agreement. There is still time to get a better result \nfor our people, to get a better result for our future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Seeing no other speakers, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I do have concerns as well. Typically we \nreward people for a change of behavior; that is good behavior, going \nfrom bad to good--not static, old, bad behavior. The concern I have is \nwith Iran. We have seen no change in behavior. The same battles are \nhappening in Yemen as they are leading a coup. The same issues are \nhappening in Syria where Russia and Iran are working together to prop \nup Bashar al-Assad. They are causing trouble in Bahrain. There is the \nsame behavior in Lebanon with Hezbollah. There has been no change in \nbehavior. Yet, the administration is determined to make an aggressive \nnuclear deal to change the status quo on our sanctions on Iran based on \nthe hope of some future new good behavior when we have seen no present \nchange in the behavior of Iran.\n  This doesn't line up with some of the statements from our own \nadministration. For instance, in November of 2013, Secretary Kerry said \nthat ``there is no inherent right to enrich. . . . We do not recognize \na right to enrich.''\n  In December 2013, President Obama said, ``we know [fully that] they \ndon't need to have an underground, fortified facility like Fordow in \norder to have a peaceful nuclear program.''\n  At the same time, in December of 2013, President Obama said, ``They \ndon't need some of the advanced centrifuges that they currently possess \nin order to have a limited, peaceful nuclear program.''\n  But under this deal, not only are we giving them the right to enrich, \nnot only are we allowing them to have fortified underground bunkers, we \nare also allowing them to have advanced centrifuges that the President \nhas stated there is actually no reason for them to have, unless they \nare not using them for peaceful purposes.\n  I have heard over and over again for the last several days in this \nChamber the conversation: If someone has a better deal, you should \npropose it, but this is the best deal that has been proposed.\n  Well, let me just throw a few ideas out there as a better deal for a \nproposal.\n  First, why don't we do this as a proposal: Why don't we actually have \nthe opportunity to read the agreement? We would like to be able to see \nit. No one in this Chamber has seen all aspects of this agreement. No \none in the House has seen all aspects of the agreement. It is not that \nwe will not read it, we can't read it, because even the administration \nhas said they have not read the entire agreement.\n  Now, I will state that we don't allow secret side deals between a \nbank and a car dealer when one is buying a used car. We certainly don't \nallow secret side deals that no one can see between the U.N. and Iran. \nI am astounded that this body is OK with signing off on an agreement \nthat absolutely no one has read in its entirety. In fact, the \nadministration has said they haven't even seen it.\n  The White House wants to have it both ways. They don't want to turn \nover the documents which the statute requires, but they also want to \nkeep the part of the law that says Congress has only 60 days to review \nit. They want to say that by the end of this week it is done--but, no, \nwe are not ever going to turn the documents over that the statute \nrequires.\n  How about this for a different idea of what we can do for an \nagreement: They don't keep the advanced centrifuges. Since even the \nPresident has said there is no peaceful purpose for those centrifuges, \nif we are going to have a good, solid agreement, they do not keep the \nadvanced centrifuges. Not only do they keep them, they keep them in \ncascade, they keep them running, they keep them spinning. There is no \nchange in behavior on those centrifuges other than the promise that \nthey won't put uranium in them.\n  How about this for an idea for a better agreement: We have onsite \ninspections that would actually allow Americans on the inspection team.\n  How about this for a better agreement: We don't lift the ban on \nmissile testing and research on Iran which allows Iran to start missile \ntesting and R again on ballistic missiles. We don't lift the ban on \nconventional weapons sales to Iran, which will allow Iran to start \nbuying large supplies of conventional weapons and surface-to-air \ndefense systems.\n  How about this change for a better agreement: Iran turns over their \nprevious military dimensions of their nuclear program. They stated over \nand over again they don't have a nuclear weapons program or ambitions. \nWhat would be the problem, then, in inspecting their research \nfacilities and their technology if nothing existed?\n  How about this for a better agreement: We don't agree to defend Iran \nin case in some future time they are attacked in their nuclear \nfacilities by Israel. I think that is absolutely absurd to have in this \nagreement.\n  How about this: We at least allow Iran the opportunity to publicly \nacknowledge that Israel has the right to exist--and they currently \ndon't acknowledge that Israel even has the right to exist--or we get \nour American hostages back, since we are lifting the sanctions on the \nindividuals who personally killed hundreds of American soldiers. Those \nsanctions are lifted. Why can't we have our American hostages back?\n  Here is one simple idea: Why don't we have the same nuclear agreement \nwith Iran that we had with Libya? When we negotiated the agreement with \nLibya years ago, their program actually ended. They actually turned \ntheir centrifuges over. They turned their nuclear material over. They \nallowed anytime inspections. While this administration continues to say \nover and over again that what we are asking for is not possible, it was \nactually done by the last administration in Libya.\n  This is not asking for something new or radical or different. This is \nasking for something enforceable and clear. Why can't we have the same \nnuclear agreement with Iran that we made with Libya and actually stop \nIran from advancing toward a nuclear weapon?\n  I am convinced we can do better--we must, for the security of the \nNation as a whole.\n\n[[Page S6626]]\n\n  With that, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a few hours from now the Senate will vote \nagain on the Iranian deal. I think it is pretty well known that no \nvotes will change. It is very unfortunate that that is the case. But it \nwill give our colleagues, hopefully--they may have contemplated how bad \na deal this is and possibly change, but obviously we know the \nlikelihood of that is unlikely.\n  The virtues of this legislation have been emphasized by my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. Those of us who have grave and serious \nconcerns have also been articulated. But I think it is well to point \nout that this will be the first major agreement or treaty in history \nthat is voted on on strict party lines. Not one single Senator on this \nside of the aisle will be voting in favor--not one--a degree of \npartisanship concerning an issue of the greatest importance, in my \nview, of any treaty or agreement since that agreement Neville \nChamberlain made with Adolph Hitler in Munich in 1938. So that part of \nit, in my view, is a failure on the part of the President of the United \nStates.\n  I know many of us, including myself, were willing to listen and \nconsider any agreement that was verifiable and enforceable that would \nhave prevented the Iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons. In fact, it \nwas stated by the Secretary of State that the object of this agreement \nwas that Iran would never have nuclear capability. Now we all know it \nis a matter of time. Whether it is 1 month or 10 years or 15 years, \nwhatever, we don't know. They notoriously cheat. That is one thing we \ndo know. So the fact is that we went from preventing Iran from having a \nnuclear capability--and they came to the table not because of renewed \nzeal for that but because their economy was so badly hurt because of \nthe sanctions which had been imposed on them and which after this deal \ncan never be reimposed. Let's be frank and candid with our colleagues \nand with the American people.\n  So here we are faced with an agreement that should have been a \ntreaty. I know of no observers of the Constitution, both known as \nliberal interpreters and conservatives, who interpret the Constitution \nwho agree that this is anything but a treaty of transcendent \nimportance, and we, of course, are treating it as an ``agreement.'' \nWell, the bad news, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who will be voting for this, is the next President of the United \nStates can repeal this, can negate it. That would not have been the \ncase if it was a treaty because then it would have been ratified by the \nConstitution and the Congress, specifically the Senate.\n  So, in the short term, apparently the President and his minions have \nsucceeded. In the long term, this will cause a grave threat to the \nsecurity of the United States of America.\n  I say to my colleagues, you know, this is an agreement that we are \ndiscussing, and I will talk about the failings of it as I see them, but \nfar more importantly, the President of the United States and the \nSecretary of State treat this as if it were in a vacuum. It is not in a \nvacuum. You cannot consider this agreement unless you look at what is \nhappening in the entire world today.\n\n\n                 Refugee Crisis and American Leadership\n\n  Mr. President, according to anyone who is an expert on national \nsecurity, including people such as Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, \nBrent Scowcroft, and the list goes on and on, the world has never been \nin more turmoil than it is today. That does not take a great deal of \nintelligence or study; all you have to do is watch television or read a \nnewspaper. The United Nations head of refugees has said: There have \nnever been more refugees in the world since World War II than there are \ntoday. You can't turn on the television without seeing the terrible \nplight of these refugees who have had to flee their country because of \nthe brutality and genocide committed by Bashar Assad. You can't do that \nwithout seeing it.\n  Some in the media and some of my friends on the liberal side treat \nthis as if it were a hurricane, an earthquake, a natural disaster that \njust sort of happened. It did not just happen, and it did not have to \nhappen. What has happened with these refugees is a direct result of the \nfailed, feckless policies of this administration in general and this \nPresident in particular.\n  This is the President of the United States who overruled his national \nsecurity team when they said that we should arm and equip and train the \nFree Syrian Army to go in there and fight against Bashar Assad. This is \nthe same President who said: It is not a matter of when, it is a matter \nof whether Bashar Assad leaves office. This is the same President of \nthe United States who announced to the world that Bashar Assad had \ncrossed the redline and we were going to retaliate--only, of course, to \nhear that the President decided not to.\n  I tell my colleagues, you cannot overstate the impact the President's \ndecision had after he warned Bashar Assad, after he said that if they \ncrossed the redline we would act and we did not. I am not sure many \nAmericans are aware that the Saudis had aircraft on the runways ready \nto join in those attacks and they found out on CNN. Is it an accident \nthat we have seen the Saudis visiting Moscow? Is it an accident that \nfor the first time in its history we see the Saudis buying Russian \nequipment? Is it astonishing to our colleagues and friends that the \nSaudis have taken it upon themselves, along with UAE and other Gulf \nStates, to intervene in Yemen against the Houthis, who are Iranian-\nbacked, Iranian-trained, Iranian-equipped? No, it is not an accident. \nNone of these things have happened by accident.\n  Now we see a nation called Syria with over 230,000 killed and \nmillions in refugee status. The surrounding countries, particularly the \nsmall ones, particularly Jordan and Lebanon, are literally overwhelmed \nwith refugees. Today, I tell my colleagues, there are more Syrian \nchildren in school in Lebanon than there are Lebanese children in \nLebanon. When you look at the size of the influx of the refugees into \nthose two countries, some wonder in some ways how they have maintained \ntheir stability.\n  All of it did not have to happen. It did not have to happen.\n  The President of the United States decided to withdraw every single \none of our combat troops in Iraq, saying at the time: We are leaving a \nprosperous, free, democratic Iraq. Does anybody believe that? Of \ncourse, so many of us argued: Please, leave a sustaining force behind--\nwhich they could have. Anyone who says we couldn't have is lying. I \ndon't use that word casually because Lindsey Graham and John McCain \nwere in Baghdad when Maliki said: OK. He said: OK. I will keep troops. \nI will keep American troops. How many? How many and what mission?\n  That answer never came from this administration until the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee that it was down to 3,500--in his words, it cascaded down to \n3,500.\n  So now here we are with the greatest humanitarian crisis, again, \nsince World War II, 70 years ago. Here we are with this situation, and \nAmericans' hearts are going out to these people. Can any of us who saw \nthe picture of the drowned little baby on the beach ever forget that? \nIt did not have to happen. It was because this President and this \nadministration and its minions refused to exercise American leadership \nwhen we refused to arm and equip and train the Free Syrian Army, \noverruling his then-Secretary of Defense, Panetta; overruling his then-\nSecretary of State, Clinton; overruling his Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, GEN David Petraeus. It is well known that they all \nrecommended arming the Free Syrian Army. At that time, Bashar Assad was \nin serious jeopardy. So what happened? The Iranians--the same Iranians \nwe are concluding this deal with--called in 5,000 Hezbollah, had \nSoleimani in charge of the Iranian\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\nRevolutionary Guard while tens of thousands have been slaughtered--\nwell, 230,000 is one estimate--with barrel bombing.\n  Do you know what barrel bombing is? It is a huge cylinder. It is \nfilled with explosives and shrapnel. They drop it. It explodes, and it \nspreads shrapnel everywhere. It is a terrible weapon. It is a terrible \nweapon. Bashar Assad has been using it continuously. Who is giving him \nthat stuff to use? The Iranians. The Iranians are the ones who are \ndoing it.\n  It is the Iranians who are supporting the Shiite militias in Baghdad. \nIt is the Iranians who are supporting the Houthis, who have taken over \na great part of Yemen and would have taken over all of it if it had \nbeen up to us as we sat by and watched. The Saudis and UAE have decided \nto go in because they could not afford to have--look at where Yemen is \non the map--they could not afford to have Yemen under the control of \nthe Iranians.\n  So here we are. So here we are. Now the news of the last few days \nis--guess what. The Russians are now building bases--a serious military \nbuildup in Syria. Why? Because they have to prop up Bashar al-Assad. \nThis misguided, delusional administration thinks that only they can \nattack ISIS and not attack Bashar al-Assad and his killing machine.\n\n  My friends, in the name of human decency, in the name of the \ntradition of the United States of America helping those who are being \nslaughtered, we should tell Bashar al-Assad: You cannot fly those \nhelicopters and those planes anymore and drop these terrible weapons. \nWe are going to shoot you down if you do it. We are going to establish \na free--safe zone on the Turkish border. We are going to have the \nrefugees go there, and we are going to feed them, we are going to \nclothe them, and we are going to take care of them. And don't you fly \nan airplane over here or we are going to shoot it down.\n  That is the message we should have to Bashar al-Assad. And now, what \nis happening now? The Russians have decided they are going to intervene \nmilitarily on the side of Bashar al-Assad.\n  Now, my friends, it has been Vladimir Putin's practice and ambition \nto expand the ``near abroad.'' That means moving into Ukraine, taking \nCrimea in violation of the Budapest agreement, it means putting huge \npressure on the Baltics, and it means propaganda campaigns and other \npressures that are even on countries such as Sweden and Norway in the \nArctic. All these things Vladimir Putin is doing is sort of an \nexpanding influence from Russia.\n  Now, my dear friends, you see him leapfrogging over to Syria to \nmaintain his base on the Mediterranean and that is a somewhat radical \ndeparture. But not to worry, my friends, the Secretary of State called \nthe Foreign Minister, Lavrov--the old Stalinite apparatchik that he \nis--and expressed his concern. So the American Government expressed \ntheir concern. Well, that ought to pretty well take care of it.\n  Meanwhile, what about China? In the last day or two, there was a \nmeeting, and a Chinese admiral, sitting between an American admiral and \nanother admiral, stated: ``The South China Sea belongs to China.''\n  A few days ago, the President of the United States went to Alaska to \nrename a mountain. I guess that is a reason for a trip. I will leave \nthat to others to judge. So he goes to Alaska and guess what happened. \nBy coincidence--by sheer coincidence--for the first time in history, \nfive Chinese warships showed up off the coast of Alaska, penetrating \nthe 12-mile zone--the first time in history. Now, I am sure that was \njust a coincidence that the President of the United States happened to \nbe in Alaska at the time that these Chinese ships showed up off the \ncoast of Alaska. Every time we turn around, we are seeing nations react \nto a lack of American leadership.\n  And so we are going to, of course, now vote--not to approve this \nagreement, because if it was a straight up-or-down vote, it would be a \ndisapproval. It would be a significant disapproval, as a matter of \nfact--just not 60. I believe it is 57 or 58 Senators who will vote that \nthey do not want to have the sanctions relieved that have been imposed \nby the Congress.\n  It is a sad day. It is a sad day. Just as briefly as possible--\nbecause we have been over all of these before--there is no doubt there \nare almost no enforcement and verification procedures. In fact, again, \nthis is for the first time I think that the Senate of the United States \nis being asked to approve of an arms control agreement--which is \nbasically what this is when you get right down to it--without knowing \nthe verification procedures. It is a deal between the IAEA and Iran. I \nstill don't get it how anybody can support an agreement that we don't \nknow the most vital elements of. That is still beyond me.\n  Obviously, in the place where we found most of--some of their real \nsecret activity buried in a mountain, that inspection will be conducted \nby the Iranians themselves. Remarkable.\n  Of course, the past nuclear activities, so-called PMD, one of the \nrequirements--one of the interesting aspects of this is to see what was \nsaid at the time in the beginning and what actually happened, such as \nthe Secretary of State saying: We must know what their previous \nmilitary activities were. We must know that because otherwise we \ncannot--guess what. We are not going to know that. Particularly, \nthough, the aspect of verification bothers me about as much as anything \nelse.\n  So now we have the Iranian Revolutionary Guard sustaining the Shia \nmilitias in Iraq. We have the Iranians funding Hezbollah, which is now \nthe major problem for the Bashar al-Assad regime. We now have the \nIranians supporting the Houthis, who, as I mentioned, are trained and \nequipped by the Iranians in an attempt to take over Yemen. The Iranians \nare now providing weapons to the Taliban in Afghanistan.\n  If they are doing all those things, and they are not changing their \nbehavior, what in the world do you think they are going to do with $100 \nbillion? Spend it on growing poppy, maybe building a YMCA? Of course \nnot. They are going to continue their activities of supporting \nterrorist organizations throughout the Middle East with another $100 \nbillion. This is what troubles me more than anything else. Has anyone \nin this body seen any indication of a change in Iranian behavior? If \nso, I would be more than eager to grasp that straw because everything I \nhave seen--and the statements in just as short a time as 2 or 3 days \nago--the grand Ayatollah says in 25 years Israel will no longer exist.\n  Is that the background, is that the atmosphere of some kind of \nagreement of this nature, where they are going to get $100 billion? It \nis confounding, and it can only be explained by this incredible \ndelusion on the part of the President and the Secretary of State--whom \nhe has had for the last 6\\1/2\\ years--that if we somehow get an \nagreement with the Iranians, there will be an arrangement in the Middle \nEast, and Iran and the United States will be partners against radical \nIslam--yada, yada, yada. That is impossible in light of Iranians' \nstated ambitions, and of course the Israelis--of course the Israelis \nare deeply disturbed.\n  All I can say is this is not a good day. This is not a good day. This \nis a day when votes are taken--again, for the second time--on one of \nthe most impactful situations in the history of this country post-World \nWar II; that is, that this agreement will allow the Iranians, to a \ndegree of latitude and a degree of capability, to spread their terror \nand their acts of terror throughout the Middle East in a far more \neffective fashion.\n  Yes, we are war weary. Yes, Americans don't want to be involved. Yes, \nwe know all of those things, even though it is 1 percent of the \nAmerican population who actually serves in the military, but the fact \nis that sooner or later, as a result of this, the United States of \nAmerica, unfortunately, will have to be engaged militarily.\n  I hate to make that prediction, but I have been a student of what is \ngoing on in the Middle East for a long period of time. I have seen \nIranian behavior, and I have watched what they have done--not just the \nrhetoric but their behavior. They are propping up a guy who has killed \n230,000 of his country's men and women and driven millions into exile. \nNow we are feeling the effects of it in Europe and soon in the United \nStates of America.\n  It is shameful--it is shameful--that we allowed this guy to slaughter \nso many hundreds of thousands of people. And who supported them, who \nbacked them, and who bailed them out when\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\nthe President of the United States said: Oh, it is not a matter of \nwhether Bashar al-Assad leaves, it is a matter of when. The President \nof the United States said: It is time for Bashar al-Assad to leave. \nBashar al-Assad will be in office after this President of the United \nStates. So it is not a good day.\n  There have been other times in our country--there was a good book \nthat was written about America before World War II called ``While \nAmerica Slept.'' There was another great book by a professor at Texas \nA about how unready we were prior to the Korean conflict. We thought \nwe were never going to be in another war, and we were totally \nunprepared when North Korea attacked South Korea.\n  Now here we are--with blame on both sides of the aisle--continuing to \ncut our military, continuing to reduce our capabilities, and continuing \nto reach a point where the retiring Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army \nsays we can no longer adequately defend the Nation against some of its \nthreats, and, to cap it off, we are now going to see an agreement which \nwill unleash the furies of Hell.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Dena Morris\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to thank an \nimportant member of our staff. Her name is Dena Morris, and she is with \nme on the floor today. Dena has worked for me for 12 years. The last 8 \nyears she served as my legislative director, and she is going to be \nleaving soon for a new professional opportunity.\n  When she first told me the news, my first reaction was: ``Say it \nain't so,'' but Dena had an offer she could not refuse. Next week, Dena \nMorris will join the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as \nthe Agency's Washington Director. Her new position, I have to admit, is \na perfect fit. It will allow her to combine her exceptional management \nskills, her deep understanding of public policy, and her strong \ncommitment to public service in ways that will benefit America's \nfamilies and businesses.\n  I already know Dena is going to do well because she has done so much \nfor me, for the people of Illinois, and for our Nation.\n  There is one thing that really tells you a lot about Dena's \ncommitment to public service and the public good. Dena Morris came to \nme 12 years ago. She left a K Street law firm and came to the Senate to \nwork as a staffer. She took a substantial pay cut to do it. She started \nin my office as a legislative assistant handling education issues. Her \nportfolio quickly expanded to include public health and then all of the \nhealth care issues. By 2007, it was clear to me she was the right \nperson to direct all the legislative activity in my office. Even with \nall the promotions and the new titles, Dena still earns less today than \nwhat she earned at that law firm she left 12 years ago.\n  So when I hear my fellow Senators come to the floor and talk down our \nstaffs and talk about denying them basic things such as health care \ncoverage, I think about Dena and the hundreds just like her who make \nthe Senate work. They do it not for the money, not for the benefits but \nbecause they want to leave a mark. Dena has done that. You see, instead \nof making mountains of money, Dena chose to help and to help the Senate \nmake history. For that I am ever grateful.\n  It will take too long to recite all the things she has worked on, but \nI can list a few: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--it was \nthe economic stimulus that was initiated by the Obama administration to \nbring America out of the great recession after the 2008 economic \ncrisis--her work on the Affordable Care Act, which has brought \naffordable, reliable health care to 16 million Americans, including \n800,000 people in my State of Illinois, and reduces the national \ndeficit. Dena was my legislative director when Congress passed the \nfirst Wall Street reform act in 7 years. She helped steer legislation \nto cut the cost of student loans, to help save the American automobile \nindustry, and to give the FDA, at long last, the authority to regulate \ntobacco.\n  Her contributions extend beyond the historic laws that she has helped \nto pass. Probably her greatest contribution, from a very selfish point \nof view, is that Dena Morris assembled my team. She took the time to \nbring together an extraordinary group of bright, committed public \nservants, just like herself, who reflected my values, her values, and \nher work ethic.\n  Lots of people think about Sunday morning as a time to kick back and \nrelax. My staff, and Dena knows this personally, lives in fear of \nSunday morning because that is when I have the time to leisurely go \nthrough the newspapers, to watch television, and to get on my cell \nphone and e-mail my staff about all the new ideas I have for the coming \nweek. It is a drill Dena knows well and which she handles with skill \nand does so effectively. I think it is her daily yoga practice that \nhelps her maintain her even keel.\n  I want to thank her husband Peter Rogoff, who has joined us. He is a \nformer longtime Hill staffer, and I want to give special thanks to \ntheir kids, Niles, now in high school, and Lulu.\n  It was about a year after Dena joined my staff that she brought Niles \nand Lulu to the office for a take-your-children-to-work day. They were \nabout 6 and 4 years old at the time. So I met with all these kids from \nmy staff members, and I said: Do you have any questions? Niles raised \nhis hand, and he looked at me and he said: How come my mom has to work \nso late?\n  It was a funny moment, an embarrassing moment in a way, but I think \nNiles and Lulu know now what the answer is. It is because their mom \ncares so much about what she does and cares so much about the people \nshe can help.\n  That is a bit of a story of Dena Morris' career. When she worked for \nthat K Street law firm, she specialized in advancing legal and civil \nrights for people with disabilities and their families. She started \nthat work just 3 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act became \nlaw. She was on the leading edge of one of America's great civil rights \nstruggles.\n  Two other things worth mentioning: Dena's first job in Washington, \nbefore the law firm, was working as an intern for her home State \nSenator, Dick Lugar of Indiana. It was an unpaid internship, as most of \nthem are. So to pay the rent Dena had to work five nights a week on \nCapitol Hill at another unique Washington institution--the Hawk and \nDove--which happens to be a local popular Capitol Hill watering hole.\n  Finally, Dena is one of six children. Her dad is a Baptist minister. \nIn her whole family of origin--parents and siblings--Dena Morris is the \nonly Democrat. She is a brave woman, and she tells me they do not \nreally talk a lot about politics at family gatherings. Her parents may \nnot share her politics, but I know they share our pride in the work she \nhas done for America.\n  I have no doubt she will continue to use her talent and her energies \nto move our Nation forward.\n  Dena, thank you for your service.\n\n\n                       Syrian Humanitarian Crisis\n\n  Mr. President, I listened to my friend, the Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, and this is the second time I have heard him on the \nfloor talking about the tragedy, the humanitarian crisis associated \nwith Syria. I couldn't agree more.\n  I also take note of that heartbreaking photograph of that 3-year-old \nboy who drowned as his family tried to escape Syria, ultimately bound \nfor Canada. In the crossing of a body of water, their boat capsized, \nand the mother and two children were lost, and the lifeless body of \nthat infant washed up on the shore.\n  When I think back, and people ask, what do you remember about the \nVietnam War, I remember a lot of things, but the image I remember is a \nphotograph of a little girl stripped naked, burned with napalm, running \ndown the road screaming. I can't get that out of my mind. Vietnam--I \nthink of that photo.\n  When I think of Syria, and what is going on with this humanitarian \ncrisis, I think of the photo of that little boy. It is heartbreaking. I \nget emotional thinking about little kids who I love in my family facing \nthat kind of tragedy.\n  There are two things I would like to say. I think it is fundamentally \nunfair to blame the Syrian crisis on this President. This is a crisis \nwhich reflects the Arab Spring, it reflects changes in the Middle East \nthat have been going on for 30 years plus, and no country has really \ncome up with a good solution to stop the bloodshed and killing in \nSyria.\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\n  I am sorry my colleague from Arizona is not here, but I would \nacknowledge and remind him there was a time when the President came to \nus and said: I want to do something. President Obama said: I want to do \nsomething about chemical weapons in Syria. The Senator from Arizona--\nand I might add the Senator from South Carolina--joined us in the \nForeign Relations Committee in moving this issue forward to give the \nPresident the authority to do something to stop the use of chemical \nweapons in Syria, and it died before it came to the floor because there \nwas no support--no support on the floor from the Republican majority in \nthe House or the Senate.\n  So to say this President has not taken action, he has. And you cannot \noverlook the fact the United States of America, through the generosity \nof its taxpayers and the leadership of this President, leads the world \nin humanitarian relief in Syria. We believe we have invested almost $4 \nbillion--more than any other nation on Earth--for these poor people who \nare suffering there.\n  Can we do more? Should we have done more? Of course, in hindsight, \nthings look so much clearer. I pushed for--and this administration is \nworking on something the Senator from Arizona has also endorsed--a \nhumanitarian safe zone. There ought to be a piece of Syria where people \ncan go for medical care and know they are not going to be killed by \nthese barrel bombs and attacks. I know the administration is working on \nthat with Turkey. It has gone very slowly. I wish the pace would pick \nup.\n  A friend of mine, Dr. Sahloul in Chicago, a Syrian American, has made \na dozen trips to Syria, to Lebanon, to Jordan giving free medical \ntreatment to the Syrian refugees, and he tells the story in graphic \nterms--and many times brings back heartbreaking photographs--of what \nthese barrel bombs are doing. I hope we can find some diplomatic or \nmilitary solution in Syria.\n  In the meantime, here is the question we must ask ourselves: What \nwill we do about these millions of refugees? We will give money, of \ncourse, to our allies that are creating camps for them. I visited one \nof those camps in Turkey, and I have to say I was really a great \nadmirer of the leadership of that country in accepting at this one camp \n10,000 people--one camp. And there are many more, hundreds of thousands \nall over the Middle East, fleeing out of that region. So now what will \nwe do about the refugees?\n  The Senator from Arizona reminded us last week these are refugees, \nnot migrants. They are the people who are victims of war who are \nfleeing with their families.\n  On Friday I was in Chicago and met with four of these Syrian families \nwho are now refugees in the United States. They told heartbreaking \nstories of losing members of their families and fleeing from one city \nto another in Syria without any success, then finally leaving, going to \nrefugee camps and trying to come to the United States. Even after they \napplied for refugee status, it took this one family over 14 months to \nmake it here to this country.\n  We have a rich history in the United States of being there for \nrefugees. We can point with some pride to the fact that when Cuba was \ngoing through its upheaval back in the 1950s and 1960s we accepted \nCuban refugees who have become a major part of America today. In fact, \nthe three Hispanic Members of the United States Senate are all Cuban \nAmericans. At least two of them were the product of that exodus--the \nproduct of a refugee status that brought their families to the United \nStates. They are making great contributions for the States they \nrepresent.\n  We did the same thing in the Soviet Union. When the Jewish population \nthere was facing persecution, we stood up and said: We will accept them \nas refugees. Thousands and thousands of Soviet Jews came to the United \nStates and have become an important part of America today.\n  The list goes on: Somalians, Bosnians, the Hmong population out of \nVietnam. So we have a rich history of responding to these humanitarian \ncrises. We need to do it again. What the administration has proposed is \nmodest--10,000--too modest, as far as I am concerned. I believe we \nshould be prepared to accept 100,000--100,000 Syrian refugees.\n  Yes, each and every one of them needs to be carefully checked and \nvetted so we know we are not inviting someone in who is a danger to the \nUnited States. The people I have met in Chicago--the refugees there--\nare just desperate people trying to find a roof over their head, trying \nto find some little work to do to keep what remains of their family \ntogether. Each and every one of them said something interesting. All \nfour of them said they couldn't believe how welcoming America was, how \nfriendly people in America were to the refugees and their families. Mr. \nPresident, that is who we are. That is what America is about. We \nshouldn't be afraid when people who are desperate for some refuge find \nour shores and ask: May we come and join you?\n  I have already had friends in Illinois calling my wife and asking: \nWhat can we do? Can we adopt a Syrian family of refugees to help them \nget started in the United States? I think that story can be replicated \nover and over again, thousands and thousands of times.\n  So I would say to my friend from Arizona, yes, it is outrageous, the \ndeath, the violence, the circumstances in Syria which has forced so \nmany millions of people to move and many of them to lose their lives in \nthe process. And it is heartbreaking to read the stories as they \ndesperately try to find some safe place to live with their families and \nare rejected by countries, some in Europe, that want no part of them. I \nwant America to do its part so that when the future generations look \nback and ask our generation: What did you do when you faced the \ngreatest humanitarian crisis of your time at this moment in history, I \nwant them to be able to point with pride to the fact that we carried on \nthe great American tradition of opening up this country to refugees who \nare looking for a safe place to live with their families.\n  Mr. President, we are in the midst of debating again--again--the Iran \nagreement, an agreement that was brokered by the President with five \nother nations--an agreement to accomplish two things: The agreement was \nto stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and, secondly, it was to \ncreate a safe enough environment that the United States does not have \nto commit military forces or go to war again in the Middle East.\n  I voted for it, and 41 other Democrats joined me. We had this vote \nlast week. It was historic and widely reported. At the end of the vote, \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader, stood up and said: We are \ngoing to do it again. We are going to do it again next week--today--\nTuesday night.\n  I don't know why we are going through a replay of this. There is a \nsuggestion he may do another vote in another few days. Members of the \nSenate have stood up to a person and announced where they stand on this \nissue. Nobody is trying to run away from this issue. It is a \nchallenging issue and a historic vote, and we are all on the record. We \nare there.\n  I don't know why we have these repeat roll calls. I don't know why we \nare going through this again, but that is Senator McConnell's choice. \nOne would think he might want to spend some time on the floor of the \nSenate dealing with some other issues, but he sticks with this one.\n  What happened over in the House of Representatives is hard to \ndescribe. We came together because of a statute passed by the House and \nthe Senate calling for a vote of disapproval of the Iran treaty. Now, \nit has been rejected--that vote of disapproval--here in the Senate. The \nHouse never took it up. The House, instead, had three separate votes, \nnever going to the issue of disapproval. They had three separate votes \non separate issues. The one they passed that might be sent our way is \nhard to believe.\n  You see, what the House of Representatives said is that we will not \nlift any sanctions on Iran until we have a new President in January \n2017. Think about that for a second. Here is what we know. We know that \nIran has fissile material capable of building ten nuclear weapons. We \nknow that. We also know that Iran has the capacity within 2 or 3 \nmonths--2 or 3 months--to create this nuclear weapon. We know that from \nour intelligence, and we know it from the pronouncements of Prime \nMinister Netanyahu of Israel.\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n  With the knowledge of that capability in Iran--to build a nuclear \nweapon, which would be a disaster in the Middle East--the House \nRepublicans have said they want to put off any effort to stop the \nIranians until we have a new President 17 months from now, which is \nmore than enough time, I might add, for the Iranians, should they \nchoose, to build a nuclear weapon. How does that make Israel any safer? \nHow does that make the world any safer?\n  Here is what we know. With this Iran agreement, within weeks the \nIranians will start dismantling their centrifuges. They will start the \nprocess guaranteed by this treaty that will result in closing down a \nnuclear reactor that produces plutonium which can be used for \nweapons. They will start inviting inspectors into their country.\n\n  There has been a lot said by the Senator from Arizona and others \nabout the track record of Iran. I agree with many things he said. They \nare not to be trusted. That is why verification is part of this \nagreement. If there were no inspectors, it would be a foolish venture, \nbut with these inspectors, we are on the ground inspecting Iran on a \ndaily basis, through the IAEA, international inspectors sponsored by \nthe United Nations. Are these inspectors good? I can say that many \nyears ago when we voted on the invasion of Iraq, when the Bush-Cheney \nadministration told us there were weapons of mass destruction, these \ninspectors told us there were none--after we had invaded, after the war \nhad started. It turns out the inspectors were right and the Bush-Cheney \nadministration was wrong. They have a good track record, and I am glad \nthey are going to be on the scene to verify this agreement.\n  But the question now is, How many more times will Senator McConnell \nwant us to vote on this same issue? As leader, he can decide to do it \nover and over. Is this part of a debate prep for some of the Republican \nSenators running for President? They come to the floor and make their \nspeeches or hear speeches and get to cast a vote before the CNN debate \nthis week? I hope that is not it. We have made ourselves clear where we \nstand on this issue, each and every one of us. We cast our votes. We \nwill do it again today. Now it is time for the Senate to move on.\n  Looming just ahead of us in a matter of days is the potential of \nanother government shutdown. The same tea party Republicans who shut \ndown this government 2 years ago have vowed to do it again over a \ndifferent issue. Somehow they believe that come October 1, if we start \nshutting down the agencies of our Federal Government, they will have \nmade a political point. They are right. They will make a point that the \nmajority in the House and the Senate--the Republican majority--cannot \ngovern, cannot manage the budget of the United States to keep our \ngovernment agencies open. I think they make that point 2 years ago; I \ndon't know why they want to remind the American people of it again.\n  So instead of voting repeatedly on the same measure, on the Iran \nagreement--where we already have a record vote--I would commend to the \nRepublican leader: Take up the issues of the day. Some are compelling. \nThere is cyber security for the safety of the United States. There is a \ntransportation bill in the House of Representatives. We passed it, and \nit is time for the House to do the same. Let's fund our government. \nLet's not face a government shutdown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues, on both sides of \nthe aisle, have noted, today's vote on the President's deal with Iran \nis one of significant consequence. The American people deserve an up-\nor-down vote on the deal itself.\n  I spent the day sitting on the floor of the Senate, listening to my \ncolleagues debate the technicalities of the President's Iranian nuclear \ndeal. This has been a lawyerly dispute, with arguments all over the \nmap. I, like the vast majority of the American people, believe that \nthis is a terrible deal.\n  It has blown up the sanctions regime that brought Iran to the table. \nIt floods Tehran's coffers with more than $100 billion that will almost \ncertainly finance the killing of innocents around the world. The \nverification efforts place all of the burden on the United States and \nour allies, leaving Iran free to delay, disrupt, and deny inspections. \nThe deal even allows Iran to advance its ballistic missile programs and \nto stockpile uranium. It is simply a bad deal and the American people \nknow it.\n  I went to Embassy Row and stood before the old Iranian Embassy to the \nUnited States, a building which was abandoned on April 7, 1980. And \nwhat the American people understand--and what Washington, DC, does not \nseem to understand--is that the technicalities of this deal, though \nimportant, are not the central question.\n  The central question is this: Why was that embassy abandoned April 7, \n1980?\n  It is because in 1979 there was an Islamic revolution in Tehran, and \nthe mullahs that came to power are theocratic hardliners that believe \nthey have a divine mandate. Their divine mandate is to export Islamic \nlaw and tyranny across the Middle East, across North Africa, and \nbeyond. The tyrants who rule Iran today believe they have a divine \nmandate to annihilate Israel.\n  For 36 years we have had a bipartisan consensus in our country that \nthe world's largest state sponsor of terror should never be allowed to \nbecome a nuclear-threshold state.\n  Sadly, the administration has abandoned that bipartisan consensus in \nthe fanciful, imaginary dream that they are going to transform Iran's \ntheocratic hardliners into moderates that will no longer oppress \nreligious minorities, women, homosexuals, and others within their \ncountry. The administration believes that the Iranian regime will no \nlonger try to spread destabilization and fund terrorism across their \nregion and across the globe. And this presents dire, but foreseeable \nconsequences.\n  The administration's deal with Iran will set off a nuclear arms race \nin the Middle East--one of the world's most volatile regions. Billions \nof dollars in sanctions relief will be available to the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard and its terrorist proxies to spill innocent blood \nand destabilize Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere. Either \nof these developments is serious enough on its own. Taken together, we \nhave an unacceptably high probability for regional conflicts that could \nquickly spiral into nuclear events. We have to take this seriously; \nbut, as the outcome of this vote is likely to demonstrate, we are not.\n  The American people are more serious than Washington DC. The American \npeople aspire to a day when that old and crumbling embassy is reopened, \nbut not by the ruling theocratic mullahs. Instead, we can only accept a \nnation that believes in human flourishing and in the dignity of their \nown people, a government that repudiates the goal of annihilating \nIsrael and the spreading their Islamic revolution across the Middle \nEast.\n  I am grateful that the American people are more serious than \nWashington DC, but, it is not too late. I urge you to vote against the \nPresident's deal with Iran.\n  It is not in our national security interest, and it is surely not in \nthe interest of our friends in that most dangerous region on the face \nof the earth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I came to the floor having spoken at great \nlength last week outlining why I thought this agreement was something \nthat ought to be fully debated and fully understood not only by Members \nof the Senate but by the American people. We had that debate. We were \npromised from the very beginning and it was enacted into law that \nCongress would be provided with all materials talked about and agreed \nupon before we had a vote to determine whether we would support \napproval or disapproval of this. We had a vote Thursday, which was \nprocedural, to give us the opportunity to register our yes and no, our \nyea and nay. The American people deserve to know on the record where we \nstand on this. There have been arguments made on both sides of this \nissue.\n  Personally, I think a close examination of this raises serious \nquestions--so serious that it is not something someone can come to the \nfloor and simply say: Well, that is over, that is done, and let's move \non. There are more important things ahead. It is hard for me to \nunderstand what is more important than getting this right.\n  I think the issues I laid out last week on Thursday before the vote \nare issues\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nthat still need consideration. But the real reason we are back here--\nthank you, Senator McConnell, for giving us another opportunity--is \nbecause we fell two votes short of the opportunity to even take a vote. \nWe took a vote on a procedural measure--a measure which, as we all \nknow, you can go home and hide behind. I don't understand why my 42 \nDemocratic colleagues were afraid to put their names on a yes-or-no \nvote proposition so that everyone knows exactly where we stand and \nnobody can go home and make an excuse as to why they are for or why \nthey are against it. It goes all the way back to the Scriptures: Let \nyour yea be yea and your nay be nay. That has always been what I have \nbelieved to be the right way here in the United States Senate as well \nas the United States Congress so that when we go home, the people we \nrepresent know exactly where we stand.\n  I think what we are witnessing today in terms of the debates that \nwill be taking place tomorrow in terms of the Presidential nomination \nprocess is the public partly frustrated--frustrated in many ways, but I \nthink part is the fact that there is a lot of procedural gobbledygook \nout there that elected Members can hide behind and not have a direct \nclarification of exactly where they stand on any particular issue.\n  The purpose for delay was to hopefully give our Members the \nopportunity to go home and listen to their constituents about how they \nfeel about this, and perhaps we could have had two of the minority \ngroup who voted to block us from going forward--we won the majority \nvote 58 to 42 on a bipartisan basis, including four Democrats, all of \nwhom have significant foreign policy experience, some having more than \nthe rest of us. So it was a bipartisan effort to move to this process, \nand we came up two short. We were hoping that over the weekend--I was \nassuming that many of my colleagues were receiving the same kinds of \ncalls and input from their constituents as I was. Mine was running 10 \nto 1 against this agreement. The more we disclosed from this agreement, \nthe more the American people learned about this agreement, the more \nconcerned they were, and hopefully they expressed those concerns to \ntheir Senators who went home over the weekend having blocked us from \nthis vote.\n  At the very least, we are pleading that we could have a vote so that \nour yes is yes and our no is no, so that we reach the threshold by \nwhich we will buy a little bit of time to hopefully expose more of this \nvery flawed and I think fatally flawed agreement, more time for the \nAmerican people to express their wishes.\n  We are not talking about a normal process of moving legislation \nthrough the Senate; we are talking about a process, a negotiation that \nwill have enormous consequences for the future, enormous impact on the \nnational safety of this country, enormous impact on the world in terms \nof a rogue nation now having the pathway to development of a nuclear \nweapons capability and weapons, unimpeded after this period of time \nexpires.\n  The very first thing people ought to understand is that coming down \nto the floor--or listening to the President of the United States say \nthat this prevents Iran from having nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons \ncapability is false. It is absolutely wrong. This provides a pathway \nfor them to get it. It just defers, but it legitimizes their becoming a \nnuclear-armed nation. This rogue nation, which is seething terrorism \nthroughout the Middle East and cries ``Death to America'' and \nextinction to Israel, will have the wealth because of the release of \nwell over $100 billion, will have the capabilities because even under \nthis agreement their nuclear processing research and development goes \nforward--with our assistance. It is in the agreement, with our \nassistance.\n  So this is not something we can simply say: Oh well, we had the vote, \nyou guys came up short, and we will cease all debate because it is \nover. It was over for the President of the United States when he \ndeclared it an agreement, not a treaty. If ever something as \nconsequential as this should fall under being a treaty and not an \nagreement, it is this agreement. Yet it was declared an executive \nagreement. The President obviously knew what he was doing because he \nhas had a lot of practice basically saying: I can bypass the Congress, \nI can bypass the Constitution by simply declaring it an executive \nagreement, an executive order, whatever.\n  In declaring this, it put us in a terrible position. Thankfully, we \nwere able to secure and vote into law, on a vote of 98 to 1, signed by \nthe President of the United States, an agreement that would allow us to \nplay a role in this and to look at the agreement and anything connected \nwith this agreement before we made a decision and the opportunity to \nvote on approval or disapproval.\n  Well, all that has been denied, and the President now only says it is \nover. The minority leader on Thursday said: It is over. Get over it. We \nare moving on. Other things need to be done. We just heard that again \nfrom one of my colleagues here, the second in command on the Democrat's \nside. Let's move forward. Moving forward is a violation of the law. \nThat will be tested in courts. But it is very hard to understand how \nthe administration and the 42 who voted for this could ignore the very \nlanguage they voted for, the very language they agreed on, the very \nlanguage that allowed us to go forward and understanding what this \nagreement says.\n  Let me quote from the law which was signed by the President of the \nUnited States, in nearly unanimous agreement by the U.S. Congress:\n\n\n     TRANSMISSION TO CONGRESS OF NUCLEAR AGREEMENTS WITH IRAN AND \n        VERIFICATION ASSESSMENT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH AGREEMENTS\n\n       The President shall--\n\n  Not the President might, not the President could if he wants to or \nnot if he doesn't want to--\n\n     transmit to the appropriate congressional committees and \n     leadership . . . the agreement, as defined. . . . including \n     all related materials and annexes . . . and any additional \n     materials related thereto.\n\n  Including all related materials and annexes--including appendices, \nincluding codicils, including side agreements.\n  We have been told--we have learned that there are two secret \nagreements that have been made between Iran and the inspection agency. \nWe have not been allowed to see those agreements despite our pleas. We \nhave been told by Secretary of State: They don't matter. Don't worry \nabout it. It doesn't directly affect you.\n  Who possibly could enter into any contractual agreement, any binding \nagreement with the adversary and not require access to the side \nagreements? Who would lease a car, who would buy a house, who would \nenter into any contractual arrangement with someone who said: Oh, by \nthe way, there is some secret stuff here, but I can't let you see what \nit is. But don't worry--it really won't affect this.\n  I can't conceive of anybody.\n  This doesn't take an Ivy League law school graduate or someone \nserving in the Congress who looks through this legislation and helps \nwrite this legislation to have people understand that this alone ought \nto be reason not to vote for this agreement until they have access to \nthat material--as required by the law they voted on.\n  So how can a Member come down to this floor and simply say: I know \neverything about this agreement, I like what it does, and I am voting \nfor it. That is their privilege. That is their right. If they want to \ngo home and explain that to their people, that is their right to do so. \nBut how can they go home and explain to the people: I voted for \nsomething without knowing exactly everything that is in it. And by the \nway, yeah, I voted for the opportunity to know that, it is in the law, \nbut the President said, ``Well, I am going to ignore that.''\n  We have heard that from this President too many times, over and over \nand over: I am going to bypass Congress. I am going to game this thing \nso it goes my way and not your way. No input whatsoever.\n  Here we stand. Why again? Because some of us--many of us--58 of us \ndon't want to simply throw up our hands and say: OK, you have got us. \nLet's move on. What is next? Big deal. Not a lot of consequence here, \nbut we will worry about that later.\n  We are simply saying that we don't think it is over. The actions by \nthe majority leader here have given us an opportunity to take another \nshot at this.\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nYogi Berra said, ``It ain't over till it's over.'' And I think John \nBelushi in ``Animal House'' said: It's over? No, it ain't over. It's \nnot over.\n  So it is not over. We have a vote coming up this evening. This vote \nthis evening will give the American people the opportunity to \nunderstand that this motion to this agreement is going to be killed \nthrough a procedural motion without those who oppose it--even though \nthey are in a minority but having the procedural right to do so under \nthe Senate rules by leaving us two votes short of getting to that \nparticular point.\n  What are they afraid of? You come down here and you tell people: This \nis a good agreement, but I don't want to put my name on it. This is a \ngood agreement, but we can't keep talking about it. This is a good \nagreement, trust me, but, yeah, the side agreements--it is too bad we \nhad to do that, but, you know, I guess we are not going to have access \nto that.\n  I was surprised by what the previous speaker, the Senator from \nIllinois, said about the inspection agreement. Who could possibly agree \nto an agreement--concede to an agreement that, yes, we will have \ninspections, but you get to exclude the facility that did all of the \nnuclear research over the last decade. We are exempted--we need an \nexemption from that. And we gave it to them. Also, by the way, we are \nnot going to let you look at any of our military facilities to see \nwhether we have had any militarization of this process. Oh, by the way, \nif under the agreement you think we are cheating at some other \nfacilities around or places where you want to have some inspections, we \nwill think about that. If we disagree, we will go through a Byzantine \nprocess to get to the point where the clock starts running, and then we \nhave 24 days to try to figure all of this out. And some will say this \ngoes on much longer.\n  Having said everything I have said, having done everything I possibly \ncan do, I am here to ask my colleagues--those who think this is a good \ndeal--I am here basically just asking one thing even though I have \nmajor reservations. I am not even asking them to change their vote. I \nam asking them to give us the opportunity to have a vote. Give us an \nopportunity so that we can hold our heads high and go home and say: \nThis is exactly how I came down on this, and here is my yes or here is \nmy no.\n  Isn't that what the American people sent us here to do? We wonder why \nthey are skeptical, why 70 percent of the people think they can't trust \nCongress on probably the most consequential, historic vote any of us in \nthis body will have in our lifetime, with untold consequences--which I \nam going to be talking about sometime later this week--for the future \nof the world, let alone for the future of America. How can we hide \nbehind a procedural motion so that we don't have a full declaration of \nwhere the majority of this body and where the outstanding majority of \nthe American people stand on this agreement?\n  I am pleading to my colleagues, have the courage to stand up for what \nyou believe in and give us a vote. Don't hide behind a procedural \nmotion. Any one of us has the capability of going home and confusing \nthe heck out of our constituents by saying: Oh, well, there were \nproblems with the agreement, and I think we can probably fix it, but \nthis wasn't the right time to do it, and we needed to move forward. By \nthe way, the end of the fiscal year is coming up, and we have other \nimportant business to do. Or, it is irresponsible for Senator McConnell \nto require another vote or more debate on this.\n  They want to run from this debate as fast as they can because the \nAmerican public--I can only speak for my own constituents, but I see \nthe polls also. There is heavy opposition to this--10 to 1 in my State, \nat least what has been sent to me through all the means of receiving \nmessages from people these days.\n  I am going to end here. I see Senator Corker on the floor, who is \ntotally responsible for this language, which was illegally violated. It \nuses the word ``shall'' and it includes the words ``side agreements'' \nand anything related to this. We owe it to the American people to \nunderstand every possible consequence of this agreement and then make \nour decision, which will go down in history. However Members vote, they \nwill carry that. We will see what this rogue Iran regime will do with \nit.\n  All I know is they are cheering in the streets of Tehran. They are \ndeclaring this a victory that did not cross any one of their objections \nand crossed every one of our redlines.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Indiana, \nwho served as Ambassador to Germany, who has been so diligent in the \npursuit of truth and knowledge relative to this agreement and obviously \nis very concerned about its implications. He has been a stalwart. He is \nleaving the Senate at the end of this congressional term. We all are \nindebted to him for his tremendous concerns for our Nation's national \nsecurity and the efforts of diplomacy to try to resolve the problems we \nhave.\n  I know we have another speaker coming to floor in just one moment, \nbut really because of what the Senator just said, I want to reiterate \none more time as to why we are where we are.\n  Four times since 2010, the Senate overwhelmingly, working with the \nHouse, put in place sanctions on Iran--four times. That was met with \ntremendous pushback from the administration, which did not want to see \nthose sanctions put in place by Congress. But those sets of sanctions \nare the very things that brought Iran to the table. The administration, \nalong with Russia, China, Great Britain, France, and Germany, began \nnegotiations with Iran because of the sanctions we overwhelmingly put \nin place in this body. Once they were about to reach a conclusion, the \nadministration decided that instead of giving this to us in the form of \na treaty--which is their choice. It is their choice under our form of \ngovernment. I know we have a lot of people in our country who are very \nupset about this, but, in fact, it is their choice. They could have \npresented it as a congressional-executive agreement, which does live \nbeyond that, but they decided instead that they were going to do it as \nan executive agreement and totally bypass Congress. That was their \npurpose. As a matter of fact, I wrote a letter to the President, and \nthey responded very quickly: Yes, our plan is to bypass Congress and go \ndirectly to the U.N. Security Council. We are going to do this as an \nexecutive agreement. That obviously met with a lot of resistance here, \nbut it is their choice. But the problem with that, of course, is that \nit only lasts while they are in office, and then the next Executive can \nchange.\n  Because all of us had brought Iran to the table and because the \nadministration had planned to use a national security waiver to waive \nour sanctions--the ones that brought them to the table--we resisted. We \nbegan on our side of the aisle, saying: No, we want a voice in this. We \nbrought them to the table. This is the biggest foreign policy issue \nthat is going to occur while we are here, in all likelihood.\n  We began pushing on this side of the aisle, and eventually we were \nable to get some support on this side of the aisle. Eventually we \npassed 98 to 1 a bill called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, \nwhich, by the way, took back power from the President, basically \nsaying: You cannot implement this for a 60-day period after it ends. \nYou have to give us the materials. We have to be able to go through all \nthe materials. Of course, we haven't gotten all of the materials. Then \nwe have the right to disapprove or approve. But there is going to be a \npause on behalf of the American people, we are going to go through this \nin detail, and then we are going to vote.\n  That was actually a taking back of power from the administration \nwhich kept them from immediately being able to implement. We are in \nthat period of time now. The administration has said the clock ends on \nThursday. We are having this vote, but everybody has said in this body \nthat this is a vote of conscience. Everybody has said that.\n  By the way, I would add that overwhelming support for sanctions, \noverwhelming support for review--there would be an overwhelming vote of \napproval had the administration done what they said they were going to \ndo when they began these negotiations, which was to end Iran's nuclear \nprogram. Had they done that, we would be seeing a totally different \noutcome here. There would be 100 people here voting in support of an \nagreement. But\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nwhat they did was they squandered that opportunity--squandered it. \nInstead, with U.S. approval, Iran will be industrializing its nuclear \nprogram. Research and development will take place. All Iran has to do \nis adhere to the agreement, and it will be an advanced nuclear country.\n  Again, if they had just done what they said, we would be supporting \nthem. So now here we are. The American people have difficulty. We are \nin a process right now. In the Senate, we have something called \ncloture. When both sides of the aisle feel as though the debate has \nended, we invoke cloture and then we move to the final vote. We have \nhad plenty of debate.\n  By the way, in the Foreign Relations Committee, we have had 12 \nhearings, not to count the informal meetings that have taken place. \nEvery Senator in this body probably knows more about this nuclear deal \nthan any international arrangement that has been agreed to in recent \ntimes. I mean, people have gone through it tooth and comb. So what is \nhappening now is that we have a bipartisan majority that opposes this \ndeal. What has happened--it is unfortunate, but Senator Reid--I don't \nknow whether he saw this as a contest between himself and the majority. \nI don't know what happened. But in August, he decided he wanted to \nmount a filibuster. It is our understanding that the administration \nsupported that filibuster. They wanted the Senate to block us from \nbeing able to vote our conscience.\n  This next vote is not a vote of conscience. It is not. It is a \ndemonstration of 42 Senators--at least that is what happened last \ntime--42 Senators--a minority--refusing to let the majority, a \nbipartisan majority--the 2 most knowledgeable Democrats on foreign \npolicy issues oppose this agreement. What they are doing is blocking us \nfrom having that vote of conscience. It has taken on a little bit of a \nTammy Wynette kind of tone to me. It appears to me that this is about \nstanding by their man. It is not about allowing us to vote our \nconscience.\n  So, yes, people are upset. Almost unanimous support for sanctions to \nbring them to the table. Only one Senator disagreeing with our ability \nto weigh in. Now we are at a point where it is time to weigh in, and \nthe minority leader, my friend from Nevada, has organized, with the \nadministration's support, a filibuster, which is, by the way, put in \nplace to make sure there is enough debate. We know there has been \nenough debate. But instead of allowing debate to end, tonight it \nappears. I hope there are some consciences in this body that say: Wait \na minute, this is wrong.\n  By the way, I know people say: Well, this is just the way the Senate \noperates. I will tell you this: I have voted for enough things I \ndisagree strongly with to make the Senate work to be able to make this \nappeal to my friends. Look, 98 of us voted to allow us to vote up or \ndown on whether we agree with the substance of this deal. It is totally \ninappropriate, from my perspective, that a minority of Senators, all on \none side of the aisle--definitely a partisan act, a very partisan act--\nappear intended to keep the President from getting a message of \ndisapproval from the Senate. It appears to me that what they are going \nto do is do it again.\n  I want to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that our \nleader here has honored the request of the body--at least up until \nnow. He has honored the request to be about a resolution of approval or \ndisapproval. In this case, since a majority disapprove, it is a \nresolution of disapproval, but what we have seen him do is fill the \ntree. A lot of people don't know what that means, so I will explain. We \ncould have had a lot of amendments--and up until this point we haven't \nhad these amendments--that would have been pretty tough votes to make \nthat are related to this arrangement, but not about the disapproval \nitself.\n\n  What our leader has done--in order to keep the debate civil, sober, \nand focused on what we are here at hand about--he has actually filled \nthe tree and kept those amendments from coming in place.\n  We will have another vote at 6 p.m. We will keep it open for a couple \nof hours because it is a Jewish holiday, and we want to make sure that \nall of our colleagues can get back here and have the opportunity to \nregister their vote.\n  I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle: Is this really in \nkeeping with the spirit of what we have done?\n  I have had friends say: Well, we have known all along that it would \ntake 60 votes. It doesn't take but a week here to understand that a \ncloture vote has to be overcome, and in the Senate that takes 60 votes. \nMy friend from Virginia keeps saying: Well, we all know it takes 60 \nvotes. Look, I understand. The American people understand that it takes \n60 votes to move beyond cloture to get to a final vote, which, by the \nway, is an up-or-down vote at 51.\n  So the American people understand what is happening: 42 Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle, my friends, after voting 98 to 1 that we \ncould weigh in, have decided that what they are going to do is keep us \nfrom being able to vote the majority, up or down, because they know if \nwe do, a bipartisan majority--the two most knowledgeable Democrats on \nforeign policy disapprove it, making it 58 votes--would be able to send \nto the President the feelings of this body, and that is the majority \nbelieves that this deal should be disapproved and that the \nadministration has squandered the opportunity that we helped create \nbecause they did not end the nuclear program. Instead what they have \ndone with this deal was to basically legitimize it.\n  As the Presiding Officer mentioned the other day, we are going to be \nhelping them with technology. They will continue with research and \ndevelopment. We have lifted the ballistic-missile ban, the conventional \nban, and we are going to agree to let them begin testing missiles \nimmediately.\n  As our Presiding Officer mentioned the other day: What do they need \nICBMs for? Think about it. What do they need them for?\n  I know it is time for Senator Moran to speak on the floor, so I will \nclose with this: The American people know they have no practical need \nfor this program--none. They have one nuclear plant. They could buy and \nenrich uranium much cheaper. We know this is about one thing, and that \nis them being a nuclear state, and, in essence, we are agreeing to the \nindustrialization of their program.\n  With that, I yield the floor to Senator Moran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I appreciate the remarks of my esteemed \ncolleague of Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. He has the knowledge and relationships in the Senate to make \nthe case he just made.\n  I wish to just briefly address what I see as terrible flaws in this \nagreement which was negotiated by the Obama administration with other \ncountries and with Iran.\n  I have previously outlined my objections on the Senate floor. I will \nrestate that I strongly oppose the agreement and would hope that the \nSenate, on behalf of the American people, our national security, and \npeace around the globe, would make the same decision that I have made, \nwhich is that this agreement results in less stability, a greater \nlikelihood of war, and a nuclear Iran--a country that is capable of \ndelivering nuclear devices across its border, shouts ``Death to \nAmerica.'' We are acquiescing by the action the Senate has taken to \ndate that this agreement will take effect.\n  I can't imagine a more significant vote that Members of the Senate \nwill take than this one, certainly in the arena of national security, \nnational defense, and international relations. This agreement concedes \ntoo much and secures too little.\n  I serve on the banking committee. This is the committee that, because \nof our oversight over the Treasury Department, is responsible for \nlegislation dealing with sanctions. I have participated in the debate \nin the committee and on the Senate floor about the sanctions that \nCongress has put in place against Iran. In my view, my colleagues and \nI--and I can certainly speak for myself--did not vote to put sanctions \nin place for the purposes of causing Iran to negotiate a path to \nnuclear capabilities. I voted for sanctions time and time again. I \nvoted to increase them, encouraged by my letters and comments on the \nSenate floor, in my conversations with administration officials, and \nwith my colleagues in the\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\nSenate that we tighten the sanctions. I didn't ask that the sanctions \nbe tightened. I didn't encourage the administration to be more forceful \nin their enforcement for purposes of creating a setting in which Iran \ncould negotiate a way out of the sanctions for the purpose of \ndeveloping nuclear capabilities. Those sanctions were put in place for \nthe purpose of keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power. Instead \nthose sanctions have been the excuse by which this administration has \nnegotiated a deal that is bad for the United States, bad for our \nEuropean and worldwide allies, and particularly bad for our allies in \nthe Middle East.\n  One would think that any agreement that was negotiated would \ndismantle Iran's nuclear capabilities. This agreement does not do that. \nOne would assume that any agreement negotiated would prohibit the \ndollars from flowing--particularly billions of dollars to Iran--until \nthey had complied with the terms of the agreement. But, no, this \nagreement allows the dollars to flow nearly from the beginning.\n  Iran will become a legitimized and enriched nuclear power, and they \nwill become a wealthier, nuclear-capable country that supports \nterrorism in the Middle East and around the globe. As they have clearly \nstated, they will continue their effort to terrorize the world and end \nour way of life in the West as we know it with their continual chants \nof ``Death to America.''\n  As perhaps an issue that ought to be raised, one would think the \nadministration would negotiate the release of Americans held captive in \nIran as part of this agreement, but, no, they said that was extraneous. \nYet, they negotiated issues related not only to nuclear capability but \nother weapons allowing Iran to increase its weaponization outside the \nnuclear arena.\n  I wish to now talk about the process. I came to the Senate following \nan election in 2010, and the frustration I immediately experienced was \nthat this place was doing next to nothing. For most of my life, I have \nbeen encouraged when Congress wasn't at work because I thought my \nconstituents were safer in the absence of congressional activity, but I \ncame to the Senate with the intention of having a Senate that would \nwork for the purpose of undoing many of the things that have happened \nover a long period of time that, in my view, are damaging to our \nfreedoms and liberties and damaging to our ability to live the American \ndream.\n  I learned in a matter of a few weeks of my arrival in the Senate, and \nafter taking the oath of office, that in this place the plan was to do \nnothing. We have seen that time and time again. My reaction to that \nwas: I want to go out and see if we can get a Republican majority in \nwhich we have different leadership of the Senate, in which the goal is \nto have a Senate that functions, and the opportunity is for every \nSenator, Republican and Democrat, to present their ideas on behalf of \ntheir constituents and make the case to the rest of us that those ideas \nare worthy of our support.\n  The goal, in part, for a change in the majority of the Senate was to \nhave a functioning Senate in which every Senator, Republican or \nDemocrat, had the chance to present their ideas. I thought, as a result \nof a change in the majority, that when we all, Republicans and \nDemocrats, had the opportunity to present those ideas on behalf of our \nconstituents, we would see a change in the attitude and approach of the \nway the Senate operates.\n  For much of my early life, what I discovered about America's \nCongress--about the Senate and the House--was that there were Senators \nwho didn't care who the President was or what party the President \nbelonged to. There were Republican Senators who would disagree with a \nRepublican President and Democratic Senators who would disagree with a \nDemocratic President. Somehow over time, the political nature of our \ncountry has changed, and it seems to me we put the party of our \nPresident above the well-being of our Nation. That is dangerous.\n  I oppose this agreement not because it was negotiated by a Democratic \nPresident. I oppose this agreement because it is wrong, and it is bad \nfor America. I thought the Senate--once the opportunities for all of us \nto present our ideas was available--would once again see the days in \nwhich it was not about party affiliation, but about the idea of \npresenting the best course and direction our country should go. \nUnfortunately, it seems to me, that the Iran agreement is the poster \nchild for a Senate that is once again bogged down in support of a \nPresident on an agreement that is unworthy of that support.\n  Our country desperately needs men and women who serve in public \noffice whose decisions are made not because they are pressured by a \nPresident, not because their President shares their party and political \naffiliation. Decisions need to be made here that benefit Americans \ntoday but, more importantly, Americans in the future. What seems to me \nto be missing in my efforts to change the nature of the Senate is that \nwe are still mired in the circumstance in which--in the absence of 60 \nvotes--the Senate's will on behalf of the American people cannot be \nexpressed.\n  The point I guess I failed to understand is when new leadership came \ninto play that was open and receptive to Democratic and Republican \nSenators presenting their thoughts, amendments being offered, bills \nbeing considered, most of my Democrat colleagues would find that \nappealing because we all came here to do something we believe in, not \nto play a political game. Unfortunately, that does not seem, to me, to \nbe the case today.\n  This is the opportunity for us to change course and return the Senate \nto the day in which it was deliberative and in which Senators spoke on \nbehalf of the well-being of the country as compared to the well-being \nof a President. It is very discouraging to me. We worked hard to make \ncertain that the Senate became a place different than it was, and \nunfortunately we see in this circumstance it doesn't appear to be much \ndifferent than it was a year ago.\n  I have been a supporter of the rules that allow for a filibuster, \nthat require 60 votes for the Senate to advance an issue. I always \nthought that protected the minority--people who have different points \nof view, people who come to Washington, DC, and may not be in the \nmajority and may feel as if they would be run over in the absence of \ntheir ability to protect their constituents, their ideas, and 60 votes \nwas designed to protect the minority viewpoints in this country.\n  This becomes the moment, in my view, in which we can look at what has \ntranspired on the debate on Iran and reach the conclusion that the 60-\nvote rule is damaging to the future of our country because it is \ndamaging to the ability of the Senate to work the will of the American \npeople and to make decisions that advance a cause different from one's \npolitical party and political philosophy.\n  In my view, the time has come for us to consider this issue of how \nthe filibuster works. It is because this issue is so important and the \noutcome of this debate so valuable to the future of our country and the \nsecurity of the world that in this case, we need to move forward with a \nmajority vote to allow this agreement to be rejected.\n  This agreement is not worthy of the protection it is being given by a \nminority of Senators. It is supported--the rejection of this treaty--\nthis agreement; it should be a treaty--the rejection of this agreement \nis opposed by a majority of Republican and Democratic Senators. Yet we \nwill never have the opportunity--unless a couple of our colleagues \ndecide to do what is right this evening--for the American people to see \nwhere we stand on this issue.\n  These are serious times. Nothing is easy in the world. It is always \ndifficult to know what the right answers are, but the path the Senate \nis on today and the path the Senate took last Thursday is a terrible \nmistake for the future of our country and the security of our citizens. \nI urge the Senate to allow consideration of this agreement, and I urge \nthe Senate to reject this agreement for the good of America.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, I echo the feelings of my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Kansas. He speaks with emotion and he \nspeaks with a heartfelt sense of concern that many of us have with \nregard to this proposed agreement by the President.\n  I rise to speak about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nJCPOA, between the United States, Great Britain, France, China, Russia, \nGermany, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. Much has been said about the \nagreement over the past weeks and months. My colleagues have addressed \na great number of concerns and deficiencies about the deal and many \noutside experts have testified before multiple committees of Congress \nexplaining their views as well.\n  In addressing these concerns, I wish to ask just a few simple \nquestions: Do we believe that with this agreement the United States and \nour allies are safer today than we were 1 year ago and will we be safer \nwhen the nuclear limitations expire in 10 years? The answers to these \nquestions are very important. They will dictate what we decide in one \nof the most important votes we will cast in the 114th Congress.\n  After closely examining the agreement, the following can be \nconcluded: Upon verification by the IAEA--the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency--of Iranian compliance, supposedly within a few months if \nIran is in compliance, they will, after payment of their obligations, \nreceive around $56 billion that were frozen in overseas accounts. \nFurther revenue will be generated because the European Union has agreed \nto lift its ban on the import of Iranian oil, thereby providing Iran \nwith billions more in revenue with which to repair its oilfields and \nbegin to repair its battered economy.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, Iran's Deputy Petroleum \nMinister recently stated that his country's oil exports would reach 2.3 \nmillion barrels a day, compared with around 1.2 million barrels per day \ntoday. Iran would also gain access to 50 million barrels of oil which \nhave been held offshore, and economists estimate that Iran's economy \nwill grow up to 9 percent in the year after the implementation of the \nagreement.\n  This verification that we talk about by the IAEA will be accomplished \nthrough protocols that Members of the Senate have not seen in writing \nand that the administration has not--nor will they--agreed to provide \nto us. This is in direct contravention to the Iran review act, which \nthe President signed into law, agreeing to provide all documents and \nside agreements and, according to reports, will unbelievably allow the \nIranians to provide their own inspections of their military work on \nnuclear sites to the IAEA.\n  A robust inspection of a regime requires an anytime, anywhere \ninspection policy. Unfortunately, under the idea of managed access, as \nfound in this agreement, if the IAEA requests access to an undeclared \nlocation, under this agreement Iran can delay access to the facility \nfor 2 weeks or longer with the outlined multistep process for \nundeclared locations.\n  U.S. sanctions against foreign firms for dealing with Iran in the oil \nand financial sectors, which have been the most effective sanctions \nenacted against Iran, will be suspended upon implementation of this \nagreement. Sanctions prohibiting U.S. firms from conducting business \nwith Iran will remain in place, but with a large carve-out for non-U.S. \nentities that are owned or controlled by U.S. companies. Some sanctions \nwill also be lifted against Iran's Revolutionary Guard, the entity that \nactually runs the military aspects of Iran's nuclear program. \nFurthermore, the agreement requires the United States to make certain \nthat U.S. State and local governments comply with sanctions relief \ncontravening their own sanctions placed on Iran.\n  Now, this proposal, the JCPOA, also commits the P5+1--that working \ngroup of countries--to work to strengthen Iran's ability to protect \nagainst and respond to nuclear security threats, including sabotage, \nwhich we can presume would mean from even our allies who feel deeply \nthreatened by this agreement which transforms Iran--a terrorist State--\ninto a breakout nuclear power and still a terrorist State.\n  In year 5 of the agreement, Iran will be removed from the United \nNations arms embargo. Yet as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGEN Martin Dempsey, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in August: \n``Under no circumstances should we relieve pressure on Iran relative to \nballistic missile capabilities and arms trafficking.''\n  In year 8 of the agreement, Iran will be removed from the United \nNations ballistic missile embargo.\n  Now, in July of this year, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter \nconfirmed to me in a hearing that under this deal, he could not rule \nout Iran acquiring, within 10 years, an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile that could hit the United States. This means Iran would have \nthe capability of producing a nuclear weapon that could reach U.S. soil \nin a decade.\n  These comments come after Gen. Paul Selva, now the Vice Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, told me during a separate hearing that Iran \nremains the leading State sponsor of terrorism, and resources gained in \nsanctions relief under the nuclear deal could be used by Iran to \ncontinue sponsoring terrorism.\n  Under the agreement, the United States agreed to allow the nuclear-\nrelated equipment to remain in Iran under lock and key, and Iran will \nbe allowed to continue researching IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, and IR-8 \ncentrifuges. Iran will also be allowed to begin testing IR-6 and IR-8 \ncentrifuges in cascades of 30 at year 8 of the agreement. After 8 \nyears, many of the research-and-development restrictions are removed \nand Iran will begin to manufacture advanced centrifuges. All R \nrestrictions end at 10 years.\n  Finally, after 10 years, Iran will be free of the restrictions on \nenrichment and could become a nuclear threshold State--legally, under \ninternational law--only postponing the inevitable nuclearization of \nIran.\n  So with these facts established, I am left with what appears to me to \nbe the undeniable answers to my questions: The United States and our \nMiddle Eastern allies are absolutely not safer today than we were 1 \nyear ago, and we will all be left unquestionably less safe when this \nagreement ends in 10 years. I, therefore, oppose this deal. It is an \nagreement that will reward a violent terrorist regime. Instead of \nstopping the Iranians from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon, it merely \ndelays it. This deal is shortsighted and dangerous for our security.\n  Just a few days ago I was talking with my 8-year-old grandson. He \nasked me what I was working on in the Senate. I told him about the \nPresident's proposed deal with Iran. I told him what we were giving \nthem. I told him about the money, the lifting of the sanctions, the \naccess to weapons and, soon, the ability to make a very bad bomb. After \nall of this, he looked at me and he simply asked: ``What do we get out \nof it?'' If this third grader can see how bad this deal is, so should \nwe.\n  In conclusion, I urge my fellow Senators to vote not only to allow us \nto debate this issue but to vote in opposition to the President's deal \nwith Iran. It is truly wrong for the United States and for the world. \nIf my grandson understood that we truly are getting a bad deal--one \nthat we should reject--most certainly we should understand as well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I am moved by the comments of my friend. \nHe told me the story regarding the discussion with his 8-year-old \ngrandson.\n  I wish to reiterate that had the President and those he designated to \nnegotiate done what they said they were going to do--and that was to \nend Iran's nuclear program, something we all celebrated--and if the \ngood Senator could say to his grandson that is what we got out of the \ndeal, what we would have here today is unanimous support of approval.\n  This body was so involved in bringing Iran to the table. It is \nunbelievable the way--in these days and times, since 2010, four times \nthe Senate has voted almost unanimously to put sanctions in place to \nbring Iran to the table. It is also hard to believe the administration \ntook the one issue that has caused us to almost have unanimity which, \nlet's face it, is rare in these times--the one issue where we have had \nalmost unanimity is to bring it to the table by passing sanctions and \nthen give us a right to weigh in. They were trying to go around \nCongress by going directly to the U.N. Security Council. But what they \ndid on an issue that the American people are solidly behind--and that \nis Iran not having nuclear weapons--what they did was squander--\nsquander--the one opportunity for this body to act in unison; that is, \nto approve what they have done.\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\n  As the Senator just mentioned, what they have agreed to--what the \npartisan minority Senators on the other side of the aisle will not even \nallow us to vote on--vote our disapproval where a bipartisan majority \ndisapproves--what they have agreed to, literally, is, with U.S. \napproval, Iran can industrialize their nuclear program, can develop \nlong-range missiles, can be involved in research and development, which \nmakes the IR-1 centrifuges, where all the focus has been, look like \nantiques compared to what they are going to be--what they are \ndeveloping right now, and we are allowing them to do that. Again, this \nis in a country that has no need for a nuclear program--none.\n  I mean, there is no practical need for the pain they have put their \ncitizens through for the past several years under these crushing \nsanctions that brought them to the table that we put in place--no \nreason for that. They want to be a threshold nuclear country, and our \ngovernment--our officials--has agreed to that. They have agreed to that \nat a time when we have no Middle East policy--none. We are watching on \ntelevision refugees from countries that are the result of the fact that \nwe have no Middle East policy. In that vacuum, this Nation--this \nadministration, without this being disapproved and sent back--this \nNation is going to agree to the industrialization of the No. 1 state \nsponsor of terror, which is propping up the regime that is causing all \nof these refugees to be flooding into Europe and other places.\n  With that, I see Senator Cassidy of Louisiana who has been such a \nstalwart on national security issues, and I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. CASSIDY. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Madam President, the challenge in speaking after so many others have \non this agreement is that almost every angle has been addressed. But \nthe advantage is that I have been able to learn what others have to say \nand perhaps introduce new ideas.\n  I am actually struck that Democrats and Republicans agree. We all \nagree that the Iranian agreement is flawed, that it does not achieve \nthe objectives originally defined by President Obama, and everyone is \nworried that the Iranians will use a portion of the $50 to $100 billion \nthey receive as a result of this agreement to advance the cause of \nterrorism.\n  What we do not agree on is whether or not the administration could \nhave and can get a better deal. Ironically, Republicans have more faith \nin the President than the President's fellow Democrats do. Republicans \nthink that if Barack Obama and John Kerry called them back up--showed \nleadership among our allies--that we can do better and Democrats think \nnot. I continue to have more faith in the President and Secretary Kerry \nthan my Democratic colleagues because typically the stronger party in a \nnegotiation gets the better deal. It seems as if the United States and \nour allies were the stronger parties.\n  Iran's economy is in terrible shape. The regime's survival is \nthreatened by dissatisfaction with 25 years of a corrupt bureaucratic \nautocracy, with economic mismanagement. Iran needs to get $130 per \nbarrel of oil to meet the government's obligations, and oil is far \nbelow that. Iran's trading partners are limited, and aside from this, \nthe Iranian people want freedom. There is discontent with the regime.\n  But far from the stronger party prevailing, this agreement concedes \non the very goals that it sought to achieve. We pursued this agreement \nwith the intention of ridding Iran of its nuclear program. Instead we \nhave agreed to lift sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy and \ngive immediate access to $60 billion, essentially bailing out a \nstruggling regime. It is fair to ask: In return for what?\n  According to the President and my colleagues who support this deal, \nwe get the opportunity not to go to war, and all Iran had to do was \nsimply agree to continue developing and running their nuclear program \nin a peaceful manner. But to quote Leon Wieseltier, a Senior Fellow at \nthe Brookings Institute:\n\n       This agreement was designed to prevent Iran from acquiring \n     nuclear weapons. If it does not prevent Iran from acquiring \n     nuclear weapons--and it seems uncontroversial to suggest that \n     it does not guarantee such an outcome--then it does not solve \n     the problem that it was designed to solve. And if it does not \n     solve the problem that it was designed to solve, then it is \n     itself not an alternative, is it? The status is still quo.\n\n  How can it be the claim that this Iranian agreement protects the \nAmerican people from the dangers of war when we are also told that the \nUnited States must provide more military support to our allies in the \nregion because of this deal increasing the likelihood of war?\n  Secretary Kerry acknowledged in a September 2 letter that, indeed, \nwar is more likely: ``Iran's continued support for terrorist and proxy \ngroups throughout the region, its propping up of the Assad regime in \nSyria, its efforts to undermine the stability of its regional \nneighbors, and the threat it poses to Israel'' are real concerns. He \ngoes on to say, ``We have no illusion that this behavior will change \nfollowing the implementation of the JCPOA.''\n  Why are we willingly, I ask, legitimizing a nuclear program of a \ncountry that we feel this way about or, worse yet, why are we willingly \nagreeing to lift sanctions, which gives Iran billions of dollars and an \nimproved economy and therefore the extra resources with which they can \nbuy and distribute conventional weapons, which Iran can now buy \nlegally? Regarding the purpose of the conventional weapons, in the \nfinal hours of negotiations, the lifting of the embargo against the \nsale of conventional weapons and missiles was added to this deal. In \njust 5 years we lift the embargo against conventional weapons, and in 8 \nyears we lift the embargo against ballistic missiles. Secretary Kerry \nhas declared that this provision is a win. The terrible thing about \nthis deal is that it is full of wins such as this. Iran's interest is \nadvanced, and the rest of the world is less safe.\n  This does not add up. We have the administration claiming that the \nregime is weak underneath our sanctions--and for that reason Rouhani \nwas able to persuade Khamenei to come to the table for negotiations--\nyet stating that Iran's opposition to lifting the arms embargo was too \nstrong to resist. The country cannot be too strong and too weak at the \nsame time.\n  Furthermore, knowing that the Iranians have cheated on numerous \nprevious nuclear agreements, why don't we have a stronger mechanism \nwith which to punish them should they cheat? All this deal puts in \nplace is the snapback. The hope is that reimposing sanctions on Iran \nwill once more cripple their economy. The same sanctions that have been \nimplemented over many years are expected to somehow immediately return \nto full strength. What is to say that countries such as Russia or \nChina, which were initially reluctant to impose the sanctions on Iran, \nwould agree to snap back should Iran cheat? Especially considering how \nmuch stronger Iran will be once their economy is given the chance to \nrebound, it seems more likely that these countries believe the economic \nadvantages of lifting sanctions on Iran far outweigh the implications \nof a nuclear Iran.\n  It has been stated one way or another by others, but I will discuss \nsomething that has not been discussed in relation to the Iranian \nagreement but which I am surprised is not of greater concern to \nDemocrats. In its environmental impact statement issued in February \n2014, the State Department estimated that the Keystone XL Pipeline, \nwhich would ultimately carry 830,000 barrels of oil daily, could \nincrease emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases by 1.3 to 27.4 \nmillion metric tons annually. Based on these calculations, President \nObama has denied Americans a chance to expand our energy independence \nand to in turn create 40,000 direct jobs and many more indirect. If \nthis deal goes through--the Iranian deal--the Iranian oil minister \nstated that Iran could send 500,000 barrels of oil per day to the \nmarket immediately upon easing the sanctions and up to 1 million \nbarrels of oil per day within 6 months. According to an estimate by a \nDC think tank, if Iran increases their oil production by this much, it \nwill release 156 million more metric tons of carbon dioxide per day. \nWait a second. If we build the Keystone XL Pipeline, we may have 1.3 \nmillion metric tons. We can't do that because of greenhouse gases. But \nthe Iranian agreement, which the President said has to occur, will \nincrease greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 156 million metric \ntons--over 100 times more.\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\n  If climate change is the greatest threat to the United States, even \ngreater than a nuclear Iran, it seems as though the President has said \nhe is willing to accept that danger in order to give the Iranians this \ndeal.\n  Well, I return to where I started. I ask my Democratic Senate \ncolleagues not to have such low expectations of the President and to \ndemand a better deal for the American people. I stand by the assertion \nthat the alternative to this bad deal is not war, but a better deal.\n  I am confident that our Nation can stand from a position of power and \nnegotiate the deal we set out to achieve.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I am here to make a few remarks about the \nproposed agreement between the United States--our participation in the \nagreement with the Government of Iran. I am going to speak briefly \nbecause we have been through this. I just want to underscore a few \npoints that are very important to me as to why I am going to be voting \nthe way I am voting.\n  I think, first of all, one of the things you always want to do when \nyou are entering into an agreement is weigh whom it is you are making \nan agreement with. I always told clients when I was practicing law that \nmore important than the words on the paper were the people whose \nsignatures appeared at the bottom. I think, in this particular \ninstance, we could not have a worse situation than what we have.\n  The Iranians have shown us what they are made of for decades. We all \nknow what they are made of. This is not going to be a good time as we \ngo forward. Generally, when people make an agreement, and people make \nagreements every day, they agree on an objective and then both \ncooperate as they move forward toward that objective. That is not going \nto happen here. We have seen before the Iranians operate under similar \ncircumstances. They cheat, to begin with, on a regular basis. But just \nas importantly, they will stiff-arm, they will drag their feet, they \nwill misinterpret, they will challenge, they will do everything \npossible to avoid meeting the objective of the agreement.\n  How did all of this start? You remember when this whole thing \nstarted, everyone was cheering about what a wonderful thing this is, \nand we are going to go forward with this, but we do not trust them, and \nno agreement is better than a bad agreement. Well, what has happened \nsince then? There is not anybody saying this is a good agreement. This \nis a bad agreement. So why did we not stick with the proposition that \nno agreement was better than a bad agreement? Now the mantra that \npeople are talking about is, well, it is not perfect.\n  I would urge that with what we are dealing, the people we are dealing \nwith, and because of the consequences for America, for the world, for \nthe Middle East, it needs to be perfect, and it is nowhere near \nperfect. I want to underscore a couple things in that regard.\n  The other thing we started out with was that the President promised \nus that we are going to have inspections anytime, anyplace. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth now that this agreement has been put on \nthe table. This is not an anytime, anyplace agreement. Indeed, the \nprocedures--if you wade through the difficult and complex procedures \nfor how you get to an inspection when there is suspicion or even when \nthere is not suspicion, if you are just doing it to check, it is going \nto be very difficult to do that. In addition to that, there are places \nin Iran that are off limits. No American will ever set foot in there. \nNo IAEA inspector will ever set foot in there.\n  So why anyone would make this kind of agreement is beyond me. I am \ntalking about Parchin. Parchin is a place where they have done the kind \nof work in the past that we want to stop. Indeed, by getting in there, \nby going through it, by inspecting it and doing an analysis, we would \nbe able to tell what they did so we could expect what they would do in \nthe future--and they will. In addition to that, the most likely place \nin Iran for bad things to happen is at Parchin. No one can get in \nParchin. Why would the Iranians insist on a provision in this agreement \nthat no one can get into Parchin? There is only one reason: They intend \nto cheat and they intend to do it at Parchin. They have gotten away \nwith a lot of things at Parchin in the past, so they want to protect \nit.\n  All of these things argue for no agreement being better than a bad \nagreement, which this is.\n  Let me talk about a couple of the things. There has been a lot of \ntime spent on them, but this situation regarding the money is just--I \ndon't understand how people can talk about signing on to this \nagreement, when you are talking about what is going to happen with the \nmoney that is going to be freed up for Iran. There is $150 billion that \nis going to be freed up. Now, you will get people who say: Well, it is \nnot that much because they owe this. It is dedicated here, what have \nyou. So let's just take the 50 billion that everybody believes--I think \nthey say 54 billion, but let's take $50 billion--$50 billion. In Iran \nthis is not small change. Here in the United States, obviously, it \nwould be a much smaller amount. But the statistics, when you compare \nwhat $50 billion means to the regime in Iran, it is very substantial.\n  What does Iran do with its money when it gets money? Since the \nsanctions have been on, their economy has been ratcheting down and \ndown. Life has become much more difficult there from an economic \nstandpoint. The government has very little money to operate. But every \ncountry has national priorities. Every single country on the face of \nthis Earth has national priorities. The only way can you judge it is \nhow they have spent their money in the past. During this period of \ntime, while they were in very difficult financial straits, they had the \nability to fund and to finance the worst enemies America has, the worst \nenemies the world has--terrorists. They have funded Hamas, they have \nfunded the Houthi rebels, they have funded Hezbollah, and others. Every \nproblem we have in the world with terrorism has Iran's fingerprints on \nit.\n  They have been able to fund that even when they were in difficult \nfinancial straits. What do you think is going to happen when they get \nthis windfall of $50 billion? Those organizations are going to become \nflush with cash. They are going to be able do things they have not been \nable to do in the past. If you go to the hospitals here in America \nwhere our veterans are lying with missing limbs--arms and legs--almost \nall of them, almost all of them were caused by a device that Iran \neither made or financed. That is where this money is going to go. How \ncan you go to bed at night saying, well, yes, I agreed to this because \nit is going to be a wonderful thing for the world, when you have \nactually put money in the hands of these terrorists who are going to \nhurt America's best who go out into the field? It boggles my mind. When \nyou are sitting at the negotiating table, why did someone not say: Hey, \nif we catch any of this money going to terrorists, all bets are off, \nand we are going to pull back everything.\n  It is not just the $50 billion. More important than that is Iran will \nnow have a continuous cashflow because they are going to be able to \nsell their oil, and they are going to be able to generate substantial \namounts of money. So it is not just the $50 billion. This money thing \nis a real problem. It absolutely boggles my mind that--I don't know how \nanybody who supports this is going to look these Americans in the eye \nwho are hurt by these devices that are made and that are financed by \nIran. It is going to go on. It is going to continue. This money is \ngoing to be used for that. That alone, to me, is sufficient reason not \nto vote for this. It should be sent back, saying: Look, we need a \nspecific agreement that this money is going to be used for domestic \npurposes for you to help the people of Iran--the people who want to do \ngood things--and not sent off to foreign terrorists who are going to \nuse that money to kill Americans and to kill other people.\n\n  I wish to talk for a second about the secret agreements that are \nincorporated into this. Who--who--would sign a contract or an agreement \nwhere\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\nyou incorporated two agreements made by two third parties, you don't \nknow what is in them--you will never know what is in them unless things \ngo south and go south badly--but you will have agreed to that. Whatever \nhappens as a result of these secret agreements--whatever happens as a \nresult of these secret agreements--we are going to have to abide by it \nbecause we will have entered into this.\n  Nobody enters into a contract to buy a bicycle where they have secret \nagreements. You wouldn't buy a consumer product for your home if at the \nbottom line it said: By the way, there are two agreements between so \nand so and so and so. Neither of them is a part of this, but by buying \nthis and signing this contract, you are agreeing to whatever is in \nthere.\n  I don't understand that. No American has seen it. We get fairly good \ninformation in the Intelligence Committee, and we have had closed \nhearings on this. We have dragged in everybody. The closest I have come \nto is Wendy Sherman. She was the No. 2 negotiator behind John Kerry. \nJohn Kerry has not seen these agreements--and everybody tells you what \nis in these agreements.\n  I cross-examined them:\n  How do you know what is in these agreements?\n  Well, that is what we were told.\n  Well, how do you know it if you haven't seen it?\n  Well, the Iranians tell us what is in there, and the IAEA tells us \nwhat is in there. So we are willing to accept that.\n  But no American has seen it. Wendy Sherman admitted she was in a room \nwith a number of people when the agreements were there, and they were \nbeing waved around, but she did not read those agreements. She cannot \ntell us what is in those agreements. She tried to tell us what is in \nthose agreements. Others tried to tell us what is in those agreements, \nbut nobody knows because they will not let us see what is in those \nagreements.\n  Why is that? Do you think there are things in those agreements that \nshow this is a good deal?\n  They are hiding stuff. There are bad things in there for America. Yet \npeople are willing to sign on to this and to endorse, to adopt, and to \nratify two secret agreements that no American has ever seen or can \nvouch for what is in those two secret agreements.\n  One of the things that is included in there that they have admitted \nis how Parchin gets inspected or, rather, isn't inspected. If they are \nwilling to admit that in those secret agreements there is a provision \nthat says Parchin will never be inspected, can you imagine what the \nrest of the matters are that are in those agreements? It is outrageous \nfor someone to adopt, on behalf of the American people, provisions that \nthey don't know what they are.\n  Let me just say that I come back to where I started; that is, we need \nto have a full appreciation of whom we are dealing with. While this is \ngoing on, while the Senate is debating this, and while the American \nCongress is debating this, the leaders of Iran proudly stand, beat \ntheir chests, and say: We promise you that Israel will not exist in 25 \nyears.\n  I don't believe much of what they say, but what I do believe is, \nbecause of the way they have acted, because of their history, that they \nwill do everything they possibly can to make that promise come true.\n  This is whom we are dealing with. They are going to try to eliminate \nour closest ally in the world over the next 25 years. This is whom we \nare dealing with. And we are willing to get in bed with these people \nand throw Israel under the bus? It is fantastic. It just does not make \nsense, but that is whom we are dealing with. They are promising, while \nall this is going on, that they will see that Israel does not exist in \n25 years.\n  Well, it has been all over the media that the people who were \nsupporting this are looking for a legacy. I promise you that the people \nwho support this are going to get a legacy, but it is not going to be \nthe legacy they want. When this thing goes south, the media and every \nAmerican is going to be looking for the people who did this, who \nsupported it, and who ratified it through this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am back to the floor a second time to \nspeak very briefly in favor of the nuclear agreement with Iran. I don't \nclearly understand why we are here again.\n  When I was sworn into the House, I remember that one of the things \npeople told me was a phrase that said that politics stops at the \nwater's edge. The idea was we reserve our deep political, partisan \ndisagreements for domestic issues, and we don't hesitate to disagree--\noften vociferously--with each other on issues of national security that \nregard our relations with other countries, but we do that based on \npolicy grounds. We don't do that in order to try to score political \nadvantage with one another, because when you are playing pure politics \nwith international relations, you are really playing with the security \nof this country.\n  There is absolutely no reason to have this vote today other than a \ndesire on behalf of the majority party in the Senate to try to gain \nsome perceived political advantage over the minority party or over the \nPresident.\n  We know exactly what is going to happen. There aren't the votes for \nthis resolution of disapproval to proceed past the Senate. There \nweren't the votes last week. There will not be the votes this week. We \nknow this agreement is going to go into effect and we, frankly, have a \nlot of work to do. We have a lot of work to do to keep the government \nopen and operating. We have a lot of work to do to implement this \nagreement. I will mention in a few moments that we have a lot more work \nto do in the Middle East to try to secure those who are running from \nterror and violence.\n  This is a waste of our time tonight. This is just about politics. \nThis is just about trying to gain political advantage over an issue \nthat is fundamental to the security of this country and to our allies.\n  I continue to support this agreement for a very simple reason. I just \nthink it is the best way, taking a look at the options in front of us, \nto stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. I know there are others who \nare hopeful--by the moderates achieving a victory within Iran's \npolitical power structure--that there will be a willingness to try to \ncome to the table and figure out some other very meddlesome issues in \nthe region, but that is not why I support this.\n  I support this because I believe we have negotiated an agreement that \nis going to make it much less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon \nthan if we were to reject the agreement. We are dramatically reducing \nthe number of centrifuges; the quality of the enriched material will be \ngreatly reduced from 20 percent down to 3 percent; we essentially \neliminate their stockpiles, reducing their stockpile materials by about \n97 percent; we get intrusive, unprecedented inspections on the entirety \nof the supply chain, so if they try to cheat--and they may try to \ncheat--we will have a much better chance of catching it with inspectors \non the ground than if we rejected this agreement and had no inspectors \non the ground.\n  Then, importantly--and I think especially for many of my more hawkish \nRepublican friends--we preserve the military option and make it much \nmore effective and credible under this agreement. It is much more \neffective because we are going to have eyes on the program and on the \nsupply chain so that if we did catch Iran cheating with those \ninspections, we would have more information than we would if we didn't \nhave any inspectors on the ground. It is more credible because we will \ndo it in the context of an international agreement, meaning that if we \ndo have to strike militarily, we will have our partners, our \ninternational partners, by our side--which we frankly would not have if \nthey all asked us to sign this agreement to try to put us on a \ndiplomatic path to divorce Iran from a nuclear weapon--we alone refused \nand then asked them for help in a military endeavor, they wouldn't go \nwith us and, thus, we would be on our own. We have just the last 10 \nyears to see what unilateral, U.S. military action in the Middle East \nlooks like. We are better off when we have partners.\n  But this has always been a choice between one set of consequences \nflowing from the adoption of the agreement versus a set of consequences \nflowing\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\nfrom the rejection of the agreement. I have heard very little realistic \ntalk from the opponents of this deal about what their conception of a \nrealistic alternative would be because most serious foreign policy \nthinkers are of one mind when it comes to what will happen if Congress \nwere to reject this deal--and we are not going to. We knew that last \nweek.\n  But what we know is that Iran's nuclear program would start back up. \nI don't think they would rush to a bomb--very few people do--but they \nwould start their nuclear program back up, have more centrifuges \nspinning, and more stockpiled material piling up.\n  The inspectors would get kicked out. I don't think there is any way \nthey would allow for inspectors to remain in the country if it wasn't \nin the context of a deal. The sanctions would probably fray at first \nbecause the Russians and Chinese would not walk away, but they would--\nover time--fall apart. The military option, as I mentioned, would get \nharder because we wouldn't have as much knowledge of their program, and \nwe would have to go it alone with Israel, potentially, but probably not \nwith our international partners who would feel badly burned by this \nrejection.\n  Finally, U.S. credibility as an honest, diplomatic, negotiating \npartner would be greatly damaged if--with the unanimous support of the \nSecurity Council, the unanimous support of the P5+1--the Senate and \nCongress decided to walk away from this deal.\n  This idea that there is a magical, better deal on the table is just \nfiction, plain and simple. There is no way to go back to the \nnegotiating table if Congress were to reject this deal. The Iranians \nwill not come back to the negotiating table. Our P5+1 partners have \ntold us to our face that they will not come back to the table. So you \nare left, at that point, with an isolated Iran with a nuclear program \nrestarting, with sanctions fraying, and with U.S. credibility damaged. \nI have no idea how that makes this country or that makes our allies in \nthe Middle East any safer.\n  I have listened to all of the arguments against it, and I listened to \nSenator Risch--who is a good friend--just make his secret agreement \nargument again. But it is amazing to me, having had so much attention \nover this AP article a few weeks ago on this supposed secret agreement \nbetween the IAEA and Iran, that there has been not even a whisper from \nopponents about the article this week correcting the AP story talking \nabout how, in fact, the IAEA--according to this report--is going to \nhave direct access to Parchin and is going to be able to take samples \nunder the agreement they have with Iran.\n  There is a lot of talk about the first article, but the second \narticle that corrects the record, nary a whisper from folks who oppose \nthis deal. The reality is that this secret agreement you talk about, \nthis agreement between the IAEA and Iran as to how they inspect Iran's \nnuclear program is nothing new because the IAEA has this with every \nsingle country they inspect. It is the foundation of the IAEA's \ninspection regime, the idea that they could only have credibility--they \ncan only have credibility if they don't disclose the secrets of the \ncountries that participate in the program. The IAEA could not function \nif it weren't for these agreements.\n  Now, we all sat in a room and were briefed on this agreement, so \nthere is not a single Senator who cannot say they don't know what is in \nthis agreement. There is not a single Senator who could say the AP \nstory was correct. There is not a single Senator, if they were sitting \nin those briefings, who can say they were surprised by what we heard \nthis week. The argument, especially after reporting that we have seen \nthis week, just doesn't wash any longer.\n  But as I said at the outset, the imperative to move beyond this \nargument is not just because we shouldn't be playing politics with an \nissue of this import but also because we have to come together on other \nissues that are vital to the stability of the region.\n\n\n                         Syrian Refugee Crisis\n\n  Mr. President, I just came back from a Syrian refugee camp with \nSenator Peters: 80,000 people living in this camp with 250 of them \ngetting on a bus every day and going back to Syria. Why? Because they \nhave been sitting in this camp in abysmal, unconscionable conditions, \nfor 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and they have no hope, no hope of ever \ngetting out. So they are going back to Syria. They are taking their \nkids and almost accepting the potential for death because the \nconditions in these camps gets worse and worse and their hope just \natrophies away. Those who aren't just going back to live in Syria, as \nwe know, are pouring into Europe by the tens of thousands.\n  When we were in the region, our partners in the Middle East told us \ntwo things. Our Arab partners in the Middle East said: Get this \nagreement done. It is vital to the security of the region. To a person, \nevery single individual we met with in Qatar, in UAE, in Iraq, and \nJordan said: Get this deal done.\n  Second, they said: Step up to the plate and do more when it comes to \nsolving this humanitarian disaster. Take refugees--like we are--in \nJordan, Iraq, and Turkey. Make sure that the World Food Programme \ndoesn't run out of money, as it is about to. Think about that, 1 \nmillion refugees in Jordan are about to lose their food benefits \nbecause the United States and some of our partners refuse to put up \nmoney to continue to operate the program. And guess what. When they do \nnot get funding from the World Food Programme, they go to see who else \nis offering them sustenance, and often it is the extremist groups we \nare trying to fight. When you stop funding the World Food Programme, \nyou push thousands of individuals into the very arms of the groups we \nare attempting to take out, degrade, and destroy in the region. It is \nunconscionable that we are not feeding people in the Middle East who \nhave fled violence, but it is terrible national security strategy to \npush them into the arms of the extremists.\n\n  What we should be debating today is an emergency appropriations bill \nto allow for refugees to come to this country, as has been in the best \ntraditions of America, and to fund humanitarian assistance so that \npeople don't starve and die or get pushed back into Syria to be killed \nby Assad and others. But instead we are having another vote--another \nvote--on the Iran nuclear agreement when we know the outcome is \npredestined.\n  We have some really important stuff to talk about here, and we need \nto move on from this debate so we can start to build on the credibility \nwe have already grown by virtue of negotiating this agreement in the \nregion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURPHY. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Connecticut a \nquestion through the Chair.\n  First, let me thank the Senator for raising this issue. I have said--\nand I think my colleague may share the feeling--that this may be the \ngreatest humanitarian crisis of our time, and other generations will \nask us: What did you do in the midst of the Syrian humanitarian crisis?\n  I met with four Syrian families in Chicago who are now refugees. They \nmade it, and they have these horrible stories of what they went \nthrough. But when we look back at the past and what we have done in \nAmerica for Cuban refugees, and I believe at least one of our \ncolleagues here was a Cuban refugee--his family was when they came to \nthis country; refugees from the Soviet Union, Jewish people suffering \nfrom persecution and wanting to escape; refugees from Somalia; the \nHmong people from Vietnam; and Bosnians who made it to the United \nStates, it seems to me that in the sweep of modern history--since World \nWar II, I would add quickly--that we have really established ourselves \nas caring for refugees, not only feeding them but accepting them, after \ncareful vetting, in the United States.\n  So I ask the Senator from Connecticut, when we hear what is happening \nin Europe, is he struck by the fact there are some countries opening \ntheir arms in extraordinary ways and others, sadly, going in the \nopposite direction with these refugees? I am sure the Senator has been \nstruck by that as well.\n  Mr. MURPHY. I say to Senator Durbin, I come from Connecticut, one of \nthe Thirteen Original Colonies. We are proud of our role as part of the \nfoundation, the fabric of America, and our\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nState's motto is ``He who transplants sustains.'' This Nation's \nexistence is predicated on people coming here fleeing persecution, \nsometimes violence, and finding a home. It represents the best of \nAmerica's traditions. Some 190,000 Vietnamese came here, and 180,000 \nfrom the Balkan countries came here just a decade ago.\n  The Senator is right--this isn't easy because we have to go through a \nsubstantial vetting process to make sure we are not bringing anyone \nhere who even sniffs of potential violence or connection to terrorist \ngroups. I was sitting in those Syrian refugee camps 2 weeks ago, and I \nwas looking at 8-year-old kids digging ditches through the sand so the \nfeces running out of their house has a place to go. Those little kids \naren't terrorists.\n  We can figure this out. We are going to need some additional \nresources to do it. I thank the Senator for taking such a lead in the \ncaucus, and I am hopeful we will be able to move on to that debate in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and in the Appropriations Committee \nafter today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I notice a discussion taking place. I wish \nto speak for approximately 10 minutes prior to the vote, assuming that \nis acceptable to the minority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would advise the Senator from Tennessee that all time \nremaining is on our side of the aisle, but I would yield half of it--5 \nof the next 10 minutes--to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Senator very much. I will be very brief. I \nmade these points earlier today, but I would just like to remind people \nas to why we are having this vote this evening.\n  Almost unanimously, on four different occasions since 2010, Congress \npassed sanctions. Both sides of the aisle strongly supported sanctions \nbeing imposed upon Iran to bring them to the negotiating table. That \nwas something which was very strongly bipartisan.\n  When it came time to bring them to the table and begin negotiations, \nthe President declared the goal was to end their nuclear program, and \nthey began negotiations. And by the way, we celebrated that goal. I \nthink there would be unanimous support for the agreement had that goal \nbeen achieved. But the President then declared that instead of bringing \nthis as a treaty, which typically would be the case for an \ninternational agreement, or bringing it as a congressional-executive \nagreement, he was going to call this an executive agreement so that \nonly he would be involved in it.\n  That being known to this body, again in a very strong, bipartisan \nway--98 to 1--we voted for the first time since I have been here to \ntake power away from the President and to keep him from invoking the \nnational security waivers he had with the sanctions and to say: No, we \nwant 60 days to go through this deal and we want the right to approve \nor disapprove and to vote our conscience.\n  Let me say one more time that had the President achieved his goal, we \nwould have unanimous support here supporting the deal itself. We would \nall be supportive of ending their program. But the administration \nsquandered that opportunity and instead has agreed to the \nindustrialization of their program, their development of \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, their development of even faster \ncentrifuges to ensure they are a nuclear threshold state.\n  What the public may not understand is taking place here now--we have \nhad a debate. We had 12 hearings in the Foreign Relations Committee. We \nhave had all kinds of Senators debating. As a matter of fact, Senators \nknow more about the Iran deal than probably any international agreement \nin modern history. It has been studied and debated.\n  So the minority, 42 Senators--I might say a partisan minority because \nthey are all Democrats--a bipartisan 58 Senators--the 2 Senators who \nknow more about foreign policy issues than any other Senators on the \nDemocratic side oppose this deal. And now, in keeping with the Iran \nreview act, the majority, a bipartisan majority, is wishing to have the \nopportunity to vote on the substance of the deal.\n  What is happening is my friend the minority leader, who is here, \nbegan saying in August that he wanted to filibuster this, and my \nunderstanding is the administration has supported that. So what we have \nnow is a partisan minority of people who are keeping the spirit of the \nIran review act from coming into play by blocking our ability to \nactually vote up or down. That is what is happening. I want to make \nsure the American people understand that. I know Members of this body \nunderstand that.\n  I want to close with this. Our majority leader, on every occasion \nwhere there has been an opportunity for this to devolve into something \nthat was partisan and there was concern on the other side of the aisle \nabout certain things that were occurring, at every point, the majority \nleader has acquiesced and agreed for things to progress in a way that \nthe minority would feel that this was not a partisan effort.\n  I wish to also point out that the majority leader, when we brought \nthis resolution of disapproval to the floor, filled the tree. He filled \nthe tree. My friends on the other side of the aisle did not want a \nbunch of amendments; they wanted only to vote on a resolution of \napproval or disapproval. In this case, since there is a bipartisan \nmajority in support of disapproval, that is what we are hoping to vote \non. But, unfortunately, what is happening again, it appears tonight \nbased on the spirit, although I hope something changes--just last week, \n42 Senators blocked the ability of the Senate to end debate and \nactually vote on the substance of the deal. I hope that changes. I hope \ntonight at least two Senators on the other side of the aisle will give \nus the ability to express ourselves on the substance of the deal and \nnot block a bipartisan majority of Members who want to express \nthemselves through a vote of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee is my friend. I \nrespect him. I have said so on the floor and have said so privately \namong my colleagues. For the record, I want to make it clear, though, \nthat Senator Reid and the Democrats said there will be no cloture \nnecessary on the motion to proceed, no motion to proceed vote necessary \nlast week on the floor to go to this measure. We had an opportunity to \nobstruct, to block, whatever you want to say, and we did not do it \nbecause we believed that what we had heard repeatedly--that this would \nbe a 60-vote final passage--would ultimately be the standard. There is \nnothing in the statute that brings us to this measure that in any way \neliminates the 60-vote requirement. It is just not there. There is \nnothing that does that.\n  When my colleague's side discovered they did not have 60 votes, which \nwas the beginning of last week, they changed the standard and said: We \nwant a majority vote, and anything less than that is a filibuster. So \nthat was a Republican decision based on the fact that now 42 Democratic \nSenators see this issue differently.\n  I would just say this: We have had 8 weeks on this issue, and we \nshould have taken 8 weeks on this issue. It is that important. And \nevery Senator should stand up and say where they stand on this issue, \nand every Senator has stood up and announced where they stand on this \nissue. This has not been glossed over. We have not made light of it. \nPeople aren't trying to find some sneaky way to avoid responsibility. \nEach person is on the record. You know where I stand, I know where you \nstand, and that goes for every one of our colleagues.\n  So what are we doing tonight? Why are we going through a replay of \nwhat we did last week, and now with the threat of amendments? Now we \nare going to have a run of amendments. They won't be on the Iran \nagreement per se, on the adoption of the agreement, which was the \nunderlying statute. They could be on something else. We are just \ndiscovering what they could be.\n  To say we haven't taken the time and dealt with this in a bipartisan \nway, dealt with it in a serious way, allowed open debate--we have done \nit, and we have cooperated in doing it. My colleague doesn't like the \nresult. I happen\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\nto believe it is a result that really reflects where we should be as a \nnation.\n  I support the President. I believe we ought to have two goals here: \nStop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon and stop America from going \nto another war in the Middle East. That is what I want achieved, and I \nthink we can achieve it through this agreement. But it is subject to \ninspection, it is subject to reports, and if the Iranians decide they \nwant to breach this agreement, then we start back on the sanctions. We \nare back where we started from.\n  I would say to the Senator from Tennessee, having, as he has, faced \nthese conscience votes on the floor about war and about the deaths \nassociated with them, I conclude: First try diplomacy. If diplomacy \ndoes not work, then you have to pursue whatever is necessary for \nnational security. But I believe we have said--42 out of 46 Democratic \nSenators--we support diplomacy first.\n  To argue that this is somehow partisan because four Senators see it \ndifferently--I think there may be some partisanship in the fact that \nnot a single Republican Member of the House or Senate supports the \nPresident's position--not one. I think there may be some partisanship \nin the fact that 47 Republican Senators, on March 9, 2015, sent a \nletter to the Ayatollah in Iran and said, basically, stop negotiating \nwith the United States of America. There is no point in it. That has \nnever ever, ever happened in diplomatic history--that 47 Republican \nSenators would prejudge a matter under negotiation with the President \nof the United States. But they did. So the fact that all 47 voted \nagainst this agreement is no surprise. They announced in March they \nwere against the agreement no matter what it said. I think that is the \nreality of what we face today.\n  I don't know why we are going to keep repeating these votes over and \nover. There are a lot of things we should take up. We have nine \nlegislative days left until this fiscal year ends and we end up closing \ndown the government. I think it is time for us to move on to important \nissues that should command the attention of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed under my leader \ntime.\n  I want to start by congratulating the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee for an incredible job in giving the Senate an \nopportunity to actually express itself on what the President has \ndescribed as an executive agreement.\n  It is an executive agreement. I think it is important for everybody \nto understand that the next President of the United States is going to \ntake a new look at this because it doesn't have the force of law of a \ntreaty. But the President didn't want us to have anything to do with it \nat all. And the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nCorker, skillfully negotiated with the other side to give us an \nopportunity, as elected representatives of the American people, to \nactually express our views on his unilateral action with the Iranian \nGovernment. We proceeded, as the Senator from Tennessee pointed out, in \na manner that respected the process and gave the Senate an opportunity \nto vote on that deal only, even though technically it was open for \namendment. Yet we have been denied the opportunity to get an up-or-down \nvote on the agreement on which the Corker-Cardin bill gave us an \nopportunity to express ourselves.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Tennessee. It has been an \nextraordinary legislative performance. The Senator from Tennessee, as \nwe all know, is someone who admires and respects and is willing to talk \nto the other side, and frequently good things come about as a result of \nit. But we are where we are.\n  This evening, Senate Democrats will have one more opportunity to do \nthe right thing and end their blockade of a vote on the President's \ndeal with Iran. We know that a strong, bipartisan majority of the \nSenate would vote to reject it. But Democratic leaders are determined \nto do anything they can to prevent that vote from happening because \nDemocrats know the deal is indefensible--indefensible--on the merits.\n  The President's Iran deal would allow the world's leading state \nsponsor of terrorism to retain thousands of centrifuges, to enrich \nuranium, to conduct their research and development programs for \nadvanced centrifuges, and to reap a multibillion-dollar cash windfall \nwhich would help it fund terrorist groups like Hezbollah.\n  Here is what the Iranian Defense Minister said just last week:\n\n       I officially declare that under no circumstances will we \n     refrain from providing material and moral support to \n     Hezbollah, or to any other group of the resistance to the \n     U.S. and Israel. We say this loud and clear.\n\n  That is the Iranian Defense Minister.\n  The assault on Israel and the assault on the United States continues \nunabated. In other words, President Obama's Iran deal would likely \nentrench Iran's nuclear capabilities, essentially help subsidize \nterrorism, and threaten Israel--for what? For what? It is not as if the \nIranian regime is about to change its behavior. The Supreme Leader \ncrows that change ``will never happen'' as he rails against the Great \nSatan--that is us--and promises Israel's demise. The scary thing about \nthis is that he is serious. He really means it. The scarier thing is \nthat the President's deal could empower his regime.\n  This is a gravely serious matter. The American people deserve to know \nwhere their respective Senators stand on the President's deal.\n  Democrats seem to think they can end the discussion by blocking an \nup-or-down vote, then turn around and pretend they care deeply about \nIsrael and human rights. Well, if they vote again to deny the American \npeople a final vote, they will have a chance to test the theory.\n  I will file an amendment that would prevent the President from \nlifting sanctions until Iran meets two simple benchmarks: It must \nformally recognize Israel's right to exist, and it must release the \nAmerican citizens being held in Iranian custody.\n  Let me say that again. If cloture is not invoked, I will file an \namendment that would prevent the President from lifting sanctions until \nIran meets two simple benchmarks: It must formally recognize Israel's \nright to exist, and it must release American citizens being held in \nIranian custody.\n  The President has so far resisted linking his deal--a deal that fails \nto end Iran's enrichment program, while leaving it as an American-\nrecognized nuclear threshold state--to other aspects of Iran's conduct, \nbut linkage is appropriate, and in this negotiation it would have been \nwise to have linkage.\n  Indeed, Senators say they understand the importance of standing up \nfor an ally such as Israel in a dangerous region, and the Senate voted \nunanimously just a few months ago in calling for Iranian leaders to \nrelease these Americans.\n  Here is what one American prisoner--this is an American prisoner in \nIran, one of ours--wrote earlier this year:\n\n       As a fellow American and combat veteran, I am writing to \n     bring to your attention my situation and that of a long list \n     of my fellow Americans. For nearly three and a half years, I \n     have been falsely imprisoned and treated inhumanely. . . . \n     While I am thankful that the State Department and the Obama \n     administration has called for my release and that of my \n     fellow Americans, there has been no serious response to this \n     blatant and ongoing mistreatment. . . .\n\n  My strong preference is for our Democratic friends to simply allow an \nup-or-down vote on the President's Iran deal. I don't know what they \nare protecting him from. He is proud of this deal. As I suggested last \nweek, he could have a ceremony down there while he vetoed the \nresolution of disapproval. He has convinced them to protect him from \nwhat he is bragging about. But if they are determined to make that \nimpossible, then at the very least we should be able to provide some \nprotection to Israel and long-overdue relief to Americans who have \nlanguished in Iranian custody for years.\n  So let me just say this. Either way, this debate will continue. This \nis an issue with a very, very long shelf life. It will be before the \nAmerican people for the next year and a half and will certainly be a \nfactor in their determination of whom they want to lead our country as \nPresident in the next election.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is hard for me to comprehend how my \nRepublican colleagues with a straight face can talk about ``Let's have \nan up-or-down vote on this.'' We agreed to allow\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\nRepublicans to have an up-or-down vote. I asked consent on this floor \non two separate occasions, and I make the same request now. We are \nwilling to have a 60-vote threshold. That is an agreement we made, and \nwe are happy to do it. But for my friends now to say ``We want an up-\nor-down vote,'' up-or-down votes on the magical number of 60 is what \nthey created. We didn't draft this legislation. It was brought through \ncommittee to this floor. They thought they had--they, the Republicans, \nthought everything was fine until they realized they didn't have enough \nvotes and suddenly they changed direction dramatically. Fifty votes \nwasn't good enough for trying to raise the minimum wage. Certainly a \nsimple majority wasn't enough to do anything about the overwhelming \ndebt that faces the American people. It is not credit cards, it is \nstudent debt. No, we couldn't debate that; we had to have 60 votes. \nEqual pay for men and women? No, we are not going to allow that to \nhappen; what we want is to have 60 votes. That is the reason we had to \nfile cloture more than 600 times, because the rule had been established \nby my Republican friend, the Republican leader, during the entire Obama \nadministration that that is the rule.\n  Here is what he said--and I have read on this floor all the multitude \nof statements he has given saying it would be 60 votes: We are not \ninteresting in using floor time for get-well efforts. We only have so \nmuch time on the Senate floor. If this isn't a get-well issue, I don't \nknow what would be. We had debate that took place over a long period of \ntime with this issue. It was debated during the August recess, it was \ndebated all last week on the floor, and the decision was made that the \nmeasures brought before this body did not get enough votes. It didn't \nget 60 votes. That is the threshold. We have agreed to have that vote, \nand suddenly the rules are suddenly attempting to be changed here, and \nthey are not going to be changed.\n  It is a situation where I wonder if the Republican leader has \nbothered to look at the calendar. We have 8 days now until we are at \nthe end of the fiscal year--8 days. We have 32 Republicans who have \nwritten to the Speaker saying: We are not going to allow a bill to pass \nunless we get rid of Planned Parenthood--health care for women. We have \nhad statements of people running for President over here who are saying \nthere will be nothing done on paying the government's bills unless we \ndo something about Planned Parenthood. Other people have made \nstatements that they want riders dealing with EPA and on and on.\n  Now, it would be different--maybe we wouldn't be as concerned, except \nyou did it once. You did it once. They closed the government for almost \n3 weeks. Two years ago, the government was actually shut down for \nalmost 3 weeks.\n  We have staring us in the face the debt ceiling, which is going to be \nupon us quickly. But, no, we are told that what we are going to deal \nwith next after this: We are going to do something that everyone knows \nhas no chance of passing, and that is something dealing with abortion. \nI guess they want to do that before the Pope gets here. But it is not \ngoing to change the Pope, how he feels about the fact that Republicans \nhave ignored poor people in America. It is not going to change the \nPope, how he feels about what is happening to our great world that we \nlive in, that we know, dealing with climate change. Republicans have \ndenied that climate change exists. So they can have a fake vote on \nabortion. It is not going to change how Pope Francis feels about what \nis happening, and it is all being directed towards the Republicans, and \nhe doesn't need--everyone knows what the problems are.\n  So we can be threatened all we need to be threatened. The Republican \nleader has threatened us: We lost, and we are going to make you suffer. \nJust like we lost ObamaCare.\n  We had over 600 votes to get rid of that. We may have more than that \nto get rid of this agreement.\n  They have magnified this agreement. They have this agreement--oh, it \nis doing all kinds of things. The purpose of this agreement, everyone \nknows, is to stop Iran from having a nuclear weapon, and that is what \nit does. That is the sole purpose of this agreement. And it is an \nagreement that is so important. It is so important that we got Russia, \nwe got China, and the others, our allies--Germany, France--to sign off \non this, and Great Britain. To think, after all the years of \nnegotiating this through all of our friends and allies, including the \ngood work that has been done in this regarding Russia and China, to \nthink that suddenly it is going to be back the way it was. Every one of \nthese countries said: If you don't move forward on this agreement, we \nare through. Sanctions are gone.\n  So this is not an intelligent debate because my friend the Republican \nleader is trying to change the rules he developed. He created these \nrules. He created the 60-vote threshold. We tried to change that \nhundreds of times, but no.\n  Let's also remind everybody that we did not filibuster this bill. We \nlet the Republicans go to this bill. We let them go to the bill. We let \nthem go to the bill. There was no motion to proceed. And people \nwatching may say: What is that? Well, what the Republicans did time and \ntime again, even on measures they wanted passed, they would make us \nfile a motion to proceed and have cloture on that. That ate up a week's \nperiod of time. In their mind, that was really tasty because it was \ngood, because it stopped Obama from moving his program ahead. Anything \nto stall for time. Well, the 60-vote threshold was created by the \nRepublicans. That is the rule of this body, and we are sticking by the \nrules of this body. It was created by the Republicans.\n  So we can be--I repeat--threatened all my friend the Republican \nleader wants to threaten us. Whatever he wants to do, he has a right do \nthat. We are not going to be stalling for time. If he wants to tear \ndown a tree--remember the tree? Remember, Reid was the bad guy; he \nfilled the tree. I can't number the times my friend the Republican \nleader has filled the tree--something he said would never happen. He \nsaid bills wouldn't come to this body unless there were hearings and \nthey were reported out of committee. Of course, that is not true. Being \nmajority leader is not as easy as giving speeches.\n  What is going on tonight is a charade by the Republicans to try to \nchange the rules in the middle of the game. The Republicans have lost. \nThey have lost this measure. We should move on to something else. It \nshould be the budget. It shouldn't be abortion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I do want to clarify, the bill \nspecifically states regular order. It is not the rule of the Senate \nthat final votes are on 60 votes. They are on a majority vote. I don't \nwant anybody in the Senate or certainly the public to think that \nsomehow we have a rule that bills pass on 60 votes. That is not the \ncase. That has been a tradition on major issues, but that is not the \nrule. The bill specifically states we will settle under regular order, \nwhich means when cloture is invoked--which hopefully will happen \ntonight--we will have a simple majority vote, up or down.\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask my friend a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORKER. If it is brief. I know people have a meeting to go to.\n  Mr. REID. Do you think this Iran issue is a major issue?\n  Mr. CORKER. It is a major issue.\n  Mr. REID. You answered your own question.\n  Mr. CORKER. I am hoping we are going to be able to vote our \nconscience on this major issue by getting cloture invoked.\n  I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum call with \nrespect to the cloture motions on amendment No. 2640 and H.J. Res. 61.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Senate amendment \n     No. 2640.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, John Barrasso, Bob Corker, \n           Steve Daines, David Perdue, Tom Cotton, Susan M. \n           Collins, Deb Fischer, Shelley Moore\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\n           Capito, Mike Crapo, Ron Johnson, Cory Gardner, Marco \n           Rubio, Lamar Alexander, James M.

Mr. President, I want to call the Senate's attention today \nto yet another outstanding Vermont business: Seventh Generation. \nSeventh Generation unveiled its line of environmentally friendly \nconsumer household products more than 25 years ago. Today it has \nexpanded to become one of the dominant businesses in this continuously \nemerging market.\n  I have visited Seventh Generation many times, and I am consistently \nimpressed with how the company continues to find new ways of expanding \nits business and offering Americans affordable and more sustainable \nalternatives to standard household products.\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\n  Since 2011, Seventh Generation has seen its business grow year after \nyear and has unveiled some 100 new products in the last 4 years alone. \nPresident and CEO John Replogle has reinvigorated the company, further \ndefining its purpose and leadership in the competitive marketplace.\n  Seventh Generation has long been a company that fosters the business \nprinciples and ideals that so many Vermonters value: to make products \nlocally, to keep it sustainable, to leave no footprint, and make \nproducts accessible. From its Burlington offices that overlook the \nshores of Lake Champlain to the shelves of the retail giants now \npromoting its products, Seventh Generation is yet another Vermont \ncompany leading the way in corporate responsibility.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the August 27, 2015, article from the \nBurlington Free Press entitled ``Seventh Generation: `Bursting at the \nseams' '' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Aug. 27, 2015]\n\n              Seventh Generation: `Bursting at the Seams'\n\n                          (By Dan D'Ambrosio)\n\n       Seventh Generation in Burlington has been on a tear since \n     John Replogle took over as president and CEO in 2011. Sales \n     are up more than 60 percent, from about $150 million when \n     Replogle arrived to about $250 million projected for this \n     year. Annual growth is in the ``low double digits,'' says \n     Replogle.\n       That's a lot of toilet tissue made from recycled paper and \n     natural, cold-water laundry detergent, not to mention the \n     dozens of other products in Seventh Generation's expanded \n     line of ``green'' disinfectants, dishwashing and hand soaps, \n     surface cleaners, diapers and baby wipes and feminine hygiene \n     products. Seventh Generation has added about 100 new products \n     under Replogle.\n       The company today dominates the market for natural cleaning \n     products, according to Replogle, who says the other leaders \n     in the industry are Method and Mrs. Meyers Clean Day.\n       ``Adding our sales together we have a half-billion dollar \n     business,'' said Replogle. ``I would love to see the three \n     brands grow to a billion dollars over the next few years.''\n       In typical Reploglian fashion, Replogle declines to \n     criticize his two closest competitors in any way, going so \n     far as to refer to them as ``frenemies.'' And he points out \n     that the three brands together have less than a 5 percent \n     share in any category they sell in, leaving a long way to go \n     before they begin to threaten the Procter & Gambles of the \n     world.\n       ``What they're trying to do is very much in the spirit of \n     what we're trying to do,'' Replogle said. ``Use fewer \n     ingredients, be less toxic, be more sustainable in \n     manufacturing and packaging. So there's a lot of commonality \n     among our brands.''\n\n\n                         `A really smart dude'\n\n       Replogle, 49, is the former president of Guinness in the \n     United States and United Kingdom. From there he went to \n     Unilever, where he ran the North American skin care business, \n     with brands including Dove, Ponds, Caress and Lever 2000. \n     Next, in 2006, Replogle took the helm at Burt's Bees, \n     bringing the quirky natural skin care company to the masses.\n       ``We launched at Target, CVS and Walgreen's,'' Replogle \n     said. ``We built a national brand. I put great people on the \n     team, and gave them a lot of freedom. We set up core values \n     and principles to run the company and we invested behind it, \n     and it took off.''\n       Which is a pretty good description of what Replogle has \n     done at Seventh Generation. Alan Newman, founder of Magic Hat \n     Brewing Co., launched the original Seventh Generation catalog \n     business more than 25 years ago. Newman has been watching \n     Replogle from his latest perch in the Maltex Building on Pine \n     Street, where Newman is running a new craft beer company for \n     The Boston Beer Co., a.k.a. Samuel Adams. Newman likes what \n     he sees on the waterfront, where Seventh Generation is \n     headquartered at Main Street Landing.\n       ``John's a really smart dude who knows how to bring focus \n     to an organization, who knows how to re-enthuse the \n     mission,'' Newman said. ``From what I can tell from the \n     outside, he's a really good delegator and manager.''\n       In Newman's estimation, Seventh Generation had largely lost \n     sight of its mission four years ago when Replogle took over.\n       ``I did not pay a lot of attention to Seventh Generation, \n     but whenever I did they were scattered all over the place,'' \n     Newman said. ``They didn't seem to have any mission left.''\n       Sales were also flat, Replogle said.\n       ``I just knew this company stood for something greater and \n     that it needed leadership,'' Replogle said. ``The company was \n     at a crossroads. We were very nearly at the end of our rope \n     frankly.''\n       Replogle began drawing that rope in by putting a laser \n     focus on what Seventh Generation stands for--natural, \n     sustainable, environmentally sensitive cleaning products, the \n     only segment of the retail category showing significant \n     growth.\n       ``We're really in tune with the consumer today,'' Replogle \n     said. ``The millennial consumer in particular, people trying \n     to avoid chemicals, who are more conscious about not only \n     what's in their product but also the practices of the company \n     itself. More and more young consumers are understanding the \n     company behind their product matters. We're winning with \n     those consumers.''\n\n\n                            A pioneer brand\n\n       As an example of a best manufacturing practice at Seventh \n     Generation, Replogle points to the fact that the company \n     contracts all of its manufacturing to about 22 factories \n     across the nation. ``You will always have the most \n     sustainable footprint on a dispersed model,'' Replogle said. \n     ``If we can manufacture closer to the market, we'll do a lot \n     better. A lot of companies have one large-scale manufacturing \n     site. Then you have to ship everything in and ship the \n     products out.'' Second, Replogle said, Seventh Generation \n     continues to innovate.\n       ``We've upgraded every product in our portfolio in the last \n     four years,'' he said. ``Every product has been improved in \n     some material way. We never stop and we're innovating into \n     new spaces. Plus, we've taken our brand from a few categories \n     into several categories. We're not only in dish soap and \n     laundry detergent, we're in hand wash, diapers and wipes and \n     feminine care. We've gone across all the categories.''\n       Target has taken notice. Spokeswoman Erica Julkowski said \n     Seventh Generation is one of a ``handful of vendors'' the \n     giant retailer works with closely to ``ideate and develop \n     products.'' ``Seventh Generation is a pioneer brand in \n     natural cleaning and has been a valued partner to Target by \n     providing ongoing innovation and thought leadership,'' \n     Julkowski said in an email. ``Through Seventh Generation's \n     deep understanding of the naturals cleaning industry, they \n     continue to provide expert knowledge on the market and \n     insight into up-and-coming products that might resonate with \n     the Target guest.''\n       In Seventh Generation's soothing offices overlooking Lake \n     Champlain--all earth tones and wood paneling with an open \n     center staircase festooned with greenery and the company's \n     principles emblazoned on dangling wooden signs--John \n     Fitzgerald is working on a shelf layout for Target. The \n     products are dish soaps and detergents.\n       In the computer generated ``plan-o-gram'' on his big \n     screen, Fitzgerald proposes a display layout of not only \n     Seventh Generation's products, but also of Method's and Mrs. \n     Meyer's offerings, as well as giants like Cascade and Finish. \n     Finally, Fitzgerald proposes shelf positions for Target's \n     own house brands, all based on data collected by a third \n     party.\n       ``Our goal is to be objective, to share the facts and give \n     them a recommendation,'' Replogle said. ``Our goal isn't to \n     convince them our way is the right way.''\n       Nevertheless, working so closely with Target is a pretty \n     good relationship builder, Replogle adds.\n\n\n                        Born here, staying here\n\n       Seventh Generation is bursting at the seams at Main Street \n     Landing, with most of its approximately 140 employees working \n     in Burlington. Replogle plans on adding another 15 employees \n     to the staff by the end of the year.\n       ``We have maximized our space in here,'' he said. ``Growth \n     is a wonderful thing, but right now we're fully utilized in \n     this building.''\n       That doesn't mean, however, that Seventh Generation is \n     going anywhere.\n       ``Burlington is our long-term home,'' Replogle said. ``We \n     were born here, we're growing up here and will will remain \n     here. No question. We're committed to that.''\n       Seventh Generation has a small office in Toronto, and a \n     satellite office in Raleigh, North Carolina, where Replogle \n     lived as CEO of Burt's Bees, and where his family still \n     lives.\n       When he was recruited to run Seventh Generation, Replogle \n     and his wife decided against uprooting their four children, \n     so he has been commuting, returning to his home in Raleigh \n     every other week.\n       A native of Boston and a graduate of Dartmouth and Harvard, \n     Replogle feels he has the best of both worlds, maintaining \n     his life in Raleigh and returning to New England for more \n     than a visit. Replogle said it's going to feel even better \n     when his daughter starts at Dartmouth as a freshman this \n     fall.\n       ``She'll be right down the road as well,'' he said.\n       Replogle expects to open an office in California soon, and \n     earlier this year he launched the business in China with an \n     office in Hangzhou.\n       ``There's demand for our products over there,'' Replogle \n     said. ``We're in Japan, Hong Kong, of course mainland China. \n     We're in Korea, Vietnam, Australia. That's been growing over \n     the last five years.''\n       Replogle said Seventh Generation will also be in Europe \n     within three years.\n       ``How we get there we're still working on right now,'' he \n     said. ``Whether it's a direct model where we create Seventh \n     Generation Europe or whether we partner into that market we \n     haven't determined yet.''\n\n\n                           The latest venture\n\n       Seventh Generation's office in Raleigh is home to the \n     company's venture arm, with nine employees who look for new \n     business opportunities beyond natural cleaning products.\n       ``We created Seventh Generation Ventures about three years \n     ago with the idea of\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n     partnering with like-minded companies and helping them \n     accelerate their growth,'' Replogle said.\n       The acquisitions began with Bobble, a filtered water bottle \n     company Seventh Generation bought in 2013. The plastic water \n     bottle features a replaceable charcoal filter, and sells for \n     $10, with a new filter that costs about $3. It's marketed as \n     a way to reduce disposable water bottle use.\n       Next, Seventh Generation Ventures picked up Presse, a \n     travel coffee mug with built-in French press, which is being \n     marketed under the Bobble name. Call it a K-Cup killer.\n       ``This is our answer to Keurig,'' said Replogle, holding a \n     stainless steel Presse in his hand. ``We looked for mission-\n     aligned companies like this that are trying to solve a \n     problem like, end the incredible waste of single-serve water \n     bottles or, end the incredible waste of K-Cups.''\n       Seventh Generation Ventures was boosted considerably by a \n     $30 million investment last September from former Vice \n     President Al Gore's investment fund, the London-based \n     Generation Investment Management LLP. Seventh Generation \n     returned to private ownership about 15 years ago after a \n     brief flirtation with being a publicly owned company.\n       The company's nine board members own about 70 percent of \n     the company, Replogle said, with new shareholders \n     periodically invited in, and existing shareholders offered an \n     exit.

Simpson and Senator James E. Risch on this \nimportant achievement.\n  Enactment of this legislation, also called the SNRA Plus, was \naccomplished due to significant hard work, led by Representative \nSimpson. Representative Simpson's determination to work through the \nmany challenges that arose during the near decade of this collaborative \neffort has given Idaho a homegrown solution to sustaining this \ntreasured area of Idaho.\n  Senator Risch's work in shepherding this legislation through the \nSenate, including through the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources on which he serves, is also commendable. Senator Risch fought \nthrough many challenges in his pursuit of getting this needed \nlegislation over the finish line.\n  A number of other individuals deserve acknowledgement for their \nconsiderable efforts to develop a hard-sought consensus that will be of \nlasting benefit. John Revier and Lindsay Slater of Representative \nSimpson's staff dedicated immeasurable time and extensive know-how to \ndeveloping the legislation to reach this milestone. Custer and Blaine \nCounty Commissioners also did an outstanding job in this collaborative \neffort. The SNRA Plus is a win for Idaho and an example of how local \ngovernments and interests can achieve solutions to some of the most \npersistent public lands issues we face today.\n  Following the enactment of this important legislation, the focus must \nnow shift to the hard work of successful implementation that will \nrequire commitment from the various Federal agencies and all of the \naffected interests. Again, I commend Representative Simpson, Senator \nRisch and the other stakeholders for their important work that will \nmake a lasting difference in our great State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6646-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF U.S. PROBATION AND PRETRIAL \n                                SERVICES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in March of 1925, President Calvin \nCoolidge signed into law the Probation Act, making that sentencing \noption available in the Federal courts. Six months later, on September \n22, the first Federal probation officers were appointed, taking on the \ncrucial dual task of promoting rehabilitation and protecting public \nsafety. On this 90th anniversary, we pay our respects to the probation \nofficers who serve the public, helping to keep our communities safe.\n  The advent of probation at the Federal level was driven by the \nsuccess and spread of probation by individual States. Between 1909 and \n1925, some 34 bills were introduced to establish a Federal probation \nlaw. President Coolidge, who as Governor of Massachusetts was familiar \nwith probation at the State level, provided key support for the law's \nfinal passage.\n  A significant impetus for the law's eventual enactment was the fact \nthat the National Prohibition Act of 1919 made Federal criminals out of \nmany non-violent, otherwise law-abiding Americans. Under the auspices \nof the U.S. Courts, Probation and Pretrial Services has been operating \na Federal re-entry court since 2008, along with programs aimed at \naddiction recovery.\n  Among those first Federal probation officers was George Grover, who, \n20 years before the Probation Act became the first state-authorized \nprobation officer in Maine, serving Cumberland County. Mr. Grover was a \nvigorous advocate of probation as an alternative to incarceration. \nAllowing a non-violent offender, under rigorous supervision, to remain \nat home and in the community, on the job and supporting a family, Mr. \nGrover often said, ``Gives a man a chance to try again.''\n  Probation officers are important members of the law enforcement \ncommunity. Together with pretrial services and other law enforcement \nagencies, they help individuals become productive, responsible, and \nlaw-abiding citizens.\n  Balancing corrections and rehabilitation with safeguarding the public \nis difficult and, far too often, dangerous. On this 90th anniversary, \nwe pay our respects to the probation officers who have lost their lives \nor been assaulted in the line of duty. In particular, I salute the men \nand women of Probation and Pretrial Services in Maine and across the \ncountry for their dedication to the public they serve.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 90th anniversary of \nthe U.S. Probation System in Maine, for their dedication to ensuring \nthe criminal justice system operates effectively and the public remains \nsafe. Two events will be held in recognition, scheduled for September \n21, 2015 and September 25, 2015, to commemorate 90 years of hard work \nand success.\n  Signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge in 1925, the Probation \nAct altered the outlook of our judicial system. The act empowered \ncourts to suspend a sentence and place worthy defendants into the \nprobation system. Under predetermined conditions and irrefutable terms, \nlow-level offenders have the opportunity to stay with their families \nand remain employed, while giving back to the community. For 90 years, \nthis important piece of legislation has helped change and enhance \nlives, while keeping communities safe.\n  Implementing probation services as a Federal law was a long and \narduous process, and required significant effort at the State level. \nMaine has been a leader in supporting probation services since the \nearly 1900s. In fact, Maine is home to George Grover, one of the first \nfederally appointed--unpaid--State probation officers. He was appointed \n90 years ago, on September 22, 1925, and served the communities and \ncourts of Maine diligently.\n  The U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services of Maine are dedicated to \nthe betterment of the entire State. Helping to change lives, keeping \nfamilies together, allowing defendants to stay on the job and give \nback, are just a few of the benefits this system regularly achieves. \nThe U.S. Probation System is also committed to addressing and combating \nthe serious concern of drug addiction in Maine. Through re-entry courts \nand treatment services, the probation system is helping low-level \noffenders turn their lives around and earn a fresh start.\n  I applaud the U.S. Probation and Pretrial System in Maine for their \ndedicated service to communities and bettering lives throughout Maine. \nI would like to join the U.S. District Court of Maine in highlighting \nthe success and hard work that has been demonstrated over the last 90 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6646-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6646-S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TERRY BOSTON\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

Mr. President, today, I wish to recognize and honor the \nextraordinary service of Wayne Townsend, a lifelong Hoosier who spent \n23 years in the Indiana State legislature and was the 1984 Democratic \nnominee for Governor.\n  Wayne passed away on July 3, 2015, at the age of 89. A native of \nGrant County, Wayne dedicated his life to Indiana and embodied the true \ndefinition of a public servant.\n  Throughout his legislative career, Wayne was a tireless advocate for \nHoosier public schools and helped lead the effort to pass the School \nReorganization Act of 1959 and its reauthorization in 1965. He also was \na strong advocate for equal rights.\n  Throughout his political career, Wayne remained humble and caring. He \nserved as a role model to all Hoosiers and tirelessly fought to improve \nthe lives of millions.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Wayne on several occasions. His \ndedication to public service inspired me to create the Wayne Townsend \nLegislative Program in his honor. The Townsend Program affords college \nstudents and recent graduates the opportunity to serve Indiana by \nworking in our Washington, DC, office for a semester. Wayne has been an \nimportant mentor to me during my own legislative career, and his legacy \ncontinues to motivate me today.\n  Born on May 1, 1926, on his family's farm in Grant County, the \nyoungest of six children, Wayne graduated from Jefferson Township High \nSchool and went on to study agriculture at Purdue University. He joined \nthe Army during the Korean War and served in the Counterintelligence \nCorps. In 1951, Wayne started his own farming business, which he \neventually grew from 225 acres to 2,500 acres. He was elected to the \nIndiana General Assembly in 1958 at 32 years old and elected to the \nIndiana Senate in 1970. During his legislative career, Wayne was a \nmember of the house ways and means committee and the senate finance \ncommittee.\n  Outside of politics, Wayne was a loving husband, father, and \ngrandfather. He married Helen Hardin, his college sweetheart, in 1953, \nand they had five children together: Jay, Mark, Lisa, Steve, and Alan. \nAll five of their children went to Blackford High School and graduated \nfrom Purdue University. He was also a proud grandfather to 18 \ngrandchildren.\n  Wayne continued to play a prominent role in Indiana after his time in \nthe state legislature. He was president of the Grant County Purdue \nAgricultural Alumni Association and a director of the Purdue \nAgricultural Alumni Association. Wayne also continued his involvement \nin education, serving as a trustee for Earlham College for 8 years and \na trustee for Purdue University for 15 years. In 2007 he received the \nFrank O'Bannon Public Service Award, and in 2014 he received Purdue \nUniversity's highest honor, the Order of the Griffin.\n  Wayne will be deeply missed by all Hoosiers. His integrity, tireless \nefforts, and strong leadership helped to make Indiana a better place, \nand we will always be grateful for his service. May God welcome him \nhome and bring comfort to his family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6647-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT CALVIN SPANN\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I wish to celebrate the remarkable life \nand accomplishments of a great American and New Jerseyan, Lieutenant \nCalvin Spann. As a boy in Rutherford, NJ, Calvin was amazed by the \nmiracle of flight, watching as planes took off from nearby Teterboro \nAirport. This early passion for aviation, coupled with a determination \nto prove that as an African American he was as capable as anyone to fly \na plane, would eventually motivate him to take a courageous risk as a \nyoung man. Lieutenant Spann enlisted in the Army Air Forces at a time \nwhen all branches of the U.S. military were still segregated. He left \nhome behind when he was assigned by the Army to attend Flight Training \nSchool at Tuskegee University in Alabama.\n  In earning his wings at Tuskegee and serving in Europe during World \nWar II as a member of the 100th Fighter Squadron and 332nd Fighter \nGroup, Lieutenant Spann proved not only that he could fly but that he \ncould do it with unusual bravery and skill. Lieutenant Spann flew 26 \nmissions during the war, including what was at the time the longest \nbomber escort mission in history. Lieutenant Spann received numerous \nawards for his military service, including--much too late--a \nCongressional Gold Medal in 2006. The distinction with which Lieutenant \nSpann and his fellow Tuskegee Airmen served paved the way for President \nTruman to desegregate the U.S. military in 1948.\n  Lieutenant Spann, unfortunately, returned home at a time in which \nracial discrimination still outweighed his distinguished military \nservice. Trying to build flight hours in an effort to remain a pilot, \nhe was denied access to planes at Teterboro, and commercial airlines \nwould not hire him simply because of his race. With characteristic \nresilience, he earned a living for himself and his family as a factory \nsupervisor, sales representative, restaurant owner, and real estate \nbroker. Fifty years later, he was inducted into the New Jersey Aviation \nHall of Fame.\n  Lieutenant Spann pushed against a system that held all Americans back \nby denying some individuals the ability to contribute their talent and \npassion simply because of their identity. The United States of America \nis a better, stronger country because of Lieutenant Spann. For having \nthe courage to pursue his dreams in the face of tremendous obstacles \nand at great risk to himself, Lieutenant Spann deserves our deepest \nrespect and gratitude. May he rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6647-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6647-S6648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALLISON TRANSMISSION\n\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I recognize the 100th anniversary \nof Allison Transmission, a company that traces its history back to the \nfounding of the Indianapolis Speedway Team Co. in 1915. As a co-founder \nof the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and part owner of several racing \nteams, James A. Allison established a machine shop on Main Street in \nSpeedway, IN. Allison's initial focus was racing. However, in 1917 when \nthe United States entered World War I, Allison shifted focus to produce \nparts and tooling for Liberty engines used by many Allied airplanes in \nthe war.\n  After a brief return to racing at the war's end in late 1918 and a \nwin at the\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\n1919 Indianapolis 500, Allison continued to focus on engineering \naircraft and marine products. When James Allison died in 1928, General \nMotors bought the company. Shortly before the start of World War II, \naircraft engines became the Allison Division's focus. Later, as part of \nGM, Allison Transmission developed the first cross-drive hydraulic unit \nfor the M-41 Patton tank. Since then the company has made transmissions \nfor most of the U.S. military's armored and tactical wheeled vehicles.\n  Further development of transmissions for buses, automatics for trucks \nand buses, hydraulically controlled trucks and buses, and transmissions \nwith electronic controls were developed by Allison from the 1950s \nthrough the 1990s. GM sold Allison Transmission in 2007 to a pair of \nprivate equity firms, and in March 2012, Allison Transmission Holdings \nInc. became a public company with its shares trading on the New York \nStock Exchange.\n  Today, Allison Transmission, a company founded on the values of \ninnovation and Hoosier hard work, continues to deliver quality products \nand reliable services with a current focus on fuel economy. \nHeadquartered in Indianapolis, Allison Transmission is the world's \nlargest manufacturer of fully automatic commercial-duty transmissions \nand a leader in hybrid-propulsion systems. Today, vehicles powered by \nan Allison fully automatic transmission can be found on every continent \ndoing everything from transporting school children, fighting fires, and \nunlocking oil beneath the earth's surface. Allison Transmission \ncurrently has approximately 2,700 employees and a presence in more than \n80 countries, including manufacturing facilities in the United States, \nHungary, and India.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I would like to congratulate \nAllison Transmission on 100 years of success. As a multinational \ncompany that grew out of a humble machine shop in Speedway, IN, Allison \nTransmission has served as an economic and community anchor for the \ngreater Indianapolis area and beyond.\n  On this special occasion, we congratulate Allison Transmission on 100 \nyears of excellence in innovation and service, and honor the \ngenerations of Hoosiers who have devoted their careers to manufacturing \nexcellence under the Allison Transmission brand. We are proud that \nAllison Transmission calls Indiana home, and we wish them continued \nsuccess for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6648-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH CASEY\n\n Mr. CASEY.

Joe has been at the forefront of \nthis innovation, leading the charge to transform SEPTA from a \ndependable transportation service to a nationwide leader and \ntrailblazer in public transportation.\n  During his tenure as general manager of SEPTA, Mr. Casey demonstrated \na steadfast dedication to customer service, infrastructural innovation, \nand business integrity.\n  Mr. Casey is committed to the principle of putting the customer \nfirst. He established SEPTA's first customer service division, which \nworked endlessly to ensure customer service was the cornerstone of \nSEPTA and its employees. Mr. Casey's ``Four Cs'' of customer service--\ncleanliness, convenience, courtesy, and communication--quickly became \ndoctrine engrained in the daily operations of the authority. Mr. \nCasey's unwavering dedication to customer service helped propel SEPTA \nto record ridership numbers and mold SEPTA into the authority it is \ntoday.\n  Mr. Casey not only helped SEPTA become a more advanced and innovative \nauthority, he worked tirelessly to improve the entire transportation \ninfrastructure of Southeastern Pennsylvania. He supervised the \nattainment of 120 new Silverliner V rail cars and 700 hybrid buses, \nwhich were major improvements to SEPTA's operation. Mr. Casey also \ntestified before the U.S. and Pennsylvania House and Senate committees \nregarding infrastructure and the need for investment. His testimonies \nhelped lead to the passage of Act 89 in the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, which provides necessary funding for critical \ninfrastructural advancements for both rail and highway projects.\n  Mr. Casey's reputation of integrity and character is reflected in his \ncommitment to economic, environmental, and social sustainability. His \ndedication to sustainability resulted in SEPTA earning awards such as \nthe 2012 American Public Transportation Association Outstanding Public \nTransportation System and the Gold Sustainability Recognition. These \nawards highlight the bright and successful tenure of Mr. Joe Casey as \ngeneral manager of SEPTA.\n  After his retirement, Mr. Casey will apply his transportation \nexpertise as chair of the transportation committee tasked with planning \nand coordinating transportation logistics for the 2016 Democratic \nNational Convention in Philadelphia.\n  I want to once more congratulate Joe Casey on his career as an \ninnovative and honorable leader of SEPTA.

His work has spanned many \nareas of public service, and I wish to recognize Major General Zink and \nhis family as he moves on to the next stage of retirement.\n  As a young man from Sterling, NE, Major General Zink felt the call to \npublic service early. He enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard \nin 1970 after completing his undergraduate course work at Nebraska \nWesleyan University. Major General Zink received his commission as an \ninfantry officer through the Nebraska Military Academy in June of 1972. \nHe spent 4 years drilling as a young officer in the 134th Infantry \nBattalion while he completed his law degree at the University of \nNebraska College of Law. Major General Zink went on to serve as a staff \njudge advocate at the brigade and State headquarters level before being \nselected as the Nebraska assistant adjutant general for the Army. Major \nGeneral Zink retired in 2008 after becoming commander of the U.S. Army \nNorth's Operational Command Post One.\n  Working in the legal community as an attorney, Major General Zink \nspecialized in worker's compensation practices and tort law, while also \ndonning the uniform on weekends to assist soldiers and the Nebraska \nNational Guard with legal issues.\n  After he left the service, Zink continued to work for the State of \nNebraska. Serving as State chair of the Nebraska Committee for Employer \nSupport of the Guard and Reserve for over 5 years, Major General Zink \nhas been an advocate for Nebraska servicemembers and their employers. \nHis leadership helped to strengthen employer knowledge regarding the \nvalue of military experience in the workplace. Under Zink's watch, 11 \nNebraska employers finished in the top 30 finalists for the Secretary \nof Defense Employer Support Freedom Award. The Burt County Sherriff's \nOffice and Electrical Contractors, Inc., also took home the Defense \nDepartment's highest honor for employers in support of National Guard \nand Reserve employees.\n  In 2009, Major General Zink ran for office and won a position with \nthe Airport Authority.

A bill for the relief of Shirley Constantino Tan; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill for \nthe private relief of Shirley Constantino Tan. Ms. Tan is a Filipina \nnational living in Pacifica, CA. She is the proud mother of 19 year old \nU.S. citizen twin boys, Jashley and Joriene, and the spouse of Jay \nMercado, a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n  I believe Ms. Tan merits Congress' special consideration for this \nextraordinary form of relief because I believe her removal from the \nUnited States would cause undue hardship for her and her family. She \nfaces deportation to the Philippines, which would separate her from her \nfamily and jeopardize her safety.\n  Ms. Tan experienced horrific violence in the Philippines before she \nleft to come to the United States. When she was only 14 years old, her \ncousin murdered her mother and her sister and shot Shirley in the head. \nWhile the cousin who committed the murders was eventually prosecuted, \nhe received a short jail sentence. Fearing for her safety, Ms. Tan fled \nthe Philippines just before her cousin was due to be released from \njail. She entered the U.S. legally on a visitor's visa in 1989.\n  Ms. Tan's current deportation order is the result of negligent \ncounsel. Shirley applied for asylum in 1995. While her case appeal was \npending at the Board of Immigration Appeals, her attorney failed to \nsubmit a brief to support her case. As a result, the case was \ndismissed, and the Board of Immigration Appeals granted Shirley \nvoluntary departure from the United States.\n  Shirley never received notice that the Board of Immigration Appeals \ngranted her voluntary departure. Shirley's attorney moved offices, did \nnot receive the order, and ultimately never informed her of the order. \nAs a result, Shirley did not depart the United States and the grant of \nvoluntary departure automatically became a deportation order. She \nlearned about the deportation order for the first time on January 28, \n2009, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents took her into \nimmigration custody.\n  Because of her attorney's negligent actions, Ms. Tan was denied the \nopportunity to present her case in U.S. immigration proceedings. \nShirley later filed a complaint with the State Bar of California \nagainst her former attorney. She is not the first person to file such a \ncomplaint against this attorney.\n  On February 4, 2015, Shirley's spouse, Jay, a U.S. Citizen, filed an \napproved spousal petition on her behalf. On August 20, 2015, U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services denied Shirley's application due \nto the fact that Shirley still had a final order or removal. Shirley \nmust go back to the immigration court and ask for the court to \nterminate her case and then reapply with United States Immigration and \nCitizenship Services. Shirley is now again faced with deportation while \nshe seeks to close her case before the Immigration Judge.\n  In addition to the hardship that would come to Ms. Tan if she is \ndeported, Shirley's deportation would be a serious hardship to her two \nU.S. citizen children, Jashley and Joriene, who are minors.\n  Joriene is a sophomore at Stanford University and is pre-Med in Human \nBiology. Jashley is a sophomore at Chapman University and plans to \ndeclare his Business major in spring. In addition to his studies, \nJashley is involved in Stanford's Pilipino-American Student Union. Ms. \nTan no longer runs her in-home daycare and is a stay-at-home mom.\n  If Ms. Tan were forced to leave the United States, her family has \nexpressed that they would go with Shirley to the Philippines or try to \nfind a third country where the entire family could relocate. This would \nmean that Jashley and Joriene would have to leave behind their \neducation and the only home they know in the United States.\n  I do not believe it is in our Nation's best interest to force this \nfamily, with two U.S. citizen children, to make the\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\nchoice between being separated and relocating to a country where they \nmay face safety concerns or other serious hardships.\n  Ms. Tan and her family are involved in their community in Pacifica \nand own their own home. The family attends Good Shepherd Catholic \nChurch, volunteering at the church and the Mother Theresa of Calcutta's \nDaughters of Charity. Shirley has the support of dozens of members of \nher community who shared with me the family's spirit of commitment to \ntheir community.\n  Enactment of the legislation I am introducing on behalf of Ms. Tan \ntoday will enable this entire family to continue their lives in \nCalifornia and make positive contributions to their community.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS FOR SHIRLEY CONSTANTINO \n                   TAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1151), Shirley Constantino Tan shall be eligible for issuance \n     of an immigrant visa or for adjustment of status to that of \n     an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence upon \n     filing an application for issuance of an immigrant visa under \n     section 204 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1154) or for adjustment of \n     status to lawful permanent resident.\n       (b) Adjustment of Status.--If Shirley Constantino Tan \n     enters the United States before the filing deadline specified \n     in subsection (c), she shall be considered to have entered \n     and remained lawfully and shall, if otherwise eligible, be \n     eligible for adjustment of status under section 245 of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1255) as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply only if the application \n     for issuance of an immigrant visa or the application for \n     adjustment of status is filed with appropriate fees within 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (d) Reduction of Immigrant Visa Number.--Upon the granting \n     of an immigrant visa or permanent residence to Shirley \n     Constantino Tan, the Secretary of State shall instruct the \n     proper officer to reduce by one, during the current or next \n     following fiscal year, the total number of immigrant visas \n     that are made available to natives of the country of the \n     alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)) or, if applicable, the \n     total number of immigrant visas that are made available to \n     natives of the country of the alien's birth under section \n     202(e) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1152(e)).\n       (e) PAYGO.--The budgetary effects of this Act, for the \n     purpose of complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010, shall be determined by reference to the latest \n     statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' \n     for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional \n     Record by the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \n     provided that such statement has been submitted prior to the \n     vote on passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/15/senate-section/article/S6654-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6654-S6656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 252--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL \n  BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP OF THE SENATE RELATING TO EASING THE \n          BURDEN OF FEDERAL TAX COMPLIANCE ON SMALL BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. VITTER submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                              S. Res. 252\n\n       Whereas American small businesses face major obstacles \n     complying with their Federal tax obligations;\n       Whereas the complexity of the Federal tax code unfairly \n     penalizes small businesses;\n       Whereas such complexity requires small business owners to \n     spend significant amounts of time, money, and resources \n     complying with their tax obligations and less time operating \n     their business;\n       Whereas Congress has exacerbated these challenges for \n     America's small businesses by failing to update the tax code \n     in a manner that properly reflects current circumstances;\n       Whereas tax policy should also promote increased savings by \n     American citizens to be able to afford the costs of living \n     deeper into old age;\n       Whereas employee stock ownership plans help small \n     businesses offer economic incentives to employees and help \n     employees save more for their retirements via investments in \n     their employing companies;\n       Whereas tax policy should support small businesses in \n     providing benefit packages to their employees to be \n     competitive with larger employers for the best talent;\n       Whereas the successful research and development tax credit \n     has been used to incentivize private firms to invest in \n     research and development, and private investment leads to \n     spillover effects that can have a broad public good through \n     the creation of new products, the development of new \n     processes, and the launching of new industries;\n       Whereas while the research and development tax credit is \n     essential for our innovators, it is not accessible to many \n     small businesses and startups--per the Government \n     Accountability Office, over half of the credit goes to firms \n     with $1,000,000,000 or more in receipts;\n       Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service, \n     numerous commercially successful innovations originated in \n     small, fledgling firms that could not access the research and \n     development credit;\n       Whereas, if Congress made the research and development tax \n     credit more available to small businesses and startups, \n     thousands of innovative small firms could claim the credit, \n     boosting their capacity to invest in innovation and job \n     creation; and\n       Whereas prudent changes to the structure of the Federal tax \n     code would ease the burden of tax compliance, allowing small \n     businesses to put more money back into their business, \n     community, and the economy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Committee on Small \n     Business and Entrepreneurship that the Senate should enact \n     the following:\n\n                   TITLE I--SMALL BUSINESS TAX REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) on January 1, 1998--nearly 25 years after the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 was enacted and the \n     employee stock ownership plan (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as an ``ESOP'') was created--employees were first \n     permitted to be owners of subchapter S corporations pursuant \n     to the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-188);\n       (2) with the passage of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \n     (Public Law 105-34), Congress designed incentives to \n     encourage businesses to become ESOP-owned S corporations;\n       (3) since that time, several thousand companies have become \n     ESOP-owned S corporations, creating an ownership interest for \n     several million Americans in companies in every State in the \n     country, in industries ranging from heavy manufacturing to \n     technology development to services;\n       (4) while estimates show that 40 percent of working \n     Americans have no formal retirement account at all, every \n     United States worker who is an employee-owner of an S \n     corporation company through an ESOP has a valuable qualified \n     retirement savings account;\n       (5) recent studies have shown that employees of ESOP-owned \n     S corporations enjoy greater job stability than employees of \n     comparable companies;\n       (6) studies also show that employee-owners of S corporation \n     ESOP companies have amassed meaningful retirement savings \n     through their S ESOP accounts that will give them the means \n     to retire with dignity;\n       (7) under the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) \n     and the regulations promulgated by the Administrator of the \n     Small Business Administration, a small business concern that \n     was eligible under the Small Business Act for the numerous \n     preferences of the Act is denied treatment as a small \n     business concern after an ESOP acquires more than 49 percent \n     of the business, even if the number of employees, the revenue \n     of the small business concern, and the racial, gender, or \n     other criteria used under the Act to determine whether the \n     small business concern is eligible for benefits under the Act \n     remain the same, solely because of the acquisition by the \n     ESOP; and\n       (8) it is the goal of Congress to both preserve and foster \n     employee ownership of S corporations through ESOPs.\n\n     SEC. 403. DEFERRAL OF TAX FOR CERTAIN SALES OF EMPLOYER STOCK \n                   TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN SPONSORED BY S \n                   CORPORATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 1042(c)(1) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking \n     ``domestic C corporation'' and inserting ``domestic \n     corporation''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to sales after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 404. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE.\n\n       (a) Establishment Required.--Before the end of the 90-day \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Treasury shall establish the S Corporation \n     Employee Ownership Assistance Office to foster increased \n     employee ownership of S corporations.\n       (b) Duties of the Office.--The S Corporation Employee \n     Ownership Assistance Office shall provide--\n       (1) education and outreach to inform companies and \n     individuals about the possibilities and benefits of employee \n     ownership of S corporations; and\n       (2) technical assistance to assist S corporations in \n     sponsoring employee stock ownership plans.\n\n     SEC. 405. SMALL BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et \n     seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 47 as section 48; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 46 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 47.
