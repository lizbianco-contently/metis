Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate's top Democrat on \ntrade announced his support for the bipartisan trade legislation we \nwill vote on today.\n  It adds to the renewed momentum we are seeing for America's workers. \nIt is showing that Democrats can join Republicans to knock down unfair \ninternational barriers that discriminate against America's middle \nclass--barriers that for too long have prevented American workers from \nselling more of what they make and American farmers from selling more \nof what they grow. It is demonstrating that both parties can work \ntogether to strengthen America's national security at home and \nAmerica's leadership abroad, instead of simply ceding the future and \none of the world's fastest growing regions to Chinese aggression.\n  It is proving that our friends can rally with us and support 1.4 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\nadditional jobs in our country--including over 18,000 in Kentucky \nalone--as one study estimates new trade agreements with Europe and the \nPacific could well support. These are the reasons a bill is gaining \nsteam that would help advance all of these objectives--a bill that \nwould enhance Congress's role in the trade process while ensuring \nPresidents of either party have the tools to secure strong and \nenforceable trade agreements.\n  That is the bipartisan trade bill before us today. It passed the \nFinance Committee with strong bipartisan support in April. It passed \nthe full Senate with strong bipartisan support in May. It just passed \nthe House with backing from across the political spectrum as well, \ngaining the support of everyone from Chairman Ryan and Representative \nHensarling on one side to Representative Kind on the other.\n  Now it is time for the next step.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to vote for cloture on this bipartisan \ntrade bill today. That will open the way for final passage of TPA \ntomorrow. It will open the way for final passage of TAA and the AGOA \nand preferences measure the following day, too.\n  Earlier this morning, Speaker Boehner reaffirmed his commitment to \ntaking up TAA once it passes the Senate. He stated his desire to see \nboth TAA and TPA on the President's desk by the end of this week, and \nhe underlined the House's readiness to go to conference on the Customs \nbill. Speaker Boehner is clearly committed to building trust across the \naisle on this issue, and I am as well. That is why I just moved to go \nto conference on the Customs bill.\n  So this is where we are. Let's vote today. Let's vote today to move \nahead on TPA, an important accomplishment for the country. Then we can \nvote to move ahead on TAA, AGOA, and preferences, and then we can vote \nto move ahead on Customs.\n  If we all keep working together and trusting each other, then by the \nend of the week the President will have TPA, TAA, and AGOA and \npreferences on his desk, with Customs in the process of heading his way \nas well.\n  Today is a very big vote. It is an important moment for the country. \nIt sets in motion the completion of a project we set out on literally \nmonths ago, completing work on all four of the bills reported by the \nFinance Committee. That is what my friends on the other side have said \nthey wanted, and that is what can be achieved by continuing to work \ntogether.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Racism In America\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, our Nation's heart remains broken over the \nsenseless tragedy last week in Charleston, SC. A young man full of hate \ntook the lives of nine worshippers after they welcomed him into their \nBible study.\n  Once again, someone motivated by ignorance and hatred got his hands \non a gun and inflicted pain on innocent Americans. Once again, we must \nwitness the people of a community as they struggle to reconnect and put \nthe pieces of their lives back together. Once again, we are looking at \nour newspapers, watching our TV screens, and talking at our dinner \ntables about why--why did this happen?\n  As the painful details emerge, we cannot turn away from the hard \ntruth this tragedy lays bare: Racism still exists in our society.\n  We have to accept that reality. If we ever hope to change it, we have \nto accept that reality. I watched this weekend as pundits and the \nNation's thought leaders attempted to address this issue by \nsidestepping the truth. This violent attack was racially motivated, \nplain and simple. It was intended to terrorize the African-American \ncommunity both in Charleston and around this Nation.\n  Fifty years after Dr. Martin Luther King led a March in Washington, \n50 years after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act, 50 years after the \nmarch for voting rights in Selma, 50 years after Congress passed the \nVoting Rights Act, we must still face the hard truth about race in \nAmerica. The truth is that we still have much to do. We must overcome. \nWe have no choice. One cannot ignore this underlying issue.\n  It deeply troubles our Nation that hatred and bigotry exist. The \nharsh reality of hatred and bigotry in this country, in addition to the \nconsistent lack of opportunities in communities of color, have left far \ntoo many men and women of color feel that their lives really don't \nmatter. It is easy to feel that your life doesn't matter when the odds \nare stacked against you every place you look, on every hand.\n  Here are some of the facts African Americans face on a daily basis. \nNearly half of all African-American families have lived in poor \nneighborhoods for at least two generations--50 percent compared to 7 \npercent of White families. An African-American man is far more likely \nto be stopped and searched by police, charged with crimes, and \nsentenced to longer prison terms than a White male--10 percent longer \nfor the same crimes in the Federal system. In the State system, the \nnumbers are even more skewed than that.\n  These facts alone illustrate that countless men and women face \nunprecedented challenges and are still judged by the color of their \nskin, not the content of their character.\n  We have a moral obligation to change these realities. We must do \neverything within our power to ensure that all Americans know that \ntheir lives matter. This means standing for what is right, calling out \nbigotry and hatred when it is seen and felt, and then taking action to \naddress the bigotry.\n  It is hard to fathom that even as the community of Charleston \ngrapples with the devastation of this hateful act, African-American men \nand women have to walk under a Confederate flag when they step on the \ngrounds of the South Carolina statehouse in Columbia, SC.\n  The Confederate flag is a symbol of the dark past from which our \ncountry has come. It does not and should not represent our values or \nthe way we treat our fellow Americans. It is a symbol of slavery. It is \na symbol of White supremacy. There is no other way to explain it. It \noften flew high as vile organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan torched \nAfrican-American churches.\n  This symbol of the past has no place atop buildings that govern \nAmericans. It is just not who we are, and certainly it shouldn't be who \nwe want to be. The flag should be removed and now.\n  Yesterday, Governor Nikki Haley of South Carolina said that in the \nCapitol of South Carolina the flag should not be flown. She said: We \nwill do this in spite of what the State legislature feels.\n  We have tried this in the past, and the State legislatures have said: \nNo, we are keeping the flag flying.\n  So I applaud her. I appreciate her courageous act so that the \nConfederate flag has no future in the future of South Carolina. It \nbelongs in the past in every place in America, not just South Carolina. \nAnyone who desires to fly that flag on private property can do so, of \ncourse, but no State in our great Nation should allow this flag to soar \nabove its capitol. It shouldn't soar in public places.\n  We must always stand for what is right. We must stand for equality \nand justice and act to defend them. We must preserve and protect the \nrights of every American, not because it is the safe thing to do, not \nbecause it is popular or because it has political benefit. We must \nstand and defend equality and justice because that is the right thing \nto do.\n  We must take meaningful action to ensure the safety of our citizens.\n  Once again, our hearts are broken as another community struggles to \nrecover from a mass shooting. I am going to mention now just a few of \nthem: Fort Hood, 13 Americans killed, and this was on a military base; \nTucson, AZ, 6 Americans killed; Carson City, NV, 4 Americans killed; \nNewtown, CT, 27 Americans dead, and 22 of them were innocent little \nchildren; Aurora, CO, in a movie theater, 12 killed; the Navy Yard, \nmaybe a mile from here at the most, in the District of Columbia, 12 \nkilled; Charleston, SC--of course we know 9 were killed while in a \nBible study class. And these are not all of the violent acts; these are \nbut a handful. All of these violent events occurred within the past few \nyears.\n\n  Our country, the United States, is the only advanced country where \nthis type of mass violence occurs--the only country. Per capita, in \nAmerica we kill each other with guns at a rate 297 times higher than \nJapan, 49 times higher than France, 33 times higher than Israel, and we \noutdistance every other country by far too much.\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\n  We can do something about this sad, violent reality. Let's do \nsomething. We can expand, for example, background checks for people who \nwant to buy guns to prevent the mentally ill and criminals from buying \nguns. Is that asking too much--the mentally ill and criminals? More \nthan 80 percent of the American people support this. Why can't we in \nCongress support it? The American people support it. It has bipartisan \nsupport. I say it over and over again. The American community is \noverwhelmingly in support of not giving guns to people who are mentally \nill or felons. They shouldn't be able to buy guns. We should act to \nsave lives by expanding these background checks. Isn't that the least \nwe can do?\n  I know people will come and say: Well, he wasn't a felon. Maybe so. \nBut couldn't we do something? Couldn't we at least do this minimal \nthing to stop people who are sick in the head and people who are \ncriminals from purchasing guns? Couldn't we at least do that?\n  Einstein's definition of insanity is continuing the same thing over \nand over while expecting a different result, and that is what we are \ndoing. For the future of our country, we have to change. In the face of \nracism and bigotry, we must act. We can't do nothing. We must prevent \nfelons and the mentally ill from gunning down even more Americans in \nbroad daylight. If we do not, we will be here again. Our hearts will be \nbroken again. Again we will have to ask ourselves how we allowed \nanother senseless tragedy to take place while we stood by doing nothing \nto prevent other deaths.\n  Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate today?\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4525-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4525-S4529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, later today the Senate will once again have \nan opportunity to vote on whether to renew trade promotion authority. \nThe Senate has already considered this issue once and the House has \nvoted on it twice, each time demonstrating strong bipartisan support \nfor TPA. My hope is that we can get to a similar result with today's \nvote in the Senate.\n  We need to be clear about what is at stake. The United States is \ncurrently negotiating a number of trade agreements with some of our \nmost important trading partners in the world. If the Senate fails to \napprove this bill, neither Congress nor the American people will have a \nstrong voice during these negotiations. As a result, our Nation will \nnot be able to get the best trade agreements possible, if we are able \nto advance any trade agreements at all. Some people, including some of \nour colleagues, may be fine with that result. They do not think we need \ntrade agreements to promote a healthy economy. But nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  As we all know, most of the world's consumers live outside our \nborders--95 percent of them. In addition, the vast majority of economic \ngrowth in the world is likely to occur outside of the United States \nover the next decade. If our workers, farmers, ranchers, and service \nproviders are going to be able to compete in these growing markets, we \nmust have open access to these markets and fair trade rules to boot. \nWithout strong trade agreements, neither of these is possible.\n  When it comes to international trade, we cannot stand still. If we \ndon't lead and set the rules of the game, other nations will and our \neconomy will be left behind.\n  The United States continues to be a leader in agricultural exports \nthroughout the world. In fact, we still export more agricultural goods \nthan any other country. In addition, the United States continues to \nboast an enormous manufacturing base that supplies consumers in every \ncorner of the globe.\n  We also lead the world in technology, digital services, and \ninnovation. Indeed, not only do we lead the world in creation of \nintellectual property, America essentially created the modern digital \nlandscape.\n  The United States also continues to lead in trade in services, \nexporting more than $700 billion in services in 2014 alone. That is \nmore than twice as much as the United Kingdom, the world's second \nhighest services exporter.\n  I ask that the Parliamentarian let me know when my 10 minutes has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. HATCH. In other words, we know we can compete on the world stage \nwhen the rules are fair and the playing field is level. That is why I \nam such a strong proponent of this TPA legislation. This bill, which is \nthe product of a great deal of work and a lot of bipartisan \ncooperation, will have a powerful and positive impact on industries \nthroughout our economy, on consumers, and, of course, on American \nworkers as well.\n  In an America that embraces international trade, I believe even those \nindividuals who encounter a temporary setback can find new \nopportunities, can out-work, out-produce, out-think, and out-innovate \nour global competition so long as the groundwork has been laid to give \nthem those opportunities. That is why we need strong trade agreements, \nand that is why we need TPA.\n  As you can surely tell, I feel very passionately about free trade, \nand I know many of my colleagues are just as passionate in their \nopposition. But as Congress has considered this legislation, I think we \nhave had a full and fair debate on these issues. We have been \ntransparent on the substance of the bill and in the way things have \nmoved forward. Both sides have been able to make their case to the \nAmerican people.\n  It is at times such as these when working in Congress is the most \nrewarding. We have the opportunity to hear so many different accounts, \nsift through mountains of data and research, meet with hundreds of \ninterested parties representing thousands of our constituents, and work \nthrough hotly contested differences. Then, after all of that work, when \ncircumstances are right, we are able to come up with bipartisan \nlegislation that addresses the needs of our country, our constituents, \nand our economy. That is what we have been able to do with this TPA \ndebate, which is a debate that has been going on for many years now.\n  I still want to work with those who may not share all my views on all \nthese issues. One way we have agreed to do that is to help ensure that \ntrade adjustment assistance, or TAA, will be extended. As you know, TAA \nhas been included in the trade preferences bill the Senate will \nhopefully vote on later this week after we pass TPA.\n  I have said many times that I am not a fan of TAA. Personally, I \nthink the program is redundant and ineffective. However, after 38 years \nhere in the Senate, believe me, I am well aware that everything is not \nabout me. I understand TAA is a priority for a number of my colleagues \nand that it continues to be the price of admission for many who want to \nsupport TPA. The Senate majority leader recognizes this as well, which \nis why he has committed to ensuring that TAA gets a fair vote here in \nthe Senate and a fair opportunity to pass.\n  Throughout this process, we have done all we can, within reason, to \naccommodate the concerns of Senators. I am very appreciative of all the \nsupport we have received from Members on both sides of the aisle. We \ncouldn't have gotten this far without that support.\n  Now it is time to finish the work--to pass this bill and get it to \nthe President's desk. We need this bill to ensure that our \nconstituents' voices are heard in the trade negotiating process. We \nneed this bill to give our trade negotiators the tools they need to get \na good deal. And we need this bill to expand access to foreign markets \nso that we can grow our economy and create new and high-paying jobs \nhere at home. That is what this bill is all about and why we have been \nworking on this process for so long. We are very close to the finish \nline, and we need just one more burst of energy and a few more steps to \nget us there.\n  I urge all my colleagues who support free trade, open markets, and \nthe advancement of American values and interests abroad to join me once \nagain in supporting TPA and working with me\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\nand with my colleague Senator Wyden to get all the pending trade bills \npassed in the Senate and signed into law.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, over the last several weeks on the floor of \nboth this body and the House, we have heard Members, colleagues, say \nthey are tired of the old 1990s North American Free Trade Agreement \nplaybook on trade. They are concerned that the package which is once \nagain before the Senate is more of the same.\n  Here is my message on why this legislation needs to move forward. If \nyou believe those policies of the 1990s failed to protect American \nworkers and strengthen our economy, this is our chance to set a new \ncourse. This is our chance to put in place higher standards in global \ntrade on matters such as labor rights and environmental protection, to \nshine some real sunlight on trade agreements and ensure that our \ncountry writes the rules of the road.\n  The fact is, in 2015, globalization is a reality. The choice is \nwhether to sit back and allow globalization to push and pull on our \neconomy until in ways dictated by countries in China. So our choice is \neither to move now and get into the center of the ring and fight for a \nstronger economic future, protect our workers and promote our values, \nor remain tethered to many of those old policies of the 1990s.\n  I say to the Senate today: If you believe, like me, that it is time \nonce and for all to close the books on the North American free-trade \nera in trade, this legislation deserves your support.\n  In my hometown paper recently, there was an opinion article, and it \nstated that this trade bill lays out ``a hard-and-fast checklist for \nthe TPP, holding the Obama administration accountable for meeting its \ngoals and conditions.'' The article goes on to say that this \nlegislation ``will reorient priorities and improve the process for the \nTPP and other trade agreements in the future.'' I completely agree with \nthat view, but the Senate doesn't have to take my word for it. Those \nare the words of Tim Nesbitt, the past president of the Oregon AFL-CIO, \nwho has disagreed with me on trade often over the years. Yet now he \nstates that this legislation we will vote on today provides a fresh \nopportunity for trade done right.\n  When it comes to core American values--labor rights, environmental \nprotection, and human rights--this legislation raises the bar and \ndemands more from our trade negotiators than ever before.\n  We have talked a lot about a race to the bottom. My view is that if \nour country doesn't fight to protect worker rights and the environment \nwith tough, enforceable trade agreements, those priorities are going to \nwither away. China is certainly not going to take up the banner for \nAmerican values in trade. So if you believe America should stop a race \nto the bottom on labor rights, environmental safeguards, and human \nrights, this legislation is our chance to lift up global standards.\n  I want to talk for a moment about the economic potential of this \nlegislation. What we all understand we need to do is make things here, \ngrow things here, add value to them here, and then ship them somewhere. \nMy State knows how to make this happen, and so do many others. About \none out of five jobs in Oregon depends on international trade. Almost \n90 percent of them are small and medium sized. And what we know is that \nin many instances those jobs pay better.\n  The fact is, if our farmers want to sell their products in Japan--and \nthis is true of agriculture all over America. A lot of our farmers face \naverage tariffs of 40 percent. That is right. If you want to export \nsome jam to Vietnam, it will be marked up by 90 percent. If you want to \nsell a bottle of wine--and we have wine growers with prosperous \nbusinesses all over the country--they have to fork over 50 percent of \nthe value to the government. So if we believe other countries should \nopen their markets to American exports, like the U.S. is open to \ntheirs, this is our chance to break down the tariffs and other \nbarriers.\n  I want to touch for a moment again on how different this is than the \n1990s. In the 1990s, nobody could have imagined the right tools to \nprotect the modern Internet. Twenty-five years ago, it was impossible \nto make a living by setting up a business online. A cell phone was as \nbig as a brick. In fact, the NAFTA negotiations began a year before the \nfirst Web site was set up. Today, Internet commerce is at the heart of \nour economy. If we want to cement America's leadership in the digital \neconomy, this is our chance to vote for trade policies that will \nprotect a free and open Internet.\n  Now, I wish to mention again, apropos of how different this is, that \nI have felt for some time that critics of past trade policy have been \nspot on with respect to a lot of this secrecy which is just gratuitous. \nIf we believe deeply in trade, as Chairman Hatch and I do, and want \nmore of it, why should we have all this unnecessary secrecy which just \nmakes people cynical about trade?\n  So we have brought sunshine to this trade debate in a way that is \nunprecedented. For the first time, before the President can sign a \ndeal, the full text has to be released to the public for 60 days. \nBefore we can have votes in the other body and in the Senate, there \nwill be no fewer than 4 months where people can open a proposed trade \ndeal and read it for themselves.\n  So picture that: For 4 months, the American people will have in their \nhands--starting with the TPP--what the trade agreement is all about. \nThat is simply unprecedented.\n  I wish to close the question of how we are going to proceed from \nhere. This has obviously been a complicated piece of legislation. I \nappreciate the Senate and House leaders have committed to moving trade \nadjustment assistance alongside trade promotion authority as well as a \nproposal that originated with Senator Brown to strengthen our \ncritically important trade enforcement laws. While the goal of enacting \ntrade policies is a tool to give all Americans a chance to get ahead, \ntrade adjustment assistance is an absolute must-pass bill, and I am \nconfident it is going to get through Congress to the President's desk. \nThat bill includes the vitally important program also that creates new \nopportunities for impoverished nations in Africa.\n  The Customs enforcement bill is also moving forward on a bipartisan \nbasis, and there is important work there to be done. The Senate must \nresolve differences in the enforcement bill with the other body. I wish \nto make it clear this morning that I expect that conference to respect \nDemocratic priorities. My Democratic colleagues and I will be laying \ndown markers on several of our top priorities. I discussed those \npriorities with Chairman Ryan last night. Those priorities include \nprovisions in the Senate bill championed by Senator Shaheen to help our \nsmall businesses, provisions authored by Senator Bennet to address \nenforcement environmental laws, and Senator Cantwell's important trade \nenforcement trust fund.\n  In my view, the Congress has an opportunity in this legislation to \nshow it can work in a bipartisan way to take on one of the premier \neconomic challenges of our time. Our job is to get past the policies of \nthe 1990s and move toward getting trade done right.\n  Colleagues, let's pry open foreign markets and send more of our \nexports abroad. Let's fight for the American brand and the Oregon brand \nagainst the trade chiefs and the bad actors who are blocking our way, \nand let's raise the bar for American values and open our trade policies \nto sunlight.\n  I urge all in the Senate to vote yes on cloture today and to support \nthis package as it advances this week. In effect, we get three \nimportant bills done this week and set in motion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the motion to invoke \ncloture on TPA, the so-called fast-track legislation. I am still \nincredulous, as I have watched this trade nondebate, if you will, at \nthe speed at which, time after time, the majority leader has tried to \nshut down debate. It has happened again and again, and that is \ncompounded by the secrecy of this whole process.\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\n  I can't count the number of times in my State of Ohio and in meetings \nin Washington, with people from all over the country, that people have \nsaid we have little or no access to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. TPA, \nin the past--fast-track--has actually been sort of a rule book for how \nwe should negotiate trade agreements and, at the same time, has been a \ndirection on how to negotiate these trade agreements and a rule book on \nhow it is presented on the Senate floor. Yet none of the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership negotiations by Ambassador Froman have been informed at all \nby a TPA because we haven't had a TPA yet. We haven't even had an \ninstruction booklet in the past. At the same time, we have gotten the \nworst of both worlds because we are voting on TPA, and we really \nhaven't been able to see what is in TPP. I know supporters of TPP will \nsay we are going to have 60 days now, but Members are casting their \nvotes now--where 60 votes are required and they have maximum leverage--\nto put no final point on it, just giving up the leverage they have as \nwe are still kept in the dark on what is happening.\n  Let me give one example before I get to where I think we are making a \nmistake by moving so quickly today, in essence, fast-tracking fast-\ntrack.\n  One example, my office and I personally have repeatedly spoken to the \nPresident of the United States and the U.S. Trade Representative, \nAmbassador Froman, repeatedly asking them to fix some of the language \non tobacco. Because one of the things that apparently--we really don't \nknow for sure--the Trans-Pacific Partnership does is it gives even more \npower to American tobacco companies--more power to American tobacco \ncompanies to have influence over laws in particularly small countries \nwhich don't have the wherewithal and can't afford the huge legal bills \na large tobacco company can afford to write public health law.\n  If a small country wants to write a law to protect their children \nfrom marketing of tobacco products--which is what we have done in this \ncountry--the U.S. tobacco company or British tobacco company can--let's \nkeep it here. The U.S. tobacco company can threaten a lawsuit against \nthose countries, and those countries are probably going to back off \nbecause they probably can't afford to go to court with the big American \ntobacco company. Even something as clearly violative of the public \ninterest and of public health as what damage Big Tobacco inflicts on \nchildren has not, to our knowledge, been addressed. Again, so much of \nthis is secretive that we don't even know that.\n  That is why there is anger in this country and why there is--so many \npeople in this country tell me, so many in my State: Why are you moving \nso fast? Why is this coming up right now? Why don't we know more about \nthis whole process?\n  Yet again, the majority leader is shutting down debate. He will be \njoined, I assume, by a small number, a distinct, small number of \nminority Democrats, getting up over the 60-vote margin so they can shut \ndown debate, so they can move the TPA--the fast-track--forward, so they \ncan get the Trans-Pacific Partnership down the road.\n  No matter which side of the TPP debate, no matter which side of the \ntrade promotion authority, TPA, fast-track--no matter which side you \nare on, it is clear that our trade policy creates winners and losers. \nIt is clear. Even the most vigorous cheerleaders for free trade--the \nWall Street Journal editorial board, for instance--even the strongest \nfree-traders, even though people who reflectively support these free-\ntrade agreements acknowledge there are winners and losers.\n  They will argue that these trade agreements create more jobs than \nthey lose. I don't agree with that. They argue that. Put that aside. \nBut they also acknowledge that people lose jobs because of decisions we \nmake.\n  We are about to pass fast-track here. We are about to pass trade \npromotion authority, leading probably to the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nhaving a reasonable chance of passage. We are about to do that. We are \nmaking that decision here. Members of Congress, people who are well \npaid, with government-financed retirements and health care--we are \nabout to make those decisions, and we know--we are knowingly making \nthat decision, acknowledging that some people will lose their jobs \nbecause of a decision we make, but we are not going to take care of \nthose workers. We are going to pass today the TPA, the trade promotion \nauthority, fast-track. We are going to pass that and ignore those \nworkers. How shameful is that that we know the decisions we are making \nin this body--we are making the decisions, the President of the United \nStates makes this decision, the House of Representatives has made this \ndecision, the Senate is about to make this decision, we are making this \ndecision, knowing people will lose their jobs because of our actions. \nYet we are unwilling to provide for those workers who lose their jobs.\n  Let me give a little history, a special message to Congress. In \nJanuary of 1962, President Kennedy said:\n\n       When considerations of national policy make it desirable to \n     avoid higher tariffs, those injured by that competition \n     should not be required to bear the full brunt of the impact. \n     Rather, the burden of economic adjustment should be borne in \n     part by the Federal Government.\n\n  That is President Kennedy at the advent, at the beginning, at the \ncreation of the trade adjustment assistance, the support for workers \nwho lose their jobs because of--again, I repeat--decisions we make in \nthis body, in the House of Representatives, in the White House. We make \ndecisions on trade. We know people will lose their jobs. We should help \nthem. It should be our moral responsibility to help them.\n  Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana said: ``No small group of firms and \nworkers should be made to bear the full burden of the costs of a \nprogram whose great benefits enrich the Nation as a whole.''\n  This is as true today as it was 53 years ago. It is not a Democratic \nidea. It is not a Republican idea. Everyone from the Cato Institute--a \nlibertarian-oriented think tank in Washington, a bunch of well-paid \nscholars who make pronouncements from on high about various kinds of \npublic policy issues--to the Wall Street Journal--a similar body but \none with greater ability to disseminate information--even those two \nvenerable institutions admit the trade agreements do not create winners \neverywhere.\n  A Cato Institute trade briefing says, ``All of those job losses are a \npainful but necessary part of the larger process of innovation and \nproductivity increases.''\n  I am always a bit amused when people who--again, well-educated, good \npay, dress like this, good benefits, good retirement, good health \ncare--make pronunciations saying: Well, job losses are painful--not to \nus, of course. The same as editorial writers who make these decisions, \nthese pronouncements on trade, they are not losing their jobs. People \nin my State are losing jobs on these fair trade agreements. We are \ngoing to inflict this pain. As the Cato Institute and the Wall Street \nJournal say, by the decisions we make, we are going to inflict pain on \nthese workers. People are going to lose jobs in my town of Mansfield, \nOH. People are going to lose jobs where I grew up. People are going to \nlose jobs in Cleveland where I live now. People are going to lose jobs \nin Zanesville and Newark because of decisions we make today on fast-\ntrack, because of decisions we will make next year on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. People are going to lose their jobs, but we are going to \nvote today to cut off debate, and we are going to forget, at least \ntemporarily, about helping those workers who lose jobs because of \ndecisions we make. How immoral is that? How shameful is that? What a \nbetrayal we are inflicting on those workers if we make this decision \ntoday.\n  Former Wall Street Journal economics editor David Wessel writes, \n``Even [free trade's] most fervent admirers concede trade creates \nwinners and losers.''\n  I will debate until the cows come home the net benefits of these \ntrade agreements. I think they are net job loss. But even if you \nbelieve these trade agreements are net job-gainers--I don't think there \nis a lot of evidence of that--but even if you believe that, we know \npeople lose their jobs because of decisions we make. That is why \nRepublicans in the past have supported trade adjustment assistance in \nprinciple and in policy going back decades.\n  Fifteen years ago, President George W. Bush said, ``I recognize that \nsome\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\nAmerican workers may face adjustment challenges''--that means they get \nthrown out of work. It is a nice way a President might talk about \npeople he has left behind. Put that aside. ``I recognize that some \nAmerican workers may face adjustment challenges as a result of trade.''\n  At least to President Bush's credit--I wish his words would be \nfollowed today on this floor by the majority leader, by Republican \nLeader McConnell as he cuts off debate and leaves behind trade \nadjustment assistance. President Bush said, ``I support helping these \nworkers by reauthorizing and improving trade adjustment assistance \nprograms that will give workers impacted by trade new skills, help them \nfind new jobs quickly, and provide them with financial assistance.''\n  I can give lots of stories about people I know in Youngstown, Lima, \nDayton, Hamilton, and people in Portsmouth who lost their jobs because \nof trade, but at least they have gotten a helping hand from a \ngovernment that used to have their backs and believe in them--at least \nuntil today--from a government that actually will extend that hand and \nhelp them retrain. Maybe they can become a nurse, maybe they can work \nin information technology, maybe they can become a radiology \ntechnologist at the local hospital.\n  Earlier this year, my colleague John Cornyn--Republican from Texas, \nthe senior Senator and assistant Republican leader--told reporters that \n``there is no doubt that the benefits of more trade do not fall \nuniformly. There are some segments of the economy that don't prosper as \nwell.''\n  We know that. We have seen that acknowledgement across the board. Yet \ntoday Leader McConnell is going to cut off debate, even though \ndecisions we have made have cost people their jobs. That is why we have \na moral obligation. It is not a new idea. It is not a partisan idea. It \nis universally accepted. Trade deals don't benefit everybody. That is \nwhy this moral obligation to include trade adjustment assistance in any \npackage with TPA is so important.\n  We can't send a framework for a new trade deal to the President's \ndesk without assistance for the workers who will be left behind, but \nthat is not what we are doing today. Today, it is full-speed ahead, cut \noff debate, move ahead on fast-track, move ahead on trade promotion \nauthority.\n  I assume a number of my Democratic colleagues are going along with \nit. I hope the wrath of people in this country--if the House and Senate \nrefuse to do what some of their leaders say they will, that they will \npass trade adjustment assistance, that they will take care of those \nworkers--if they don't live up to that promise--and many times in the \npast they haven't lived up to similar promises--a lot of my colleagues \nare going to go home and face people who say: Wait. You made a \ndecision. I got thrown out of a job because of a decision you made, \nbecause of a decision you made as a House Member, because of a decision \nyou made as a Senator, because of a decision you made, Mr. President. I \nwas thrown out of work, and you passed on June 23--or whatever today \nis--fast-track without taking care of me, even though it was your \ndecision that I lose my job.\n  What kind of government--what kind of principles do we live under \nhere?\n  In March, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote in \nNational Review Online:\n\n       To be sure, any trade deal, while a net plus overall, \n     produces winners and losers. But the TPP will be accompanied \n     by so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance, training and \n     subsidies to help those negatively affected.\n\n  Again, Krauthammer, as he is about 95 percent of the time, is wrong. \nHe is wrong that it is going be accompanied by the trade adjustment \nassistance. The assumption all along, even among TPP proponents, has \nbeen that TPA would be passed in tandem with aid for workers. But you \nknow, even though that is what we did first here, Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives are unwilling to vote for them together. They \nare just not going to vote. Speaker Boehner, for some reason, \nacquiesced to the President of the United States, pulled them apart, \nand had separate votes. Think about the message we will send. If we put \nanother huge trade deal--parenthetically, once-majority leader, \nRepublican leader Trent Lott said: You can't pass a trade agreement in \nan even-numbered year. Do you know why he said that? He said that \nbecause people don't like trade deals in this country. People know \nNAFTA sold them out. They know CAFTA sold them out. They know PNTR with \nChina sold them out. They know Korea sold them out. We heard these \npromises over and over.\n  With NAFTA, we were promised 200,000 jobs in 2 years. Thank you, \nPresident Bush 1, and thank you, President Clinton, for that. We lost \n680,000 net jobs. Central America Free Trade Agreement--thank you, \nPresident Bush 2, for that. Promises were made, big promises about job \nincreases, big promises about wages going up. It didn't happen. Wages \nstayed flat. Jobs were lost. Thank you, President Bush 2, for that.\n  Korea, South Korea Free Trade Agreement, negotiated in part by \nPresident Bush, pushed through the Senate by President Obama--thank \nyou, Mr. Presidents of both parties, for that. They told us 70,000 jobs \nwould be created out of the South Korea Free Trade Agreement. No, we \nhave lost 75,000 jobs.\n  Using the same formula that we have--we have seen this over and over. \nWe know what happens. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that \nbetween 2009 and 2012, two-thirds of displaced manufacturing workers \nwho did find new jobs ended up taking lower paying jobs. Most of those \nworkers saw wage losses of more than 20 percent.\n  You can debate whether the gains others experienced make these losses \nworth it. I don't think they do. I think if you have traveled darned \nnear anywhere--if Members of Congress spent a little more time with \npeople who can't contribute to them, with people who don't belong to a \nlocal rotary club, with people who might just work hard, play by the \nrules, not make a lot of money, barely make it, sometimes have their \nhouse foreclosed on, sometimes lose their job--if we would spend a \nlittle more time with people like that, I think we would see how these \ntrade agreements are working.\n  There is a debate to be had. I will cede it is debatable, whether \nthese trade agreements--whether the evidence is that they create jobs \nor lose jobs. I think it is pretty clear they lose jobs. But there is \nno debate. There is no debate on what actually happens here. Because of \ndecisions--I will repeat--before this vote coming up in about 60 \nseconds, because of decisions we make in this body--the President \nmakes, Senators make, Congress men and women make--because of decisions \nwe make in this body, people in our States, whether it is Arkansas or \nArizona, Oregon, Utah or my State of Ohio, people lose jobs because of \ndecisions we make. There is no question people lose jobs because of \ndecisions we make. Anything short of providing for those workers who \nlose their jobs today, not doing this on a promise--we are basically \ntrusting the majority leader who doesn't really like, I understand, the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program. We are relying on the word of \nSpeaker Boehner, who doesn't particularly like trade adjustment \nassistance. We know most of the Members of his party in the House of \nRepresentatives do not particularly like trade adjustment assistance. \nWe are going to rely on their promise.\n  We are voting today on the fly. We are saying to workers in this \ncountry: Yes, we have made decisions that may have cost you your job. \nWe are going to try to help you when you lose that job, but we are \nstill going to go ahead today and do that. That is why I asked my \ncolleagues to vote no on this motion today to invoke cloture on trade \npromotion authority.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH.

So the vote would have \nbeen 61 to 39.\n  More importantly, this is a day of celebration in the corporate \nsuites of this country, to be sure, because they have another \ncorporate-sponsored trade agreement that will mean more money in some \ninvestors' pockets. It will mean more plant closings in Ohio, Arizona, \nDelaware, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Maine, and all over this \ncountry.\n  Most importantly, what I didn't understand about the vote today is \nthat even though the Wall Street Journal, the CATO Institute, and \nothers acknowledge that, as to the decisions we make here on trade \nagreements--while they say it is a net increase in jobs--people lose \ntheir jobs because of the decisions we make. So we make decisions here \ntoday that throw people out of work. We know that. Across the political \nspectrum that is acknowledged. But we today don't do anything to help \nthose workers that lose their jobs. We make a decision to throw people \nin Mansfield, OH, and Cleveland, OH, out of work, but then we don't \ntake care of those workers that lost their jobs because of our \ndecisions. It is shameful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me just concur with the Senator from \nOhio. This trade agreement was supported by virtually every major \ncorporation in this country, the vast majority of whom have outsourced \nmillions of jobs to low-wage countries all over the world. This trade \nagreement is supported by Wall Street. This trade agreement is \nsupported by the pharmaceutical industry, which wants to charge people \nin poor countries higher prices for the medicine they desperately need.\n  This agreement was opposed by every union in this country, working \nfor the best interests of working families, and by almost every \nenvironmental group and many religious groups.\n  In my view, this trade agreement will continue the policies of NAFTA, \nCAFTA, and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China--agreements that \nhave cost us millions of decent-paying jobs.\n  We need a new trade policy in America--a policy that represents \nworking families and not just the big money interests.\n  I strongly disagree with the majority leader, who called this a great \nday for America. It is not a great day. It is a great day for the Big \nMoney interests, not a great day for working families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\n                            Order For Recess\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nrecess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference \nmeetings, as well as from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. today for an all-Senators \nbriefing, and that all time in recess count postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is no secret that Republicans on this \nside of the aisle don't agree with President Obama about everything. In \nfact, I would say that on balance most Republicans disagree with the \npolicy choices made by this President. But occasionally--occasionally--\neven the leader of the Democratic Party, the President of the United \nStates, gets things right.\n  Occasionally, the President of the United States gets his policy \nchoices right, and he did so with regard to trade promotion authority.\n  I would point out to our friends and to anybody listening that this \nactually is a 6-year trade promotion authority. This extends well \nbeyond the tenure of the current occupant of the White House, and it \nwill be available for the next President of the United States to \nnegotiate trade deals that are in the best interests of the United \nStates.\n  So I agree with the majority leader. This latest vote is just another \nexample of the Senate getting back to work and restored to regular \nworking order. This is a dramatic departure from the old Senate, \nbecause there has actually been a lot of time for consideration of \nimportant pieces of legislation--from the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct to the Justice for Victims of Human Trafficking Act to the budget.\n  By moving this trade promotion authority bill forward, we can ensure \nthat American workers and businesses can get the best deal in trade \nagreements with countries from Asia to South America to Europe.\n  I believe we have actually kept the campaign promises we made last \nyear that, if the American people entrusted the Republicans with the \nnew majority, we would work together with our allies where we could on \nthe other side of the aisle where we have common cause to deliver \nresults for the American people, to legislate in their best interest--\nnot just to obstruct for obstruction's sake or gain some temporary \ntactical or political advantage but to promote a functioning, \ndeliberative Senate. I see one of the leaders of this effort, the \nSenator from Delaware, who has done great work trying to find that \ncommon cause and producing a result, as exemplified by the TPA. I am \ngoing to yield for him in just a moment.\n  But let me just talk briefly about my response to the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Ohio, who said there is nothing good to be \nhad out of this trade promotion authority or any potential trade deals \nthat we might negotiate.\n  My home State of Texas relies heavily on international trade. We are \nthe number one trading State in the Nation, which is just one reason \nwhy our economy grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Our economy in \nTexas grew at the rate of 5.2 percent in 2014. Do you know the rate at \nwhich the U.S. economy grew? The U.S. economy grew at just 2.2 percent. \nSo why wouldn't we want to do anything and everything we can to \nstimulate the growth of the economy to benefit people looking for work \nand people looking for higher wages? This important trade promotion \nauthority is the first step to doing that.\n  I will conclude because the distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nhere and others who want to speak.\n  Trade is an engine of growth. It keeps our economy growing. These \nupcoming trade agreements, whether it is the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nor the transatlantic investment treaty, serve as a great opportunity to \nturbo-charge that growth.\n  Our economy actually contracted last quarter by 0.7 percent. As long \nas our economy is shrinking and not growing, we are not going to be \nable to create the jobs to put America back to work. We are not going \nto be able to create the sorts of wages that we want for all working \nAmericans. This legislation represents an important step in that \ndirection. I am glad that in the exercise of a little mutual trust and \ncomity, we have reached this important point.\n  We are not through yet because there are other parts of this trade \npackage that we are going to need to process this week. But the promise \nand commitment we made on this side of the aisle was that if our \ncolleagues across the aisle trust us to move through the trade \npromotion authority bill, we will continue to work with them and keep \nour commitments to them, and, hopefully, more than just the trust that \nproduces these pieces of legislation will result from this increased \nconfidence and trust in one another.\n  We know we are going to find measures we will disagree on, and we \nwill fight like cats and dogs when we need to. But when we actually \nagree on the policy and can find it within ourselves to work together, \nthe American people are the beneficiaries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, while the Senator from Texas is still on \nthe floor, let me say, if I could--he mentioned the word ``trust'' a \nnumber of times. It is an important word in Congress. One of my \nfavorite sayings is ``Integrity--if you have it, nothing else matters. \nIntegrity--if you don't have it, nothing else matters.'' The same is \ntrue for trust.\n  In order to get things done here--there is a lot we need to get done. \nEverybody realizes that.\n  My takeaway from the election last November was threefold: No. 1, \npeople want us to work together; No. 2, they want us to get stuff done; \nand No. 3, they want us to get things done that will actually \nstrengthen the economic recovery.\n  One of the ways to strengthen the economic recovery, frankly, is to \nmake sure that those markets overseas will actually allow us to sell \ninto them, whether it is products or goods or services, that we have \naccess to those markets.\n  The other thing is that my colleague from Texas is as big believer, \nas am I, in the Golden Rule, and that is to treat people the way we \nwant to be treated. And I think most of the people in this country \nsupport what we are doing. Most of the Democrats in our country support \nwhat their President has proposed, and the Republicans as well.\n  But what we need to do while we move forward with trade promotion \nauthority is we need to keep in mind that not everybody will be helped \nby this and that there are some people who will to be disadvantaged, \nand we have an obligation to them to treat them how we would want to be \ntreated if we were in their shoes.\n  There is a sister piece of legislature to go along with trade \npromotion authority, and I would ask the Republican whip from Texas to \ngive us some assurance or reassurance so we build trust around this \nissue. When we are contacted by folks from around the country today, \ntomorrow, or the next day, what are we going to do to provide \nassistance to those people who may be disadvantaged because of trade \npromotion authority and the trade deal that is going to be negotiated? \nCan you give us some assurance there? Is this like the end of the road \nor are there some more pieces to follow this week?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would respond to the question by our \ncolleague from Delaware that assurances have been given that we \nunderstand that the trade promotion authority and the trade adjustment \nassistance travel together.\n  I think we have seen examples where the benefits of trade are not \nuniformly felt across the country. There are some people who will be \ndisplaced. But the importance of trade adjustment assistance--I wish we \ncould negotiate something a little more frugal that would actually get \nthe job done. But a negotiation took place between Chairman Ryan in the \nHouse and the ranking member, Senator Wyden, in the Senate on this \nimportant piece of the package.\n  We all recognize that these travel in pairs and that trade adjustment \nassistance is part of the price you pay for getting trade promotion \nauthority done. But most importantly to my colleague's point from \nDelaware, for those people who are displaced, this guarantees that they \nwill have access to the sort of job training and skills enhancement \nthat they will need in order to get even better jobs in this economy\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\nthat, on net, will benefit the entire country. That is the intent on \nthis side of the aisle and I think the intent of trade adjustment \nauthority and making sure that we finish our work--not here today but \nthrough the rest of the week--on this important package of pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Republican whip for those \nwords and for his work on this. I would just close with this thought: \nWhenever I talk to people who have been married a long time--like 50, \n60, 70 years--I always ask them, what is the secret to being married a \nlong time? I get some very funny answers, and I get some very poignant \nones as well. The best answer I have ever heard to that question, what \nis the secret to being married 50, 60, or 70 years, is the two c's--not \n``Cornyn'' and ``Carper'' but ``communicate'' and ``compromise.'' I \nwould add maybe a third to that, and that is ``collaborate.''\n  We need to demonstrate the ability to communicate and to compromise \nand to collaborate. And those aren't always the secret to a vibrant \nmarriage, but they are the secret to a vibrant democracy.\n  This is a confidence-building measure. I think we have taken an \nimportant step here, working with Democrats and Republicans and working \nwith a Democratic President, and the next step is one we have just \ntalked about, trade adjustment assistance. We need to do that. If we \ncan actually work through these issues this week and produce a \nbipartisan product that the President is going to sign, we will \nactually build some trust. And when we turn to the issue of \ntransportation and having a robust, vibrant transportation system and \nhow to fund that, how to pay for that, what to do, this will be \nhelpful.\n  So my applause to Senator Ron Wyden, Senator Murray on our side, \nSenator Hatch, the leader on the Republican side, and to Senator Cornyn \nfor good work--not done but a very good start today.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my \ncolleagues, and I think they make compelling arguments. I just have a \nhard time. I really have a hard time, with this. I have not had one \nWest Virginian--average, working West Virginian--who had a good job at \none time and lost a job who thinks this type of approach to trade is \ngood. Not one. And I am hearing them talking about how much trade we do \nfrom our States. I would like to know what type of trade. Manufactured \nproducts? I don't see many manufactured products leaving this country. \nI see an awful lot of resources, such as oil that has been refined into \ndiesel fuel or gasoline. It probably comes from Texas, I would say. I \nthink that is probably a big part of their trading, and those types of \nthings. But how many people actually benefit from that who really have \na good manufacturing job? That is all I have asked.\n  We talked about TAA. We are all hung up on TAA. Do you know why we \nare hung up? Because we all understand we are going to lose more jobs. \nWe have already lost 6 million jobs since NAFTA. We have all lost 6 \nmillion jobs across this country. I lost 31,000 manufacturing jobs.\n  I understand NAFTA hasn't been enforced, and they had some rules in \nthere. And then you take this piece of legislation, TPA--there was more \nsecurity around this piece of legislation than there was around the \nIran nuclear deal we were talking about. My staff could go there, they \ncould take notes, we were briefed, and we were able to ask questions. \nWe couldn't even take a note or take a note out.\n  They are telling me: Well, you know, we all depend on trade and the \nmarket shrinking. We are at $18 trillion GDP. Think about this. We in \nthe United States of America have the greatest economy the world has \never seen--$18 trillion. Do you know that of all these 11 countries we \nare talking about, the closest one to us is Japan--$4.5 trillion. It \nfalls off the Richter scale. But yet we have to be very secretive \nbecause somebody might leave us.\n  Well, let me tell you, I have been a businessperson all of my life. \nIf I wanted to get into a market, I will assure you, I would be able to \nevaluate my competition, the people with whom I want to do business. If \nthat was the big person on the block, I had to make more adjustments \nthan they had to make. But yet we are so concerned about the secrecy of \nthis deal that none of us are able to see it, work it, define it, \ndissect it, and improve upon it. Now we are just voting basically carte \nblanche and saying: OK, sure, you are going to get a 60-day review. You \ncan't do a thing about it if you don't like it.\n  I didn't think we were elected to do that. I really didn't.\n  When you start looking at everything this stands for and you look at \nbasically--and my father--my grandfather had a grocery store and my dad \nhad a little furniture store, so I was raised in retail. One thing my \ndad always encouraged was competition. He enjoyed having it. He said: \nJoe, listen, good competition brings out more buyers. More buyers gives \nus more of a chance to sell our goods.\n  What he never did like and what he thought was unfair was when you \nhad unfair competition--didn't pay their taxes, didn't live by the \nrules or play by the rules. And if we didn't enforce those, it gave \nthem an unfair competitive advantage.\n  If you believe our past performance in our trade deals makes us an \nexpert at enforcing and making sure people play by the rules so that \nAmerica is treated right, then you probably would have voted for this. \nI don't. I can only judge off of our past performance, where we are \ntoday.\n  When you go shopping for whatever types of goods--household goods, \nclothing goods, furniture--the greatest furniture markets in the world \nwere in the United States. We make very little furniture in this \ncountry today. They still want our wood products, so you know what, \nyes, we ship logs out of West Virginia around the world so people can \nmake the furniture that they want to send back to America. So I guess \nthey say: Oh, yes, that is good trade. The only reason they are buying \nour logs is because they don't have the quality logs we have. They \ndon't have the quality hardwood forests.\n  The best coal in the world, the best metallurgical coal--coking--that \nmakes the steel, the best in the world comes out of West Virginia. Sure \nthey are going to buy it because they don't have it. They are going to \nmake their products and send them back to us and come into these \nmarkets subsidized.\n  I would just say sooner or later we ought to do something for \nAmerica. You have to rebuild this country, and you don't build the \nwealth of a country based on basically moving paper back and forth. \nMoving paper back and forth--there are some people, with the wealth \nthey accrue from this, I am sure they are very satisfied and happy with \nthat. And we see the income inequality over the last 20 years. We have \nnever seen this big of a spread. Never.\n  You see the flatline of workers all over America, just as flatline as \ncan be. I don't know how we can look them in the eye and say we have \ndone the best because now we have opened up 11 new countries.\n  Vietnam--58 cents an hour is what they are going to pay their \nworkers. And we said: Whoa, whoa, NAFTA is going to be basically \nbringing the whole North American trade up to par. Twenty-two years \nlater, I understand that Mexico's minimum wage is still under $1 an \nhour, around 80 cents.\n  You think a person who makes 58 cents an hour or 80 cents an hour or \n$1.50 an hour--7 out of 11 countries make less than $2--that those \npeople will have disposable income to buy the products we would like to \nsell so that we can expand our economy and our jobs? I am sorry, \nI don't think that is going to happen. I really don't. It doesn't make \nany sense to me at all how we expect a person who can barely survive to \nhave disposable income to buy products that we in the United States of \nAmerica wish to sell to really lift our manufacturing base. But I guess \nthat is why we have TAA that we are arguing about because we know we \nhave given that up. We just about wrote that off 22 years ago, so I \nguess we are going to write the rest of it off now.\n\n  Technology is great. I am all for innovation, creation, technology. I \nam for every bit of that. But sooner or later, you have to make \nsomething, you have to build something, you have\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\nto reinvest, and there have to be people making these products, being \nable to support their families and to have a benefit package that gives \nthem a decent life.\n  When I was growing up in little Farmington, WV, we had manufacturing, \nmining. We had people who could go to work, work hard, make a living, \ntake their family on vacation, pay the bills. And we let all of that \nslip away from us. I am not saying they will be the jobs of the past, \nbut we could have the jobs of the future--steel, manufacturing.\n  So I am not willing to give up on this. You don't find me chastising \nmy colleagues on the Republican side or my colleagues on the Democratic \nside. I think we are all here for the right reason. Sometimes we get a \nlittle bit off track, and I think this is one time we have gotten off \ntrack. Something that would really help the United States of America, \nworking families all over this country, we have kind of forgotten \nabout, and I am concerned about that.\n  I am concerned about going home to my beautiful State of West \nVirginia and telling the people: I am sorry, we are going to have a \nharder time competing with some of these countries because there is \njust no way.\n  We have opened up our borders. We have let international trade, an \ninternational manufacturing base go wherever they get the best deal. \nAnd I guarantee you that in every developing country, they are not \ngoing to be as tough as we are on human rights and on the environmental \nquality they should be aspiring to. They are not going to be tough on \nthose things. They are trying to build an economy. They are trying to \nbuild, basically, a nation, bring it up. And they are going to be a \nlittle bit lax on these things. That is unfair competition, which my \ndad always warned me against.\n  When we talk about European trade, I am not worried about European \ntrade because they are basically on the same level playing field that \nwe are. But when you are trying to build up a country, should you \nsacrifice and tear down your country? Should you give away everything \nyou have worked hard for and built?\n  I want to help these countries. I have not a bit of problem helping \nthese countries. I am not an isolationist. But I basically would have \nput something in there that would have protected our manufacturing \nbase. I would have put something in that said that when we fell below \ncertain jobs in manufacturing, it stops. You don't give it all away. It \nis hard to regain that and recapture it.\n  I am sure Wall Street is very happy today. I have a lot of friends \nwho work on Wall Street. There are a lot of good people who work on \nWall Street, but there are a lot of people who basically are just \ndriven by the almighty dollar. They are not driven by Main Street. They \nare not worried about West Virginia. They are not worried about my \nlittle town of Farmington or any part of my State. And they are going \nto be very happy. They are not worried about 99 percent of the people \nwho are still on Main Street trying to survive.\n  We talked about the Export-Import Bank. They said: Trust us; we are \ngoing to get a vote on Export-Import Bank. Maybe we will sometime. I \nwould hope that comes to fruition. That helped a lot of small \nbusinesses. We haven't gotten that vote yet. So you would have thought \nthere would have been a priority to get a vote on that. It has done an \nawful lot to get us in the market so we can compete on a more level \nplaying field. That hasn't happened.\n  But here we go again. We are going to have some votes tomorrow, and \nthe votes tomorrow are going to be based on the TAA because the House \ncouldn't pass TPA fast-track with TAA in it. It is basically what we \nare dealing with. So they think we can do a backdoor. What makes you \nthink TAA would be acceptable in any way, shape, or form in the House? \nWhat makes you think now, since we have carved this out--but we were \npromised a vote here on the TAA, which we know we are going to need--it \nis going to make it more acceptable on the House side when they made \nthem take TAA out and couldn't pass TAA in the TPA bill? Doesn't make \nany sense to me.\n  So I think it is a sad day today. I really do. And I am concerned. I \nam concerned about our country. I am concerned about my hard-working \npeople in West Virginia--and I know you are--and all the other States \nwe have. These are good people. They deserve an opportunity. They \ndeserve fair trade. They really deserve a fair trading country, people \nwho will trade honestly with us and who have a quality or standard that \nthey have to live up to in order to get into our markets. I don't think \nwe should sacrifice our markets basically just to build them up. I \nthink we should assist them, but they are going to have to find their \nown markets to the point where we don't sacrifice.\n\n  So I think this could be a troubling thing. I am hoping it is not, \nbut it could be. I have concerns. And I have said that if I can't \nexplain it back home, I can't vote for it. And this is one I could not \nexplain back home. I could not make the people feel comfortable that \nthis is really going to improve quality of life and opportunities for \nthem and their families. I couldn't do it because I don't see it. I \ndon't believe in it. And I said I wouldn't vote for it, and I didn't.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cruz). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I just want to say a few things about the \nvote we just took on cloture to proceed with TPA.\n  The Senator who just spoke talked about some of the problems with the \ndeal and the dislocations that happen when we have trade. We all \nrecognize there are dislocations. There are dislocations whenever an \neconomy adjusts and moves ahead with or without trade. But trade \noverall is necessary. It is good. Free trade is good.\n  Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers live outside our \nboundaries. Seventy percent of the world's economic output happens \noutside of our boundaries. We need to trade. We can't just say: Well, \nwe are just going to live within ourselves here, have an economy that \ndoesn't reach out or pull in. We benefit. We benefit from better \nservices and cheaper goods when we trade. Our manufacturers benefit \nwhen we are able to export our products.\n  It was said before that we haven't seen any good outcomes after \nNAFTA. We have. It is rewriting history to say that we haven't seen \ngood outcomes as a result of NAFTA. I think the last speaker said \nMexico has not improved since NAFTA. It has. I can tell you, as a \nrepresentative of a State that borders with Mexico, the economy is \nconsiderably bigger and better. Arizona is one of our biggest trading \npartners. It has improved since NAFTA.\n  These trade agreements work. We haven't had a trade agreement \nnegotiated without the TPA process--with the exception of one--I think \nin over 30 years. That one was a deal I believe with Jordan, and it had \nfar more to do with defense than commerce.\n  So we need to have TPA--this process--in order to negotiate these \ntrade agreements. The vast majority of our trade--I believe it is close \nto 90 percent of our trade--is with countries with which we have free-\ntrade agreements.\n  So I applaud those who have worked so hard to bring this to pass \nhere--Senators Hatch and Wyden and others--and the compromises that \ntook place. I am not a particular fan of trade adjustment assistance. \nWhen economies move forward, there are dislocations. We can't account \nfor all of them. In fact, we have seen some of the problems with \nprevious TAA assistance. I believe some of it went to those who were \nlaid off at Solyndra and to some of these things that had very little \nto do with trade. Because of the way you seek such assistance, we don't \ndo the best that we could to keep track of where those jobs were lost \nto. But having said that, we all recognize, as the Senator from Texas \nsaid earlier, that TAA is the price we pay to get TPA. We all recognize \nin this body that there are compromises that need to be made. That is \nhow we move legislation, and that is how we get important legislation \nsuch as TPA passed so that we can\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\nhave more free trade, and our economy will benefit because of it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                   Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to \ntalk about Internet tax freedom and to talk about ensuring that our \nonline businesses remain competitive.\n  First of all, I commend the House of Representatives for recently \npassing the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would permanently \nextend the current ban on Internet access taxes. The current tax \nmoratorium will expire on October 1, and if we fail to renew it, it \ncould cost taxpayers nearly $15 billion in new fees and taxes next \nyear. In addition, as importantly, it would make Internet access less \naffordable to hard-working families and hamper small businesses' \nability to grow and create jobs using the Internet because essentially \nit would allow all of these jurisdictions to tax the Internet. So when \nyou get on the Internet, you can expect many more taxes if we do not do \nwhat the House of Representatives did and extend the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. In fact, I think we should make it permanent.\n  I am a cosponsor of a Senate companion bill of which I hope this \nSenate will follow the House's lead to pass and send a permanent \nextension to the President's desk.\n  Unfortunately, one of the things we have heard is that some see this \nextension of the moratorium on Internet taxation as an opportunity to \nattach another piece of legislation that, in fact, would burden our \nonline businesses and would tremendously disadvantage a State like my \nhome State of New Hampshire that has made the legislative decision not \nto have a sales tax.\n  We have seen this playbook before. It was called before the \nMarketplace Fairness Act. Of course, there is nothing fair about this \nact when it comes to our online businesses having to collect taxes for \nnearly 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. You can imagine the bureaucratic \nnightmare that would occur. So this so-called Marketplace Fairness \nAct--I always used to like to call it the ``Online Sales Tax Act'' or \nthe ``Online Sales Tax Collection Act.'' That would be a more accurate \ndescription of that particular act.\n  So here we are. We have a rerun of this particular bill that would \nhave required businesses in the State of New Hampshire--even though we \ndo not have a sales tax--our online businesses to collect for all these \nother tax jurisdictions. Again, it is not even just States that have \nsales taxes. In some States, it goes down to the municipal level when \nit comes to municipalities and local jurisdictions actually collecting \na separate tax, so it would have ended up being over 9,000 taxing \njurisdictions. So here you have a nice online business out there having \nto be the tax collector for all these different jurisdictions. You can \nimagine that this would really be a huge burden on these online \nbusinesses.\n  The individuals who have been supporting this new sales tax \ncollection scheme in this new burden on the Internet--by the way, one \nof the reasons I am such a strong proponent of permanently extending \nthe tax freedom and the lack of taxes on the Internet, on Internet \naccess, is because we have seen not only consumers' access to the \nInternet but the ability of businesses and the ability of us to create \njobs and to see real growth on the Internet. This has allowed people to \nstart businesses from their home. It has allowed so much creativity. It \nhas been very positive for our economy.\n  So lo and behold in all of that there are some talking about \nattaching to this Internet Tax Freedom Act this incredibly burdensome \ncollection scheme to require businesses to be out there collecting all \nthese sales taxes throughout the Nation. The latest proposal the \nproponents of this type of tax collection scheme have come up with is \none that again creates even more issues--certainly as many if not more \nissues--than the prior proposal that was called the so-called \nMarketplace Fairness Act. Of course, we know there is nothing fair \nabout it if you are a business having to collect all these taxes.\n  What this rerun would do is actually create this reporting system and \nrequire businesses to purchase this software and then require States to \nactually have what are called certified software providers. Here is \nwhat would happen: Under this latest scheme, the certified software \nproviders for these States would actually collect all the sales \ninformation for every sale--every online sale in a State--and then they \nwould manage the collection of these taxes. Well, can you imagine? So \nnow we are going to say to businesses: Yes, you have to purchase this \ncertain software. And guess what. Every sale you make is going to be \nheld by the central government in each State.\n  Can you imagine, with all the things we have seen happen in terms of \nbreach of privacy of individuals? We have seen cyber attacks, all these \nissues we are facing. We have seen it in our government with OPM. We \nhave seen it with the IRS. We have seen it with private companies in \ndata breach.\n  Now this latest scheme is, let's send all the sales information to \none place, and we will have some company--I guess some private \ncompanies will stand to benefit from this--they will now collect all \nthese taxes, and they will hold all this information. Imagine how much \ninformation they would hold in each State.\n  So that is how we are going to create this new taxing scheme. You can \nimagine how a State such as New Hampshire would feel about that as a \nState that has decided not to have a sales tax--that suddenly our State \nhas to keep all this information, has to hire some private company to \ndo this, to collect all these taxes, and then that each of our online \nbusinesses has to purchase this software which is supposed to interface \nwith its State government. What a massive bureaucracy, and how unfair \nit is in terms of State sovereignty that the Federal Government would \nimpose this on a State such as New Hampshire that has made a decision \nnot to have a sales tax.\n  This, to me, would be the opposite of what we are trying to \naccomplish under the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which I fully \nsupport, which is about Internet tax freedom, and to attach this \nproposal to that Internet Tax Freedom Act, which some people, I think, \nare scheming around here to do, which with the right hand we are going \nto give you Internet freedom and with the left hand we are going to \ntake that freedom away from States like mine that have chosen not to \nhave a sales tax. And our online businesses would now have to be part \nof this huge bureaucratic scheme to collect taxes for other States and \nother localities.\n  So I would hope my colleagues would not go down this road because I \nthink the Internet should be free. I think online businesses should be \nable to continue to thrive and grow. I think online businesses should \nnot be required to collect for over 9,000 taxing jurisdictions. And \ncertainly I think all of us should have concerns about all of the sales \ndata being collected by some kind of third party and being held in one \nplace just so we can collect more taxes on online businesses.\n  In fact, what I have heard from our businesses in New Hampshire \npreviously when the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act was on the floor \nof the Senate--many of the businesses in New Hampshire that have online \nsales told me then how unfair they thought this taxing scheme was, and \nthose concerns\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\nremain, great businesses such as Garnet Hill in Franconia, NH. Russ \nGaitskill, who is the president and CEO of Garnet Hill, told me \npreviously: ``It's going to be a nightmare.''\n  I heard in the past from E Laundry and Dry Cleaners, a small \nbusiness founded in Manchester in 1921. About 70 percent of E's sales \nare now Internet based. The company's president said he would not have \nthe resources to calculate, collect, and deliver sales taxes for \nthousands of jurisdictions across the country.\n  There is a great bakery, certainly, in the Nashua and Amherst area, \nFrederick's Pastries. Anybody who has been there--I can tell you, \nFrederick's is a great bakery. Susan Lozier Roberts of Frederick's \nexpressed concern that this taxing scheme would create mass confusion, \nkeeping up with all the individual tax codes.\n  There is the fact that we are going to have to have software and have \nsome third party hold all of the sales information for all these online \nbusinesses. That creates so many other additional burdensome issues, as \nwell as privacy issues.\n  Travis Adams with whaddy.com, based in Nashua, said previously: One \ntax audit from another State or jurisdiction would completely crush us. \nBecause what happens under this so-called taxing scheme is now all of \nour online businesses can be audited in all of these taxing \njurisdictions. So you can be an online business in New Hampshire, and \nwhat the proponents of this new tax scheme would like to have is this \nopportunity that businesses in New Hampshire can now be audited in all \nthese other jurisdictions. You can imagine what kind of burdens that \nwould create on businesses that are trying to focus every day on the \nbottom line and creating jobs.\n  So I would say that as we look at this new proposal that some people \nbehind the scenes are talking about trying to attach to the Internet \nTax Freedom Act--I hope we will not go down this road. It would be bad \nfor business, it would be bad for people's privacy, it would be a big \npower grab, I think, from Washington to require States such as New \nHampshire to collect these taxes from throughout the country, and it \ncertainly would not be positive to create more jobs through online \nbusinesses.\n  In fact, the Competitive Enterprise Institute said of this latest \nproposal, which is a cousin to the so-called Marketplace Fairness Act:\n\n       [This] new tax grab erodes healthy tax competition among \n     states, puts consumers' information at higher risk, and \n     ushers in a regime of taxation without representation. It's \n     like the Blackwater of tax collection, state-paid mercenaries \n     with sales tax charts. Under the Marketplace Fairness Act \n     businesses are threatened by the prospect of being audited \n     and prosecuted in every state into which they sell.\n\n  This issue is one I think we all should care about. I know in my home \nState of New Hampshire, where we have chosen not to have a sales tax, \nit would be completely unfair for us to consider passing this proposal \nwhich is a brandnew tax grab that erodes New Hampshire's competitive \nstatus of choosing not to have a sales tax. Also, there is the concern \nwe all should have about a central taxing authority holding all of this \nprivate sales information in each of the States and what could be done \nwith that information and how will consumers' information be protected. \nNew Hampshire's residents and Internet retailers cannot afford this \nradical Federal invasion of our State.\n  I hope my colleagues will see the importance of extending the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act to encourage innovation and job creation, but \nunder no circumstances should the Internet access tax moratorium be \nheld hostage by a new and invasive sales tax that would not only undo \nthe benefits of the tax moratorium but also burden our small businesses \nwith becoming tax collectors for other States. That is wrong, and I \nhope this body will not go down that road. I certainly will be doing \neverything I can within my power in the Senate to make sure this new \nsales tax collection regime does not get attached to a very positive \nproposal, which is the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, it is an honor to follow my colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, who has done such an eloquent job.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  I want to talk about the Export-Import Bank. I said this during the \nunnecessary 2013 Government shutdown, and I will say it again: Most \nAmericans think Congress can do something to help create jobs and \nstrengthen our economy--even if it is simply not doing any harm. Yet \nhere we are again, willfully allowing an important tool for economic \ngrowth to expire by not taking commonsense action.\n  On June 30, the charter for the Export-Import Bank will expire. \nDuring its 80-plus years of existence, the Bank has garnered support \nfrom every President during that span and repeatedly been renewed by \nCongress, often without any objection. The Export-Import Bank is not a \nDemocratic program or a Republican program. It is a program to help \nAmerican businesses. President Reagan's words from 30 years ago still \nring true:\n\n       Exports create and sustain jobs for millions of American \n     workers and contribute to the growth and strength of the \n     United States economy. The Export-Import Bank contributes in \n     a significant way to our nation's export sales.\n\n  The Gipper was right then, and he is right today.\n  Those who oppose the Ex-Im Bank for ideological reasons may make \ntheir case in the abstract, but I have to operate in the reality, where \nI have heard over and over from Indiana small business owners and \nworkers about the importance of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  Jon, the vice president of Specialty Hardwoods of Indiana, in \nNappannee, told me about their small company, which has around 40 \nemployees. They got through the financial downturn of 2008 and 2009 but \nsuffered during that time, as all small manufacturers did, not only \nhere in this country but worldwide. As they returned to profitability, \nthey made a decision to try to diversify markets.\n  Up until 2008, they mostly sold their products to the recreational \nvehicle industry. Since then, they have started to sell to cabinet \ncompanies that market to the kitchen and bath industry nationally and \nmade a direct attempt to go after export sales. Lumber product exports \nnow account at Specialty Hardwoods for more than 45 percent of their \ncurrent sales. Jon told me:\n\n       We could not have done this without the support of EXIM \n     bank. I personally have helped other small companies in our \n     industry contact EXIM and establish relationships with EXIM \n     to market their products. It levels the playing field for \n     smaller companies to enter this market segment of our \n     industry.\n       We have grown our business and survived because of EXIM \n     bank and the efforts of the 40-45 people that we employ.\n\n  The stories continue.\n  Mark, the vice president and co-owner of Agrarian Marketing \nCorporation, told us about his company that makes feed additives and \nnutritional supplements for the livestock industry. They have a very \nlarge distributor in Cairo, Egypt, that represents nearly 30 percent of \ntheir business. For this Hoosier business, nearly 30 percent of their \nbusiness comes from Cairo, Egypt.\n  The credit insurance they purchase through Ex-Im Bank allows them to \nsource this business by extending beneficial credit terms to their \nEgyptian customer. It would not be possible if they required their \ncustomer to prepay for those orders.\n  Mark said:\n\n       Although we are a small business, this segment of our \n     business is very important to us and provides excellent \n     profitability and jobs here in Indiana as well as jobs for \n     our contract manufacturers in Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio. All \n     would suffer if we lost this business.\n\n  Bruce, the CEO and chairman of Sullivan-Palatek in Michigan City, \nnoted that not only are the 140 jobs at his company impacted but \nseveral hundred more at local suppliers.\n  Bruce said:\n\n       In the event that the Ex-Im Bank were to be shut down, the \n     impact to us would be immediate. I believe we would have very \n     much difficulty in getting any new orders.\n       In fact, the orders that we have in house, many of them we \n     would not be able to ship. We would have to shut them down \n     right in the middle . . . of the order process.\n\n  Jon, Mark, and Bruce are three of many in Indiana, many around the \ncountry. In my home State, the Hoosier State, since 2010 the Export-\nImport Bank has directly helped more than 100 companies that have \nexported more than $3 billion in goods and services.\n  The Ex-Im Bank costs zero in taxpayer dollars. In fact, it turns a \nprofit.\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\nSince 1992, the Bank has returned more than $7 billion in profits to \nthe Treasury. Last year, $675 million was returned to the Treasury. And \nthe default rate is 0.175 percent. That is less than one-fifth of 1 \npercent. That is an effort to manage it in a fiscally prudent, fiscally \nresponsible manner.\n  In fiscal year 2014, the Ex-Im Bank authorized around $20.5 billion \nfor 3,746 transactions, which contributed to $27.5 billion of U.S. \nexports and more than 164,000 jobs right here in the United States.\n  These are not, for the most part, huge corporations. They are small \ncompanies that wouldn't be able to afford financing elsewhere. In 2014, \n90 percent of the transactions approved by the Bank were in support of \nsmall businesses.\n  So what happens if Ex-Im's charter is to expire? It will be forced to \nshut down, unwind current obligations, and the loss of future financing \ncould result in a significant amount of business being lost overseas. \nThat directly affects the bottom line for many businesses, leaving them \nwith less revenue to reinvest and less revenue to pay wages or create \nnew jobs. It becomes difficult--if not nearly impossible--for the \nprivate sector to replace the loans, the guarantees, and the insurance \nprovided by the Ex-Im Bank.\n  At a time when American companies are competing in a game that is \noften rigged by foreign currency manipulation, intellectual property \ntheft, and insurmountable regulatory barriers, unilaterally eliminating \nour export credit agency further handcuffs U.S. job creators and allows \ncompetitors in foreign countries to pick up the business.\n  If Ex-Im no longer provides financing, foreign companies and \ncountries are still going to buy their goods and products. They need \nthe products. But instead of buying that product from Muncie, IN, they \nwill purchase it in Russia or China.\n  This is, to me, the direct opposite of what Congress should be doing. \nIt seems as if up is down and down is up in this discussion. Nearly \nevery other major country has a credit export agency. Many are larger \nand much more aggressive than the Export-Import Bank. Unilaterally \neliminating our export credit agency hurts not only the United States \nand handcuffs our job creators, but it also helps competitors in \nforeign countries to capitalize and seize that business.\n  Our global competitors, including China, Brazil, and India, are \ninvesting more in export financing every single day. They are investing \nin their companies and in their economy. If we take this measure, we \nare stepping back. They are rooting for America's Export-Import Bank to \nclose because it means more business for them.\n  Even our neighbor Canada is providing far more export financing than \nthe United States. Canada's economy is one-tenth the size of the U.S. \neconomy, and their export-import agency already provides far more \nexport financing than we do at the present time. The Ex-Im Bank is a \ntool that helps American companies compete in the global economy.\n  In Indiana, we pride ourselves on what we call Hoosier common sense. \nIt does not get more common sense than creating more American jobs in a \nfiscally responsible way. That is what the Export-Import Bank does.\n  Congress needs a dose of that Hoosier common sense, which is the same \nas the common sense in the Presiding Officer's home State of Ohio. We \nshould act quickly to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank to help our \ncompanies, to help our employees, to help workers around our country, \nand to help our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Madam President, our country stands on the brink of a \ngreat opportunity in the Asia-Pacific. Since 2008, the United States \nand 11 other Pacific nations, including Japan and New Zealand, have \nworked to conclude negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This \nagreement represents nearly 40 percent of the global gross domestic \nproduct, or GDP, and is the most ambitious free-trade agreement in \nhistory. By upending antiquated international tariff systems and \ntearing down barriers to trade, we can unleash American ingenuity and \nsend our Nation's products from Main Street to Malaysia.\n  Much has been said about the national benefits of concluding TPP, but \nI want to focus on some of the particular benefits for my home State of \nColorado. Colorado, like most States, benefits immensely from \ninternational trade, particularly with Asia. According to the Business \nRoundtable, more than 265,000 Colorado jobs are supported by the \ncountries that would be affected by TPP. These trade-related jobs \ninclude the farmworker harvesting world-famous melons down in Rocky \nFord and the meatpacker shipping American beef from Greeley. They are \nthe electrical engineer designing computer systems in Boulder and the \nnatural gas worker maintaining a rig in Parachute. Collectively, these \neveryday working Americans help drive the economic and trade engine of \nColorado. Last year, my State exported more than $8 billion worth of \ngoods all across the world. Approximately half of them, or $4 billion, \nwent directly to TPP countries.\n  While nations like Vietnam and Japan have imposed hefty tariffs on \nour Colorado goods in the past, TPP presents an opportunity to level \nthe playing field. American goods would flow more freely to the region \nand American workers stand to benefit. That is why I strongly support \ngranting the President trade promotion authority, or TPA, and \nfinalizing a high-standard TPP. A vote for TPA is a vote for the \nAmerican worker. It is a vote for more active engagement in the world \nand a higher standard of living, and it is a vote to recognize that \nthrough increased trade, we can indeed deliver upon the promise of a \nbetter tomorrow.\n  Unfortunately, however, some in Congress have opted for isolationism \nand retreat. They have sounded the alarm over supposed failure of past \ntrade agreements and argued in favor of taking cover rather than taking \ncharge, and they have doubled down on the false notion that trade is \nalways bad for the American economy and the American worker. But a \nquick review of the facts will dispel these myths very quickly. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, national beef exports \nto Colombia and Panama have more than tripled since 2011 when we \nenacted free-trade agreements with these countries. National wheat \nexports to Chile more than doubled from the enactment of our 2003 free-\ntrade agreement through 2014, while dairy exports increased more than \n20 times to that country, and our beef exports have increased more than \neight times to the participant countries of the Central America and \nDominican Republic free-trade agreement.\n  Colorado businesses have played a large role in expanding overseas as \nwell. My State witnessed a 37-percent increase in goods exported to \ncountries with free-trade agreements between 2003 and 2013. Exports to \nKorea have increased 61 percent since the conclusion of our free-trade \nagreement with that nation in 2011. And NAFTA, which anti-trade forces \nfrequently dismiss as the poster child for trade deals gone awry, has \nresulted in a 293-percent--that is right, 293 percent--increase in \nColorado exports to Canada and Mexico since 1994.\n  Beyond the numbers, though, it is important to meet with the workers \nand business owners who understand that freer trade helps their bottom \nline. Just a few days ago, I traveled to Eastern Colorado on my annual \nwheat tour. It is a tradition that Senator Wayne Allard started in the \n1990s--then a U.S. Representative--and one I was excited to continue in \nthe Senate. I invited my colleague from Colorado Senator Bennet, so we \ncould both hear the needs directly from Coloradans and see the positive \nimpacts that agreements such as TPP could have not only on Eastern \nColorado but farmers across this country.\n  On the tour, we had the chance to marvel at the truly incredible \nproduction level of Colorado wheat growers. We are just about 2 weeks \naway from\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\nthe height of the winter wheat harvest in Colorado--a time when I have \nalways enjoyed working at our family implement dealership in Yuma--and \na reminder that Colorado helps feed the world. The vast majority of \nColorado's wheat crop is exported. In fact, in 2013, we shipped more \nthan $235 million worth of wheat across the globe. Eighty percent of \nthe wheat we produce in Colorado is exported. Most of the wheat growers \nwe met on the Eastern Plains aren't interested in retreating from the \ninternational marketplace. In fact, they want to expand the \ninternational marketplace. They understand that freer trade means \nimproved opportunities to place their product. And with a high-standard \nTPP, Colorado wheat growers could penetrate notoriously difficult \nmarkets in countries such as Japan and begin to ship from Thurman to \nTokyo and beyond.\n  It isn't just wheat either. Colorado farmers and ranchers already \nexport millions of dollars in Western Slope beef, Southern Colorado \nonions, and San Luis Valley potatoes. In fact, according to the \nDepartment of Agriculture, Colorado potatoes represent around 70 \npercent of all U.S. potato exports to Mexico. That market stands to \ngrow significantly if TPP is successfully concluded, considering that \nMexico is a member nation in the negotiations.\n  There is no question that trade benefits rural America. We should be \npromoting Palisade peaches in Perth and Olathe sweet corn on the \nstreets of Singapore. Growing up in rural Colorado, I saw the potential \nthat our hard-working farmers and ranchers created for Colorado and for \nColorado products abroad. Their determined spirit and hard-working \nattitude are what keep America at the top of the global economy, and \nTPP will expand that promise in the Asia-Pacific.\n  Urban and suburban America succeed with increased trade as well. As \ndo their rural counterparts, urban and suburban Coloradans benefit from \na wider selection of cheaper goods. The mechanics of free trade stretch \ndollars a little bit further for the teenager with a part-time summer \njob as well as for the family struggling to make ends meet.\n  Aside from the benefit of cheaper products, increased trade creates \njobs here at home. A couple of months ago, I was fortunate enough to \nvisit a company in Boulder, CO, that manufactures zip lines and other \nadventure equipment. This company has successfully expanded their \nbusiness to Europe and Asia, helping people across the globe enjoy rain \nforest canopy tours, free falling, and more.\n  As this business expanded overseas, they had the ability to hire more \nemployees and boost the local economy in Boulder. They doubled their \nColorado office and are still looking to grow. An agreement such as TPP \nwill open further opportunities for this company in the Asia-Pacific \nand beyond, perhaps facilitating world-class bungee jumping in New \nZealand or advanced rock climbing in Peru, and with those new \nopportunities come more Colorado jobs.\n  That is the essence of free trade. It encourages innovation and \nentrepreneurship. It connects the world while growing our workforce at \nhome, and it presents an opportunity for Colorado and our country to \nspread our goods and ideas across the globe.\n  That is why I have supported free-trade agreements in the past--\nagreements that have yielded significant economic and strategic \nbenefits for our Nation. That is why I supported the latest generation \nof trade promotion authority and look forward to supporting it again. \nWe will continue to support it this week as it goes to the President's \ndesk to be signed into law. That is why I urge my colleagues to \ncontinue their support for free-trade agreements, so the United States \ncan help grasp the great opportunity that awaits us in the Asia-\nPacific.\n  We have held several hearings over the past couple of months in the \nForeign Relations Committee and beyond talking about the benefits of \nfree trade. A couple of weeks ago, we were joined by experts from Asia \nand economic leaders around this country, all of whom believe we have \nan important role to play in expanding trade and expanding the \nopportunities that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to when that \nagreement comes to this floor, thanks to trade promotion authority. It \nis an important measure that we must enact. It is an important \nstatement of good faith that the United States truly is interested in \nthe Asia region, the Asia-Pacific region, making good on our efforts to \ntruly pivot to Asia to rebalance policy we all support but making good \non our word that we are indeed in the region to stay.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                         Republican-Led Senate\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last fall, Republicans promised that if \nwe were elected to the majority, we would get Washington working. That \nwasn't a campaign slogan, that was a commitment. After 6 months of \nRepublican control, I am proud to report we are delivering on that \npromise.\n  The past 6 months in the Senate have been the most productive months \nin a long time. We passed bipartisan legislation to approve the \nKeystone Pipeline. We passed a bipartisan bill to help prevent suicides \namong veterans. We passed the first significant bipartisan reform of \nMedicare in years, which will ensure that our seniors have access to \nphysicians and that those physicians are judged by the quality rather \nthan the quantity of the care they provide. We passed bipartisan \nlegislation to give law enforcement new tools to fight human \ntrafficking and provide support for trafficking victims. We passed a \nbipartisan bill to authorize funding for our national defense to \nprovide for the needs of our men and women in uniform.\n  Those are just some of the highlights.\n  Every piece of legislation I mentioned passed with bipartisan \nsupport. One reason that happened is because the Republican majority \nhas been committed to ensuring that all Senators, whatever the party, \nhave the opportunity to make their voices heard.\n  Under Democratic leadership, not only were Members of the minority \nparty shut out of the legislative process, but many rank-and-file \nDemocrats were as well. During all of 2014, the Democratic leadership \nin the Senate allowed just 15 amendment rollcall votes--15 votes in an \nentire year. That is barely more than a vote a month.\n  By contrast, the Republican-led Senate has taken more than 130 \namendment rollcall votes so far this year or more than 21 votes a \nmonth. That is not only more amendment rollcall votes than last year, \nit is more amendment rollcall votes than the Senate has taken in the \npast 2 years combined. That is through the first 6 months of 2015. We \nhave another 6 months to go.\n  This week, the Senate is considering what I hope is going to be our \nnext bipartisan achievement; that is, the legislation to help expand \nU.S. trade with other countries and increase the opportunities that are \navailable for American businesses and American workers.\n  Over the past few years, exports have been a bright spot in our \neconomy, supporting an increasing number of American jobs each and \nevery year. In 2014, exports supported 11.7 million U.S. jobs and made \nup 13 percent of our Nation's economy. We need to continue to open \nmarkets around the globe to American goods and services, and the best \nway to do that is through new trade agreements.\n  Countries with which we have free and fair trade agreements purchase \nsubstantially more from us than other countries. In fact, in 2013, \nfree-trade agreement countries purchased 12 times more goods per capita \nfrom the United States than nonfree-trade agreement countries--12 times \nmore goods per capita.\n  For American workers, increased trade means more opportunity and \nincreased access to high-paying jobs. Manufacturing jobs tied to \nexports pay, on average, 13 to 18 percent more than other jobs in our \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, while trade agreements have proliferated around the \nglobe over the past several years, the United States hasn't signed a \nnew trade agreement in 8 years. A big reason for that is the fact that \ntrade promotion authority expired in 2007. Since 1934, almost all of \nthe U.S. free-trade agreements have been negotiated using trade \npromotion authority or a similar streamlined, expedited process.\n  Trade promotion authority is designed to put the United States in the\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\nstrongest possible position when it comes to negotiating trade \nagreements. Under TPA, Congress sets guidelines for trade negotiations \nand outlines the priorities the administration must follow. In return, \nCongress promises a simple up-or-down vote on the resulting trade \nagreement instead of the long amendment process that could leave the \nfinal deal looking nothing like what was initially negotiated.\n  That simple up-or-down vote is the key. It lets our negotiating \npartners know that Congress and trade negotiators are on the same page, \nwhich gives other countries the confidence they need to put their best \noffers on the table. That, in turn, allows for a successful and timely \nconclusion of negotiations.\n  Currently, the administration is negotiating two major trade \nagreements that have the potential to vastly expand the market for \nAmerican goods and services in the European Union and in the Pacific. \nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated with a number of \nAsia-Pacific nations, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, \nSingapore, and Vietnam. If this agreement is done right, it could have \nhuge benefits for American agriculture, among other industries.\n  Agriculture producers in my State of South Dakota and in the \nPresiding Officer's State of Iowa understand that trade promotion \nauthority is the most effective way to secure trade agreements that \nwill benefit our farmers and our ranchers. One pork producer in my \nState of South Dakota contacted me to tell me that a successful TPP \ndeal could increase U.S. pork exports to just one of the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership countries by literally hundreds of millions of dollars in a \nyear.\n  Discussions of the benefits of trade tend to focus on the economic \nbenefits, and with good reason--it helps our economy. It creates good-\npaying jobs and raises the standard of living for people in this \ncountry and gives access for consumers to lower cost goods and \nservices. But new trade agreements also have the potential to result \nnot just in economic gains for America's farmers, ranchers, and \nmanufacturers but in national security gains for the country.\n  When we make trade deals with other countries, we are not just \nopening new markets for our goods, we are also developing and cementing \nalliances. Trade agreements build bonds of friendship with other \nnations that extend not only to cooperation on economic issues but to \ncooperation on security issues as well.\n  It is also important to remember that just because the United States \nisn't negotiating trade agreements doesn't mean other countries will \nnot be. In fact, the United States hasn't signed a single new trade \nagreement over the past 8 years, but that hasn't prevented other \ncountries from signing numerous trade agreements over the same period. \nIf America fails to lead on trade, other nations such as China will \nstep in to fill the void, and these nations will not have the best \ninterests of American workers and American families in mind.\n  The bill before us today will help pave the way for the United States \nto cement alliances with friendly nations through trade and will help \nensure that any trade deals the United States enters into will be \nfavorable to our economic and our national security interests.\n  The Senate passed a version of this bill last month with a bipartisan \nmajority, and I am hopeful we will have a similarly strong bipartisan \nvote yet this week. Republicans believe our Nation's problems are best \nsolved when Members of both parties come together to find solutions for \nthe American people.\n  Republicans' plans for our second 6 months in the majority are the \nsame as those for the first 6 months of our majority; that is, to make \nsure we continue to move forward in a way that addresses the challenges \nthat are facing our country. Unfortunately, last week we saw an \nunfortunate return to partisanship on the part of the Democrats when \nthey blocked an appropriations bill to fund our troops. It is not that \nDemocrats have a problem with this bill; in fact, many of them voted to \nsupport the funding this bill provides when they voted in favor of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act last week. The authorization act is \nthe first step in a two-step process which has to be followed by the \nappropriations bill that actually provides the funding. But Democratic \nleaders and the President, even though many of them supported the \nDefense authorization bill, are upset that government agencies such as \nthe EPA and the IRS aren't receiving the Democrats' preferred level of \nfunding, so they have decided to hold appropriations bills hostage in \nan effort to get what they want.\n  It is unfortunate that Democrats are holding money for our troops \nhostage in order to get more funding for the EPA and the IRS. If \nDemocrats believe the funding levels in the appropriations bills are \nnot acceptable, they will have the opportunity to offer amendments to \nincrease the funding. But in order to do that, they have to allow us to \nactually proceed to consideration of these bills on the Senate floor. \nWhat they are, in effect, doing now is filibustering any attempt to \nbring any spending bill to the floor; most recently, as I mentioned, \nthe funding bill for our troops. The bill that funds our national \nsecurity interests in this country is currently being held hostage. We \ncan't even get it on the floor to debate it. We are not only talking \nabout ultimately passing it, we are talking about even having a \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate about something as important as \nfunding our troops and the important military objectives we have as a \nnation. Yet, right now, we have a filibuster being conducted by the \nDemocrats--again, because they want to get more funding for their \nfavorite agencies. Well, that is a bad way to go about this.\n\n  I am hopeful that this obstruction--which is largely driven by the \nDemocratic leadership--that most rank-and-file Democrats will rethink a \nstrategy that involves opposing every opportunity to fund our Nation's \npriorities and to get things done for the American people.\n  After years of stagnation in the Senate under Democratic leadership, \nI think even most Democrats have enjoyed governing in a functioning \nSenate again. We have dozens of bipartisan bills to show for the first \n6 months of this year, and our record of accomplishment can continue if \nthe Democrats abandon their strategy of obstruction and continue to \nwork with us to solve the challenges facing our Nation. They can start \nby not objecting to proceeding to even getting a bill that funds our \nnational security interests here on the floor of the Senate so we can \ndebate it. As I said, if they don't like the funding levels in there, \nwe will have an open amendment process in which they will be able to \noffer amendments to change those funding levels. But what they are \ndoing right now is fundamentally wrong, not even allowing consideration \nof an appropriations bill that funds our military and pays our troops \non the floor of the United States Senate. I hope that will change.\n  I hope that the Democrats will join us in making the next 6 months of \n2015 as productive as the first 6 months have been and that we can \npoint to bipartisan achievements that are good for the American people, \nthat focus on their basic daily needs, and that will promote policies \nwhich will grow our economy and create jobs and lead to a higher \nstandard of living and increased take-home pay for middle-income \nfamilies across this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nunderscore the importance of trade and trade promotion authority to the \nAmerican manufacturing industry.\n  Despite some claims to the contrary, U.S. manufacturers have been \namong the principal beneficiaries of our existing free-trade \nagreements. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs depends on exports. On \naverage, the wages of those in export-supported manufacturing jobs are \n18 percent higher than those of other factory workers.\n  Furthermore, since the last TPA bill passed through the Congress in \n2002,\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\nU.S. goods exports have more than doubled, reaching $1.6 trillion in \n2013 alone. While we hear a constant drumbeat decrying our trade \ndeficits, the United States enjoys a nearly $60 billion yearly \nmanufacturing surplus with our 20 existing partners to the free-trade \nagreements. Consumers and businesses in those 20 countries purchased \n$658 billion of U.S. manufactured goods in 2013 alone, which represents \nnearly 48 percent of all exports produced by the 12 million Americans \nemployed in manufacturing.\n  Clearly, in places where we have free-trade agreements, where our \nmanufacturers can compete on a level playing field, they are winning. \nWe need to build on that track record of success and enact more high-\nstandard, 21st-century free-trade agreements. That is yet another \nreason why we need TPA.\n  It is no wonder, then, that our TPA bill is supported by \nmanufacturers throughout the country. We have received letters or \nstatements of support from groups such as the National Association of \nManufacturers, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, the \nGrocery Manufacturers Association, the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, the \nSemiconductor Industry Association, the Society of Chemical \nManufacturers & Affiliates, the National Council of Textile \nOrganizations, and many others.\n  On top of that, a number of iconic individual manufacturing companies \nhave weighed in publicly in support of our bill, including Boeing, \nCummins, Dow Chemical, Honeywell, Intel, Texas Instruments, Xerox, and, \nof course, many others.\n  Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, IL, is the world's leading \nmanufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel engines, and \ngas turbines. Caterpillar knows the value of trade to a healthy \neconomy, having exported nearly $88 billion in goods and services over \nthe past 5 years. They know that if we pass TPA, they can do even \nbetter.\n  Upon introduction of our bill, the company issued a statement saying, \n``Passage of TPA will provide the United States with the strongest \npossible hand when negotiating future trade agreements and will help \neliminate the current high tariffs and trade barriers that companies \nlike Caterpillar currently face.''\n  It is not just big companies that benefit. Ninety-eight percent of \nnearly 300,000 American exporters are small and medium-sized \nbusinesses. Let me say that again. Ninety-eight percent of all U.S. \nexporters are small and medium-sized businesses. There are 300,000 of \nthem. That fact escapes many people.\n  Let me give an example of one of those small businesses from my home \nState of Utah. Kimber Kable is owned and operated by Ray Kimber. Ray's \nstory is emblematic of the American dream. In the late 1970s, Ray \nfigured out a way to weave audio cables to reduce unwanted noise and \nimprove fidelity. The company he started in his garage over 35 years \nago is now a driver of economic growth and a source of jobs. Today, he \nemploys 30 people in Ogden, UT. He sells his cables to the world. Two-\nthirds of Ray's cables are shipped to customers overseas.\n  Ray is not only a friend of mine, he is also an outstanding example \nof a larger truth: The U.S. manufacturing sector is the most innovative \nin the world, and American workers are unsurpassed in manufacturing \nproductivity. Because of U.S. innovation and productivity, where U.S. \nmanufacturing competes on an equal footing, it always succeeds.\n  We can help people like Ray reach more markets and maintain healthy \nsmall businesses across America--businesses that will grow our economy \nand create more jobs--but we can only do that if our trade negotiators \nhave the tools to set fair trade rules for our exporters. That is what \nour TPA bill provides.\n  For example, a big part of the ability of small companies like Kimber \nKable to sell around the world is digital trade. That is why the TPA \nbill that is again before us directs our trade negotiators to ensure \nthat electronically delivered goods and services are classified with \nthe most liberal trade treatment possible and that our trading partners \nallow the free flow of data across borders.\n  Using the Internet to market, sell, and transmit digital products is \nonly part of the story. Companies like Ray's are also innovators, and \ntheir innovations must be protected. Too many small businesses have \nexperienced firsthand the destructive impact of intellectual property \ntheft. Companies like Kimber Kable have to contend with counterfeiters \nstealing their company name to sell inferior products. This TPA bill, \ntherefore, will also ensure that U.S. trade agreements reflect a \nstandard of intellectual property rights protection similar to that \nfound in our own U.S. law. The bill calls for an end to the theft of \nU.S. intellectual property by foreign governments, including piracy and \nthe theft of trade secrets, and for the elimination of measures that \nrequire U.S. companies to locate their intellectual property abroad in \nreturn for market access. These are strong provisions that will help \nU.S. manufacturing compete and sell their products around the world.\n  Companies from Caterpillar to Kimber Kable recognize the importance \nof trade and trade agreements to the future of American manufacturing. \nThey recognize that 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of \nthe United States and that if we want to sell American-made products to \nthese customers, we need strong agreements to break down barriers and \nlevel the playing field. We simply cannot do that without the TPA.\n  We can do better and we must do better for American manufacturers. If \nwe really want to support the American manufacturing industry, then we \nshould vote today to pass this TPA legislation once and for all.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to talk \nabout the importance of international trade to my home State of Utah \nand how Utahns will benefit from the passage of the TPA bill.\n  Despite having a relatively small population, the State of Utah is a \nvery significant player in international trade. In 2014 alone, Utah \nexported more than $12 billion in goods. That number has more than \ndoubled over the past decade, despite the economic downturn that took \nplace during that time.\n  Goods exports account for more than 11 percent of Utah's GDP. More \nthan 50,000 Utah jobs are directly tied to goods exports, as more than \n3,400 Utah-based companies export goods to countries around the world. \nBy the way, nearly 86 percent of those exporting companies are small or \nmedium-sized businesses.\n  These Utah exports include a number of key manufacturing exports, \nincluding primary metal products, computer and electronics products, \nchemicals, processed foods, and transportation equipment, just to \nmention a few.\n  There are a number of Utah companies that I could single out here \ntoday. As I said, there are more than 3,400 Utah-based exporters, but \nlet me talk about one in particular--Albion Laboratories, which is \nbased in Clearfield, UT.\n  Albion is a leading, global manufacturer of chelated minerals for \nhuman and plant nutritional applications. The company is incredibly \ninnovative, owning more than 100 patents from manufacturing processes \nto food applications. Over the years, Albion has enjoyed strong growth \nin large part because of its expanded exports. Today, Albion exports to \nmore than 100 different countries, which has allowed the company to \nregularly add new jobs to accommodate its increased output. As of right \nnow, the company employs approximately 150 people. This is just one \nexample of the many unique and innovative Utah companies that have \nbenefited from international trade and will benefit even more from \nexpanded access to foreign markets in the future.\n  Now, there has been a lot of talk about the potential benefits of our \npending trade agreements with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and \nthe European Union. As of right now, more than half of Utah's exports \nalready go\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\nto these two markets. Therefore, I think it is safe to say that Utah-\nbased exporters will benefit greatly from the expanded market access \nthey will undoubtedly see if we can get both the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership over \nthe finish line.\n  Of course, without TPA, these two important trade agreements, which \nare among the largest and most ambitious agreements in our Nation's \nhistory, don't stand a chance. TPA gives our negotiators the tools they \nneed to get the best deals possible. TPA gives Congress and our \nconstituents a strong voice in the negotiating process, and, of course, \nTPA assures that once an agreement is reached, our country will be able \nto deliver on the deal.\n  Utahns depend on international trade. Utah's job creators, like those \nthroughout the country, need greater access to foreign markets in order \nto compete. Put simply, they are not going to get that access without \nTPA.\n  So for the sake of the thousands of Utah companies that export goods \naround the world and the tens of thousands of Utahns whose jobs depend \non those exports--and for the hundreds of thousands of companies all \nover this country and more--I urge my colleagues to join me one more \ntime in supporting our TPA legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n              Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid Safety Act\n\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Madam President, I rise not to speak about an issue that \ndivides this Chamber but rather one that unites us; that is, the care \nof those who have served and sacrificed for our Nation, America's \nveterans.\n  Today, I take great pride in the fact I have worked across the aisle \nto introduce bipartisan VA reform legislation, the Jason Simcakoski \nMemorial Opioid Safety Act. I am pleased to be joined in offering this \nlegislation by my friend and colleague Senator Capito of West Virginia.\n  This legislation is aimed at addressing the problem of \noverprescribing practices at the VA and providing safer and more \neffective pain management services to our Nation's veterans. It is \nnamed in honor of a Wisconsin veteran, U.S. Marine veteran Jason \nSimcakoski.\n  On August 30, 2014, Jason tragically died at Wisconsin's Tomah \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center as a result of what was medically \ndeemed mixed-drug toxicity. I call this a failure to serve someone who \nhas faithfully served our country.\n  At the time of his death at the VA, Jason was on 14 different \nprescription drugs. Yet this Marine's heartbreaking story is just one \nexample of the overprescribing problem at the VA.\n  After two, decade-long, wars, a large number of our servicemembers \nare coming home with the damage of combat, and our veterans and their \nfamilies are facing the difficult challenge of physical injuries, PTSD, \nand other mental illnesses.\n  Unfortunately, I believe the VA's overreliance on powerful and highly \naddicting opioids has resulted in getting our veterans hooked rather \nthan getting them help. Jason's story is a tragic example of the \ndevastation caused by addiction--addiction whose roots are, \nregrettably, at the VA.\n  To me, overprescription of opioids at the VA is a root problem, and \nit is growing into a weed--a weed of addiction whose impact is being \nfelt beyond the walls of VA facilities. The ripples are indeed being \nfelt across America in the communities we work for every day in our \nNation's Capital.\n  The families whom we have a responsibility to represent--families of \nthose who have bravely served our country--are struggling with the loss \nof a son or a daughter, a father or a mother, a sister or a brother to \naddiction whose root is planted within the VA system. It is our job to \nmake sure they do not feel alone, and I believe we have a shared \nresponsibility to do everything we can to pull out this weed by its \nroots.\n  Jason's family is in Washington today, and I am so honored to have \nworked with them and others in putting these reforms together to \nprovide the VA with the tools it needs to help prevent this type of \ntragedy from occurring to other veterans and their families.\n  I what to thank the Simcakoski family and let them know I have a \ntremendous amount of respect for the courage they have shown in telling \ntheirs and Jason's story and working to make a difference in the lives \nof other veterans and their families.\n  Their story is one of a sacred trust we must have with our veterans \nand their families. It is a story of how that trust has been broken, \nand it is a tragic story of loss.\n  My message to my colleagues comes from Jason's widow Heather, who has \nsaid:\n\n       When I look back at the past, I want to know we made a \n     difference. I want to believe we have leaders in our country \n     who care. I want to inspire others to never give up because \n     change is possible.\n\n  Her words have inspired me, and it is my hope they will inspire my \ncolleagues to join us in taking action. I hope I speak for all of us \nwhen I say there is no room for politics when it comes to ensuring that \nour Nation's veterans receive the timely, safe, and highest quality \ncare that they have earned.\n  Our legislation takes steps to give veterans and their families a \nstronger voice in their care by strengthening opioid prescribing \nguidelines and other measures. It also works to improve coordination \nand communication throughout the VA and puts in place stronger \noversight and accountability for the quality of care we are providing \nour veterans.\n  Our goal is simple: put these bipartisan reforms in place to prevent \ntragedies like Jason's from occurring to other veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  I wish to thank and recognize Senators Blumenthal, Brown, Hirono, \nJohnson, Kaine, Manchin, Markey, Moran, Murray, Sanders, and Tester for \njoining Senator Capito and me, signing on as original cosponsors of \nthis bipartisan effort. I also wish to thank the many veterans service \norganizations and medical professionals for their invaluable support, \ninsight, and input as we crafted this legislation.\n  Today, I ask the rest of my colleagues to join us in working to \nconfront the problems of overprescribing practices at the VA and to \nprovide more safe and effective pain management services to our \nNation's veterans.\n  Let us work together to fix what has been broken and restore that \nsacred trust with our veterans and their families. Let us work together \nto give our veterans and their families a voice--a voice that is heard, \nrespected, and recognized. Let us be inspired by that voice to take \nbipartisan action on solutions to prevent these problems and tragedies \nfrom ever happening again and to provide our veterans and their \nfamilies with the care they have earned and the care they deserve.\n  Madam President, I yield time to my coauthor on this bill Senator \nCapito.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I come here before you today, joined by\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\nmy colleague Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin--but also by colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle, as she mentioned--in support of \nlegislation to provide safer and more effective pain management to our \nNation's veterans.\n  Too many of our veterans have returned from overseas duties only to \nfight another battle here at home. The Jason Simcakoski Memorial Opioid \nSafety Act takes the necessary steps to address challenges faced by our \nveterans.\n  Again, I thank the Simcakoskis for their bravery and courage, as \npainful as it is for the family, in hopes that it will help--and it \nwill help--the next generation of veterans who are being treated at the \nVA.\n  This bill reforms the overreliance on painkillers by the VA while \nstill ensuring that veterans receive appropriate medication. This \nlegislation not only updates and strengthens the guidelines for opioid \nprescriptions, but it requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nexpand the scope of research, education, delivery, and integration of \nalternative pain management. Chronic pain should not be something our \nveterans are forced to live with, and the VA must be on the cutting \nedge of developing effective pain management.\n  This bill will elevate the role of patient advocates--as I am sure \nJason's wife was a great patient advocate--require community meetings \nhosted by the VA, and establish a joint DOD-VA working group to improve \ncoordination and communication at all levels of government.\n  In an era where medical research and technological advancements have \nled to at least a 90-percent survival rate for our wounded soldiers, we \nmust continue to focus on the battles our veterans face when they \nreturn home, including treatment of those wounds that are not evidently \nvisible.\n  One marine in my hometown, Andrew White, returned home to West \nVirginia after serving in Iraq. Andrew displayed signs of PTSD, \nincluding insomnia, nightmares, constant restlessness, and pain related \nto an injury. In addition to antidepressant and antianxiety pills, \ndoctors placed Andrew on a strong antipsychotic drug and, over time, \nincreased his dosage from 25 milligrams to 1600 milligrams--more than \ntwice the dosage recommended to treat schizophrenia. Andrew White died \nin his sleep at the age of 23.\n  Andrew is a reminder of the physical and mental side effects of the \nwar. We must work together to provide the resources and care necessary \nto assist our veterans in their transition into civilian life.\n  Expansion of the Opioid Safety Initiative and further development of \nthe opioid therapy risk support tool will do just that. These measures \nwill enable the VA to use the patient record database to detect those \nat higher risk of opioid abuse and submit information to the State \nprescription drug monitoring programs. We really need all hands on \ndeck. This real-time tracking of information will enable medical \nprofessionals to better diagnose and treat patients.\n  This legislation calls for more accountability within the VA through \ninternal audits, reports to Congress, and increased information \nsharing. We cannot allow bureaucracy to get in the way of delivering \nquality care to veterans, and we must prioritize the efficient delivery \nof care.\n\n  In my home State of West Virginia, the tragic effects of opioid abuse \nhave left families devastated. I have met with other families who lost \ntheir loved ones who suffered from PTSD and traumatic brain injury, and \nI believe more can be done to find solutions.\n  It is incumbent upon us in a bipartisan way, as my colleague has \nsaid, to do right by our veterans. I wish to thank Senator Baldwin. I \nhave been at committee meeting after committee meeting with her where \nshe has pounded the drum on the importance of this issue and how \ndevastating it is to families across this country. I thank Senator \nBaldwin.\n  Our best is not just the least we can do. It is our duty to those who \nhave served, of whom we have asked so much, to do more than our best, \nand this bill does that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Data Breach at OPM\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, earlier today the Financial Services and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Subcommittee, of which I am a member, \nconducted a hearing on the data security breach at the Office of \nPersonnel Management. I am a member of that subcommittee, and we had \nseveral witnesses, including OPM Director Archuleta. Our goal was to \nlearn about the latest data breach that was revealed earlier this \nmonth.\n  I think that in many ways the hearing was useful and in other ways it \nwas inadequate. The hearing once again demonstrated that much more \nneeds to be done to address the ongoing IT management issues which \nplague so many agencies but in particular OPM.\n  As our witnesses testified, the recent breach--and really, it is \nbreaches--at OPM was not a resource issue but a management issue. Too \noften--and I certainly understand that how we appropriate money is \nimportant--the excuse is we don't have enough resources. Today, in my \nview, it was made clear that this is much more of a management issue \nthan a resource issue.\n  As Director Archuleta said in her confirmation hearing as well as in \ntoday's hearing, IT security was her top priority when she entered the \nagency in November of 2013. But what has transpired since then has been \ntroubling. She reminded me today that in her confirmation hearing--IT \ndata security was her top priority when she arrived at the agency in \nlate 2013.\n  Ms. Archuleta highlighted the fact that in March of 2014, OPM \ndetected a sophisticated attack targeting sensitive information. While \nthe hackers didn't get information in that particular instance, this \nshould have been the first alarm to go off that somebody was trying to \nget access to very sensitive documents.\n  I will reiterate what I am talking about in this case. This was March \nof 2014. We are talking about a hack attempt that occurred last year, \nnot the ones that are making the news today. Unfortunately, it happened \nagain a year ago--in June of 2014--when a company that was involved in \nbackground checks for the government, U.S. Investigation Services, \nUSIS, suffered a breach impacting as many as 26,000 Federal employee \nrecords. It happened again in August of 2014--a third time. So we have \nMarch, June, and August. In August of 2014, another company involved in \nbackground checks, KeyPoint, was breached, and this time over 48,000 \nrecords were stolen.\n  In both of these contractor breaches, OPM was required to send out \nnotifications to Federal employees who were affected. Clearly OPM knew \nabout these breaches. Now we have learned that the credentials stolen \nin those original breaches were used to enter the OPM system and this \ntime steal highly sensitive information. The information stolen was \nSocial Security numbers, military records, veteran status, addresses, \nbirth dates, job and pay history, health insurance, life insurance, \npension, age, gender, race, and union status. So these three separate \nexamples should have been the stark warning to secure this highly \nsensitive data.\n  When I asked the Director today about this topic, she merely pointed \nto an IT modernization plan that was drafted when she entered the \nagency about 20 months ago. My question was: Having seen these three \nattempts to breach the information at OPM, what then occurred at OPM \nfollowing that which was different to further and better protect \ninformation at the Office of Personnel Management? The answer was \nreally about pointing to a plan that was developed when the Director \ninitially arrived at OPM some 20 months ago.\n  In addition to those three breaches, if those were not warning \nenough, there were two other important reports which also could have \nand should have suggested that better management was\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\nneeded. In November 2014, the inspector general for OPM released its \nannual report on Federal information security. That report found that \n11 of the 47 major information systems--23 percent--at OPM lacked \nproper security authorization. In fact, 5 of the 11 systems were in the \noffice of the Chief Information Officer, the person responsible for the \nagency's data security.\n  This morning, Ms. Archuleta was proud to claim that the agency had \nbeen upgraded to just ``significant deficiency'' with regard to its IT \nsystem, up from ``material weakness.'' And the inspector general \ntestified this morning that they had offered 29 recommendations in \ntheir November report, and to date only 3 of the 29 recommendations had \nbeen adopted.\n  In addition to the inspector general report in November of 2014, in \nDecember--the following month--of 2014, the General Accounting Office, \nor GAO, issued a report highly critical of IT management at OPM. The \nreport identified best practices that OPM should implement to improve \nIT management. The report found that ``OPM's efforts to modernize \nretirement processing have been plagued by IT management weaknesses''--\nanother indication that OPM desperately needed to address IT \nmanagement, which our witnesses argue is critical to ensuring agency-\nwide security.\n  So my takeaway from this morning's hearing is that all the warning \nsigns were there. OPM was aware of the persistent issues. They knew \nabout breaches to their contractors, and the agency knew they were a \ntarget. Yet the only evidence that OPM did anything was a plan that was \nwritten in the first 100 days of the new Director's tenure at OPM. \nPlanning is important, but execution matters a lot more.\n  We still need lots of answers as to what OPM did following those \noriginal breaches last year. What security plan did they put in place? \nHave they identified which information to secure? How did they secure \nthese documents? Were they effective in preventing other attacks? How \noften did the OPM Director and the CIO, the Chief Information Officer, \nmeet and what were their discussions?\n  I am encouraged to know that our Financial Services and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee intends to have another hearing, \nand this time we will have the opportunity to present it in a secured \nsetting so that no one can indicate that they are incapable of \nanswering the question because of security issues. I look forward to \nthat hearing. However, I will tell my colleagues that it is \ndiscouraging to know what I now know, and it is a discouraging time for \nIT security and the Federal Government.\n\n  I hope we can use this as a lesson for other agencies that they need \nto be vigilant. We face real and serious threats. Inaction by agencies \nput Federal workers, the American people, and, most importantly, our \nnational security at risk.\n  In my view, this is important. These hearings matter. The information \nwe are garnering and attempting to garner is important for those who \nare employees of the Federal Government. They need to know what has \ntranspired so they can better protect themselves. Why are they at risk \nbecause of these hacks? Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, we need \nto know what has transpired here. Processes need to be in place to \nprevent additional challenges to our information technology, because it \nis a matter of our national security.\n  So for the sake of our Federal employees and their well-being but \nalso for the sake of the American citizens and our national security, \nthis is not an issue that we have the opportunity to avoid. Answers \nneed to be forthcoming and decisions need to be made system-wide--not \njust at OPM but throughout the entire Federal Government--as we work to \nprotect those who work for the Federal Government and as we work to \nprotect American citizens from a national security perspective.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to address the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4541-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO THOMAS PARROTT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I, as chairman of the Committee on Finance \nalong with Ranking Member Wyden, recognize Thomas Parrott, a \ndistinguished executive at the Social Security Administration--or, SSA. \nTom is currently the Assistant Deputy Commissioner for Legislation and \nCongressional Affairs at SSA. He is a dedicated public servant who has \nserved his country for more than 40 years.\n  Tom began his career at SSA in January 1975 as a claims \nrepresentative in the Midtown Manhattan district office, before being \nassigned to district offices in Rochester, NY, and later in Redding, \nCA. He returned to his hometown of Baltimore in 1980 as a policy \nanalyst in the predecessor office of what is currently called the \nOffice of Legislation and Congressional Affairs. Since that time, he \nhas been in the same component office at SSA serving as the Associate \nCommissioner for Legislative Development and Operations, as Acting \nDeputy Commissioner, and in his current position as the Assistant \nDeputy Commissioner.\n  Tom is a 1972 graduate of Denison University in Ohio, and he \ncompleted the Federal Executive Institute's Leadership for a Democratic \nSociety program in 2005. He was appointed in 2008, by then-SSA \nCommissioner Michael Astrue, to the Senior Executive Service.\n  As testimony to Tom's devotion to public service, prior to joining \nSSA, he was a VISTA volunteer and a field health inspector in western \nNew York working with migrant farm workers in the potato and apple \ngrowing regions of the State.\n  Sequences of staffers in the Finance Committee have had the pleasure \nof working with Tom on many issues relating to Social Security during \nhis tenure at SSA. He has always been resourceful, insightful, and \nforthcoming.\n  Tom will retire from the Social Security Administration on July 3, \n2015. He will be sorely missed by his colleagues and his many friends \non the Hill. He will leave behind the numerous individuals he has \nmentored and encouraged over the years and who will now carry on this \nwork.\n  Both Ranking Member Wyden and I feel that it is important that we in \nCongress recognize those who devote their working lives to improving \nthe lives of others. Career civil servants often do their work in quiet \nanonymity behind the scenes providing vital service to the American \npeople. They are rarely recognized for their many contributions. Tom \nParrott is one of those people. His record of leadership at the Social \nSecurity Administration and his commitment to providing the American \npeople with effective and compassionate service is a record of which he \ncan be justly proud.\n  Ranking Member Wyden and I wish Tom all the best in his retirement \nfrom Federal service and thank him for his many years of dedicated \nservice. Tom will continue in many ways to serve people in his \ncommunity, and we are all grateful for his efforts. We wish him all the \nvery best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4541-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4541-S4542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    3RD ANNIVERSARY OF DACA PROGRAM\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I commemorate the 3-year \nanniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, \ncommonly referred to as DACA. This program has played a vital role in \nempowering the Nation's undocumented immigrant youth population.\n  Many of these young people were brought to the United States at a \nyoung age, through no fault of their own, and know no other home or \ncountry. They are woven into the fabric of California and this country. \nAt school, they are taught American history, culture, and values. They \nstrive to achieve the American dream.\n  The DACA Program enables such youth to fulfill their potential and \nthus to maximize their contribution to their families, communities, and \nthis country. President Obama announced the DACA Program in June 2012 \nto protect\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\neligible young people from deportation for a 2-year period, while \nCongress considered comprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n  The Senate passed the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and \nImmigration Modernization Act with a strong bipartisan majority, 68 to \n32. This bill would have provided a pathway to citizenship for DACA \ngrantees and others similarly situated. But the House failed to act, \nand so here we are today without comprehensive immigration reform. \nAlthough we have not yet succeeded in fixing our broken immigration \nsystem through congressional action, at least the DACA Program provides \nsome temporary reprieve for these young immigrants so that they do not \nlive in constant fear of deportation.\n  The program enables them to get work authorization, and thus to seek \nhigher education and contribute to the American economy. To qualify, an \nindividual must have come to the United States when they were under 16 \nyears of age and lived in the country continuously for at least 5 \nyears. The individual must also receive an education, pass a background \ncheck, and pay an application fee.\n  The State of California is home to over a quarter of the estimated \n1.8 million young immigrants who potentially meet the criteria of the \nDACA Program. Of the approximately 660,000 DACA applications that have \nbeen approved since the program's inception in 2012, about 30 percent \nreside in California. This is more than any other State. To help those \nwho are eligible, nonprofits, religious organizations, pro bono legal \nnetworks, and other volunteers in California and nationwide have risen \nto the occasion. They have helped, and continue to help, hundreds of \nthousands of DACA applicants to navigate the filing process.\n  The benefits of DACA for these young individuals and for this country \nare undeniable. A recent report published by the University of \nCalifornia, Berkeley School of Law found that 66 percent of students \ngranted DACA noted a positive change in post-graduate plans and greater \nhope for their future. All of the study's participants come from low-\nincome households, with 88 percent living below 150 percent of the \nFederal poverty level. Many students reported that parents could not \nassist them with educational costs; and, in some instances, students \ncontributed a portion of their own earnings to provide for their \nfamilies. Several students had suffered the deportation of a close \nrelative, and over a quarter had a parent or sibling with an active \ncase in immigration court.\n  Imagine the day-to-day stresses of being a college student: trying to \nexcel in the classroom, paying for food and housing, and finding future \nemployment. For these students, they must also consider additional \nfinancial, psychological, and emotional challenges because they--\ndespite spending their lives in this country--are undocumented. The \nDACA Program gives these young people a measure of stability so they \ncan focus on their school work and professional growth and development, \nnot on whether they or a loved one will be deported. The DACA Program \nallows them to do just that and look forward.\n  The economic impacts of the 2012 DACA Program show that the United \nStates has much to gain from enabling eligible undocumented individuals \nto work lawfully within our borders. According to the University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles' North American Integration and Development \nCenter ``The DACA program of 2012-2014 appears to have spurred \nextraordinary growth in the earnings of DACA beneficiaries. According \nto the results of two recent surveys, this wage growth surpassed 240 \npercent, a number that far exceeds the expectations in the \nliterature.''\n  All around the country, this time of year is punctuated by graduation \nceremonies. Parents and grandparents beam as their children and \ngrandchildren earn their high school, college, and graduate degrees. \nThis year, I was one of those grandparents. My granddaughter, Eileen, \ngraduated from Stanford, my alma mater, and I was so proud to attend \nthe ceremony. DACA recipients and their families should have that \nfeeling too--a feeling of hope for the future, accomplishment, and \ngrowth, and they should have it without fear of deportation right \naround the corner. That is what this is about.\n  So I am pleased to commemorate the 3-year anniversary of the DACA \nProgram, and I very much hope we can renew our commitment to passing \ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4542-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.\n  As World War II came to a close, representatives of 50 nations met in \nSan Francisco to sign the United Nations' founding charter, officially \nestablishing an international forum to prevent war, support human \nrights, respect international law, and promote social progress. These \ndelegates hoped the creation of this new organization would prevent \nanother devastating global conflict by addressing diplomatic challenges \nand humanitarian crises around the world.\n  Over the past seven decades, the United Nations has engaged in \npeacekeeping operations throughout the world, with more than 120 \nnations contributing military personnel, police, and civilians to these \nhumanitarian efforts. Although there continue to be areas where armed \nconflict is all too prevalent, I am proud of the many successes \nachieved through this global mission.\n  The United Nations has also played an important role in addressing \nthe needs of the world's most vulnerable populations by promoting \nhealth, nutrition, and education. Through the work of the World Health \nOrganization, the World Food Programme, and many other bodies, the \nUnited Nations has led efforts worldwide to reduce poverty and save \nlives.\n  As United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and leaders from \naround the world gather in San Francisco on June 26 to celebrate the \n70th anniversary of the United Nations Charter, I want to congratulate \nthe United Nations for its incredible achievements and dedicated \ncommitment to fostering consensus, partnership, and unity among the \nnations of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4542-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4542-S4543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NEFFENGER CONFIRMATION\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yesterday I missed Senate rollcall vote No. \n217, the nomination of Peter V. Neffenger, of Ohio, to be an Assistant \nSecretary of Homeland Security, because of flight delay issues due to \nweather. Had I been here, I would have voted in favor of this \nnomination.\n  I support the Senate's confirmation last night of Coast Guard VADM \nPeter V. Neffenger who was confirmed to be the next Administrator of \nthe Transportation Security Administration, TSA.\n  The TSA has been without Senate-confirmed leadership for too long. \nJohn Pistole, the previous TSA Administrator, announced on October 16, \n2014, that he would be resigning in December. Since the end of 2014, \nthe TSA Administrator position has been vacant. In January, I along \nwith Ranking Member Nelson, and Senators Ayotte, Cantwell, and Fischer, \ncalled on President Obama to send us a qualified, experienced, and \ndedicated individual to serve as TSA Administrator. Unfortunately, \nPresident Obama did not nominate Admiral Neffenger until April 28, \n2015, over 6 months after John Pistole informed the administration that \nhe would be leaving. I was disappointed at the length of time it took \nfor the President to send us a qualified nominee. Even the New York \nTimes editorial page, normally quite deferential to the President, \nexpressed the opinion that ``the Obama Administration has been \ndisturbingly slow to give the TSA strong leadership at the top.''\n  By comparison, the Senate has very rapidly moved the Neffenger \nnomination, despite two separate committees being involved with his \nformal vetting. Since the TSA was transferred to the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Senate has abided by an understanding that TSA \nAdministrator nominees would be vetted by the Commerce Committee, which \nhas primary jurisdiction over TSA, and also by the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, which oversees the Department of \nHomeland Security where TSA is organizationally housed. Some could\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nsay that this protocol could lend itself to unnecessary delay. However, \nAdmiral Neffenger received three votes in less than 3 weeks, first by \nthe Commerce Committee on June 4, 2015, the second one on June 15, \n2015, by the Homeland Security Committee, and last night when he was \nconfirmed by a vote of 81 to 1. So the Senate has moved swiftly to \nconfirm this important nomination, in comparison to the time the Obama \nadministration has taken to send the Senate a qualified nominee.\n  While I am disappointed at the length of time it took for the \nPresident to send the Senate a qualified nominee, I applaud the \nPresident's selection of Admiral Neffenger to be the next TSA \nAdministrator. Admiral Neffenger has served ably and well for 34 years \nin the U.S. Coast Guard, rising through the ranks to become the Vice \nCommandant when the Senate confirmed him last year for that \ndistinguished position.\n  During an assignment to Mobile, AL, he helped to lead the multi-\nagency response to the 1993 Amtrak Sunset Limited train derailment into \na remote waterway in the Mobile River Delta, which killed 47 people. \nAdmiral Neffenger also has substantial experience serving right here in \nthe Senate, having been a Coast Guard fellow and detailee for 3 years \nat the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  Admiral Neffenger also served as Deputy National Incident Commander \nfor the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. In that role, Admiral Neffenger \ncoordinated and led over 50,000 people from Federal, State, and local \nagencies, tribal representatives, non-governmental organizations, and \nthe private sector throughout five Gulf Coast States in the clean-up \nand response effort. Clearly, Admiral Neffenger has the requisite \nbackground and experience to lead reforms at the TSA.\n  Admiral Neffenger has proven himself as a leader, and the TSA is an \nagency in dire need of strong, capable leadership. In May, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's Inspector General testified in the \nHouse of Representatives that, ``[u]nfortunately, although nearly 14 \nyears have passed since TSA's inception, we remain deeply concerned \nabout its ability to execute its important mission.'' Then, earlier \nthis month, news broke that undercover investigators from the Inspector \nGeneral's office had penetrated TSA security checkpoints while carrying \nillegal weapons or simulated bombs on 67 of 70 attempts. In other \nwords, TSA failed 95 percent of the time to prevent illegal weapons or \nsimulated bombs from being smuggled through TSA security checkpoints. \nThis is unacceptable, and it is clear that the Inspector General is \nright to be concerned about TSA's ability to execute its important \nmission in a rapidly changing threat environment.\n  TSA has also experienced a number of other troubling failures about \nwhich I have written to the agency. I have been concerned about the \nTSA's oversight of Secure Identification Display Area, SIDA, badges at \nthe Nation's airports. In December 2014, it was revealed that a Delta \nramp agent in Atlanta allegedly used his SIDA badge to bypass TSA \nsecurity and facilitate an interstate gun smuggling operation via \ncommercial aircraft. TSA's response to my letter of inquiry about its \noversight of SIDA badges stated that TSA does not issue or manage SIDA \nbadges and that this responsibility falls to airport operators--which \nraised even more concerns about TSA's awareness about lost SIDA badges \nat our Nation's airports.\n  Another issue I have raised with TSA relates to the potential \nsecurity gaps in its PreCheck initiative raised in reports by the \ninspector general. On January 28, 2015, the inspector general released \nan unclassified summary of a classified report concluding that PreCheck \nis a positive step towards risk-based security screening as a concept, \nbut that TSA needs to modify its PreCheck vetting and screening \nprocesses and improve its PreCheck communication and coordination. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General report \nalso stated that, ``TSA did not concur with all recommendations and all \nrecommendations remain open.''\n  In response to the conclusions and recommendations, I wrote to TSA \nalong with Ranking Member Nelson on March 25, 2015, asking a series of \nquestions about potential security gaps in TSA PreCheck. TSA responded \nto this letter on April 14, 2015, but the issue of potential security \ngaps in PreCheck and other expedited screening initiatives must still \nbe addressed as TSA seeks to continue these initiatives, let alone \nexpand them.\n  Admiral Neffenger's proven leadership throughout the course of his \nservice in the U.S. Coast Guard will undoubtedly afford valuable \nperspective in his role as TSA Administrator. Admiral Neffenger \nunderstands the need for TSA to continuously evolve to meet the \nchallenges presented by an ever-changing threat environment. Obviously, \nthe TSA is an agency that needs a strong leader who will bring cultural \nchange to the agency. I am hopeful that Admiral Neffenger can be a \nleader who can fundamentally reform the TSA. He has a heavy burden, but \nI believe he is capable of shouldering that burden and I pledge to work \nwith him and my colleagues here in the Senate to see that those changes \noccur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4543-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE VOLUNTEERS\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the work \nof 12 power linemen from nine electric cooperatives in Arkansas for \ntheir work to bring reliable electricity to citizens in Guatemala.\n  The Arkansas linemen dedicated more than 2 weeks to completely change \nthe lives of more than 1,390 residents in 2 villages in rural \nGuatemala--Jolom I'Jix and Zapotal. Through construction activities \nsuch as installation of poles, distribution transformers, household \nconnections, and meters, these volunteers extended the electric \ndistribution system 4 miles, connecting homes to an electric grid \npowered by a small hydroelectric plant.\n  Since 2013, Electric Cooperatives of Arkansas volunteers have worked \nto improve the lives of Guatemalans by providing electricity. The \nsignificance of this project stretches to impact numerous aspects of \ndaily life for these residents. Electricity is a critical element in \nimproving the quality of life and to providing health care, education, \naccess to clean water, and economic growth. Equipped with this newfound \nsource of electricity, hope for a brighter future exists for \nsubsistence farmers whose main worry is simply providing food for their \nfamily.\n  This effort, funded by participating co-ops and supporters in \nArkansas, continues the State's storied history of making an impact. By \nbeing a beacon of good for these villagers, the linemen were able to \nengrave a lasting impact, which will help future generations of \nGuatemalans.\n  I offer my sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to make a \ndifference for those who are truly in need.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise on behalf of the Delaware Delegation to honor the exemplary \nservice of Alan Levin, director of the Delaware Economic Development \nOffice, upon his retirement. Alan became director in January 2009 and \ncontinued to serve with distinction in that capacity for 6 years. He \nassumed that position at a time when tens of thousands of Delawareans \nwere losing their jobs, and the State's top priority was putting them \nback to work. Throughout this tumultuous time, he has been a tremendous \nleader and true advocate for the State.\n  Alan has a lifetime of experience when it comes to knowing what it \ntakes to make a business successful. In 1987, he took over Delaware's \nhomegrown pharmacy chain Happy Harry's, the business his father \nstarted, and grew it to become an iconic brand with 76 stores \nthroughout the state. Prior to taking over the family business, he \nworked for United States Senator Bill Roth as his executive assistant \nand counsel. He is a graduate of Tulane\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\nUniversity and Widener University Law School.\n  When Delaware Governor Jack Markell tapped him to head the Delaware \nEconomic Development Office, unemployment in Delaware was soaring. The \nState's automotive plants were shuttering, and the State's major oil \nrefinery announced plans to idle operations. Alan got straight to work, \nand over the next 6 years, the Delaware Economic Development Office \nawarded more than $213 million in job creation grants and loans to \ncorporations through its strategic fund, and courted big firms such as \nAmazon, Barclays, Capitol One, JP Morgan Chase, Kraft Foods, Purdue and \nSallie Mae to expand its current operations or relocate to Delaware. \nAlan was also instrumental in reopening the shuttered Delaware City Oil \nRefinery, putting hundreds of people back to work at one of the State's \nmost significant industrial sites.\n  Alan has been lauded as a bold risk-taker whose experience and \ninnovative planning has helped Delaware have the fastest job growth in \nthe Mid-Atlantic over the last 2 years. He can also be credited with \nhelping to level the playing field for minority, women, and veteran \nbusiness owners, as well as those with disabilities. On behalf of \nSenator Chris Coons and Congressman John Carney, I wholeheartedly thank \nAlan Levin for his service to the State of Delaware. His model \nleadership and dedication has improved the quality of life for \ncountless residents and businesses in our great State. We offer our \nsincere congratulations on a job well done, and wish him and his wife \nEllen, their children Andrew, Daniel and Jason, and their granddaughter \nHannah, many happy, healthy and successful years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4544-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO DETECTIVE CORPORAL MARK W.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ncreate a sustainable future for rural healthcare; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a \nbill I am introducing, the Rural Emergency Acute Care Hospital Act, or \nREACH Act.\n  Since January 2010, 55 rural hospitals have closed their doors. It is \neven more troubling that the pace of rural hospital closures appears to \nbe accelerating.\n  As you can see from this chart, the number of hospital closures has \nincreased each year over the past 5 years. These closures are creating \na health care crisis for hundreds of thousands of Americans across the \ncountry.\n  The REACH Act will create a new rural hospital model under Medicare \nthat will enable struggling rural hospitals to keep their doors open \nand maintain the most critical hospital service: emergency medicine.\n  When a rural hospital closes, the community loses the lifesaving \ncapabilities of the emergency room. According to the National \nConference of State Legislatures, 60 percent of trauma deaths in the \nUnited States occur in rural areas. After a traumatic event, access to \nan emergency room within 1\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nhour can make a big difference between life and death.\n  Take, for example, Portia Gibbs from North Carolina. At 48, Portia \nsuffered a heart attack 75 miles from the nearest emergency room. She \nlater died while waiting for a helicopter to arrive that would have \ntaken her over the State line to Virginia, where the closest hospital \nwas located. If Portia's heart attack had occurred just 1 week earlier, \nPortia would have been transported to a hospital in Belhaven, NC, just \n30 miles away. Unfortunately, the facility in Belhaven had closed just \n6 days before Portia's heart attack, citing insurmountable financial \nstruggles.\n  Then there is the tragic story of 18-month-old Edith Gonzalez who \nchoked on a grape in her hometown of Center, TX. Edith's frantic \nparents rushed her to their local hospital, Shelby Regional Medical \nCenter, only to discover that it had closed just weeks earlier. By the \ntime little Edith arrived at the next closest hospital, she had passed \naway.\n  While we can't say with certainty that both Edith and Portia would \nhave survived if their local hospitals had not closed, we know the \nearlier people access care, the better their chances are.\n  The term used by emergency medical practitioners is the ``golden \nhour.'' The golden hour is the hour following a traumatic event when \nlifesaving intervention--like that which can be provided in an \nemergency room--has the best chance of impacting survival. In other \nwords, the longer a patient has to wait to receive emergency medical \ncare, the lower their chances will be for survival.\n  Rural hospital closures mean patients have to travel longer distances \nto access emergency medical care. Ensuring that rural communities keep \ntheir emergency care resources could make the difference between life \nand death. Rural hospital closures also extend beyond the loss of \nemergency services to include economic consequences for rural \ncommunities. Hospital closures can mean the death of a rural community. \nApproximately 62 million Americans live in rural areas. Rural \ncommunities play an integral role in the economic stability of this \ncountry through their invaluable contributions in food production, \nmanufacturing, and other vital industries.\n  In addition to supporting the medical needs of those who participate \nin rural industry, rural hospitals also serve as the single largest \nemployer in a rural community. The economic impacts of closing a \nhospital when no other hospital is close by are devastating. If we care \nabout the physical and economic health of rural communities, we must \nmake a change that will reverse the trend of accumulating rural \nhospital closures.\n  iVantage Analytics compiled a report for the National Rural Health \nAssociation which identified 283 additional hospitals at risk of \nclosure based upon performance indicators that matched those of the 53 \nfacilities that already closed.\n  Allow me to direct the Presiding Officer's attention to this map. \nThis map depicts the approximate locations of 53 of the 55 hospitals \nthat have closed in the last 5 years.\n  I would like to point out that between the printing of this chart and \ntoday, two additional rural hospitals have closed. That alone is a \nclear indication of the problem I am trying to convey.\n  Now, imagine this same map depicting five times the number of \nhospital closures you see here. That is what is what will happen if we \ndo not act to protect America's rural hospitals. Furthermore, the loss \nof those additional hospitals would not only impact local economies but \nwould also result in a $10.6 billion loss in GDP. It must change, not \nonly for the health of rural Americans but also for the health and \nstability of our economy.\n  Payment cuts to hospitals are one contributing factor to rural \nhospital closures. More significant, however, is the current Medicare \npayment structure that supports rural hospitals. Today, the Medicare \npayment structure for hospitals is focused on inpatient volume. \nEmergency rooms act as a loss leader, and income is primary generated \nthrough inpatient stays.\n  A RAND study published in 2013 found that the average cost of an \ninpatient stay is 10 times the cost of an emergency room visit. \nResearchers at the University of North Carolina found that many of the \nat-risk rural hospitals around the country have an average of two or \nfewer patients admitted to a hospital on any given day. These hospitals \ncan have up to 25 inpatient beds, and if only 2 or fewer of those beds \nare filled every day, that is a utilization rate of 8 percent or less.\n  Instead of letting these facilities close because they do not have \nthe needed inpatient volume to generate enough revenue, why not let go \nof the underutilized inpatient services in favor of sustaining life-\nsaving emergency care. That is what the REACH Act does. It provides a \nvoluntary pathway for rural hospitals to eliminate their underutilized \ninpatient services and ensure residents have access to emergency \nmedical care that saves lives. A key component of the bill that allows \nthe rural emergency hospital model to function is the requirement for \nthese facilities to have protocols in place for the timely transfer of \npatients who require a higher level of care or inpatient admission.\n  The value of the rural emergency hospitals in the case of a life-\nthreatening emergency will be their ability to administer lifesaving \nmeasures in order to stabilize a patient before they are transferred to \na higher level of care.\n  In addition to providing lifesaving emergency care, rural emergency \nhospitals will have the flexibility to provide a wide array of \noutpatient services, including observation care, skilled nursing \nfacility care, infusion services, hemodialysis, home health, hospice, \nnursing home care, population health, as well as telemedicine services. \nThis list is not all-inclusive but is just a sample of the outpatient \nservices rural emergency hospitals could provide to their communities. \nThe door is left open for rural emergency hospitals to design their \noutpatient services to match the needs of their communities.\n  There are roughly 1,300 critical access hospitals in America, \nincluding 82 in Iowa, the second most just behind Kansas. I am not \nsuggesting that 1,300 critical access hospitals will become rural \nemergency hospitals. Some hospitals may never consider giving up their \ninpatient beds, others may consider it in the future, but some critical \naccess hospitals need this or something like it right now.\n  The rural emergency hospital model, with its outpatient and emergency \ncare services, will be good for the health of rural communities and our \nNation because of the critical care it will provide when and where \nrural Americans need it. When there is a farm accident in the afternoon \nor a heart attack in the middle of the night, that emergency room can \nbe the difference between life and death. Medicare needs a payment \npolicy that recognizes that simple fact.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my cosponsor Senator \nGardner, other colleagues, and stakeholders in building a sustainable \nfuture for rural health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, \n        Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Reed, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Franken, Mr. Udall, and Mr. Heller):\n  S. 1651. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the Government pension offset and windfall elimination \nprovisions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to address America's \nretirement savings crisis. A 2013 survey conducted by the Governors of \nthe Federal Reserve System found that roughly 31 percent of Americans \nhave no retirement savings or access to a defined-benefit pension. In \naddition, 19 percent of respondents nearing retirement--those aged 55 \nto 64--reported having zero savings or pension to rely on in the coming \nyears.\n  In light of these figures it is more important than ever that \nCongress ensure America's seniors have access to the Social Security \nbenefits they have earned. Yet provisions such as the Windfall \nElimination Provision, WEP, and the Government Pension Offset, GPO, \nprevent millions of Americans--including teachers, firefighters, and \npolice officers--from receiving their full benefits. It is time \nCongress repealed them.\n  This afternoon, I, along with Senator Collins and a number of my \nSenate colleagues from both sides of the aisle,\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\nintroduced the Social Security Fairness Act. This bipartisan bill will \nrepeal both the WEP and GPO provisions which Congress enacted in 1983 \nand 1977, respectively. In December 2014, these unfair provisions \nchipped away at more than 2 million Americans' Social Security \nbenefits. That same month, in my State of Ohio, more than 200,000 \nOhioans had their Social Security benefits reduced because of these \nprovisions.\n  Over the past 35 years, fewer and fewer workers have been given \naccess to defined-benefit plans, and, today, only about half of the \ntotal U.S. workforce is covered by an employer-sponsored retirement \nplan. That is why Social Security is critical for so many. Congress \nshould make sure that every American has access to all the Social \nSecurity benefits he or she has earned. Repealing these provisions is \nan important step in that direction.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in repealing the WEP and GPO by \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Social Security \nFairness Act of 2015, which I am joining my colleague from Ohio in \nintroducing today. This bill would repeal both the windfall elimination \nprovision, WEP, and the government pension offset, GPO. We believe that \nthese two provisions in the Social Security Act unfairly penalize \ncertain individuals for holding jobs in public service when the time \ncomes for them to retire.\n  The WEP affects individuals who have worked in both the private \nsector and in public sector jobs for which Social Security taxes were \nnot withheld. For such individuals, the WEP applies a special formula \nto calculate benefits, reducing them compared to what would otherwise \nbe paid.\n  The GPO affects retired public employees whose spouses are entitled \nto Social Security benefits. When these individuals apply for Social \nSecurity spousal or survivor benefits, the GPO applies an offset, \nreducing the Social Security benefit based on the amount of that \nindividual's public pension. In some cases, the spouse will not be \nentitled to any spousal or survivor benefit because of the GPO.\n  The WEP and the GPO have enormous financial implications for many of \nour teachers, police officers, firefighters, postal workers and other \npublic employees. Given their important responsibilities, it is simply \nunfair to penalize them when it comes to their Social Security \nbenefits. These public servants--or their spouses--have all paid taxes \ninto the Social Security system. So have their employers. They have \nworked long enough to earn their Social Security benefits. Yet, because \nof the GPO and WEP, they are unable to receive all of the Social \nSecurity benefits to which they otherwise would be entitled.\n  The impact of these two provisions is most acute in 15 States, \nincluding Maine, which have state retirement plans that lack a Social \nSecurity component. However, it is important to point out that the GPO \nand WEP affect public employees and retirees in every state, including \nour emergency responders, other Federal employees, and postal workers. \nNationwide, more than \\1/3\\ of teachers and educating employees, and \nmore than \\1/5\\ of other public employees, are affected by the GPO and/\nor the WEP.\n  As of 2013, one and a half million people were affected by the WEP \nand 615,000 people had their benefits reduced by the GPO. Many more \npublic employees across the country stand to be harmed in the future. \nMoreover, at a time when we should be doing all that we can to attract \nqualified people to public service, this reduction in retirement \nbenefits makes it even more difficult for our federal, state and local \ngovernments to recruit and retain the public servants who are so \ncritical to the safety and well-being of our families.\n  What is most troubling is that this offset is most harsh for those \nwho can least afford the loss: lower-income women. In fact, of those \naffected by the GPO, more than 80 percent are women. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the GPO reduces benefits for more than \n200,000 individuals by more than $3,600 a year--an amount that can make \nthe difference between a comfortable retirement and poverty.\n  Many Maine teachers, in particular, have talked with me about the \nimpact of these provisions on their retirement security. They love \ntheir jobs and the children they teach, but they worry about the future \nand about their financial security.\n  Roxie Brechlin of Bar Harbor, Maine, is one of many examples of the \neffect that the GPO and the WEP have on our teachers when they retire. \nMrs. Brechlin first began paying into Social Security when she took her \nfirst summer job at age 16. After graduation, she continued to pay into \nSocial Security for 18 more years before getting her first teaching \njob. Mrs. Brechlin worked as a teacher for 23 years, and for 14 of \nthose years she worked full-time at another job during the summer, \npaying more and more into Social Security each year.\n  Mr. Brechlin recently contacted my office to explain the effect that \nthe WEP and GPO will have on his wife. Mrs. Brechlin recently retired. \nWhen she applied for Social Security benefits, the WEP applied, and her \nbenefit was reduced by two thirds. Mr. Brechlin is more concerned about \nwhat would happen to his wife if he were to predecease her. Normally, a \nwidow would be eligible to continue to collect 100 percent of her \nhusband's benefit. Mrs. Brechlin, however, would not be able to collect \nany survivor benefit, due to the application of the GPO. Not only does \nthis fact worry Mr. Brechlin, he also sees it as unfair.\n  It is time for us to take action, and I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin us in cosponsoring the Social Security Fairness Act to eliminate \nthese two unfair provisions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Markey, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1654. A bill to prevent deaths occurring from drug overdoses; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, in an effort to decrease the rate of \ndrug overdose deaths, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Durbin, \nWhitehouse, Markey, and Leahy in introducing the Overdose Prevention \nAct. Representative Donna Edwards is introducing this bill in the other \nbody.\n  Throughout the country, the death rate from drug overdoses has been \nrapidly climbing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, drug overdose death rates have more than tripled since \n1990, and more than 110 Americans died each day from drug overdoses in \n2011. More than half of these deaths are attributable to opioids, like \nprescription pain relievers or heroin. Indeed, this tragic epidemic has \nhit particularly hard in my home state of Rhode Island, where in 2014, \n239 individuals died from drug overdoses.\n  Americans aged 25 to 64 are now more likely to die as a result of \ndrug overdose than from injuries sustained in motor vehicle traffic \ncrashes. While overdoses from illegal drugs persist as a major public \nhealth problem, fatal overdoses from prescribed opioid pain medications \nsuch as oxycodone account for more than 40 percent of all overdose \ndeaths.\n  It is clear that we must do more to stop these often preventable \ndeaths. Fortunately, the drug naloxone, which has no side effects and \nno potential for abuse, is widely recognized as an important tool to \nhelp prevent drug overdose deaths. Naloxone can rapidly reverse an \noverdose from heroin and opioid medications if provided in a timely \nmanner. Overdose prevention programs, including those that utilize \nnaloxone, have been credited with saving more than 26,000 lives since \n1996, according to the CDC.\n  Opioid abuse and overdose is not an abstract threat found in far-off \ncorners. It is a national public health crisis and it's taking place \nright here at home in our communities and our neighborhoods.\n  Rhode Island is taking steps to combat this scourge and is leading \nthe way in adopting innovative solutions. Through a ``collaborative \npractice agreement,'' some Rhode Island pharmacies are dispensing \nnaloxone, along with training about its proper use, to anyone who walks \nin and requests the treatment, no prescription necessary. In addition, \nthe Rhode Island State Police carry naloxone in every cruiser.\n  The Overdose Prevention Act, which we are introducing today, would \ncomplement these efforts and take important steps towards addressing \nthis\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nissue nationally and increasing access to naloxone in our communities. \nThe legislation aims to establish a comprehensive response to this \nepidemic that emphasizes collaboration between state and federal \nofficials and employs best practices from the medical community, as \nwell as programs and treatments that have been proven effective to \ncombat this startling national trend. This is an emergency and it \nrequires a coordinated and comprehensive response.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS, to award funding through cooperative \nagreements to eligible entities--like public health agencies or \ncommunity-based organizations with expertise in preventing overdose \ndeaths. As a condition of participation, an entity would use the grant \nto purchase and distribute naloxone, and carry out overdose prevention \nactivities, such as educating and training prescribers, pharmacists, \nand first responders on how to recognize the signs of an overdose, seek \nemergency medical help, and administer naloxone and other first aid.\n  As rates of overdose deaths continue to spike, public health \nagencies, law enforcement, and others are struggling to keep up without \nclear and timely information about the epidemic. Therefore, the \nOverdose Prevention Act would also require HHS to take steps to improve \nsurveillance and research of drug overdose deaths, so that public \nhealth agencies, law enforcement, and community organizations have an \naccurate picture of the problem.\n  It would also establish a coordinated federal plan of action to \naddress this epidemic. The Overdose Prevention Act seeks to bring \ntogether first responders, medical personnel, addiction treatment \nspecialists, social service providers, and families to help save lives \nand get at the root of this problem.\n  I am pleased that the Overdose Prevention Act has the support of the \nAmerican Association of Poison Control Centers, the Drug Policy \nAlliance, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and the Trust for America's \nHealth. I look forward to working with these and other stakeholders, as \nwell as our cosponsors to urge the rest of our colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this crucial legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4549-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 208--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nREQUESTED RELEASE OF CONVICTED TERRORIST JUVENAL OVIDIO RICARDO PALMERA \n  PINEDA, ALSO KNOWN AS ``SIMON TRINIDAD'', FROM PRISON IN THE UNITED \n            STATES AS A PART OF THE COLOMBIAN PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. RUBIO submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 209\n\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant was born in southern Ohio on April \n     27, 1822, to Jesse Grant and Hannah Simpson Grant;\n       Whereas the first line of the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant \n     proudly states: ``My Family is American, and has been for \n     generations, in all its branches, direct and collateral.'';\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant attended school in Georgetown, \n     Ohio, graduated from the United States Military Academy in \n     1843, and entered the United States Army;\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant served in a variety of military \n     posts from the Atlantic Coast to the Pacific Coast, including \n     posts in New York, Michigan, and California, and a post at \n     the famous Jefferson Barracks in Missouri;\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant distinguished himself in combat \n     during the Mexican-American War and worked tirelessly to \n     succeed in civilian life;\n       Whereas, as a civilian farmer in Missouri, Ulysses S. \n     Grant--\n       (1) met and married his wife, Julia Dent, for whom Ulysses \n     S. Grant built a home named Hardscrabble;\n       (2) worked alongside slaves and emancipated the only slave \n     that Ulysses S. Grant owned; and\n       (3) continued to own land while Ulysses S. Grant was \n     President;\n       Whereas when the Civil War erupted, Ulysses S. Grant left \n     Galena, Illinois to rejoin the United States Army, gained the \n     colonelcy of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Regiment, and began \n     his meteoric military rise;\n       Whereas during the Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant led troops \n     in numerous victorious battles including--\n       (1) in Tennessee, at Forts Henry and Donelson and at Shiloh \n     and Chattanooga; and\n       (2) in Mississippi, at Vicksburg;\n       Whereas President Abraham Lincoln chose Ulysses S. Grant to \n     be Commanding General during the Civil War, and in that role \n     Ulysses S. Grant revolutionized warfare in Virginia to \n     preserve the Union;\n       Whereas in gratitude, the people of the United States twice \n     elected Ulysses S. Grant President of the United States;\n       Whereas during his Presidency from 1869 to 1877, Ulysses S. \n     Grant worked valiantly to help former slaves become full \n     citizens and some prominent historians consider him to be the \n     first modern President of the United States;\n       Whereas after leaving the Presidency, Ulysses S. Grant \n     became the first President of the United States to tour the \n     world;\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant established a foreign policy that \n     the United States followed into the 20th century and beyond;\n       Whereas Ulysses S. Grant authored his memoirs, a \n     significant piece of 19th-century nonfiction, while \n     courageously battling cancer, which eventually took his voice \n     and his life but did not silence the noble words that he left \n     as a legacy;\n       Whereas the Ulysses S. Grant Association was founded during \n     the Centennial of the Civil War in 1962 by the leading \n     historians of that era and the Civil War Centennial \n     Commissions of New York, Illinois, and Ohio, 3 States where \n     Ulysses S. Grant lived;\n       Whereas, in the years since it was founded in 1962, the \n     Ulysses S. Grant Association--\n       (1) has produced 32 volumes of ``The Papers of Ulysses S. \n     Grant'', the major source for the study of the life of \n     Ulysses S. Grant and the 19th century in which he lived; and\n       (2) has worked toward the publication of the first \n     scholarly edition of the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant, which \n     as of May 2015, is nearing completion;\n       Whereas the Ulysses S. Grant Association was first \n     headquartered at the Ohio Historical Society located on the \n     campus of Ohio State University, later moved to Southern \n     Illinois University, and relocated in 2008 to Mississippi \n     State University; and\n       Whereas in 2012, the Ulysses S. Grant Association \n     established the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library, the \n     world center for Ulysses S. Grant scholars and tourists: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses support for the bicentennial celebration of \n     the birth of Ulysses S. Grant, military leader and President;\n       (2) designates the Ulysses S. Grant Association, housed at \n     the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library on the grounds of \n     Mississippi State University, as the designated institution \n     for organizing and leading the celebration of the \n     bicentennial; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to join in \n     that bicentennial celebration to honor Ulysses S. Grant, one \n     of the major historical figures of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/senate-section/article/S4550-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 210--CELEBRATING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STATE \n                               OF WYOMING\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Barrasso) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
