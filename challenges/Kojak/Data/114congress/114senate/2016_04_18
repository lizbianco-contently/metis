Mr. President, Americans continue to see the \ndifference a Republican-led Senate can make on behalf of our country. \nWe have passed legislation to combat the prescription opioid and heroin \nepidemic, to provide a long-term highway funding solution, and to \nadvance many other important issues.\n  Today I am hopeful we will be able to add to that record of \nachievement with the FAA reauthorization and airport security bill, \nwhich aims to keep Americans safe in our airports and in the skies. \nRecent terror attacks across the world emphasize the importance of \nensuring our airports are secure, and I am pleased the bill includes a \nnumber of provisions that will help to do so. From increasing security \nin prescreening areas to securing international flights arriving in the \nUnited States, to ramping up measures aimed at deterring cyber security \nattacks, this legislation contains the most comprehensive aviation \nsecurity reforms in years.\n  It also includes a number of passenger-friendly provisions such as \nrefunds for lost or delayed bags and efforts to improve travel for \nthose with disabilities. The bill accomplishes all this without raising \nfees or taxes on passengers and without imposing heavy-handed \nregulations that threaten consumer choice.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill is the product of hard work and \ndeliberation from Members on both sides of the aisle. It wouldn't have \nbeen possible without the leadership of Senator Thune, our Commerce \nCommittee chair, and Senator Ayotte, the Aviation Subcommittee chair. \nThey worked to consider amendments from both Republicans and Democrats \nthat Members thought would make this good bill an even better one. I \nalso thank their ranking member counterparts, Senator Nelson and \nSenator Cantwell, for their efforts to advance this legislation.\n  Let's continue that bipartisan progress today and move the FAA \nreauthorization and airport security bill across the finish line. It is \na win for passengers. It is a win for national security. It is another \nexample of commonsense legislating under Republican leadership that is \ngetting the Senate back to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2109-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The \nSenate Republicans are like the guy who shows up only half the time for \nwork and then asks for a raise. They go through the motions, but they \nfail to do their job.\n  They failed to fund opioid legislation. They failed to do anything \nabout the water in Flint, MI. They failed to fix what everyone agrees \nwas an error on the renewable tax credits. They have failed to address \nthe Zika virus and on and on.\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\n  Republicans used to complain all the time about meeting deadlines for \ndoing the budget resolution, but this year they just aren't doing one. \nEven district court nominations supported by Republicans seem too hard \nfor this group to accomplish.

Mr. President, the Senate Republicans are making history \nbut for all the wrong reasons. The Republicans' obstruction of \nPresident Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, is the first \nof its kind in Senate history. Never before has the Senate \ncategorically refused to consider a Supreme Court nominee solely \nbecause the vacancy occurred during an election year. As each day \npasses, the Republicans set some new mark for gridlock.\n  For example, in the post-World War II era, the average time between a \nSupreme Court nomination and the nominee's first hearing was 29 days. \nToday is the 33rd day since Merrick Garland's name was put forward by \nPresident Obama. Already we are 5 days past the average.\n  The longest a nominee has been forced to wait for a hearing was 82 \ndays. That was President Eisenhower's nominee, Potter Stewart, who was \nconfirmed at a later time. Republicans vow every day that there will be \nno hearing. So they are well on their way to eclipsing the 82-day mark.\n  While that achievement may earn the Republicans a slap on the back \nfrom the Koch brothers and Senator McConnell--who, by the way, is the \nproud ``guardian of gridlock,'' as he says--Americans take no pleasure \nin this record-setting obstruction. Instead, Americans want Republicans \nin the Senate to do their job and give Merrick Garland a hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2110-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been almost 3 years since the Senate \npassed comprehensive immigration reform. Senate Democrats worked with a \nhandful of Republicans to craft a good, fair, comprehensive immigration \nreform bill that passed with strong bipartisan support. Then we watched \nas Speaker Boehner capitulated to the tea party radicals and refused to \nallow a vote on the floor. It would have passed overwhelmingly.\n  To his credit, President Obama saw Republicans' inertia on \nimmigration reform and decided to act. He told us in his State of the \nUnion Address that he was tired of waiting around for Republicans to do \nthings, so he had to do it himself, and that is what he has done.\n  Using his Executive authority under existing law, he worked to fix \nthe system to prioritize enforcement resources on those who actually \npose a threat to our national security and public safety. On November \n20, 2014, President Obama ordered a series of Executive actions that \nincreased border security and ensured greater accountability throughout \nour immigration system.\n  One aspect of President Obama's Executive actions was the Deferred \nAction for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents Program. \nThe program provided temporary deportation relief for parents of U.S. \ncitizens and lawful permanent residents, if they meet three basic \nrequirements. No. 1, they have to be in the country for at least 5 \nyears; No. 2, they must register with the government; and No. 3, they \nmust pass a criminal background check. Today, there are over 5 million \nchildren--all U.S. citizens--who are eligible for this program.\n  President Obama also expanded the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrival Program, helping to protect DREAMers, the undocumented children \nwho were brought to the United States at a very young age. To date, \nover 700,000 DREAMers have been protected--12,000 in Nevada alone. Not \nonly were these Executive actions the right thing to do, they were also \nsmart investments. Nevada will benefit from about a $3.5 million-a-year \nincrease in State and local tax revenues. Nevadans will see an increase \nin earnings of more than $1 billion over 10 years. Together these \nprograms will help grow America by $230 billion over the next 10 years, \nbut now this progress is being threatened.\n  Shortly after President Obama's announcement, a politically motivated \nlawsuit was filed by the Texas attorney general and joined by \nRepublican Governors and attorneys--not all of them but a lot of them. \nThe Texas attorney general won a preliminary injunction temporarily \nblocking both programs. This came from a single judge.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider the case and today it heard \noral arguments. They were good. I thought it was an extremely sound, \ndeliberate argument. I think the Justices--most of them--had questions \nthat went to the heart of what the issues are, standing and other \nthings. A decision to overturn the President's actions would put many \nfamilies with U.S. citizen children at risk of deportation and prevent \nthe Department of Homeland Security from doing its job of focusing on \ncriminals and other threats to national security and public safety.\n  In Nevada alone, President Obama's Executive actions stand to help \n50,000 people. Those are 50,000 Nevadans who should not be separated \nfrom their families.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court must do the right thing and recognize \nPresident Obama's authority. That is why I joined 38 other Senate \nDemocrats and 186 House Democrats in filing an amicus brief with the \nSupreme Court, making clear that Congress granted the Department of \nHomeland Security broad discretion in enforcing our country's \nimmigration laws. What the President did was both lawful and it was \nnecessary. He helped target limited enforcement resources. It is also \nwhat every other President since Eisenhower has done, including Ronald \nReagan and George H.W. Bush. Instead of litigating the President's \nlawful actions, Republicans should work to fix the immigration system \nin Congress. By working with Democrats to pass immigration reform, they \nwould render the President's Executive actions unnecessary.\n  I hope the Supreme Court decides in the administration's favor. I \nthink they will, even though the Court is short a member. I hope these \nExecutive orders are implemented to bring hard-working families out of \nthe shadows, but our Nation would be far better off with a permanent \nsolution. Our Nation would be far better off with a bipartisan, \ncomprehensive overhaul of our Nation's immigration laws.\n  My friend the assistant minority leader has been at the forefront of \nthese immigration issues. The DREAM Act is something he put forward 15 \nyears ago. I admire the work he has done on this. I think he has kept \nthis issue alive, when a lot of Republicans wanted it to go away. He \nhas been helpful to the people of Nevada--people who don't know his \nname and will never ever see him, but we have 12,000 DREAMers whose \nlives have been changed forever, and we hope the same will happen to \ntheir parents.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2110-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me first thank the minority leader, \nSenator Reid, for his kind words about the DREAM Act, which I \nintroduced 15 years ago.\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\n  This was a piece of legislation that came about because a mother \ncalled my office in Chicago. Here was her family story.\n  She brought her two kids to America from Brazil. They actually \nstarted off in Korea, but they came through Brazil and came to \nChicago--mother, father, and two kids. The father had the ambition of \nstarting a church. There are a lot of Korean churches around Chicago \nand around the country, and his dream was to start a Korean-American \nChurch. His dream never came true. He continued to pray and read the \nBible, but he didn't work much. It was up to mom to go to work.\n  She went to work in a dry-cleaning establishment in Chicago. If you \nhave been around the great city I am honored to represent and go into a \ndry cleaners, most of the time Korean families are running them. They \nare working around-the-clock, and are the hardest working people \nimaginable.\n  Mom went to work in the dry cleaners and the kids struggled because \nthere wasn't much money coming in. One of their girls, Tereza, heard \nabout a program in Chicago called the MERIT Music Program. It is a \nprogram that is available for low-income families of kids in public \nschools. The lady who left the money for it said to give them \ninstruction in musical instruments and help them buy the instruments.\n  Tereza Lee heard about this when she was a little girl and decided to \nsign up for it and to practice the piano. Well, guess what. She turned \nout to be a prodigy. She was amazing. For her the MERIT Music Program \nwas like an opening to another part of the world she had never seen. \nShe participated in recitals. Sometimes they told me they had to give \nher a key to the Merit music offices because she wanted to stay and \npractice until late at night. It was tough for her getting through high \nschool. She tells the story, when she was interviewed in the local \npress, that sometimes she didn't have a lunch to take to school or any \nmoney to buy food. She would wait until the other kids left, and she \nwould go through the wastebasket and look for food they had left \nbehind. That is how tough it was. But because of her skill at playing \nthe piano, she was given an opportunity. She was accepted into the \nJuilliard School for music in New York and at the Manhattan School of \nMusic conservatory to pursue the piano. She was that good.\n\n  When she and her mom started filling out the application, they \nreached that point where it said this: What is your nationality? What \nis your citizenship?\n  Her mom said: Tereza, I don't know. We came here on a visitor's visa \nway back when you were 2 years old, but I never filed any papers for \nyou.\n  She said: Mom, what are we going to do?\n  Her mom said: We are going to call Durbin's office.\n  So they called the Senate office. We looked into it. The law in the \nUnited States was very clear for 17-year-old Tereza Lee. She had to \nleave the United States for 10 years and apply to come back in--leave \nfor 10 years. She came here at the age of 2. She did not do anything \nwrong.\n  She did everything right. She finished high school, against the odds. \nShe developed a talent, against the odds. She was accepted at one of \nthe best music schools in America, and our law very clearly said: \nLeave; we don't want you. If you want to try to come back in 10 years, \nthat is your business.\n  I don't think that is right. That is why 15 years ago I introduced \nthe DREAM Act. It said: If you are one of those kids brought here under \nthe age of 16, have finished high school, and have no serious criminal \nissues, we are going to give you a chance. Go to college or join the \nmilitary and we will give you a path to ultimately getting to the back \nof the line but becoming a citizen of the United States--the DREAM Act.\n  When I introduced this bill to solve Tereza Lee's problem, I used to \ngive speeches about it all around Chicago. A funny thing would happen. \nWhen I would finish the speech and go back to my car, sometimes at \nnight, there would be somebody waiting by my car. As I got closer, it \nturned out to be a very young girl, usually, maybe with her friend.\n  They would wait to make sure no one was around. The young girl would \nsay to me: Senator, I am one of those DREAMers. I am undocumented. My \nmom and dad are scared to death that they are going to be deported, and \nthen I will be deported. I hope you can pass this.\n  Well, time passed. We called the bill on the floor and called it in \nthe House. We have never been able to make it the law of the land. \nSadly, the reality is that there are probably 2.5 million young people \nliving in America who would qualify under the DREAM Act to be given a \nchance to become legal--2.5 million.\n  What happened to Tereza Lee? I have to finish that story. She ended \nup going to the Manhattan School of Music. Two families stepped \nforward--families that had befriended the Merit music program in \nChicago. I know one of them well. They said: This girl is too good. We \ncan't waste her talent. We will pay for her education.\n  They did so out of pocket. She did not qualify for any Federal \nassistance because she is undocumented. So Tereza finished school and \nplayed in Carnegie Hall. Now she is about to complete her Ph.D. in \nmusic. She is living in Brooklyn, NY. She is a mom with a little girl. \nShe married an American musician so she is legal--finally. That is her \nstory. Thank goodness this determined young girl stuck with it. We have \nto stick with it too.\n  The people who want to turn away these 2.5 million DREAMers ought to \ntake a minute to meet them--just to meet them and to understand what it \nis to be a young person in America going through all the challenges of \nadolescence and all of the challenges that might be brought to you in \nyour community or by our family and knowing in the back of your mind \nthat at any moment, someone can knock on the door and tell you that you \nhave to leave this country and that you are not here legally.\n  They do it, and they fight every single day for a chance and a dream \nso that someday they will become part of the only country they have \never known. These are kids who, just like the Senate a few minutes ago, \ngot up every day in the classroom and pledged allegiance to that flag, \nthe only flag they have ever known. They do not view themselves as \nMexican or Korean. They view themselves as Americans.\n  The question is this: How do we view them? Do we view them as an \nasset to America or do we view them as a problem--a problem that should \nbe thrown away and deported? You are listening to the Presidential \ncampaign. We all are. I am not going to go into detail about some of \nthe terrible things that have been said, but I just wish some of the \nhaters, some of the people who want to turn on these young people, \nwould meet them. Come and meet them. Hear their stories.\n  I think even the hardest, coldest heart would be moved by them. \nAcross the street--you can see it through the window--is the Supreme \nCourt building. It was about 12 years ago that we decided to do \nsomething in the Senate that I thought was a great idea. Every 2 years, \nwhen there is a new class of Senators, we have a dinner with the \nJustices of the Supreme Court. We do it at their place. It is right \nacross the street. We line up in the entryway there--the beautiful \nmarble entryway. There are tables set up, each of us sits at a table \nwith one of the Justices.\n  I can remember one of the early times I went over there. I shared the \ntable with another Senator, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a \nlegendary Member of the Senate and former President pro tempore of the \nSenate. He served here for decades and carried the Constitution around \nin his breast pocket. In his great days he could recite poetry nonstop. \nHe was a real believer in the Senate. He wrote the history of the \nSenate, one that probably will never be matched. I shared a table with \nhim in the Supreme Court for one of these dinners.\n  I said: Isn't this a beautiful building?\n  He said: It sure is.\n  I said: How often do you get over here, Senator Byrd?\n  He said: This is my first time.\n  I said: You have been in the Senate for 40-plus years, and this is \nyour first time? Why?\n  He said: Well, it is a separate branch of government. We must respect \nthem. They had never asked me to come over.\n  Well, I see it a little differently. I go across that street because, \nyes, it is a separate branch of government, but it\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\nis one that we should understand and respect, as I hope they understand \nand respect Congress on this side of the street. So this morning I did. \nI went over for an argument before the Supreme Court. There was a huge \nmob out in front of the Supreme Court because the case that was being \nconsidered is one that affects millions of lives in America--Texas v. \nUnited States.\n  The question is this: What are we going to do with people like Tereza \nLee, whom I just described earlier. You see, what happened 6 years ago \nis that I joined with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana and \nwrote a letter to President Obama saying: If the Congress is not going \nto change the law to make it possible for these young people to stay in \nthis country, would you issue an Executive order that allows them, at \nleast on a temporary basis, to stay in the United States?\n  Within a year or two, the President agreed to do it. He created what \nis known as the DACA Program. It basically says that young people like \nTereza Lee, whom I described earlier, can step forward, identify \nthemselves to our government, submit themselves for criminal \ninvestigation, and pay a filing fee of around $500, I believe it is. If \nthey do, they will be given the right to stay in the United States on a \ntemporary renewable basis for 2 years or 3 years.\n  That is what DACA is all about--so that young people can pursue their \nlives at least with the understanding that for a few years, they don't \nhave to worry about that knock on the door. Oh, if they get a job, they \nhave to pay their taxes. If they go to college, they are not going to \nget a penny from this government. We don't help them pay for their \ncollege education.\n  The President did it. I applauded him for doing it. So far, 700,000 \nyoung people just like Tereza Lee have signed up for protection under \nDACA. We estimate that the total universe of young people eligible is \nabout 2.5 million. So the President attempted to extend the DACA \nProgram. He said: We need to address the problem with their parents. \nMany of these parents have children who are U.S. citizens and legally \nin the United States, but they are undocumented and subject to \ndeportation.\n  So the President said, in what is known as DAPA: The parents of these \nkids can come forward, submit themselves to a criminal background check \nwith fingerprints and all, pay a filing fee of around $500, and then \nthey will be allowed, on a temporary, renewable basis, if they keep \ntheir noses clean, to work in this country.\n  If they are going to work in this country, they have to pay their \ntaxes. Well, that is what the President suggested. As soon as he made \nthese two proposals to extend DACA and to create this other program for \nthe parents, a lawsuit was filed. It was led by the State of Texas, and \n25 other States, I believe, joined. That is the case before the Supreme \nCourt today.\n  Before I get into the details of that case--and I want to say a word \nabout it on the floor this afternoon--let me say one other thing. What \nSenator Byrd told me about not going across the street was not only \nrespect for that institution of the Supreme Court, but as a Senator he \nwas basically saying that we need to respect their right to be above \npolitics. We want to make certain that that branch of government is \nabove politics, that they apply the law and interpret the Constitution \nin a nonpolitical way.\n  Sometimes I read their decisions and think they have gone political \non us. But the goal is to make sure they are preserved from becoming \npolitical. This morning, when I went before the Supreme Court, I did \nnot face nine Justices, only eight. Antonin Scalia, who passed away a \nfew weeks ago, created a vacancy that has not been filled. Why has the \nSenate failed to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court? Because within \nhours of the untimely death of Justice Scalia, the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, who was here a few moments ago, announced publicly: \nWe will not fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court.\n  That is important to remember. It is the first time in the history of \nthe United States of America--the first time in the history of the \nSenate--that the Senate is refusing a hearing for a Presidential \nnominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. It has never happened \nbefore--never.\n  Oh, the Republicans argue: Well, if the shoe were on the other foot, \nI am sure you Democrats would do exactly the same thing. I call their \nattention to the year 1988. Republican President Ronald Reagan, with a \nvacancy on the Supreme Court, submitted the name of Anthony Kennedy to \nthe Senate. A Republican President was filling a vacancy on the Supreme \nCourt, and he submitted the name of his nominee.\n  The Senate, then controlled by the Democrats, gave Anthony Kennedy a \nhearing, a strong vote, and sent him over to the Supreme Court. So when \nthe shoe was on the other foot, we did not play politics. But now we \nare. So I faced eight Justices over there as that argument was made \nthis morning. I thought to myself: If they end up in a 4-to-4 tie--and \nthat can happen--it will be chaos and confusion across America, with \ndifferent courts and different districts having different \ninterpretations of the same law.\n  How did we get into this mess? Because the Republican majority in the \nSenate has decided: We are not going to appoint anyone to fill this \nvacancy. Their argument is this: Let the American people speak to \nfilling this vacancy in the Presidential election. Let them decide \nwhether it will be a Democrat or a Republican President filling this \nvacancy.\n  There might be some value to that argument if President Obama, in the \nlast election, when he was running for reelection in 2012, had been \nrunning for a term of 3 years. You can argue then that this fourth year \nhe was not entitled to be President. But you know what. It turns out \nthat he was running for a 4-year term. It turns out he won by 5 million \nvotes. It turns out that when it comes to being Commander in Chief and \nPresident of the United States, he has all the powers vested in him by \nthe Constitution, even in the fourth year. Isn't that amazing--4 years \nas the President? That is what the American people decided, but only to \nbe overruled by the Republican majority in the Senate.\n  Sorry, Mr. President, they say, you only get 3 years. Maybe we give \nyou 3 years and 2 months, but you sure don't have the right to try and \nfill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, even though the Constitution \nexplicitly says in article II, section 2: The President shall appoint a \nnominee to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. Their argument is that \nyou may think you are President when it comes to the Supreme Court, but \nthe Senate Republican majority thinks otherwise.\n  I sat down with Merrick Garland. He is the proposed nominee to fill \nthis vacancy. He is chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court, which is a \nhigh position in the judiciary. He was born in Illinois, so I come to \nhis nomination with some prejudice, but he is an extraordinary person.\n  People have said: Well, why didn't the President choose a woman? Why \ndidn't the President choose an African American? Why didn't he choose a \nHispanic? Why didn't he choose someone from India? Why did he choose \nthis man?\n  I think he chose him for an obvious reason: He is clearly qualified. \nEven Republican Senators have said nice things about him publicly. Many \nof them have said they refuse to even meet with him, will not even sit \nin the same room with him. Some have agreed to, but many have said no. \nSenator McConnell said: I won't meet with him because he is not going \nto get a hearing and he is not going to get a vote.\n  It is time for us to fill that vacancy. It is time for us to accept \nour constitutional responsibility and show respect for the document we \nall swore to uphold and defend when we took the oath of office. It is \ntime to fill that vacancy and put nine Justices on the Supreme Court to \navoid the uncertainty, confusion, and chaos which might otherwise \nemerge.\n  I wish to say a word about the case before the Court this morning. \nThis was a case--United States v. Texas--a legal challenge, as I \nmentioned earlier, to the President's immigration policy, filed by 26 \nRepublican Governors. I believe this lawsuit has no legal merit. It is \ndriven by political hostility toward President Obama and his \nimmigration policy.\n  I was proud to join an amicus brief signed by 39 Senators on our side \nof the aisle and 186 House Democrats in support of the administration's \ndecision\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\non immigration. The President is on very solid ground in this case. I \nam hoping and confident that the Supreme Court will rule in his favor.\n  As an initial matter before the case proceeds, the States that filed \nthis lawsuit have to show they will be harmed by the President's \nimmigration policy. Otherwise, they really don't have any standing to \nsue. It turns out that exactly the opposite is true. The President's \npolicy allowing people to work here on a temporary basis under his \nExecutive orders will create a huge benefit to the American economy.\n  Over the next 10 years, in the State of Texas alone--and they brought \nthe lawsuit; at least started it--the President's immigration action \nwould increase that State's gross domestic product by more than $38 \nbillion and increase the earnings of all Texas residents by $17.5 \nbillion. They argue that the President's immigration policy would cost \nthe State of Texas money. It turns out that exactly the opposite is \ntrue.\n  Even if the States have standing to sue, the Supreme Court repeatedly \nhas held that the Federal Government has broad authority to decide \nquestions of immigration. Justice Anthony Kennedy, appointed earlier, \nwrote the opinion for the Court striking down Arizona's controversial \nimmigration law. Listen to what he said:\n\n       A principal feature of the removal system--\n\n  Removal of people who are not eligible to be in the United States--\n\n     is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials. . \n     . . Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces \n     immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to \n     support their families, for example, likely pose less danger \n     than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime.\n\n  This administration's immigration policy is not just legal, it is \nsmart and realistic. The President has said simply: We should \nprioritize. We have limited resources. We can't deport all those who \nare here undocumented. If we are only going to deport some, let's pick \nthose who are a danger to the United States.\n  The President has focused on those who have been convicted of serious \ncrimes or pose a threat to our security. And shouldn't he? As Commander \nin Chief, shouldn't that be his highest priority, to make sure anyone \nwho is a danger to the United States is gone? He knows he can't deport \nall even if he wished to, so he focuses on those who may be a danger to \nthe United States--prosecutorial discretion. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity only has enough funding to deport a small fraction of \nundocumented, so the President wants to focus the limited resources on \nthose who could do us harm. That is just common sense.\n  At the same time, the President said that we should not waste our \nresources on deporting young immigrant students who grow up in this \ncountry, such as Tereza Lee, whom I mentioned earlier, or tear apart \nfamilies by deporting the parents of U.S. citizens. The President's \npolicy is focused on deporting felons, not families--criminals, not \nchildren.\n  In November of 2014, President Obama established this program, DAPA, \nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent \nResidents. Under DAPA, undocumented immigrants who have lived in the \nUnited States for more than 5 years and have American children would be \nrequired to come forward, register with the government, pay a fee, go \nthrough a criminal background check and a national security background \ncheck, and pay their taxes.\n  If the government determines these parents have not committed any \nserious crimes and don't pose any threat, this Executive order says: On \na temporary, renewable basis, they will not be targeted for \ndeportation.\n  President Obama also expanded the DACA Program for children, as I \nmentioned earlier, at the same time. Why did he do that? Because for \nyears Republicans in Congress have refused to consider legislation to \nfix our broken immigration system.\n  On the floor of the Senate on June 27, 2013, I joined a group of \nseven other Senators--four Democrats and four Republicans in total. We \nhad worked for months to construct a bipartisan, comprehensive \nimmigration bill. We had to give a lot. There were things in that bill \nwhich I didn't like at all and things which some of the Republican \nSenators didn't like, but it is the nature of legislation and \ncompromise that that happens.\n  We brought the bill to the floor for a vote after a lengthy markup in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and dozens of amendments had been \noffered. The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform legislation \non June 27, 2013, 68 to 32--more than 2 to 1. That bill would have \nstrengthened border security, protected American workers, and \nestablished a tough but fair path to citizenship for 11 million \nundocumented immigrants who were then currently living in our country.\n  What happened to the bill after it passed the Senate? I take you back \nto how laws are made and your civics course. It went across the Rotunda \nto the House of Representatives, which was under Republican control. \nThe majority in the House of Representatives refused to call the bill, \nrefused to even bring it to the floor for a debate, and refused to \noffer any substitute. They did nothing--nothing, despite our broken \nimmigration system. In the face of this, the President was left with no \nchoice.\n  For the good of the American people, he used the authority given him \nas President to try to make some reforms to our immigration system. The \nCenter for American Progress has studied what the President proposed, \nand they say that over the next 10 years, if these two programs--DACA \nand DAPA--were passed, the gross domestic product for my home State of \nIllinois would increase by $15 billion and the earnings of Illinois \nresidents would increase by almost $8 billion. Could your State use \nthat--more economic activity, more people paying taxes to the Federal \nGovernment and to your State? Virtually every State could use that.\n  It is unfortunate that these bills have been blocked by the Senate, \nand now they are trying to block them in the Supreme Court.\n  I see Senator Cornyn is on the floor, and I will close by telling a \nstory about another DREAMer. I have done this quite a few times. My \nstaff has done a lot of work on it. I thank them all for it. These \nstories really say a lot more than I ever could in a speech. They tell \nus what was at stake before the Supreme Court of the United States this \nmorning.\n  This attractive young woman is Vasthy Lamadrid. Her family came to \nthe United States from Mexico. She was 5 years old. They came here with \nnothing. They moved into a home with four other families, so a lot of \nthe kids slept in the same room.\n  Despite their poverty, Vasthy felt safe and excelled in school. Math \nwas her best subject. She had nearly perfect scores on standardized \ntests. English was tough, but then she discovered a series of books \ncalled ``Goosebumps.'' If you have kids or grandkids, I bet you have \nheard of that one. She became an avid reader and mastered the English \nlanguage.\n  By middle school, Vasthy was placed in the gifted program. That is \nwhere she discovered her love of engineering. She was a student in the \nEngineering Pathway at Bioscience High School, where she received the \nYoung Entrepreneurs Award, made the principal's list every semester, \nand played tennis. She was an active volunteer, working with such \ngroups as Girls For Change, CompuGirls, E-Tech, Hospice of the Valley, \nand St. Joseph's Hospital. Vasthy also helped younger kids in her \nneighborhood by tutoring them in math and tennis.\n  Vasthy went on to attend Arizona State University. Because she is \nundocumented, she didn't qualify for a penny of government assistance, \nand she had to pay out-of-State tuition despite the fact that she had \nlived her entire life in the United States, in Arizona.\n  Then something extraordinary happened. Counting on the generosity of \nthe American people, Vasthy decided to crowdfund her college education. \nShe shared her life story online and asked people to contribute to help \nher pay her tuition. Well, it worked. She is currently in her second \nyear of college. In the first semester, she made the dean's list with a \n3.79 GPA in the Ira Fulton School of Engineering.\n  Thanks to DACA--the Presidential Executive order--she is able to \nsupport herself. She has also made time to continue to volunteer for a \nclub called\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\nSTEM Academy mentoring young children. She volunteers with the Arizona \nImmigration Refugee Service as an English teacher. As a result of her \nvolunteer work, she has decided she wants to become a science teacher. \nCan we use more science teachers in America? You bet.\n  This is what she said in a letter she wrote:\n\n       DACA signifies to me a chance to show that I belong here--\n     that inside I am an American. It represents an opportunity to \n     show that my parents' sacrifice was worth it. I love this \n     country and want to one day become a citizen and continue to \n     give back to the community. I don't need that journey to \n     become a citizen to be easily given to me, but I'd hope that \n     the journey is fair.\n\n  Vasthy and other DREAMers have so much they can give to America.\n  I don't understand the Republican Party when it comes to the issue of \nimmigration. We are a nation of immigrants. My mother was an immigrant \nto this country. I am a first-generation American and proud of it. It \nis my honor to serve and represent a great State like Illinois. I know \nwhat her journey was like. She was brought here at the age of 2 from \nLithuania. I know what her early life was like as she struggled to try \nto make sure there was food on the table, first for her mom, sister, \nand brother, and then ultimately for her own family. That is my \nfamily's story, but it is a story that is repeated over and over again.\n  There is something in the DNA of immigrants who are willing to risk \neverything in this world to go to a country where they don't even speak \nthe language because they know they will have an opportunity here, and \nthey bring something with them. That is why they light up the \nscoreboard in Silicon Valley with all of these new inventions and new \ncorporations with thousands of employees that make us an economic \nsuccess in many fields. That is why we should think twice about those \nwho condemn immigrants in this Nation of immigrants.\n  I am confident the Supreme Court will uphold the President's \nimmigration actions. Then I hope, after they have done this, that the \nRepublicans in Congress will finally decide to return to the table and \nwork on a bipartisan basis for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am always impressed with the \ndistinguished Democratic whip and his eloquence, but he is telling the \nAmerican people that we have to choose between being a nation of \nimmigrants or a nation of laws. The fact is, we don't have to make that \nchoice; we can be both. But we can't do it when we have a President who \nsimply believes he can do an end run around the U.S. Constitution.\n  In fact, according to Pew, about 3.5 million people could claim the \nbenefits of the President's unlawful Executive action, receiving work \npermits, driver's licenses, and Social Security numbers. While we are a \ncompassionate country, we are a nation of immigrants, that is not the \nkind of decision the Constitution gives to a single political actor, \neven if he is the President of the United States.\n  So there is a right way and a wrong way. And I realize the \ndistinguished Democratic whip believes that just because they can't get \nwhat they want when they want it, the President can then resort to this \nend run, but thankfully that is not the view of the courts. The U.S. \nFederal district court in Brownsville, TX, issued an injunction against \nthe President's Executive action. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \naffirmed that injunction, and now the Supreme Court of the United \nStates heard arguments in the case this afternoon.\n  This is really more than just about immigration. This is whether, \nunder the doctrine of separation of powers, the Constitution we have \nlived under for lo these many years gives the President unilateral \nauthority without the approval of Congress, the elected representatives \nof the people, and in flagrant disregard for the laws that are already \non the books.\n  The heart of the case the Court heard today is about stopping a \nPresident who said: I have a pen and I have a phone. And even though \nthe American people have given Republicans a majority in both Houses \nand obviously forced the President to deal with a Republican conference \nto come up with consensus legislation, the President said: Forget that. \nI am not about trying to achieve bipartisan consensus on anything. If I \ndon't get what I want, I am going to jam it through the system and hope \nthe courts don't stop me. So it is not just about immigration, it is \nabout the Constitution itself.\n\n  There are perhaps 22 different times, by my count, where the \nPresident of the United States acknowledged he didn't even have this \nauthority. I remember in a speech he gave to La Raza, an interview he \ngave on Univision, the President denied he had the authority, which \nnow, miraculously, our Democratic friends think is clear-cut under the \nlaw. How can that be? It cannot be.\n  I remember specifically being at a meeting where the President \ninvited the leadership of both the House and the Senate to the White \nHouse after the 2014 election. Many may recall that leading up to that \npoint, there had been a lot of rumors about the President issuing an \nExecutive action, but he had not done so. I remember specifically \nsitting there in the White House with some of my colleagues from the \nHouse and the Senate, where then-Speaker Boehner said to the President: \nPlease, Mr. President, don't do this. Don't poison the well. Don't make \nit impossible, by such a polarizing action, for us to build consensus \non the building blocks of immigration reform where we could actually \nagree.\n  I remember Majority Leader McCarthy making the same comment. I joined \nin and reiterated the same point. The President, defiant, told us he \nwas going to go ahead and do it.\n  There are a lot of conversations people are having today across the \nUnited States. I had some of those earlier today during some visits \nwith people who were just wondering how to explain the political \nenvironment in America today. What I tell them is that this seems \nunprecedented in my experience. People are so angry. People are so \nscared. People are frightened and worried about the next generation. \nAnd for the first time in my memory, parents are doubting whether their \nchildren will enjoy the same sorts of freedom and prosperity that we \nenjoy today. That is a tragedy.\n  My parents were part of the ``greatest generation.'' My dad was a B-\n17 pilot in the Army Air Corps, even before the Air Force came into \nbeing. On his 26th bombing mission over Nazi Germany, while he was \nflying in the 8th Air Force out of Molesworth, England, he was shot \ndown and captured as a prisoner of war for 4 months. Fortunately, that \nwas toward the tail end of the war. Even though he was injured in his \nparachute jump--not seriously, as it turned out, although he had some \ndisability associated with that later in life--he managed to survive \nthat and even survived an appendectomy by a fellow prisoner of war when \nhe had appendicitis in a POW camp. It is amazing.\n  I always thought my dad had nine lives. Even though he passed away at \nthe very young age of 67, he survived countless occasions when surely \nhe could have lost his life, including those occasions of jumping out \nof a burning B-17 plane over Germany and an appendectomy in a POW camp \nat the hands of a fellow prisoner of war.\n  The reason my parents and all of our parents sacrificed so much and \nrisked so much and worked so hard is that they believed in the promise \nof America--the promise that exists only when the law is respected, \nwhen people in high office are bound by and obligated to and held \naccountable to the same laws that govern the most humble among us. That \nis what America is all about--a country where people, if they work hard \nand play by the rules, can achieve their dreams. I think that is the \nreason America seems so polarized today. People have sort of jumped \noutside the usual paradigm of political calculation where you are a \nliberal or you are a conservative or you are somewhere in the middle. \nPeople have sort of jumped that track, and we are seeing something \nentirely different on the left and on the right. I think the reason is, \nin part, because of a President who believes he is not bound by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.\n  People are frightened because they have seen over the last 7 years--\neven though the President was stopped legislatively after the \nAffordable Care Act\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nwas passed and after Dodd-Frank was passed and then stopped by the \nelectorate giving the Republicans a majority in the House and in 2014 a \nmajority in Senate--that this President will not be stopped by the \nvoters. That is the determination he made, and this Executive order is \nexhibit 1 because he said: I don't care what the voters think. I don't \ncare what the American people think. I don't care what the Constitution \nsays. I don't care that what Congress says should be the law of the \nland. I am going to do it the way I want to do it. Frankly, that is \nscary stuff when you are talking about the Commander in Chief, the \nleader of the free world, and the sort of power that goes along with \nthat.\n  Rather than heed the warning--or I would really call it the plea of \nleaders in the House and the Senate after the 2014 election--the \nPresident decided to go around Congress and try to essentially change \nthe law, giving work permits to people who were illegally present in \nthe country, giving them driver's licenses, even giving Social Security \nnumbers to an estimated 3.5 million people. How can the President do \nthis when Congress is deadlocked? Well, he did it. And that is a \nquestion the Supreme Court is going to have to decide.\n  At the time, the President called it a middle-ground approach. He is \na master of rhetoric. The problem is the facts belie his words. The \nfact of the matter is this was a constitutional scorched-earth tactic. \nAnd more than anything else, it eroded public confidence in Congress's \nability, working with the White House, to get anything constructive \ndone in the area of immigration.\n  The Acting President pro tempore is, of course, from the great State \nof Oklahoma, and he went to school in Texas. He understands what I \nunderstand: We have a large Hispanic population in Texas--about 38 \npercent. But we are a very diverse State. Many people are surprised \nwhen I tell them the third most commonly spoken language in Texas today \nis Vietnamese--Vietnamese. Can you believe that? We also have a large \nIndian American population.\n  We are a very diverse State, and the main reason for that is we still \nrepresent that land of opportunity that America used to be, where \npeople can come, work hard--those of modest means, with little on their \nbacks and maybe nothing in their pockets--and achieve something and \nlive the American dream. So I resent, I really do resent, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois trying to tell us the President was \nonly trying to do something that was good for Texas. He doesn't have a \nclue. In fact, if we were to follow the policy choices of the \nleadership in Texas, the country would be a heck of a lot better off \nwhen it comes to taking advantage of our energy resources, when it \ncomes to taxes, reasonable regulation, and a willingness to try to \naccommodate those who invest capital and create jobs. To me, that is \nthe single biggest difference between where I live in Texas and what I \nsee across our country and what is coming out of Washington, DC. There \nseems to be an attitude here in Washington of how many more obstacles, \nhow many larger impediments can we place in the way of those who invest \nthe capital and those who are creating the jobs and still expect the \nAmerican dream to be alive.\n  Believe me, we have tested it. The Obama administration has tested \nit, and what it has produced is disaster. It has produced a health care \nsystem that, rather than making health care more affordable, has made \nit more expensive, has caused people who liked their coverage to give \nup their coverage only to buy something that had a deductible that has, \nin essence, made them self-insured. It has created stagnant wages. It \nhas created stagnant economic growth.\n  There are not a lot of problems we have in this country that couldn't \nbe mitigated, made better, if we just saw our economy growing again, \ninstead of the sort of anemic and flatlined growth we have seen since \n2008.\n  My predecessor in the Senate, Mr. Phil Gramm, has a Ph.D. in \neconomics from Texas A University. He has made the point that, \nhistorically, what you see after a recession like the one we saw \nfollowing the fiscal crisis in 2008 is a V-shape recovery. In other \nwords, you hit the bottom and you bounce up and you grow quickly \nbecause basically you have worked the problems out of the system. But \nwhat we have seen since 2008 is a U-shaped recovery, if you could even \ncall it that. It is pretty close to flat, where the economy is growing \nat less than 2 percent, which is not fast enough to keep people fully \nemployed. And we still have--although the unemployment rate has dropped \ndown, we still have the smallest percentage of people participating in \nthe workforce that we have had in the last 30 years. Many people have \nsimply given up, retired early, or made other arrangements. This is a \nserious matter.\n  The Supreme Court heard arguments today. We know there are currently \neight members of the Supreme Court. I heard the distinguished \nDemocratic whip complain about the fact that we have decided to allow \nthe voters to choose in November the President who will make the choice \nto fill the Scalia vacancy. Well, the fact of the matter is, it is \nsimply too important to allow President Obama, given his penchant for \nlawlessness and usurpation of constitutional authority--to give him the \nchance to stack the Supreme Court in favor of a Court that would likely \nrubberstamp his actions and those of future Presidents for the next 25 \nyears.\n  The hypocrisy is rich, listening to our Democratic colleagues. These \nare the folks who invented the judicial filibuster. They invented the \njudicial filibuster. They did that when President George W. Bush was \nPresident. As controversial as the nomination of Clarence Thomas was, I \nbelieve he was confirmed with 52 votes--not 60 votes but 52 because \nnobody dreamed back then that Senate rules would allow the minority \nparty to insist on 60 votes to confirm a President's appointee.\n  We know that after the election where the Democratic majority lost \nthat majority, in a lameduck session they jammed a number of appointees \nonto the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an effort to pack that court \nto match the ideological picture they wanted. Again, this is the second \nmost important court in the Nation, which they believed would be more \ninclined to rubberstamp the overreaching by the Obama administration.\n  We are all familiar with the Biden speech in 1992 when, as chairman \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, he suggested it would be perhaps \ninappropriate to confirm a Presidential nominee in the waning days of \nthat President's term.\n  We saw the Harry Reid speech in 2005, where he said it is the \nPresident's prerogative to appoint, but the Senate is not obligated to \ngrant consent to that nomination. Actually, I agree with Senator Reid \nback then, but not today, when he has taken the exact opposite \napproach.\n  Then there is Senator Schumer, the heir apparent to the Democratic \nleadership in the Senate, who said, in 2007, 18 months before George W. \nBush left office: I think there ought to be a presumption against \nconfirmation.\n  To listen to my Democratic colleagues complain about the decision we \nhave made to let the voters vote for the President who is going to fill \nthat vacancy and to watch them--well, it looks like crocodile tears to \nme, and it smells like hypocrisy.\n  As we have said, the Supreme Court of the United States heard \narguments today in a case brought by the State of Texas and other \nStates that would otherwise be compelled to grant work permits, issue \ndriver's licenses and Social Security numbers to people illegally \npresent in the United States who did not comply with our laws. I am \nconfident the Court will find that the States have suffered real harm \nfrom the standpoint of the constitutional notion of standing; in other \nwords, you have to have standing before you can sue. Basically, it \nmeans you have to show real or potential harm if the Court doesn't act. \nI am confident the Court will find standing.\n  But the Court will do one of two things. Either the Court will affirm \nby being split 4 to 4 or all eight Justices could write in favor of the \nFifth Circuit decision to let the injunction stand or, if the Court \ndeems that this issue needs to be held over until the Court has all \nnine members, after the first of the year, that is a decision the Court \ncan make.\n  This is a very important issue, and I am glad the Court is taking it \nup. We\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nneed to know--we need to know whether we remain a nation of laws as \nwell as a nation of immigrants. The whole idea our Democratic \ncolleagues have foisted on us that somehow we have to choose between \nthose two is a false choice. It is a false choice. We are both. We \naren't one or the other. America has always been made better by people \nwho have risked coming to the United States because they weren't \nsatisfied with what they had or where they lived, but the day we begin \nrewarding people who do this in disregard of the laws is the day we \nbegin to no longer be a nation of laws, and that is a legacy and a \ntreasure we should not squander.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to discuss an issue of \nimportance for Nebraskans and Americans all across this country; that \nis, the need for comprehensive tax reform.\n  It is no secret the current Tax Code is overly complex and outdated. \nAny American can tell you how frustrating it is to file a tax return. \nOur Tax Code is riddled with deductions, exemptions, credits, \nexclusions, preferences, and loopholes that make it nearly impossible \nfor anyone without a degree in tax law to understand.\n  At the same time, we should recognize that some progress has been \nmade. Thanks to the work of Chairman Hatch and members of the Senate \nFinance Committee, many important updates to the Tax Code were made \npermanent at the end of last year. In particular, increasing the \ndeduction limit and making permanent section 179 of the Tax Code was an \nimportant step. This section allows small businesses to deduct from \ntheir taxes certain depreciable business assets. My constituents told \nme annual uncertainty about whether section 179 would be renewed made \nit very difficult for them to plan, to invest, and to grow their \nbusinesses. Making this provision permanent reduced the ambiguity that \nhad plagued Nebraska's small business owners and operators.\n  Although we have made some progress in reforming the Tax Code, there \nis more work to do for the American people. I believe tax reform should \nfocus on several principles, including competitiveness, simplicity, and \neconomic growth. At nearly 40 percent, the United States has the \nhighest combined corporate tax rate in the developed world. This is \nstifling job growth, hurting families, and compelling businesses to \nmove overseas. Any comprehensive plan should seek to lower this rate to \na competitive level, one that will not only encourage current \nbusinesses to stay but also incentivize new businesses to set up shop.\n  Another goal of comprehensive tax reform should be to simplify the \nTax Code. Families and businesses spend billions of hours every year in \ncompleting their taxes. A disproportionate share of this burden is \nshouldered by many small businesses. Many of these are family \nbusinesses, and they don't have the resources to easily comply.\n  Creating a tax system that is simple and efficient will reduce \nadministrative and compliance costs. A simple tax system will also \nincrease transparency, allowing Americans to fill out their taxes \naccurately while preventing fraud and lost revenue. Perhaps most \nimportantly, any plan to reform the Tax Code--well, it must spur \neconomic growth. Inaction on reforming the Tax Code is delaying needed \ngrowth in GDP, jobs, and investment.\n  When I was first elected to the Senate, I thought my colleagues and I \nwould immediately take up two issues to restart our economy, grow jobs, \nand help all American families: tax reform and reducing the overburden \nof government regulations. After all, it is pretty obvious these are \ntwo issues we can reform that would have a positive impact on our \neconomy. We see regulations become ever more burdensome, and they \ncontinue to depress our economy, stifle innovation, and hurt our \nfamilies.\n  Major tax reform has not happened. We continue to chip away, but I \nbelieve now is the time we step up and be bolder. We must make the \nnecessary reforms to our tax system to give Americans confidence in our \nfuture. We need to help put more money back in the pockets of \nhardworking Americans and allow them to spend money on the goods and \nservices they choose and that they need.\n  It is my hope my colleagues will join me in continuing this \ndiscussion and that this dialogue then will eventually result in \naction, in comprehensive tax reform that truly benefits Nebraskans and \nthe American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       China's Aluminum Industry\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, over the last few decades, China has used \nmarket-distorting subsidies and industrial policies to repeatedly prop \nup their own industries and rip off American jobs. Steel, tires, solar \npanels--the story plays out again and again. Too often China's economy \nis not run by the markets; it is run by government committee. So even \nthough its own State Council has called out the problem of severe \nexcess capacities, China clings to the same old tired and destructive \npolicies. Today I want to address what is happening now with China's \nhuge overcapacity of aluminum.\n  The amount of aluminum Chinese smelters are churning out has gone up \nby more than 1,200 percent in a decade and a half. In 2000, they \nproduced 2.5 million metric tons. In 2015 China produced 32 million \nmetric tons. When you create a glut of aluminum production the way \nChina has, you send the markets into turmoil and you do enormous harm \nto American workers.\n  I spoke last week at a public hearing held by the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and the International Trade Commission about how the \noverproduction of steel in China is an urgent and immediate threat to \nsteel jobs here in our country. While China's steel mills are churning \nout more steel than ever, American steel towns are suffering or worse. \nThousands of jobs nationwide have been lost just in the last year. Even \nthough one-third of all steel produced today has no buyer, China keeps \nadding and adding to the glut by producing more steel.\n  The same story is played out in the case of primary aluminum. There \nis a huge overcapacity in China that, once again, is driven by market-\ndistorting government policies. It has unleashed a chain of events that \ncan end in economic devastation across this country. Global aluminum \nprices have already plummeted, undercutting our American companies. \nBetween the start of 2011 and this upcoming June, the lights will have \ngone out at nearly two-thirds of the aluminum smelters in the United \nStates. More than 6,500 jobs--good American jobs--will have been lost. \nYou can bet that sooner or later the damage will ripple downstream \nthrough the entire aluminum industry, which employs three-quarters of a \nmillion Americans either directly or indirectly.\n\n  In my judgment, the United States is badly in need of a safeguard \nagainst this economic tidal wave. That is why I have chosen to stand \nwith my friend Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, and \nthe steelworkers. They filed a petition for relief under section 201 of \nthe Trade Act of 1974 today. Without an immediate economic bulwark, the \nUnited States is in danger of losing thousands of good family-wage jobs \nacross our country.\n  It is my view that the administration should act in this case as soon \nas possible to defend our workers and our businesses from economic \nruin. The United States and our trading partners must ramp up the \npressure on China to stop overproduction, and our trade enforcers have \nto take on the trade cheats and use every single trade tool in the \ntoolbox, including the ENFORCE Act, the Leveling the Playing Field Act, \nand the other measures my colleagues and I on the Finance Committee \nfought to get signed into law over the last year.\n  I firmly believe workers in Oregon and across this country can \ncompete with anybody in the world, but the United States cannot afford \nto sit idly by and watch China's destructive policies cause our \naluminum industry to be wiped out. As the steelworkers have pointed out \nrepeatedly, enough is\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nenough. Leo Gerard and those steelworkers are standing up and fighting \nback, and I am honored to stand with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in a few moments, we will be voting on \nending debate on H.R. 636, and that will allow us to proceed to a vote \non the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act \nof 2016. I wish to urge my colleagues to support that motion to end \ndebate.\n  The legislation we are considering is not just any FAA \nreauthorization. This bill is the most pro-passenger and pro-security \nFAA reauthorization in recent history. Travelers are frustrated, and \nthis bill contains commonsense reforms to make travel safe and secure \nand more passenger-friendly.\n  For over 2 weeks on the Senate floor now and before that in the \nCommerce Committee, where I serve as chairman, we have been working \nhard to thoughtfully develop this bill and to allow for robust debate. \nFor instance, there are drone safety provisions in the bill, including \na pilot program to deploy technology to intercept drones near airports. \nThese provisions are obviously intended to prevent accidents like the \none that happened outside the Heathrow Airport this weekend, where a \ndrone hit an approaching plane.\n  We developed this provision and others in the bill through an open \nprocess that allowed every member of the committee to contribute and \nhelp write the bill. Last year, we held six hearings on topics that \nhelped inform our bill, and at the committee markup last month alone, \nwe accepted 57 amendments, 34 of which were sponsored by Democrats and \n23 by Republicans. On the Senate floor, when it was reported out and \ntaken up, we added 19 amendments, 10 from Democrats and 9 from \nRepublican Senators. The resulting bill is one we can be proud of, and \nboth sides of the aisle have commended us for our inclusive process. \nWhen there have been differences, we have been able to find ways to \naddress or set those aside for later so the progress on the legislation \ncould move forward.\n  Even at this late hour, we have worked constructively to assemble a \npossible managers' package of more than two dozen additional amendments \nthat we would like to adopt by voice vote prior to final passage. Yet, \neven if that is not possible, I commit to those Senators whose \namendments we stand prepared to accept that I will work to address \ntheir concerns as we engage with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Now it is time to conclude our work on the bipartisan FAA bill that I \nintroduced a long ways back, along with my friend and ranking member, \nSenator Bill Nelson, and our Aviation Subcommittee leaders, Senators \nKelly Ayotte and Maria Cantwell.\n  The bill includes reforms benefiting the traveling public, and we \nshouldn't let them down. Let's vote yes on the motion to end debate and \nstart moving these historic reforms forward.\n  As I mentioned, I have a list of 26 amendments that we would like to \nclear--amendments offered by both sides. It is a package we could \nadopt. We have a couple of objections to doing that. If the Members who \nhave put forward those objections would be willing to release those \nobjections, we would be able to get another 26 amendments adopted, many \nof which have been offered by colleagues, as I said, on both sides and \nmany of which contain measures that I think will make the bill even \nstronger and make it a product we can all be proud of as it moves over \nto the House of Representatives. There, I hope it will receive \nconsideration and action and ultimately end up on the President's desk.\n  The FAA bill is legislation we have to do on a fairly routine basis \naround here. This authorization will stand for about 18 months. There \nare a number of important considerations that need to be addressed that \nthis bill not only acknowledges but addresses. As I mentioned, those \nconsiderations have to do with drone safety, which is an increasingly \nimportant issue in our economy and one where we need to make sure we \nhave the right rules of the air, if you will, in place so that we \npreserve and ensure that safety is the No. 1 factor as we continue to \nsee the increased research, development, and deployment of drone \ntechnologies in ways that have tremendous commercial application. As I \nsaid, it also includes a lot of passenger protections which are very \nconsumer-friendly in terms of passengers who travel on a regular basis \nwith the airlines. So those are things as well that we need to address \nin this legislation.\n  We enhanced the bill by amendment when it came to the floor with a \ncouple of safety provisions that we think are critically important, \nparticularly in light of what has happened of late with the attack in \nBrussels and a number of other attacks we have seen, where we have had \naviation insiders involved, if you will--particularly the Metrojet \nairliner that crashed not that long ago and killed 224 people. There \nare a number of safety provisions that help address some of those \nconcerns. As I said, we expand the TSA precheck program to limit the \nnumber of people who are in areas outside secure areas--outside the \nperimeter, so to speak--where they are more vulnerable to these types \nof attacks.\n  These are all included in this legislation. So from an aviation \nsecurity standpoint, this bill includes the most comprehensive security \nmeasures we will have adopted in nearly a decade. As I said before, \nfrom a passenger-friendly standpoint, according to a columnist at the \nWashington Post, this is one of the most passenger-friendly FAA \nreauthorization bills we have seen literally in a generation. So these \nare reasons why this bill needs to move forward.\n  I hope my colleagues here in the Senate, when the vote comes here in \na few minutes, will cast a vote in support of ending debate and allow \nus to move forward to a vote on final passage, which will enable this \nlegislation to move forward to the House of Representatives and I hope \nultimately to the President so he can sign it into law and put many of \nthese provisions in place that would be good for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Immigration Enforcement\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, I wish to pay tribute to Sarah \nRoot, a young woman from Iowa who just graduated from college with \nperfect grades. She was devoted to her family and friends and had a \nbright future, but she was taken from this earth too soon.\n  I want to express my sympathies to Sarah's parents and acknowledge \nMichelle Root, Sarah's mother, who is watching today. She will be \ntestifying tomorrow before the House Committee on the Judiciary at a \nhearing titled, ``The Real Victims of a Reckless and Lawless \nImmigration Policy: Families and Survivors Speak Out on the Real Cost \nof This Administration's Policies.''\n  The hearing will focus on how the Obama administration's failed \nimmigration policies allow thousands of criminal aliens to roam free.\n  Michelle Root will share her personal story about the loss of her \ndaughter and how someone in the country illegally was able to walk free \nand abscond from authorities after fatally hitting her daughter's \nvehicle on graduation night.\n  Sarah was 21 years old and had just graduated from Bellevue \nUniversity with an interest in pursuing a career in criminal justice. \nIn the words of her family, ``she was full of life and ready to take on \nthe world.'' According to a close friend of hers, Sarah was smart, \noutgoing, and dedicated to her friends and family. She embodied the \nwords: ``live, laugh, love.''\n  The day Sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver in the \ncountry illegally. The alleged drunk driver was Edwin Mejia, who had a \nblood alcohol\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\ncontent of more than three times the legal limit.\n  The driver was charged with felony motor vehicle homicide and \noperating a vehicle while intoxicated on February 3.\n  Bail was set at $50,000, but he was only required to put up 10 \npercent. So, for a mere $5,000, the drunk driver walked out of jail and \ninto the shadows.\n  This case has shed light on the breakdown between the Federal \nGovernment and State and locals. It has also been a terrible example of \nwhy the President's policies don't work, and how they are having a dire \neffect on American families like the Root family.\n  Under President Obama's Priority Enforcement Program, a person in the \ncountry illegally will only be detained or removed in a few limited \ncircumstances. The administration hides behind these so-called \n``priorities'' to ensure that a vast majority of people in the country \nare not removed. Some say that nearly 90,000 illegal immigrant \ncriminals were released in 2015 because of this policy.\n  The administration's polices result in tragedies like Sarah's.\n  A smart young lady who had a bright future was struck by a drunk \ndriver who entered the country illegally, and was turned over to a \nbrother who was also in the country illegally, while awaiting his \nimmigration court date.\n  After the accident, local law enforcement apparently asked the \nFederal government--specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement--to take custody of the driver, but the Federal government \ndeclined. ICE refused to place a detainer on him. An ICE spokesman \nstated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the man because his \narrest for felony motor vehicle homicide ``did not meet ICE's \nenforcement priorities.''\n  The driver made bond and absconded, never showing up for his hearings \nand required drug tests. It is difficult for the family to have closure \nsince the man is nowhere to be found. It is unknown if he is still in \nthe United States or if he has fled to his home country of Honduras.\n  Sarah Root is one of many victims who have been harmed or killed \nbecause of lax immigration enforcement and the notion that drunk \ndriving isn't always a public safety threat.\n  Even though this tragic accident happened in the heartland of \nAmerica, this is a border security problem. The driver of the vehicle \nthat killed Sarah entered the country illegally.\n  Every day, people are illegally entering the country, being removed, \nentering again, and committing more crimes. Illegal re-entries are \nhappening because there are no consequences. That is what happened in \nKate Steinle's death. And, that is why we need to move on Kate's law.\n  That bill would deter people from illegally re-entering by enhancing \npenalties and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for certain \nindividuals with previous felony convictions.\n  The Obama administration cannot continue to turn a blind eye to drunk \ndrivers, sanctuary communities, and people who ignore our laws, \noverstay their visas, or cross the border time and again.\n  I am still waiting for answers from the Obama administration on this \ncase, and many more. There are many unanswered questions.\n  How many more people have to die? How many more women and young \npeople are going to be taken from their family and friends?\n  Things have got to change. The President must rethink his policies \nand must find a way to ensure that criminal immigrants are taken off \nthe streets. The Obama administration should try enforcing the law, \ninstead of its priorities, for the sake of the American people.\n  I want to wish Michelle Root the best of luck while she is in \nWashington this week, and send my thoughts to her father who is trying \nto find justice back home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mrs. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise today to echo the sentiments shared \nby our senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Tomorrow morning, one \nof my constituents, Michelle Root, will be testifying before the House \nJudiciary Committee about the loss of her beautiful young daughter, \nSarah Root. As a mother of three daughters myself, I cannot begin to \nfathom the pain and anguish Mrs. Root is experiencing.\n  Earlier this year, 21-year-old Sarah Root was killed by a drunk \ndriver. That driver, Edwin Mejia, was allegedly drag racing with a \nblood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he \ncrashed into the back of Sarah's vehicle.\n  Edwin Mejia is also an illegal immigrant. After causing the death of \nan American citizen and being charged with motor vehicle homicide, one \nwould think he would clearly meet U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement's so-called enforcement priorities. But no, citing the \nadministration's November 2014 memo on immigration enforcement \npriorities, ICE declined to lodge a detainer and take custody of Mejia. \nDuring a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nhearing, ICE Director Sarah Saldana actually suggested that ICE \nneglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, \nSarah Root was seriously injured, not dead.\n  How twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an \nillegal immigrant who, while driving drunk and drag racing, hits and \neither seriously injures or kills an American citizen is not considered \na priority for deportation?\n  In fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing \nquestions from Senators from Nebraska and Iowa, as well as media \nattention and concerns raised by the Root family, did ICE finally \nacknowledge that they should have taken Mejia into custody. It should \nnot take all of those actions for ICE to determine that an illegal \nimmigrant who kills an American citizen should be removed from our \ncountry.\n  Tragically, after ICE declined to file a detainer against Mejia, he \nposted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. This is \nso despite the fact that he had a history of skipping court dates \nrelated to prior driving offenses.\n  A few weeks ago, I spoke with Sarah's dad, who told me that before \nthey could even lay their daughter to rest, Mejia was released. This is \ntruly an injustice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that we \nget answers in this case and prevent a similar tragedy from being \nreplicated elsewhere.\n  While America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we \nare also a nation of laws. It is a privilege to live in this country, \nand anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should \nwithout question constitute a priority for removal. For ICE to decide \notherwise is baffling.\n  In recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed Mejia \non their ``most wanted'' list and acknowledged they should have taken \nhim into custody.\n  The photograph of Sarah behind me was taken as she celebrated her \ngraduation from Bellevue University with a 4.0 GPA and a bachelor's \ndegree in criminal investigations and prepared to begin a bright \nfuture. The next day, she was killed.\n  While nothing can bring Sarah back, her family and friends deserve \nclear answers as to why Mejia was allowed to flee. This tragedy further \nunderscores the administration's failed immigration enforcement \npriorities and should serve to spur renewed discussion about their so-\ncalled priorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                   Filling the Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, there are a lot of people in this country \nwho work very, very hard. We are known in this country as a people who \nwork hard.\n  Montanans are no exception. We have some of the hardest working folks \nI know who live in that great State. Whether it is a farmer preparing \nthe spring crop or a fishing guide preparing for the upcoming tourist \nseason, my constituents know what a long day's work looks like. In \nfact, many of my constituents work two jobs so they can put food on the \ntable and a roof over their head and can save for their kid's college \neducation. These folks don't wake up in the morning and say: Hey, I \nthink I will take the year off and just sit it out.\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\n  That is why it is no surprise that when I went home for the March \nrecess, Montanans were overwhelmingly disgusted with the majority's \ndecision to refuse to do their job. Constituent after constituent asked \nme what the heck we were doing back here. Local editorial boards even \nchimed in.\n  The Billings Gazette, my State's largest newspaper, tore the majority \nto shreds, saying that those who crow about making Washington work \nbetter are intentionally sabotaging the system, making it work worse.\n  The Montana Standard, in ``Butte, America,'' accused Senators of \n``shirking their constitutional responsibilities'' and denounced their \ntactics as ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.''\n  If that wasn't enough, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle described the \ncrusade as ``nothing but an abdication of responsibility and another \nexample of the kind of playground-level obstruction that has soured so \nmany Americans on Congress and contributed to the divisive meltdown in \nthe race to the GOP nomination for President.''\n  Now here we are. It has been 33 days since Judge Garland was \nnominated to the Supreme Court--33 days and counting. Yet there are no \nhearings in sight, no chance for the American people to have their \nvoices heard through their elected representatives, no chance to ask \ntough questions of the nominee.\n  This week we will hear the majority leader talk about regular order \nwith respect to appropriations bills. But if regular order is good \nenough for appropriations bills, it is good enough for a Supreme Court \nnomination.\n  The bottom line is this. The American people are as frustrated as I \nam. They are fed up with the obstructionism, and they want Congress to \ndo its job.\n  So let's have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and then \nlet's have a vote in the Senate. As the Montana Standard says, anything \nless than that is ``a pretty shoddy way to do business.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, in about 8 minutes we are going to start \nthe vote on a motion for cloture, moving forward on the FAA bill. We \nhave had a lot of debate about this. It passed with very little \nobjection in the Commerce Committee. We have a package of 26 \namendments, all of which have been cleared. We hope that can go as a \nseparate amendment, almost like a managers' package. They are all \nnoncontroversial.\n  I am quite encouraged that we are making a number of reforms in the \nFAA that I have spoken about at length and that the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Thune, has spoken about at length. It is a good \nbill. Its previous adoption on a motion for cloture was something like \n94 to 4. So you see where we are going.\n  Then we will get into conference with the House, although it is my \nunderstanding they have not passed their bill. They passed it out of \ncommittee, but they have some controversial things. Hopefully, they \nwill get it out, and we will be able to come to terms and get this \nreauthorization of the FAA, which we had to extend in a short-term \nreauthorization, because the clock is ticking. So I just wanted to \nshare that with the Senate.\n\n\n                         Protecting the Manatee\n\n  Now, Mr. President, since we have some time and no Senator is seeking \nrecognition, I want to tell the Presiding Officer about a creature we \nhave in Florida. We have lots of interesting creatures. There are \nthings that come in that are like alien species, such as the Burmese \npython that they estimate--the Superintendent of Everglades National \nPark has estimated that there may be as many as 150,000. They got one \n15-foot female, and she had 54 eggs in her. So you see how prolific \nthey are.\n  You cannot find them. The only way you can really find them is if \nthere is a cold snap, because they will come out of the water, out of \nthe river of grass where they are so exquisitely camouflaged. In a cold \nsnap, they will come out of the water and up to the tree islands. Of \ncourse, you have seen some of those monsters--18 footers.\n  Well, they had another critter that we have, because in Florida we do \nhave alligators. Lo and behold, you may have seen this alligator. This \nalligator was 800 pounds and 15 feet long. He had been in a lake that \nwas created in a cattle pasture, and he had been eating cows, so he had \nplenty of food. Well, this alligator, of course, is a critter that is \nnative to Florida. It is the crocodile that is imported.\n  You can tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile \nbecause the alligator has a rounded snout and the crocodile has a \npointed one. All of this is to tell you we have another critter that is \nthe most loveable critter, and we have had it on the endangered list. \nThis is the animal called the manatee; some people call it a sea cow.\n  These adorable creatures breathe air but live in the water. They have \nlittle flippers and a big body. Of course, they have these lovable \nfaces. They have been endangered primarily because of boat propellers \ncutting them up. So we have had a serious effort at reducing the speeds \nof boats to a slow idle in manatee areas to protect them.\n  They also get bothered by cold water. When there is a cold snap, they \nwill migrate to warmer water. Pollution is another cause of the manatee \nbeing endangered.\n  There has been a comeback. Around 20 years ago, there were only 1,200 \nof them in the world. That population has grown upward to 6,000.\n  Here is the point: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to take \nthem off the endangered list and put them into a lesser category. Those \nof us who want to protect these critters don't want them to come off \nthe endangered list. If I had thought enough in advance, I would have \nbrought a picture of a manatee. They are the most loveable critters. \nYou can get in the water, you can swim with them, and you can feed \nthem. When you feed them a pellet of food, they nibble like a horse \nnibbles sugar out of your hand--all of this under water.\n  They are the most adorable critters. They love to be rubbed on their \ntummies. They love fresh water. In a brackish water system, where you \ncan take a fresh water hose, they will come up and just drink the \nwater, and then they will roll over so you can spray them underneath \ntheir flippers.\n  Thank goodness they have rebounded, but there is a lot more to \nrebound. So, I wanted to share our crusade--our efforts to try to keep \nthe manatee on the endangered list and to protect them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3680\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Texas\n\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, today the Supreme Court heard oral \narguments in United States v. Texas. This case is a challenge to \nPresident Obama's Executive actions to prioritize U.S. immigration \nenforcement.\n  In 2012, the President used his legal authority to establish the \nDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program, or DACA. DACA has given \nnearly 700,000 undocumented young people the opportunity to come out of \nthe shadows to pursue their dreams through education and jobs.\n  In 2014, again acting within existing legal authority, the President \nannounced an expansion of the successful DACA Program. He also created \na new Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent \nResidents Program, or DAPA. DAPA allows the undocumented parents of \nU.S.-born and legal permanent resident children, the majority of whom \nare U.S. citizens, to stay in this country with their families.\n  Together, the expanded DACA and DAPA were expected to enable nearly 5 \nmillion people to come out of the shadows without fear of deportation. \nUnfortunately, Texas and 25 other States have challenged the \nPresident's authority to issue these Executive orders, resulting in the \nSupreme Court hearing today.\n  Hundreds of DREAMers, Muslim students, and activists from California, \nNew York, New Jersey, and elsewhere rallied on the Supreme Court steps \nthis morning. I spoke with them and heard their stories and their hopes \nthat the Supreme Court would make the right decision in support of the \nPresident and the millions of DACA and DAPA families. Many carried \nsigns and stickers that read ``Keep families together.'' Keeping \nfamilies together is at the crux of the President's Executive orders--\nfamilies like that of Gabriela Andrade, who, as a teenager, fled \nviolence in Brazil and settled in Texas before coming to Hawaii. While \nGabriela's sister and parents were granted visas through a lottery \nsystem, Gabriela fell through the cracks. Until President Obama \nannounced the DACA Program, she lived in fear of being separated from \nher entire family. She said:\n\n       DACA pulled me out of limbo and gave me a life again. It \n     allowed me to go back to school to pursue a bachelor's degree \n     in political science, to volunteer with several local \n     organizations.\n\n  Today, Gabriela is an advocate for DREAMers like herself. President \nObama's DAPA and expanded DACA Programs would help thousands of \nfamilies like Gabriela's who want to stay together and be contributing \nmembers of our communities without the daily fear of deportation. To \ntear undocumented parents away from their children and put these U.S.-\nborn children in foster care is unconscionable. To deport people who \nwere brought here when they were very young--to essentially tear them \naway from the United States, the only home and country they have \nknown--is also unconscionable.\n  These young people would be facing insurmountable odds, and I can \ncertainly relate to some of the challenges they face. When I was almost \n8 years old, my mother, brothers, and I legally immigrated to the \nUnited States. When we first arrived in Hawaii, we certainly struggled. \nI had to navigate the public school system without speaking a word of \nEnglish. My mother worked low-paying jobs with no job security, and we \nstruggled to make ends meet. But we took strength in being together as \na family.\n  However, in addition to facing the kind of challenges my whole family \nfaced when we first arrived in this country, DACA and DAPA families \nlive in constant fear that they will be ripped apart through \ndeportation. These families and children have been living in limbo for \nover a year while the legal challenges work their way through the \nsystem, through the courts.\n  In addition, United States v. Texas is also pushing DREAMers who are \neligible for the original DACA Program, which is not being challenged, \nfurther into the shadows.\n  Singai Masiya, who heads the Aloha DREAM Team in my home State and is \na DREAMer himself, told my office that DACA-eligible people in Hawaii \nstopped applying for DACA. Why? They are afraid that if the Court rules \nagainst President Obama's Executive actions, their application \ninformation will be used to deport them. This is a real fear in our \ncommunities.\n  United States v. Texas not only affects the lives of the more than \n7,000 DACA- and DAPA-eligible Hawaii residents, it affects our economy. \nOver 10 years, DACA, DAPA, and expanded DACA are projected to provide a \n$276 million cumulative increase in Hawaii's State gross domestic \nproduct. The Center for American Progress also projects that, over 10 \nyears, DACA, DAPA, and DACA expansion would provide a $136 million \nincrease in the combined earnings of Hawaii's residents. However, in \norder to see these economic benefits, the Justices of the Supreme Court \nmust rule on the side of DREAMers and the DAPA families. My hope is \nthat the Supreme Court rules that the President is well within his \nlegal authority in expanding DACA and DAPA and allows these Executive \nactions to be implemented.\n  I note, however, that Executive actions, important as they are, are \nnot enough. The President himself has called on Congress to fix our \nbroken immigration system so that 11 million undocumented people in our \ncountry can come out of the shadows and live and work openly.\n  It has been almost 3 years since the Senate passed bipartisan, \ncomprehensive immigration reform. I call upon Congress to do our jobs \nand enact fair, humane, and sensible immigration reform--recognizing \nthat we are, indeed, a country of immigrants. That fact is at the very \nroot of our strength as a nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Public \nLaw 114-74, included an instruction to the chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on the Budget to file allocations, aggregates, and budgetary \nlevels in the Senate after April 15, 2016. Today, I wish to submit the \nrequired filing found in that act.\n  Specifically, section 102 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 \nrequires the chairman to file: No. 1, an allocation for fiscal year \n2017 for the Committee on Appropriations; No. 2, an allocation for \nfiscal years 2017, 2017 through 2021, and 2017 through 2026 for \ncommittees other than the Committee on Appropriations; No. 3, aggregate \nspending levels for fiscal year 2017; No. 4, aggregate revenue levels \nfor fiscal years 2017, 2017 through 2021, and 2017 through 2026; and \nNo. 5, aggregate levels of outlays and revenue for fiscal years 2017, \n2017 through 2021, and 2017 through 2026 for Social Security.\n  The figures included in this filing are consistent with the \ndiscretionary spending limits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of \n2015 and the most recent baseline from the Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO. CBO's last baseline was released on March 24, 2016.\n  In addition to the update for enforceable limits above, section \n102(c) of the act allows for the matter contained in subtitles A and B \nof title IV of S. Con. Res. 11, the fiscal year 2016 congressional \nbudget resolution, to be updated by 1 fiscal year. Pursuant to this \nauthority, all reserve funds available to the Senate in title IV of \nlast year's budget resolution are updated and available for use.\n  For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is \nfound in section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21, the fiscal year 2008 \ncongressional budget resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard \nto zero for all fiscal years.\n  All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables detailing \nenforcement in the Senate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,

Mr. President, today I wish to bring renewed attention \nto the continued violence perpetrated by Boko Haram against women and \nchildren.\n  It has now been 2 years since the horrific kidnapping of 279 school \ngirls in Nigeria. In the aftermath of this brazen attack, Senator \nMikulski and I, joined by the other women in the Senate, strongly \nadvocated for the imposition of sanctions on Boko Haram, and the \ninternational community responded by doing just that. We were grateful \nfor Secretary Kerry's swift action to get this done at the United \nNations, and Boko Haram is now subject to a complete asset freeze, \ntravel ban, and arms embargo.\n  In addition, the Senate unanimously passed legislation that I \nauthored to require a comprehensive, 5-year strategy to combat Boko \nHaram at the end of last year. Next week, I am sending a letter signed \nby many of the cosponsors of this legislation to our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives, urging them to take up this important \nmeasure.\n  Nevertheless, Boko Haram has continued to wage its relentless war on \ninnocent civilians in Nigeria and throughout the Lake Chad Basin since \nit declared its allegiance to ISIS last year. More women and more girls \nhave been kidnapped. Although some of the\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\ncaptives have escaped, most are still lost, likely subjected to forced \nmarriages, religious conversions, sexual trafficking, slavery, and \npossibly forced to carry out suicide bombings on behalf of Boko Haram.\n  According to UNICEF, 39 out of 89 Boko Haram suicide bombings in 2015 \nwere carried out by women, and the number of children involved in \nsuicide bombings increased tenfold in just one year. The fact that \nchildren are being used as weapons in Boko Haram's terror campaign \nspeaks to the inhumanity and total disregard for life that is at the \ncore of this terrorist group's perverse ideology. As Boko Haram \nincreasingly relies upon women and children to carry out its attacks, \nsurvivors who have lived through such unimaginable ordeals are often \nmet with suspicion when they return to their communities. Such \nmarginalization extends their suffering.\n  In a letter to Nigeria's bishops, Pope Francis wrote: ``Do not grow \ntired of doing what is right.'' He urged: ``Go forward on the way of \npeace. Accompany the victims! Come to the aid of the poor! Teach the \nyouth!'' I could not agree more. We must keep fighting to ensure that \nall Nigerians can live in peace and that young girls everywhere can \npursue an education without fear of violence or intimidation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2122-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DECISIONS DAY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize that Saturday, \nApril 16, 2016, was National Healthcare Decisions Day. National \nHealthcare Decisions Day exists to inspire, educate, and empower the \npublic and providers about the importance of advance care planning. \nStarted by a Richmond attorney as a local grassroots initiative in \nVirginia, NHDD became an annual event in 2008, and today it is \nrecognized across all 50 States. Faith-based groups, doctors and \nnurses, hospitals, patients, and caregivers alike are engaged in these \nefforts. NHDD is an opportunity for all Americans to discuss their \npreferences and goals with family and friends--and this starts with \nfilling out an advance directive.\n  In the last year, we have made real progress in giving Americans \naccess to the clear, consistent, and concise information they need to \nmake critical health care decisions, and there is a growing awareness \nof the need to transform advanced care, both among providers and \nfamilies.\n  In my own State of Virginia, the general assembly recently designated \nApril as Advance Care Planning Month. Around the Commonwealth, \nVirginians are innovating and creating new models of care to provide \npatients with the tools and support to make their own advanced care \ndecisions. For example, the Richmond Academy of Medicine's Honoring \nChoices Initiative is a partnership with three major health care \nsystems working to adopt nationally recognized best practices and \nadapting them to the needs of patients, families, doctors, and \nhospitals in central Virginia. On the ground, Virginians are holding \ndozens of events this month to encourage individuals to fill out an \nadvance directive.\n  This year has been a significant one at the national level as well. \nFor the first time, Medicare providers are being compensated for \nspending time with their patients to discuss their health care \ndecisions. And I am pleased that the bipartisan Care Planning Act, \nwhich I introduced again this last year with Senator Isakson, has \ngained more support than ever, including from nearly 90 health and \nsenior advocacy groups. The purpose of the Care Planning Act is to \nalign the care people want with the level of care they get. It doesn't \nlimit choices; it works to make sure people are made fully aware of the \nbroad range of choices they have. The growing support for this \nlegislation demonstrates just how far the conversation around advance \ncare planning has come. While physician reimbursement is an important \nfirst step, the Care Planning Act provides a strong, bipartisan \nfoundation for Congress as we consider how to further empower patients \nto make informed choices about their own care.\n  I am working to advance this conversation wherever I can. For \nexample, Senator Isakson and I are cochairs of the Finance Committee's \nbipartisan chronic care working group, and we are looking at a broad \nrange of policies so that chronically ill patients receive the highest \nquality care at all stages of illness, especially towards the end of \nlife. We are not going to pass the Care Planning Act in full as a part \nof that process, but I see this process as a real way to move the ball \nforward. While this process remains a work in progress, I am hopeful \nthat we will be able to get some of these bipartisan provisions done.\n  I know how important this is not just from my time serving as a \nGovernor and as a Senator but through the eyes of a loved one who \nstruggled with these issues. My own mother suffered from Alzheimer's \ndisease for 10 years, and for 9 of those years, she couldn't speak. My \nfather, sister, and I found grappling with the challenges of caring for \nher difficult. The difficulty was greater because, when she was first \ndiagnosed, my family didn't take the opportunity to talk in an honest \nand fully informed way with her and her health care providers about the \nfull array of health care options available or about what her \npriorities would be during the final years of her life.\n  Care planning is a subject that most people do their best to avoid, \nbut on National Healthcare Decisions Day, I urge all Americans to fill \nout an advance directive and to have these conversations. I also urge \nmy fellow policymakers to continue engaging in this dialogue to improve \nadvanced care planning at all levels--Federal, State, local--so that at \nthe end of the day, we are empowering Americans and their loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2122-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES WAGNER\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize in \nthe Record James W. Wagner, a leader at the helm of one of Georgia's \ngreat institutions of higher education, Emory University.\n  After 13 years as president of Emory University, Mr. Wagner will soon \nbe stepping down from his position. I feel I would be remiss if I did \nnot mark some of his achievements at Emory here in the Record, as the \nsuccess of Emory University and its students has made a difference to \nour Nation.\n  Emory University's reputation as a private research university that \nhas led in academic, research, and health care eminence extends far \nbeyond its beautiful campus, which is headquartered in the beautiful \nDruid Hills neighborhood of Atlanta, GA. President Wagner has enhanced \nthe school's reputation, recruiting a world-class and diverse community \nof scholars and researchers who have secured an increased number of \nappointments to national academies and an increased amount of external \nresearch funding that added up to more than $570 million in 2015.\n  President Wagner guided the Emory community in developing the \nuniversity's first vision statement, which established the foundation \nfor a 10-year strategic plan focused on strengthening faculty \ndistinction, ensuring the highest student quality, enhancing the \nstudent experience, and exploring new frontiers in science and \ntechnology.\n  President Wagner also led a fundraising campaign that resulted in the \ninvestment of $1.7 billion in support of the university's initiatives \nin teaching, research, scholarship, patient care, and social action.\n  In short, President Wagner has advanced all aspects of the \nuniversity's mission through the innovative design and construction of \na number of new facilities to support health sciences research, science \neducation, residential life, library resources, and patient care.\n  I hope that President Wagner and I will remain in touch wherever his \nnext step takes him, and I wish him and his wife, Debbie, the very \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2122-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2122-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2122-S2123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2123-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 3:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1670.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Kansas urging the federal \n     government to require the use of sound science in evaluating \n     crop protection chemistries and nutrients; to the Committee \n     on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 6045\n\n       Whereas, Agriculture is crucial to the continued production \n     of food, feed, fiber and energy to meet both domestic and \n     global demand; and\n       Whereas, In the United States, the agriculture and value-\n     added industries and businesses utilize precision farming \n     equipment, crop protection chemistries, genetic engineering \n     or enhancement, agricultural nutrients and other modern \n     technologies. Such advanced practices protect the safety of \n     the public and reduce environmental and natural resource \n     impacts, while increasing yields, improving profitability and \n     ensuring an abundant, affordable and wholesome food supply; \n     and\n       Whereas, Agricultural production systems and crop \n     protection are among the most studied and highly regulated of \n     all industries, at both the state and federal levels. The use \n     of sound science should be the bedrock of our nation's \n     regulatory scheme for the agriculture and food production \n     industries, as these industries are critical to the economic \n     vitality of Kansas and the United States: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas: That we support the use of sound science to study and \n     regulate modern agricultural technologies such as crop \n     protection chemistries and genetically engineered or enhanced \n     traits and nutrients; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we oppose legislative or regulatory action \n     at any level that may result in unnecessary restrictions on \n     the use of modern agricultural technologies.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-148. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas urging the President of the United \n     States to obey the United States Constitution and declare \n     that the detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay \n     will remain; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5024\n\n       Whereas, The President of the United States, Barack Obama, \n     has threatened to move the terrorist detainees currently held \n     at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to Fort Leavenworth without \n     regard to the wishes or the safety of the people of Kansas; \n     and\n       Whereas, The President has threatened to close the \n     detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay; and\n       Whereas, The threat of the transfer has been underscored by \n     visits to Fort Leavenworth by officials of his \n     Administration, preparing for the threatened transfer; and\n       Whereas, Many detainees that have been released have \n     continued to fight against this country and its allies; and\n       Whereas, This President and others have insisted that the \n     mere existence of the detention facility at Guantanamo has \n     inflamed terrorists around the world and aided in their \n     recruitments; and\n       Whereas, Transferring the detainees to Fort Leavenworth \n     will only transfer the ire of terrorists worldwide from \n     Guantanamo to Fort Leavenworth; and\n       Whereas, This President has a demonstrated willingness to \n     violate American law; and\n       Whereas, This President has said that he will go around the \n     Congress to accomplish his agenda; and\n       Whereas, Closing the Naval Station at Guantanamo has been \n     high on this President's agenda since before he was first \n     elected; and\n       Whereas, The President has continually sought to weaken our \n     standing in the world; and\n       Whereas, The terrorists have demonstrated an ability and \n     willingness to conduct attacks in America, in furtherance of \n     their savage war against America; and\n       Whereas, Detonating large bombs in civilian communities in \n     the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth would be exactly the sort of \n     demonstration that the terrorists would try; and\n       Whereas, Fort Leavenworth does not have the necessary \n     facilities to hold and care for the detainees and would, for \n     example, be forced to transport them through the city of \n     Leavenworth to access medical care, thereby presenting \n     additional soft, tempting targets for attacks; and\n       Whereas, The surrounding community does not have the law \n     enforcement, emergency response resources or the physical \n     capability to harden potential civilian targets in the \n     surrounding area. Transferring detainees to Fort Leavenworth \n     represents a predictable, direct and unnecessarily high risk \n     to American citizens in the vicinity of Fort Leavenworth; and\n       Whereas, The Naval Station at Guantanamo is a high security \n     facility designed to both house high risk detainees and be \n     secure from attack by external forces. This facility has not \n     been the object of an external terrorist attack and, if it \n     had been attacked, it would not have represented a threat to \n     American civilians or communities; and\n       Whereas, The intentional placement of detainees on American \n     soil, physically within an American community, would \n     unnecessarily and intentionally put American citizens at much \n     greater risk. It follows that any move by the President or \n     other members of the Federal, State or local government to \n     move the detainees to Fort Leavenworth would mean \n     intentionally and knowingly placing American citizens at \n     greater risk, in violation of the government's sworn oath to \n     support and defend them against enemies, foreign or domestic; \n     and\n       Whereas, Officers from over one hundred countries attend \n     classes at Fort Leavenworth; and\n       Whereas, Many of these officers would not bring their \n     families nor be permitted by their countries to attend, if \n     the detainees were transferred to Fort Leavenworth, thereby \n     hurting the local economy; and\n       Whereas, These officers and their families represent an \n     important bond and link among our nations. Their loss will \n     not just affect the local economy, but would potentially have \n     grave impacts on our future ability to effectively and \n     successfully find peaceful solutions to international \n     problems: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas urges the President of the United \n     States to obey the Constitution of the United States and the \n     laws of this country, the people of which have placed him in \n     a position of great trust and responsibility and depend upon \n     him to ensure that the laws be upheld and that their security \n     be maintained; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President must declare that the \n     detention facility at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay will \n     remain, and that the detainees will continue to be held \n     there, until said detainees are given proper, lawful \n     disposition, in accordance with the Laws of War and the best \n     interests of the safety of the people of the United States \n     and their allies.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-149. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urging the United States \n     Congress to modernize the federal cap on the locally set \n     Passenger Facility Charges user fee by setting it at $8.50 \n     and adjusting it periodically to offset the impacts of \n     inflation; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 261\n\n       Whereas, In 2010, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's public \n     use airports supported approximately 304,000 jobs, generated \n     $9.2 billion in annual payroll and produced $23.6 billion in \n     annual economic activities; and\n       Whereas, In 1990, the Congress of the United States \n     authorized Passenger Facility Charges (PFCs), local user fees \n     collected for every boarded passenger, to help airports of \n     all sizes meet their capital needs to finance Federal \n     Aviation Administration (FAA) approved projects such as \n     terminals, parking and multimodal projects that enhance \n     safety, security, capacity, noise reduction or increase air \n     carrier competition; and\n       Whereas, PFCs are locally determined fees collected at the \n     point of sale, which do not affect Federal expenditures; and\n       Whereas, The PFC cap was last raised in 2000 when Congress \n     set it at $4.50; and\n       Whereas, Inflation has eroded the buying power of PFCs by \n     approximately one-half since then due to rising construction \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, There is a growing recognition of the need for \n     infrastructure finance and funding to keep pace with \n     inflation and action for doing so such as the act of November \n     25, 2014 (P.L. 974, No. 89) in the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania; and\n       Whereas, Modernizing the PFC cap to $8.50 now and indexing \n     it for inflation would restore its original purchasing power \n     and provide local communities with the ability to set their \n     individual PFC user fees based on locally determined needs \n     for ensuring the safety and security of their airports; and\n       Whereas, Over the next five years, airports will require \n     more than $75 billion to improve infrastructure to prevent \n     passenger delays and congestion; and\n       Whereas, Direct Federal funding through the FAA Airport \n     Improvement Program has declined 10% over the past six years \n     and covers only a fraction of the total infrastructure \n     projects required to upgrade and maintain the world-class \n     aviation system: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania urge the Congress of the United States to \n     modernize the Federal cap on the locally set PFC user fee by \n     setting it at $8.50 and adjusting it periodically to offset \n     the impacts of inflation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution to be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the presiding officers of \n     each house of\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\n     Congress and to each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-150. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to ensure \n     the continued appropriation of watercraft inspection station \n     funding in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly \n     enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to \n     implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and \n     Development Act; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 104\n\n       Whereas, maintaining a healthy suite of economic, \n     environmental and social ecosystem services in aquatic \n     systems is integral to the quality of life in the State of \n     Idaho; and\n       Whereas, healthy aquatic habitats provide clean drinking \n     water, flood control, transportation, recreation, \n     purification of human and industrial wastes, power \n     generation, habitat for native plants and animals, production \n     of fish and other foods, marketable goods and cultural \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, Dreissenid mussels, specifically quagga mussels \n     (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra mussels \n     (Dreissena polymorpha), are aquatic invasive species that \n     cause irreparable ecological damage to many waters in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Dreissenids have not yet been detected in the \n     Pacific Northwest. The estimated annual cost to address \n     established populations of Dreissenids in the Pacific \n     Northwest Economic Region is almost $0.5 billion annually; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act was \n     signed in June 2014. Section 1039 of the act authorizes $20 \n     million for Columbia River Basin watercraft inspection \n     stations to prevent introduction of Dreissenid mussels and \n     other aquatic invasive species through the Secretary of the \n     Army; and\n       Whereas, the fiscal year 2016 budget for the United States \n     Army Corps of Engineers includes $4 million in funding for \n     watercraft inspection stations as authorized by the Water \n     Resources Reform and Development Act, and the State of Idaho \n     and Pacific Northwest Economic Region are grateful for the \n     Corps' recognition of the severity of the threat of aquatic \n     invasive species to the region and dedication to assist the \n     region in enhancing prevention efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that we respectfully \n     request that Congress ensure the continued appropriation of \n     these funds in the fiscal year 2017 budget to significantly \n     enhance aquatic invasive species prevention efforts and to \n     implement the intent of the Water Resources Reform and \n     Development Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the United States, the Secretary \n     of the Army, the Secretary of the Interior, the President of \n     the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of \n     Congress, and the congressional delegation representing the \n     State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-151. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Ohio encouraging the \n     President of the United States, the United States Congress, \n     and the United States Office of Management and Budget to \n     support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, \n     Michigan, and encourage the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers to take expeditious action in preparing an Economic \n     Reevaluation Report; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                      House Resolution Number 263\n\n       Whereas, The Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, are \n     of the utmost importance to Ohio and play a critical role in \n     the nation's economy and security. Each year, approximately \n     10,000 Great Lakes vessels, carrying 80 million tons of iron \n     ore, coal, grain, and other cargo, safely and efficiently \n     traverse the locks; and\n       Whereas, Nearly 80% of all domestic iron ore, the primary \n     material used to manufacture steel, travels from mines in \n     Minnesota and Michigan's Upper Peninsula through the Soo \n     Locks to steel producers in Ohio; and\n       Whereas, Only one of the four Soo Locks, the Poe Lock, is \n     large enough to accommodate the modem vessels that commonly \n     traverse the Great Lakes. 70% of cargo is carried on these \n     large ships that can only pass through the Poe Lock, and the \n     remaining cargo must pass through the smaller MacArthur Lock. \n     The 100-year-old Davis and Sabin Locks are rarely used as \n     they are the smallest locks and cannot accommodate large \n     modem vessels; and\n       Whereas, The continued reliance on only the Poe Lock poses \n     a serious risk to national security and the economies of not \n     only the State of Ohio, but also the entire country. A long-\n     term outage of the Poe Lock due to lock failure or a \n     terrorist attack could cripple the economy and disrupt steel \n     production in the United States. It is estimated that a 30-\n     day outage of the Poe Lock would result in economic losses of \n     $160 million; and\n       Whereas, Upgrades to the Soo Locks are needed to ensure \n     national security and unfettered commerce through the Great \n     Lakes. The United States Army Corps of Engineers acknowledges \n     that the Soo Locks are a single point of failure for the \n     Great Lakes Navigation System; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress has authorized the \n     construction of a second Poe-sized lock, but a study that \n     contains crucial errors is preventing the construction from \n     proceeding: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That we, the members of the House of \n     Representatives of the 131st General Assembly of the State of \n     Ohio, encourage the President and the Congress of the United \n     States and the United States Office of Management and Budget \n     to support plans to upgrade the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. \n     Marie, Michigan; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we encourage the United States Army Corps of \n     Engineers to take expeditious action in acknowledging the \n     national security need for maintaining the Great Lakes \n     Navigation System in addition to properly accounting for the \n     limitation of transportation resources if a lock outage \n     occurs in the preparation of an Economic Reevaluation Report; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Representatives \n     transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the \n     President of the United States, the President Pro Tempore and \n     Secretary of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk \n     of the United States House of Representatives, the members of \n     the Ohio congressional delegation, the Director of the United \n     States Office of Management and Budget, and the Assistant \n     Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-152. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming urging the United States Congress to \n     seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations \n     from listing under the Endangered Species Act and to assist \n     in funding programs and services for gray wolf and grizzly \n     bear management; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 4\n\n       Whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear predation on livestock \n     and big game species is resulting in economic losses in the \n     state of Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, the cost to manage gray wolves and grizzly bears \n     and to compensate individuals and entities for damage caused \n     by these species is significantly greater than can be \n     sustained through existing budgets of the responsible state \n     and federal agencies; and\n       Whereas, gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are \n     recovered and these species should therefore be removed from \n     the list of experimental nonessential population, endangered \n     species or threatened species in Wyoming in order for the \n     state to effectively manage these species; and\n       Whereas, federal funding is essential to assist the state \n     in compensating individuals and entities for losses caused by \n     gray wolves and grizzly bears now and after the date these \n     species are removed from the list of experimental \n     nonessential population, endangered species or threatened \n     species in Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, such federal support in compensating individuals \n     and entities for losses will increase acceptance of these \n     wildlife species in Wyoming and continue the healthy and \n     self-sustaining populations of gray wolves and grizzly bears \n     in the state: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress \n     and the United States Fish and Wildlife Services to speedily \n     seek removal of the gray wolf and grizzly bear populations \n     from the list of experimental nonessential population, \n     endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming, by all \n     means available.\n       Section 2. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress \n     to immediately and fully fund all necessary programs and \n     services for gray wolf and grizzly bear management, \n     particularly programs and services to compensate individuals \n     and entities for losses caused by these wildlife species.\n       Section 3. That the Wyoming legislature calls on Congress \n     to assist in funding the necessary programs and services \n     indicated in section 2 of this resolution after the date the \n     gray wolf and grizzly bear populations are removed from the \n     list of experimental nonessential population, endangered \n     species of threatened species in Wyoming.\n       Section 4. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress, to \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation and to the Director of \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-153. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan supporting the recommendations of the Chicago Area \n     Waterway System Advisory Committee to prevent Asian carp from \n     entering the Great Lakes; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, The Chicago Area Waterway System serves as a \n     pathway for aquatic invasive species to move between the \n     Great Lakes and Mississippi River basins. Zebra mussels and \n     other species spread from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi \n     River and its tributaries through this man-made connection. \n     Now, Asian carp are on the brink of using this same route to \n     invade the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River basin; and\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n       Whereas, Asian carp continue to migrate upstream and are \n     now within a day's swim of Lake Michigan. In the last year, \n     juvenile Asian carp have moved 66 miles closer to Lake \n     Michigan, leaving them only 76 miles from the Great Lakes. \n     While electrical barriers currently stand in their way, new \n     research indicates that those barriers may not be effective \n     at stopping small fish; and\n       Whereas, The impacts of Asian carp to the ecosystems and \n     economies of the Great Lakes states and local communities \n     will be catastrophic. Invasive species established in the \n     Great Lakes already cost the region more than $100 million \n     per year. Asian carp could add dramatically to this cost if \n     they move through the Chicago area into the Great Lakes. \n     These carp are voracious filter feeders and could out-compete \n     the native fish of the Great Lakes, threatening a $7 billion \n     sport and commercial fishery. History has demonstrated that, \n     once established, aquatic invasive species like Asian carp \n     are nearly impossible to eradicate; and\n       Whereas, The Chicago Area Waterway System Advisory \n     Committee was formed in May 2014 with the goal of reaching \n     consensus on a set of recommendations for elected and \n     appointed local, state, and federal officials and the public \n     on short- and long-term measures to prevent Asian carp and \n     other aquatic invasive species from moving between the Great \n     Lakes and Mississippi River basins through the Chicago Area \n     Waterway System; and\n       Whereas. The diverse, 32-member advisory committee reached \n     consensus in a letter to the President of the United States \n     on a specific system of control points to prevent the two-way \n     interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species. It also \n     reached consensus on supporting immediate actions at the \n     Brandon Road Lock and Dam in Joliet, Illinois, to prevent the \n     risk of Asian carp from migrating upstream while the system \n     of control points is evaluated as a long-term solution for \n     all aquatic invasive species; and\n       Whereas, The best long-term solution will prevent Asian \n     carp from entering the Great Lakes while preserving as much \n     as possible the current uses of the Chicago area waterways. \n     Options that would change shipping on these waterways should \n     only be pursued after all other options have been exhausted; \n     and\n       Whereas, The costs of preventing Asian carp from entering \n     the Great Lakes are substantially lower than the costs to the \n     ecosystems and economies of the Great Lakes states if Asian \n     carp were to become established: now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we support the Chicago Area \n     Waterway System Advisory Committee recommendations to \n     implement immediate control technologies at Brandon Road Lock \n     and Dam in Joliet, Illinois, and to further investigate the \n     specific system of control points for long-term movement of \n     aquatic invasive species into and out of the Great Lakes; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, and the Commanding General and Chief of Engineers \n     of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-154. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan memorializing the \n     United States Congress to take actions necessary to help \n     families enduring mental health crisis; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 169\n\n       Whereas, According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, mental illness is defined as ``health conditions \n     that are characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or \n     behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with \n     distress and/or impaired function.'' The National Institute \n     of Mental Health states, ``while mental disorders are common \n     in the United States, the burden of illness is particularly \n     concentrated among those who experience disability due to \n     serious mental illness (SMI)''; and\n       Whereas, Laws, regulations, and misinterpretations \n     frequently shut out families attempting to get effective and \n     appropriate treatment for their loved ones in a mental health \n     crisis. In a given year, approximately ten million Americans \n     endure serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, major \n     depression, or bipolar disorder. Approximately four million \n     Americans battle with serious mental illness do not receive \n     treatment in a given year; and\n       Whereas, Families struggling with mental illness must also \n     grapple with the likelihood that their loved one will end up \n     in jail or prison where there is virtually no mental health \n     treatment. There are ten times more individuals with serious \n     mental illness in jails and prisons than in state psychiatric \n     hospitals. Moreover, federal laws and billing policies \n     restrict the ability of persons on Medicaid to receive high-\n     quality inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment; and\n       Whereas, Current spending needs to be more focused on the \n     most effective services and most severe mental illnesses. \n     Passage of federal legislation like the Helping Families in \n     Mental Health Crisis Act of 2015 (H.R. 2646), sponsored by \n     United States Congressman Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania, would \n     be a positive first step. The bill would create a new \n     Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use \n     Disorders to coordinate funding between agencies, collect \n     increased data on treatment outcomes, and drive evidence-\n     based care: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to take actions \n     necessary to help families enduring mental health crisis; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-155. A joint memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the United States Congress to \n     restructure the United States Postal Service in a way that \n     would reopen shuttered mail processing plants throughout the \n     nation and provide acceptable delivery times; to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                     Senate Joint Memorial No. 105\n\n       Whereas, the mail processing function of the post office in \n     Pocatello, Idaho, was closed on or about April 19, 2015; and\n       Whereas, Brian Sperry, the regional spokesman for the \n     United States Postal Service (USPS) stated that the impacts \n     would be that stamped ``First-Class Mail'' would take between \n     two and three days to reach its destination; and\n       Whereas, mail delivery in eastern Idaho is now \n     significantly delayed, with delays ranging from a few days up \n     to a few weeks; and\n       Whereas, USPS has already closed or suspended services in \n     many locations nationwide, including in Twin Falls, Idaho, \n     and is considering closing more; and\n       Whereas, USPS can provide better delivery times while still \n     cutting substantive costs by restructuring its pre-funding \n     for retirement benefits: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-third Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives concurring therein, that Congress should \n     pass legislation that would direct USPS to restructure their \n     budget priorities, rethink their administrative model, make \n     appropriate budget cuts if necessary, focus on customer \n     service and acceptable delivery times, and reopen shuttered \n     mail processing plants throughout the United States; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate be, and she is \n     hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this \n     Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives of this Congress, and the \n     congressional delegation representing the State of Idaho in \n     the Congress of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/18/senate-section/article/S2127-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KIRK, from the Committee on Appropriations, without \n     amendment:\n       S. 2806.
