Mr. President, the Senate has demonstrated that the \nHouse-passed bill lacks the support of 60 Senators. I would urge a \n``yes'' vote on the 2-month extension. Senator Burr, the chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee, and Senator Feinstein, the ranking member, \nas we all know, have been working on a proposal that they think would \nimprove the version that the Senate has not accepted that the House \nsent over. It would allow the committee to work on this bill, refine \nit, and bring it before us for consideration. So the 2-month extension, \nit strikes me, would be in the best interest of getting an outcome that \nis acceptable to both the Senate and the House and hopefully the \nPresident.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So I would urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

We know what is going on overseas. We \nknow what has been tried here at home. Do we really want this law to \nexpire?\n  We have 1 week to discuss it. We will have 1 day to do it. So we \nbetter be ready next Sunday afternoon to prevent the country from being \nin danger by the total expiration of the program we are all familiar \nwith.\n  Unless there is objection, and I understand there is not an \nobjection, we will pass the highway extension on a voice vote tonight \nand we will be back in session Sunday a week.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. We would be happy to cooperate in passing a surface \ntransportation bill by voice, but I do say this--and I mentioned this \nto my colleague away from the microphones. For those of us living in \nthe West, we cannot get back on a Sunday afternoon. I think it is very \ndifficult for us to get back here on a weekday before 5 o'clock, so I \nwould hope on a Sunday we wouldn't be expecting the Senate to come in \nsession before 5 o'clock because we can't get here.\n  I am protecting the western part of my caucus, which is pretty big, \nbut I am not going to agree to anything unless we can come in at least \nafter 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, as my friend the Democratic leader knows, I \nwould be happy to work with him on that. He also knows I just tried to \nget a short-term extension of a variety of different lengths in order \nnot to put us in this position, but we are left with this option only.\n  We will work with the Democratic leader about the actual time, but \nthe law expires at midnight Sunday a week. I doubt if there are many of \nus comfortable with that--maybe a handful--but we need to act \nresponsibly here on behalf of the American people.\n  Mr. REID. I agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/23/senate-section/article/S3315-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak earlier because I \nwanted to encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to \na resolution on this problem. We cannot let this country go dark in \nterms of its ability to do its duty to defend the United States of \nAmerica. We have to get off of what we are doing here and start getting \ndown to the business of what we need to do.\n  I have to believe that tonight the world is watching us and they are \nsaying: There goes the United States Senate, and there they go home, \nha, ha, ha. They have a program that someone tried to render helpless \nin terms of our ability to protect ourselves. Edward Snowden literally \ntried to disgrace the United States.\n  Now here we are working on a program that went through the respective \ncommittees, that has the sound and sensible solution, and we have \nrejected it.\n  I am not here to talk about the program, but I will tell you whom I \nam ready to talk about--the thousands and thousands and thousands of \npeople who work at the National Security Agency, and I want to talk \nabout what they go through every day. They are out there working a 36-\nhour day trying to defend the United States of America, and they want \nto work under a law that is constitutional, is legal, is authorized, so \nthey can do the necessary work to defend the United States of America. \nThey thought they were doing that under the old FISA bill. They thought \nthey were doing that. They were proud of what they were doing. They \nmustered everything they could give to this country. Then along comes \nEric Snowden. Then along come the leaks. Then along comes the \npontificating about ``My, my, my, we have to worry about privacy.''\n\n  I worry about privacy, too, but I also worry about the safety and \nsecurity of\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\nthe United States of America. And I watched the Nation vilify the men \nand women who work at this Agency.\n  So now, as we work under the current law--which will expire; make no \nmistake, it will expire--we don't have it together to pass a new law. \nSo they have been vilified for what they have done. They have been \nvilified for what they have done, in many instances attacked by their \nneighbors, their children picked on and bullied because their parents \nwork at this Agency. Morale was at a low ebb. Finally, now we are \ntrying to deal with and cope with that. They are proud of their work. \nAnd what are we doing? We can't even pass a law. We can't even pass a \nlaw. I think that is absolutely outrageous.\n  I am so sorry we are going home. I am so sorry we are going home. So \nnow we will come back next Sunday. I really urge those people--who I \nknow are of good will and well-intentioned--to really work to find a \nway that when we come back next Sunday, we will be able to vote and \nmove forward and not end up in this ongoing parliamentary quagmire.\n  I worry about our country, and I worry about our ability to govern. \nThis is as serious as it gets. What is the role of a National Security \nAgency? To be able to operate and function in a way that is \nconstitutional, legal, authorized, and obviously of necessity.\n  So I really feel very strongly about this. And I have watched all \nthis go back and forth. So we spent hours and days and days and days on \nall of these amendments on trade. That is good. I am glad we did it. \nBut I am not glad we took that long. We had this bill. We knew we had \nthis bill. We waited until the last minute. We got ourselves into a \njackpot. Now we really have to find our way out.\n  I just cannot speak more forcibly and enough about this. Well, I will \nhave more to say next week. But I really urge others to do their very \nbest. I know there are people here, such as my colleague Senator \nFeinstein and others, who have worked on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 89, H.R. 2353.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2353) to provide an extension of Federal-aid \n     highway, highway safety, motor carrier safety, transit, and \n     other programs funded out of the Highway Trust Fund, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there going to be a unanimous consent \nrequest made at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands there will be.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will reserve the right to object at that point.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of time--I know it is early in the \nmorning--I would like to make a statement. I am not going to object to \nproceeding to this measure, but I would like to make a matter of record \nwhat I am sure the Senator from South Dakota already knows: that absent \nour action at this moment, the Federal highway program authority will \nexpire May 31.\n  We have just spent the better part of the evening contemplating the \nexpiration of important law relative to our national security, and we \nhave not resolved it.\n  What is happening here, of course, is a request for a 60-day \nextension of the Federal highway program. I might say--and I am sure \nthe Senator from South Dakota is well aware of this--this is the 33rd \nshort-term extension of our Federal highway program.\n  I think all of us understand that the program that once was \nconsidered to be the centerpiece of America's infrastructure and its \neconomy has now deteriorated to the point where we are extending it for \n1 month, 2 months, and 3 months at a time. Frankly, it does not serve \nour country and it doesn't serve our economy. It is a reflection on the \nlack of leadership by those who have the authority in committees and in \nthe House and Senate to propose a measure that becomes a long-term \nhighway program.\n  I just want to make it clear that instead of enacting a 6-year \ntransportation program worthy of our great Nation, this Congress \ncontinues to limp along down a political highway of excuses. It is \ncoming to an end.\n  There have been lengthy discussions in our Democratic caucus that \nthese continued short-term extensions are unacceptable in this great \nNation. And I would just say that although we will agree to this 60-day \nextension, we are serving notice on the majority leader in the Senate \nas well as the Speaker to do their job and to enact a law that provides \nthe kind of infrastructure that could build America's economy.\n  So I will not object to this request, but notice is given that in \nthis 60 days, it is time for this Congress to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2353) was passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROUNDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 91, S. 802.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER pro tempore. The clerk will report the bill by \ntitle.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 802) to authorize the Secretary of State and the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development to provide assistance to support the rights of \n     women and girls in developing countries, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, with \nan amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Girls Count Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the United States Census Bureau's 2013 \n     international figures, 1 person in 12, or close to \n     900,000,000 people, is a girl or young woman age 10 through \n     24.\n       (2) The Census Bureau's data also illustrates that young \n     people are the fastest growing segment of the population in \n     developing countries.\n       (3) Even though most countries do have birth registration \n     laws, four out of ten babies born in 2012 were not registered \n     worldwide. Moreover, an estimated 36 percent of children \n     under the age of five worldwide (about 230,000,000 children) \n     do not possess a birth certificate.\n       (4) A nationally recognized proof of birth system is \n     important to determining a child's citizenship, nationality, \n     place of birth, parentage, and age. Without such a system, a \n     passport, driver's license, or other identification card is \n     difficult to obtain. The lack of such documentation can \n     prevent girls and women from officially participating in and \n     benefitting from the formal economic, legal, and political \n     sectors in their countries.\n       (5) The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide is \n     particularly concerning as it can exacerbate the \n     disproportionate vulnerability of women to trafficking, child \n     marriage, and lack of access to health and education \n     services.\n       (6) A lack of birth registration among women and girls can \n     also aggravate what, in many places, amounts to an already \n     reduced ability to seek employment, participate in civil \n     society, or purchase or inherit land and other assets.\n       (7) Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for \n     poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, \n     tending livestock, caring for younger children, and doing \n     chores.\n       (8) Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty \n     levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the \n     lack of official information on women and girls.
