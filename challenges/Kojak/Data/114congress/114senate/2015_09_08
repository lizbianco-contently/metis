Mr. President, today we will begin consideration of \nthe resolution to disapprove the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nnegotiated by China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the \nUnited Kingdom, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the United States. \nThis resolution seeks to constrain Iran's nuclear weapons program. I \nwill ask all Senators to be present in the Chamber beginning tomorrow \nafternoon to commence debate on this important issue.\n  Let me extend my appreciation for the time and research many of our \ncolleagues have given to understanding the details, the strengths, and \nthe weaknesses of this agreement. For many, this has been a very \ndifficult decision. For some, it was made even more difficult by \nassertions from the administration that the only choice was between \nthis agreement and war. Of course, that was never, never true. All such \npolitical statements really say is that the administration lacks the \nwill and the leadership to pursue a stronger agreement, additional \nsanctions, and policies intended to end Iran's enrichment program if it \ncannot attain congressional agreement on the President's deal with \nIran.\n  The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act passed the Senate by a vote of \n98 to 1 earlier this year. It provided each of us with the opportunity \nto truly represent our constituents on this important issue. I expect \nthat every Senator who voted for that measure is now entitled to an up-\nor-down vote--not a filibuster or artificial limits on passage but an \nimportant vote--on this resolution.\n  Along with the Americans we were sent here to represent, countries, \nbusinesses, and proliferation networks seeking to expand ties with Iran \nstand to have a simple question answered. All of the people involved in \nthis around the world deserve to have a simple question answered: Does \nthe Senate disapprove of this deal with Iran? Does the Senate \ndisapprove of this deal with Iran? The Senate should not hide behind \nprocedural obfuscation to shield the President or our individual views.\n  This debate should not be about a President who will leave office in \n16 months; it should be about where our country will be in 16 years.\n  The Democratic leader said that his party strove to preserve the \nCorker-Cardin bill and that it was incumbent on Congress to review this \nagreement with the thoughtful, level-headed process this agreement \ndeserves. I agree that is exactly what is needed right now. I know that \nis exactly what nearly every Senator in this body voted for. And I call \non every Senator to resist attempts to obstruct a final vote and deny \nthe American people and Congress the say they deserve on this extremely \nimportant matter.\n  The facts have already led many of our Democratic colleagues--\nincluding the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee in the \nSenate and the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House, as well as the \nlikely next leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate--to come out \nin opposition to this agreement. Certainly those were not easy \ndecisions for them. But these Democrats are joined in their skepticism \nby Americans of every political persuasion who believe this deal will \nmake our country less safe--less safe.\n  Even those lawmakers who have come out in favor of the President's \nagreement use terms such as ``deeply flawed'' to describe it. Let's \nremember why that is. The American people were led to believe that \nnegotiations with Iran would be about ending its nuclear program, but \nthat is not what the deal before us would do. We know the President's \ndeal with Iran will not end its nuclear program but will instead leave \nIran with a threshold nuclear capability recognized as legitimate by \nthe international community--quite the opposite of the original goal. \nWe know the President's deal with Iran will leave it with thousands of \ncentrifuges, an advanced research and development program, and access \nto billions of dollars, at least some of which the President himself \nhas acknowledged will be used to support terrorism. We know\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\nthe President's deal with Iran will allow it to further ballistic \nmissile research and strengthen its economy. In short, by almost any \nmeasure, we know Iran will emerge stronger from this deal in nearly \nevery aspect of its national power and better positioned to expand its \nsphere of influence.\n  The Iranian nuclear program was never intended to produce nuclear \nenergy for peaceful civilian purposes. That was never what they had in \nmind. Certainly Iran does not need an underground enrichment facility \nfor those purposes or long-range ballistic missiles. Iran has employed \nevery aspect of national power to defend the regime and the Islamic \nrevolution to include support for terrorism, unconventional warfare, \npublic diplomacy, cyber warfare, suppression of internal dissent, and, \nof course, support for proxies and terrorist groups.\n  We already know Iran is undertaking many activities relevant to the \ndevelopment of a nuclear explosive device. As the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency revealed in a November 2011 report, it has attempted to, \nNo. 1, procure nuclear-related equipment and materials through \nindividuals and entities related to the military; No. 2, develop \npathways for the production of nuclear material; No. 3, acquire nuclear \nweapons development information and documentation from a clandestine \nnuclear supply network; and No. 4, develop an indigenous design of a \nnuclear weapon, as well as test components. All of that has been done, \naccording to the IAEA.\n  Moreover, as Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz \nrecently observed:\n\n       The final stages of the nuclear talks have coincided with \n     Iran's intensified efforts to expand and entrench its power \n     in neighboring states.\n\n  They warned:\n\n       Iranian or Iranian client forces are now the pre-eminent \n     military or political element in multiple Arab countries. \n     Unless political restraint is linked to nuclear restraint, an \n     agreement freeing Iran from sanctions risks empowering Iran's \n     hegemonic efforts.\n\n  I will have more to say later in the week concerning my opposition to \nthis agreement, and I expect every Senator will wish to explain his or \nher respective vote. But I would ask every Senator to keep this in mind \nas well: The President has said that ``no deal is better than a bad \ndeal.'' And while he will be out of office in a few months, the rest of \nthe country and the world will have to deal with the predictable \nconsequences of the President's deal for far longer than the next year \nand a half.\n  If lawmakers determine that this deal is indeed a bad one, then they \nhave a duty to vote that way. We can work together to prepare suitable \nsanctions legislation and other measures required to maintain our \ncapabilities to deal with the threat from Iran, but no matter what, we \nshould conduct a respectful and serious debate that is consistent with \nthe serious ramifications of this agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6438-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I gave a speech this morning at Carnegie \nEndowment for International Peace, and it is, I think, directly how I \nfeel about this. I am glad it got some coverage this morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full remarks of the speech I made \nthis morning at 10 o'clock be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Senator Harry Reid: Remarks on Iran Nuclear Agreement, Carnegie \n          Endowment for International Peace, Washington, D.C.\n\n       When the Senate is gaveled into session a few hours from \n     now, a debate that has ignited passions from Tehran to Tel \n     Aviv, from Beijing to Berlin, and from coast to coast across \n     the United States will take center stage in the world's \n     greatest deliberative body.\n       The question at hand is no small matter: Is the agreement \n     between Iran and the international community, led by the \n     United States, the best pathway to peace and security for \n     America, Israel and our partners and interests?\n       I believe the answer is yes. And today I am gratified to \n     say to my fellow Americans, our negotiating partners, and our \n     allies around the world: this agreement will stand. America \n     will uphold its commitment and we will seize this opportunity \n     to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n       While the formal debate begins this afternoon, the private \n     negotiations that brought us to this point have been going on \n     for years--and the public's review of the agreement has gone \n     on for months.\n       During that long period, President Obama and Secretary \n     Kerry were clear in their goals: above all, that the United \n     States will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.\n       The United States also would not sign any agreement that \n     takes Iran at its word or relies on trust Iran has not \n     earned.\n       And at the most difficult crossroads of this time-consuming \n     and technical negotiation, President Obama and Secretary \n     Kerry made clear that the hard choices belonged to Iran.\n       Now it's our turn. Now the United States has a choice to \n     make: We can enforce an agreement that forces Iran to walk \n     away from any nuclear-weapons program, or we can walk away \n     from that agreement and assume responsibility for the \n     consequences.\n       We can take the strongest step ever toward blocking Iran \n     from getting a nuclear bomb, or we can block this agreement \n     and all but ensure Iran will have the fissile material it \n     would need to make a bomb in a matter of months. But we \n     cannot have it both ways.\n       Make no mistake: blocking the bomb and blocking this \n     agreement are two distinct choices that lead to very \n     different futures.\n       I've spent a lot of time talking, listening, and thinking \n     about the various elements of this agreement, and so have my \n     colleagues. I've heard from nuclear scientists, the \n     intelligence community and our military leaders.\n       I've listened to diplomats and experts.\n       I've been briefed by Secretary Kerry and Undersecretary \n     Sherman, by Secretaries Lew and Moniz--the brilliant nuclear \n     physicist who knows more than almost anyone of the reality of \n     this threat, the science behind the agreement and the \n     agreement itself.\n       I've heard ardent supporters and passionate opponents. I've \n     talked with Nevadans from all walks of life. I've spoken with \n     Israel's leaders, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and \n     Ambassador Dermer. And I've read the text of this agreement \n     carefully.\n       In all my years, I cannot think of another debate with so \n     much expertise, passions and good faith on both sides.\n       It is clear to me and to the overwhelming majority of my \n     caucus that this agreement gives us the best chance to avoid \n     one of the worst threats in today's world--a nuclear-armed \n     Iran. In fact, I believe this agreement is not just our best \n     chance to avert what we fear most--I fear it is our last best \n     chance to do so.\n       Before I explain why, let me first acknowledge some of the \n     people who helped us get to this historic moment.\n       I mentioned President Obama and his Cabinet Secretaries, \n     who achieved a remarkable diplomatic breakthrough.\n       I also want to acknowledge my colleagues, led by Senator \n     Menendez, who helped set the stage for those negotiations by \n     rallying the Senate and the world behind sanctions that \n     brought Iran to the negotiating table.\n       I also acknowledge Senators Cardin and Corker for their \n     leadership. The legislation they wrote created the process to \n     review the agreement in the Congress.\n       I support this agreement--and the United States Senate will \n     support President Obama's veto of any effort to undermine \n     it--for two simple reasons:\n       First, this agreement will do a tremendous amount of good.\n       And second, blocking this agreement would lead to a \n     tremendous amount of bad outcomes.\n       The bottom line is that enforcing this agreement can \n     prevent the things we most dread--but undermining it would \n     permit those very same dreadful consequences.\n       And those consequences are, in fact, unacceptable.\n       We all recognize the threat Iran poses to Israel, with \n     powerful weapons and hateful words, with anti-Semitic smears \n     and pledges of the Jewish state's destruction. No one can \n     underestimate this menace. And no one should dismiss how much \n     more dangerous Iran would be in this regard if it were armed \n     with a nuclear bomb.\n       We also recognize the threat of the Iranian Revolutionary \n     Guard Corps--the threat from Iran's support for Hezbollah and \n     Assad--of Iran's brazen human rights violations toward its \n     own people and the Americans it holds as political prisoners \n     and those who have disappeared. We recognize the danger Iran \n     poses\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\n     to our allies, our interests, and our own troops and \n     diplomats serving in the Middle East.\n       No one is blind to the threat Iran poses. But again, no one \n     should forget that Iran would become a threat of an entirely \n     different magnitude if it ever were to have a nuclear weapon. \n     I cannot think of a single challenge in the region that \n     wouldn't get worse in that nightmare scenario.\n       That is why our goal, first and foremost, must be to keep \n     Iran from getting its hands on one.\n       We have no illusions about the Iranian regime--which is \n     exactly why when we are presented with the best way to stop \n     its nuclear ambitions, we must not let that chance slip \n     through our fingers. We must support and enforce the \n     agreement we have reached.\n       The agreement that Congress now assumes the responsibility \n     to review does a better job than any other proposal of \n     reducing Iran's chance to get a bomb.\n       When our negotiators came to the table, they did so with \n     Andrew Carnegie's advice in mind. The man who gave his name \n     and fortune to this institution once said that ``our duty is \n     with what is practicable now--with the next step possible in \n     our day and generation.''\n       In our day, we know it is not practical to bomb away \n     knowledge of how to build a nuclear weapon or erase that \n     knowledge with sanctions. So our negotiators said, even \n     though we cannot take away the recipe to build a bomb, we can \n     take away both the ingredients and the use of equipment to \n     cook one. That's what we're doing--but only if the United \n     States upholds and enforces this agreement.\n       The good news is this agreement does more than take away \n     Iran's ability to build a bomb--it gives us the ability to \n     watch its every move.\n       Through strict limits and intrusive inspections, this \n     agreement takes away Iran's highly enriched material, and \n     takes away Iran's ability to make more of it.\n       This agreement takes away Iran's ability to build any \n     facilities or fissile material secretly and with impunity.\n       The agreement Iran signed forbids it from pursuing, \n     building, or having a nuclear weapon ever. There is no \n     expiration date on that commitment--and it is not grounded in \n     any way in trust.\n       This isn't a peace treaty with Iran or a gift out of the \n     goodness of our hearts. If we trusted Iran, we wouldn't need \n     the video cameras and inspectors and seals and all manner of \n     technology to make sure Iran complies.\n       We're not asking Iran to promise us anything and taking it \n     at its word--we are demanding Iran prove to us it is \n     complying with every last letter of this agreement.\n       Before it gets sanctions relief, Iran has to take specific \n     actions. And if it doesn't happen, as some fear, sanctions \n     will be imposed on Iran.\n       We have done everything possible to make sure that if Iran \n     cheats, we'll know, we'll know quickly, and we'll act \n     immediately and with the international community behind us.\n       That makes us safer. That makes Israel safer. That makes \n     the world safer. That's what nuclear experts around the world \n     know, what diplomats know, and what the overwhelming majority \n     of my caucus knows. That is why this agreement will stand.\n       And to make sure this agreement succeeds, Congress must \n     provide the oversight to ensure monitoring and enforce \n     verification. At the same time, Congress must continue to \n     hold the line against Iranian arms trafficking, its funding \n     of terrorism, and demanding the return of Americans who have \n     been taken as political prisoners and those who disappeared--\n     priorities that were never meant to be part of this \n     negotiation but must never be forgotten.\n       This agreement offers a number of different ways to cut off \n     Iran's pathways to a bomb. There is, on the other hand, one \n     surefire way to open Iran's path to destruction--and that is \n     to reject this agreement.\n       As I mentioned, the second reason I support this agreement \n     is because of what happens if we walk away from it. That \n     would leave Iran with no limitations on any nuclear weapons \n     program and leave the United States with no leverage to do \n     anything about it.\n       If we walk away from the agreement we helped secure, think \n     about what happens the very next day: Iran gets to keep as \n     many centrifuges as it wants, and build as many more as it \n     would like. Iran gets to build its stockpile of the kind of \n     uranium and plutonium you'd need to build a bomb. Iran gets \n     to test more advanced technologies that bring it closer to a \n     bomb--and to do so as quickly as it wants. And when those \n     weapons are ready, Iran gets to point them at Israel--or \n     worse, launch them and make good on its threat to wipe Israel \n     off the map.\n       Iran also gets to kick out the inspectors and hide all of \n     this from the world.\n       Forget worries about 15 years or 20 years from now. All of \n     this is what would happen tomorrow.\n       If we walk away from this agreement, the international \n     sanctions regime also falls apart, meaning the tool Congress \n     imposed to bring Iran to the table disappears from our \n     arsenal.\n       Sanctions don't work if it's our idea alone--the world has \n     to be on the same page. Here's why: America doesn't do \n     business with Iran. We haven't for decades. But other \n     countries made their own economic sacrifices in the name of \n     pressuring Iran--and now they want to buy Iran's oil and \n     trade with it.\n       So as much as we'd like for the sanctions that brought Iran \n     to the table to also bring Iran to its knees, it's only with \n     international cooperation that sanctions actually do \n     anything. Like it or not, we need our partners in this \n     effort. And our partners have told us in no uncertain terms \n     that if the United States walks away, we'll walk away alone.\n       Sanctions have isolated Iran and brought us to this moment. \n     But if we squander it and turn our backs on our international \n     partners, it is we--the United States--who will be isolated. \n     And worse, we would surrender our leverage to negotiate in \n     the future.\n       Put it all together, and what does it mean if America \n     blocks this agreement instead of blocking Iran's pathways to \n     a bomb? It means Iran gets more money and more impunity to \n     develop a nuclear weapon. It means we get far less scrutiny \n     and far less security. It means we'll have put ourselves at a \n     disadvantage at the very moment we let Iran become more \n     dangerous.\n       Of course we still have the military option. President \n     Obama has been crystal clear about that. But military strikes \n     cannot solve this problem nearly as effectively as the \n     solution before us today. Clearly, a military option could \n     also come with significant costs and risks for both Israel \n     and the United States. After all, that's why diplomacy is our \n     first resort and the military option is our last.\n       This is why I believe blocking the agreement would actually \n     achieve the opposite of what opponents intend. Instead of \n     being tougher on Iran, voting against this agreement is a \n     vote against a smart international sanctions regime, against \n     inspections, against any international requirement that Iran \n     backs off its nuclear program in any way. Blocking this \n     agreement pushes the Iranians closer to a bomb rather than \n     pushing it farther away.\n       General Brent Scowcroft's national-security expertise \n     served four Republican presidents. As he said, we would be \n     sowing further turmoil in the Middle East rather than seizing \n     a chance and a responsibility to stabilize it. That would be \n     a tragedy of our own making--one we cannot allow.\n       I respect greatly the concerns I've heard about what this \n     agreement means for Israel. I believe this agreement makes \n     Israel safer, and in no small part that is why I support it.\n       Over my decades in the Senate, my support for the safety \n     and security of the Israeli people has been at the core of my \n     views on the Middle East and the national security of the \n     United States. From the Bonds for Israel dinners I attended \n     50 years ago, to the history of my own wife's family, my \n     support for the State of Israel and the Jewish people has \n     been personal and unimpeachable. And I have not been afraid \n     to disagree with the President of the United States when it \n     comes to Israel, whether on settlements or when the \n     Administration opposed Congress passing specific sanctions.\n       We must build on our firm commitment to make sure Israel \n     can defend itself. It will take more money and military \n     support, but we must provide the one true democracy in the \n     region and the one and only Jewish state in the world with \n     the resources it needs.\n       The United States must also maintain its staunch support of \n     Israel, including by using our veto in the United Nations for \n     resolutions that isolate Israel unfairly or make it less \n     secure.\n       I have read closely the letter that Secretary Kerry sent to \n     the Senate on September 2. That letter lays out a number of \n     important steps that the United States would take to support \n     Israel's security.\n       One of those steps is protecting Israel's Qualitative \n     Military Edge. Another is negotiating a new ten-year \n     Memorandum of Understanding on military assistance. And yet \n     another step is continuing to work with Israel on joint \n     efforts to deal with shared threats, as well as confronting \n     both conventional and asymmetric threats.\n       I've also closely reviewed the legislation that Senator \n     Cardin is proposing, which will provide additional security \n     assistance and assurances to Israel.\n       After looking at the letter and the legislation, I plan \n     work with the White House and with both Democrats and \n     Republicans to guarantee that the United States is doing \n     everything possible to protect the safety and security of \n     Israel.\n       And as the Administration has promised, we'll continue \n     funding the missile-defense system that has already saved so \n     many Israeli civilian lives. We'll also grow our strategic \n     relationship even stronger, collaborating to detect and \n     destroy tunnels used to terrorize Israeli civilians.\n       Now, after all the good this agreement will do in blocking \n     Iran's pathways to a bomb--after all the dangers rejecting it \n     will do by letting Iran grow more dangerous while our clout \n     and credibility slip down the drain--after all the assurances \n     that our commitment to Israel's security is stronger than \n     ever--after all that, some still say they want a better deal.\n       But there is no such thing. There is no more plausible \n     alternative. There is no better deal.\n       Opponents of this agreement, who I respect, talk often \n     about how very real the Iranian threat is to Israel and the \n     region--and it absolutely is. But for all the talk about what \n     is real, the idea that we can somehow get a better deal is \n     imaginary.\n       Diplomats, scientists and our international counterparts \n     tell us it is fantasy. The agreement before us is the result \n     of many years of hard work. We live in the real world--and in\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\n     the real world, this really is the best option to keep Iran \n     from a nuclear bomb.\n       Let me say a brief word about the details of getting this \n     done.\n       The Senate, of course, has an important oversight role to \n     play. When we voted nearly unanimously for the Iran Review \n     Act, we voted to give the Senate that role. We voted to \n     consider three possible outcomes: no action at all, a \n     resolution of approval, or a resolution of disapproval. It is \n     absurd to argue--as some are doing now--that by voting for a \n     process with three possible and very different outcomes, \n     senators somehow obligated themselves to vote to advance a \n     specific outcome. They did no such thing.\n       I hope we can avoid the usual and unnecessary procedural \n     hurdles. Democrats have already agreed to forgo our \n     opportunity to filibuster, and I've offered Leader McConnell \n     the chance to go straight to a vote on passage of the \n     resolution. But of course, as he has noted many times in the \n     past, everything of importance in the Senate requires 60 \n     votes. So passage will require 60 votes.\n       There is no precedent in recent history for an issue of \n     this magnitude getting consideration in the Senate without \n     having to secure 60 votes. This is not about how any one \n     leader manages the floor--this is a precedent stretching back \n     decades.\n       Finally, of all the many important things at stake here, \n     American leadership is one of them.\n       After convening our international partners in common cause, \n     rallying the world behind tough sanctions, after negotiating \n     and negotiating and negotiating some more--the way America \n     acts now will inform the way we are viewed on the world stage \n     and the credibility with which we can negotiate in the \n     future.\n       If America reneges on this agreement, we will lose more \n     than the compliance of our adversary--we will lose the \n     confidence of our allies.\n       America led the negotiations to stop any Iranian nuclear \n     program, and now it is time for Congress to reaffirm \n     America's leadership by supporting this agreement. We cannot \n     and will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Neither the \n     United States, nor Israel, our Gulf partners, a volatile \n     Middle East, or anyone in the world can risk that danger. I \n     believe it is our responsibility to avoid that threat.\n       Let's heed Andrew Carnegie's reminder of our duty to \n     respect what is practical and to respond with pragmatic \n     solutions--solutions like the one before us. As he said, \n     ``When a statesman has in his keeping the position and \n     interests of his country, it is not with things as they are \n     to be in the future, but with things as they are in the \n     present.''\n       The agreement on the table at present is a good one.\n       It is our best chance to ensure Iran never builds the worst \n     weapon on earth. I will do everything in my power to make \n     sure it is enforced and effective--to make sure, in turn, we \n     are safer and more secure--in our day and generation, and in \n     the days and generations to come.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I note that there are a lot of things in \nthis speech that I think are important, but the one thing certainly \nthat is so vitally important is that no one has come up with an \nalternative. Any alternative is imaginary. It is fantasy land. I speak \nabout that in my remarks.\n  Today we face one of the most critical national security issues of \nour time: whether to support the Iran agreement which would stop Iran \nfrom getting a nuclear weapon. That is what the agreement is--to stop \nIran from getting nuclear weapons.\n  From the beginning, Senate Democrats have done everything possible to \nmove the debate on the Iran agreement forward in the quickest way \npossible. We agreed to skip procedural votes and allow the Senate to \nbegin debate on the resolution itself. And today I am proposing that \nthe Senate move forward in the most efficient way possible. I am \nproposing that after the Senate concludes 3 days of serious debate on \nthis issue, we then move to a vote on passage of the resolution, of \ncourse with a 60-vote threshold. But Republicans are insisting that the \nSenate go through all procedural steps, including cloture, on their own \nbill.\n  As the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has stated numerous \ntimes--not a few times, not many times, but numerous times--requiring \n60 votes on matters of enormous importance is simply ``the way the \nSenate operates.''\n  Here are a few examples of the statements he has made. I could spend \nliterally all afternoon talking about quotes that are very similar to \nwhat I am about to recite. July 30, 2011, Senator McConnell:\n\n       Now, look, we know that on controversial matters in the \n     Senate, it has for quite some time required 60 votes. So I \n     would say again to my friend--\n\n  That is me--\n\n     it is pretty hard to make a credible case that denying a vote \n     on your own proposal is anything other than a filibuster.\n\n  Listen, everybody, that is what Senator McConnell said. Again, just a \nfew days later:\n\n       I wish to make clear to the American people Senate \n     Republicans are ready to vote on cloture on the Reid proposal \n     in 30 minutes, in an hour, as soon as we can get our \n     colleagues over to the floor. We are ready to vote. By \n     requiring 60 votes, particularly on a matter of this enormous \n     importance, is not at all unusual. It is the way the Senate \n     operates.\n\n  Again he came back a few months later:\n\n       Mr. President, I can only quote my good friend the majority \n     leader who repeatedly has said, most recently in 2007, that \n     in the Senate it has always been the case we need 60 votes. \n     This is my good friend the majority leader when he was the \n     leader of this majority in March of 2007, and he said it \n     repeatedly both when he was in the minority as leader of the \n     minority or leader of the majority, that it requires 60 votes \n     certainly on measures that are controversial.\n\n  He also said a short time later:\n\n       So who gets to decide who is wasting time around here? None \n     of us. None of us have that authority to decide who is \n     wasting time. But the way you make things happen is you get \n     60 votes at some point, and you move a matter to conclusion, \n     and the best way to do that is to have an open amendment \n     process. That is the way this place used to operate.\n\n  So says Senator McConnell.\n  A few months later:\n\n       Madam President, reserving the right to object, what we are \n     talking about is a perpetual debt ceiling grant, in effect, \n     to the President. Matters of this level of controversy always \n     require 60 votes. So I would ask my friend--\n\n  That is me--\n\n     if he would modify his consent request to set the threshold \n     for this vote at 60?\n\n  We could fill in month by month, but let's go to August 6 of this \nyear, just a short time ago:\n\n       Well, as we all know, it takes 60 votes to do everything \n     except the budget process. We anticipate having a vote to \n     proceed to the 20-week Pain-Capable bill sometime before the \n     end of the year as well.\n\n  Recently, the Republican leader told his own Senators and \nconservative news outlets that any attempts to defund Planned \nParenthood or repeal ObamaCare would need at least 60 votes. So why is \nthe Iran agreement any different? It isn't.\n  Even more perplexing is that some would argue that because the Senate \npassed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, all Senators would then \nbe obligated to vote for any cloture vote. Voting for the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act was a vote to review the agreement, not a \ncommitment to vote either for or against it. Voting for the Iran review \nact did not commit any Senator to take a particular position on the \nIran agreement. Voting for the Iran review act was simply a vote to \nreview the Iran agreement, and that is what we have done. It was a vote \nfor three possible outcomes: a resolution of approval, a resolution of \ndisapproval, or no action at all. It did not and does not obligate \nSenators to advance any one result. The Iran review act clearly \nincluded a 60-vote threshold for either a resolution of approval or \ndisapproval. That is it. Every Senator knew that. For any Senator to \nsuggest otherwise is absurd and factually wrong. Incorrect.\n  No Senator who voted for the Iran review act voted to give up the 60-\nvote threshold. In fact, everyone who voted for it actually voted for \nthe 60-vote threshold. In fact, one Republican Member, the junior \nSenator from Arkansas, said the reason he didn't vote for it is because \nit required a 60-vote threshold.\n  If, however, we are forced to have a vote on cloture, it will be \nbecause the Republican leader has rejected Democrats' reasonable and \nresponsible proposal.\n  There is not on either side of this aisle a more respected U.S. \nSenator than the Senator from Virginia, Tim Kaine. He was coauthor of \nthe Iran nuclear agreement, referred to properly as the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act. He said this morning:\n\n       I was the co-author of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \n     Act under which Congress is considering the international \n     agreement to prohibit Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. \n     The bipartisan bill--to give Congress a deliberate and \n     constructive review of the final nuclear agreement with \n     Iran--was drafted so that 60 votes would be required in the \n     Senate to pass either a motion of approval or a motion of \n     disapproval.\n\n  Let me read this again. One of the people who helped write this bill, \na respected Member of this body, said:\n\n       I was the co-author of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \n     Act under which Congress\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\n     is considering the international agreement to prohibit Iran \n     from obtaining nuclear weapons. The bipartisan bill--to give \n     Congress a deliberate and constructive review of the final \n     nuclear agreement with Iran--was drafted so that 60 votes \n     would be required in the Senate to pass either a motion of \n     approval or a motion of disapproval.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       We should follow the procedure that was explicitly \n     discussed and agreed to when we voted on this act, which \n     passed the Senate 98 to 1.\n\n  That is a direct quote from one of the authors of this legislation.\n  It was never any Senator's intention to forgo the 60-vote threshold.\n  Republicans are trying to pull a bait-and-switch that is born out of \ndesperation. They haven't had a good August; let's face it.\n  Are Republicans stalling on this issue so they don't have to work \nwith Democrats to keep our government open and funded? There wasn't a \nday that went by during the recess that we didn't have some Republican \nSenator talk about closing the government. Every time that happened, \nthe Republican leader would say: Well, we are not going to do that. So \nthere is a lot of talk among Republican circles about the Republicans \ndoing everything they can to force votes on things that have nothing to \ndo with funding this government long term. So are Republicans stalling \non this issue so they don't have to work with Democrats to keep our \ngovernment open and funded? Do they want to wait until the last minute \nto jam us with something?\n  Are Republicans stalling on this issue so they don't have to work \nwith us on a bipartisan cyber security bill? Every day that goes by \nwithout legislation in this body is a day that bad guys are doing bad \nthings to our businesses and to our country--stealing our names and \naddresses, trade secrets, everything they can, is what they are doing.\n  Perhaps Republicans are stalling on this critical legislation so they \ndon't have to address our distressed infrastructure, insolvent highway \nsystem, crumbling roads and bridges?\n  I hope that instead of forcing the Senate to jump through unnecessary \nprocedural hurdles, the Republicans will join with the Senate Democrats \nand agree to vote on final passage.\n  It takes a lot of nerve for the Republican leader, after the numerous \nspeeches he has given about the 60-vote threshold on everything \nimportant--is he suggesting this Iran agreement is not important?\n  Let's hope that instead of forcing the Senate to jump through \nunnecessary procedural hurdles--in fact, the Republicans are \nfilibustering their own resolution. I hope they will join with Senate \nDemocrats and agree to vote on final passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6441-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments, with the exception of the McConnell substitute amendment, \nbe withdrawn; that no other amendments, points of order, or motions be \nin order to the joint resolution or the McConnell substitute prior to \nthe vote on the McConnell substitute; that at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, \nSeptember 10, the Senate proceed to vote on the McConnell substitute \namendment; that the amendment be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote \nthreshold; further, that if the McConnell amendment is agreed to, H.J. \nRes. 61, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the time \ntoday until 5 p.m. be equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that following leader remarks on Wednesday, September 9, \nuntil 6 p.m., the time be equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees; and that following leader remarks on Thursday, \nSeptember 10, until 5:30 p.m., the time be equally divided between the \ntwo leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. President, that is my unanimous consent request.\n  Let me say a brief word, and I will turn it over to my friend the \nRepublican leader.\n  If the Republicans want more debate time, they can have it, but I \nthink 3 days would be adequate. There is a definite time for doing \nthis, and I think that is important.\n  If anyone thinks this is not a serious issue, I don't know what could \nbe a serious issue. Based upon the underlying foundation that has been \nlaid by my friend for these many years, this is going to require a 60-\nvote threshold. Everyone knows that. This goes back long before this \ndialogue started today on the floor. It has been going on for some \ntime, as my friend the assistant Democratic leader, when he has an \nopportunity to address the Senate, will discuss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on \nThursday, September 10, at 3 p.m., the substitute amendment to H.J. \nRes. 61 be agreed to, the joint resolution, as amended, be read a third \ntime, and the Senate vote on passage of the resolution, as amended.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also want to propound the following \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that if cloture is invoked on the \nsubstitute amendment to H.J. Res. 61, the amendment be agreed to, the \njoint resolution, as amended, be read a third time, and there be 4 \nhours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate vote on passage of the resolution, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, for all the \nreasons I have mentioned previously and the fact that I believe the \nRepublican leader is way ahead of himself, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this has been one of the most \nextraordinary measures that has come before the Senate in the time that \nI have served here. It is rare to have an issue of this historic \nmoment, of this importance, one that literally raises a question about \nwar and peace in the Middle East, and one that has been considered so \ncarefully by both sides of the aisle for such a long period of time.\n  When I left for the August recess, here in the Senate most of the \nMembers on my side of the aisle--the Democratic side--were still \nprocessing and reviewing the proposed agreement. And, over the course \nof August, these Members announced their public positions on the \nmatter.\n  As of today, there are 41 of the 46 Democratic Senators who have \nannounced they will support the Iran agreement. There are another four \nwho are opposed to it, and one who is yet to announce her position. We \nexpect that to happen shortly.\n  This is a unique matter. I asked my staff and others to research one \nparticular aspect of this debate. The aspect I asked them to research \nwas a letter sent on March 9 of this year by 47 Republican Senators. \nForty-seven Republican Senators sent a letter to the leader of the \nIslamic Republic of Iran, the Ayatollah.\n  To take you back in history, at that point in time when 47 Republican \nSenators sent that letter, the United States of America was in \nnegotiation with Iran to see whether or not we could come to any kind \nof an agreement or understanding when it came to limit Iran's \ndevelopment of a nuclear weapon, something that I am sure all of us--\nboth political parties--want to stop from happening. But in the midst \nof this delicate negotiation that was going on in Switzerland, 47 \nRepublican Senators, including every Member of the Senate Republican \nleadership, sent a letter to the Ayatollah in Iran. It said:\n\n       It has come to our attention while observing your nuclear \n     negotiations with our government that you may not fully \n     understand our constitutional system. Thus, we are writing to \n     bring to your attention two features of our Constitution--the \n     power to make binding international agreements and the \n     different character of federal offices--which you should \n     seriously consider as negotiations progress.\n\n  Forty-seven Republican Senators wrote to the Ayatollah in the midst \nof these delicate negotiations. It went on to say:\n\n       First, under our Constitution, while the president \n     negotiates international agreements, Congress plays the \n     significant role of ratifying them. In the case of a treaty, \n     the Senate must ratify it by a two-thirds vote. A so-called \n     congressional executive agreement requires a majority vote in \n     both the House and the Senate (which, because of procedural \n     rules, effectively means a three-fifths vote in the Senate).\n\n  Forty-seven Republican Senators are advising the Ayatollah in Iran, \nin March, that he should know more about our constitutional form of \ngovernment and understand that it will take Senate approval, which they \nsay effectively means a three-fifths vote. They continue:\n\n       Anything not approved by Congress is a mere executive \n     agreement.\n       Second, [the 47 Republican Senators advised the Ayatollah] \n     the offices of our Constitution have different \n     characteristics. For example, the president may serve only \n     two 4-year terms, whereas senators may serve an unlimited \n     number of 6-year terms. As applied today, for instance, \n     President Obama will leave office in January, 2017, while \n     most of us will remain in office far beyond then--perhaps \n     decades.\n\n  Then the 47 Republicans Senators, in their March letter to the \nAyatollah of Iran, say:\n\n       What these two constitutional provisions mean is that we \n     will consider any agreement regarding your nuclear-weapons \n     program that is not approved by the Congress as nothing more \n     than an executive agreement between President Obama and \n     Ayatollah Khamenei. The next president could revoke such an \n     executive agreement with the stroke of a pen and future \n     Congresses could modify the terms of the agreement at any \n     time.\n       We hope this letter enriches your knowledge of our \n     constitutional system and promotes mutual understanding and \n     clarity as nuclear negotiations progress.\n\n  Forty-seven Republican Senators in March of this year, writing to the \nAyatollah and basically telling him: Don't get your hopes up if you are \nnegotiating with the United States, reminding him they will have the \nlast word as Members of Congress, and also stipulating that a three-\nfifths vote will be required in the U.S. Senate.\n  Then they go on to say: Keep in mind we are going to be here a lot \nlonger than any President; we may be the last person or the last group \nto make a decision on the future of these agreements. Then they are \nbasically reminding them that Presidents come and go, and don't assume \nthe next President\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nwill even honor an agreement reached by this President.\n  Think back 12 years ago. What if 47 Democratic Senators--in the midst \nof our negotiation as to whether or not we should invade Iraq--had sent \na letter to Saddam Hussein saying: Don't negotiate with President Bush. \nDon't pay any attention to his negotiations. We are the Congress. We \nwill have the last word.\n  I cannot imagine what the public response would have been, but that \nis exactly what happened here--47 Republican Senators intervening in a \nnegotiation process with Iran, basically telling those sitting at the \ntable: Don't worry about reaching an agreement with the United States \nof America and this President.\n  I know what would have happened if that would have come up when Dick \nCheney was Vice President of the United States. We would have had 47 \nDemocrats up on charges of treason.\n  Well, in this circumstance, this was not good judgment. I would like \nto stipulate that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee did \nnot sign this letter. I want to make sure that is clear on the floor. \nBut the 47 who did have to answer a question: Why? When we are in \ndelicate negotiations as the United States of America, and we don't \nhave a final agreement, why would 47 Republican Senators want to \nintervene in those negotiations? Why would they want to say to the \nAyatollah: Don't waste your time negotiating with this President.\n  It is troublesome. Many of them had reached a conclusion even before \nthe agreement was written that they were going to oppose it. Witness \nthis letter.\n  But others took time to consider it, to measure it, and to announce \ntheir position when it came to this matter. I respect them for doing \nthat, even if they came to a different conclusion than I did. I know \nwhat happened on our Democratic side because I was in contact with \nvirtually with every Member of our Senate Democratic Caucus during the \nmonth of August, talking to them about this.\n  There is real soul-searching here, real serious consideration. Some \nof them, of course, went to the source, met with our intelligence \nagencies, the State Department, Department of Defense, and came back to \nWashington when we were in recess. One Senator I know sat down for 5 \nhours in closed meetings with our intelligence agencies to ask \nquestions that were on his mind about this agreement.\n  Others, of course, met with their constituents, talked about it, \nfound differences of opinion within their own States. They thought \nabout it long and hard, prayed over it.\n  I talked to them, always wanting to hear where they were, but never \npushing them because I knew this was serious, and they took it \nseriously. That is where we find ourselves today.\n  I salute the Senator from Tennessee. As the chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, he and I may disagree on substance, but I \nrespect him very much. He is a man of honor and a man of integrity, and \nhe brings to this process the kind of attitude toward the Senate as an \ninstitution which I respect and I will continue to respect.\n  I also believe my colleague from Maryland, a close personal friend, \nSenator Cardin--though we see this issue differently--has really \nthought long and hard about it. We have been on the phone together \nmany, many times during the course of August. I ruined a lot of his \nvacation trying to figure out where he was and what his process was. He \ntook it very seriously. I respect him, although we came out to \ndifferent positions on this matter.\n  That is the way it should be, and what the American people expect of \nus now is a debate befitting this great institution of the Senate. They \nexpect us to come and conscientiously consider this matter on its \nmerits and express our points of view, and virtually every Senator has \nalready done that publicly, save one. In the course of this debate, the \nAmerican people can follow it because it is a critical debate. What is \nat issue here is whether Iran will develop a nuclear weapon.\n  We believe that they have the capacity now to create as many as 10 \nnuclear weapons. We don't want that to happen. It would be disastrous \nfor the world--certainly disastrous for the Middle East and Israel--and \nthat is why leaders from around the world, 100 different nations, \nsupport what President Obama is striving to do.\n  What the President is trying to do is something I believe should be \nthe starting point in every critical foreign-policy decision: Use \ndiplomacy, use negotiation, and try to solve our problems in a \nthoughtful, diplomatic way. And if that fails, never rule out other \npossibilities, but start with diplomacy. That is what the President has \ndone.\n  During the course of this Presidency, he organized nations around the \nworld to join us in this effort. If this were just the United States \nversus Iran, we wouldn't be where we are today, but the President \nengaged countries which historically and recently have not been our \nallies.\n  Before we left for the August recess, we sat down with the five \nAmbassadors from nations that joined us in the negotiation. I looked \nacross the table there to see the Ambassadors from China, from Russia, \nfrom the United Kingdom, and representatives of the embassies of \nGermany and France. I thought to myself, if you are a student of \nhistory, this is an amazing coalition: China, Russia, the United \nKingdom, Germany, France, and the United States all working together. \nAnd we brought into the sanctions regime other countries that didn't \nhave the same direct involvement in negotiations but were with us. \nSouth Korea is a good example. Japan, another good example, joined us \nin this effort to put pressure on Iran. President Obama led this \neffort, and he was successful in this effort. The Iranians came to the \nnegotiating table because we put the pressure on them--economic \npressure that brought them to that moment.\n  Now we have before us this agreement. Some have said: You can never \ntrust Iran no matter what they say. I would just harken back to the \ndays of Ronald Reagan, who said of our enemies around the world when it \ncame to agreements: ``Trust, but verify.''\n  Just recently we had an announcement made by Colin Powell, a man I \nrespect very much, in support of this agreement. It was an announcement \nwhich surprised me in a way. I didn't know if he was going to take a \nposition on this matter, but this article states:\n\n       Former Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed support \n     for the [Obama] nuclear agreement with Iran on Sunday, \n     calling the various planks Iranian leaders accepted \n     ``remarkable'' and dismissing critics' concerns over its \n     implementation.\n       ``It's a pretty good deal,'' he said on NBC's ``Meet the \n     Press.''\n       Critics concerned that the deal will expedite Iran's \n     pursuit of a nuclear weapon, Powell added, are ``forgetting \n     the reality that [Iranian leaders] have been on a \n     superhighway, for the last 10 years, to create a nuclear \n     weapon or a nuclear weapons program with no speed limit.''\n       He said the reduction in centrifuges, Iran's uranium \n     stockpile and their agreement to shut down their plutonium \n     reactor were all ``remarkable.''\n       ``These are remarkable changes, and so we have stopped this \n     highway race that they were going down--and I think that's \n     very, very important,'' Powell said.\n       He also pushed back on skeptics who have expressed worries \n     about the ability of independent inspectors to verify that \n     Iran is following the agreement. Powell said that, ``with \n     respect to the Iranians--don't trust, never trust, and always \n     verify.''\n       ``And I think a very vigorous verification regime has been \n     put into place,'' he said.\n       ``I say, we have a deal, let's see how they implement the \n     deal. If they don't implement it, bail out. None of our \n     options are gone,'' Powell added.\n\n  I think he hit the nail on the head. General Colin Powell, who served \nour country in the military and as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, then as Secretary of State, brings a perspective to this which \nvery few can. He is a man who risked his life on the battlefield, a man \nwho knows the true cost of war, but a man who was empowered by another \nRepublican President to lead us in diplomatic negotiations. This is the \nkind of clear-eyed approach that we need and want when it comes to an \nissue of this gravity.\n  I will have other things to say on this matter, as others will.\n  I yield the floor to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am going to have more lengthy comments \nto make on this topic a little later, but I did want first of all to \nthank the Senator from Illinois for his comments, and I certainly want \nto thank Senator Cardin--and I will do so more fully in\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\njust a moment. But I would like to remind the body that, yes, we went \nthrough several steps along the way to get to where we are today that \ncertainly created consternation on both sides of the aisle. There were \nlots of things that occurred. A letter was referred to. There was an \naddress to the joint Congress. There have been numbers of things along \nthe way that have caused people to concern themselves that maybe this \ndebate would end up being something that was partisan and of low level.\n  What we have done is that we have actually marshaled ourselves \nthrough that, and we ended up with the Iran review act in short terms. \nThat gives us the opportunity, as the distinguished Senator mentioned, \nto actually review this. We have done that. We have had 12 hearings on \nthis topic--extensive hearings--in the Foreign Relations Committee, and \nmany other committees have done the same.\n  What we ended up putting in place, with 98 votes in the Senate--98 to \n1; we had one Senator who was absent--is a process where all Senators \ncould review this, could have the documents at their disposal to go \nthrough it, to go to classified briefings so they could understand--and \nshould understand--fully what this agreement says and then have the \nright to vote.\n  Certainly, some things happened along the way that, as I mentioned, \ncreated some consternation, but as a body, in Senate fashion, in lieu \nof letting that divide us and letting that create a scenario where we \nwouldn't review it and not vote on it, we created a process where we \nwould review it and vote on it.\n  It is my hope--and I know I have had a very nice conversation with \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois, and certainly multiple \nconversations with the distinguished Senator from Maryland--that over \nthe process of this week that is what continues. I know that is what \nall of us want to see happen.\n  I do think the American people deserve to know where Senators and \nHouse Members stand on this serious piece of foreign policy that is \nbefore us, and I want to thank everyone for their role in getting it \nhere.\n  As a matter of fact, I will move on, if I could, to what I had \nplanned to say. I first want to thank Senator McConnell and Senator \nReid for allowing this debate to take place this week without having a \nmotion to proceed. I couldn't thank Senator Cardin more for being a \ncolleague who really works to try to figure out a way for the Senate to \nplay its appropriate role in foreign policy. It has been nothing but \noutstanding in dealing with him since he assumed this role, and I want \nto thank him for the way he has conducted himself.\n  I would also like to remind people that without the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act there would be no role for Congress. One of the \nthings I think has confused a lot of the American people--and there are \na lot of people who would prefer this to have been a treaty--is the \nfact that under our form of government, the President is able to decide \nwhether he is going to submit an agreement as a treaty or as an \nexecutive agreement. An executive agreement stays in place during the \nduration of that President's tenure and could be altered by the next \nPresident. A treaty is binding on future Presidents.\n  This President, as we know, decided to go directly to the U.N. \nSecurity Council and, by the way, lift some congressionally mandated \nsanctions that we all helped put in place that actually brought Iran to \nthe table. So with the knowledge of that, Congress stepped in and \npassed this piece of legislation that now gives us the right to review \nwhat the President has negotiated and to prevent him from lifting those \ncongressionally mandated sanctions should we decide we disapprove of \nthis deal.\n  So this is a place where Congress came together and said: No, we want \nto play a role, even though a role is not contemplated under an \nexecutive agreement. I know this has been confusing to numbers of \npeople, but this was the only vehicle capable of winning a veto-proof \nmajority to provide Congress with this chance--a chance for the \nAmerican people to have us, on their behalf, review this agreement and \nthen vote.\n  As I mentioned, we have had more than a dozen hearings. I have spent \na great deal of time, as has the ranking member, as have all of our \ncommittee members--and the Presiding Officer the same--as have so many \npeople going through this agreement, and I oppose implementation of \nthis deal. I oppose its implementation.\n  When the President first stated his goal--his goal of ending Iran's \nnuclear program--that was something that could have achieved tremendous \nbipartisan support in this body. As a matter of fact, onward there were \ndiscussions of dismantling the program. And as we all know today--and I \nwill speak more fully on this tomorrow--rather than ending it, this \nagreement industrializes it. It allows the industrialization of the \nprogram run by the world's leading state sponsor of terror, and it does \nso with our approval.\n  Now, that is a large step from where we began these negotiations. Had \nthe President achieved the goal, I think what we would have in this \nbody is 100 Senators standing up and supporting what he said he wished \nto do with these negotiations. But we have ended up with something that \ncertainly is a far cry from that.\n  Instead of having anytime, anywhere inspections, I think everyone \nunderstands there is a managed inspection process. Certainly, there are \nsome issues relative to the IAEA that have given many Members \ntremendous concern.\n  The thing that is one of the most troubling aspects of this is that \nthrough the course of these negotiations, the leverage--where right \nnow, basically, the world community has had its boot on a rogue \nnation's throat--in 9 months the leverage shifts from these nations--\nour nation being one of those--having them in a position where we might \nnegotiate something that ends their program to now, where instead what \nhappens is the leverage shifts to Iran. The leverage shifts to Iran.\n  They are going to receive, as we know, billions of dollars. Most \npeople think the number is around $100 billion. By the way, they have a \n$406 billion gross domestic product. That is the size of their economy. \nWe are going to release to them over the next 9 months about $100 \nbillion--25 percent of their economy in 9 months.\n  The President has said, and surely others, that some of this is going \nto be used to sponsor terrorism. We know that. Think about if we had 25 \npercent of our GDP given to us over the next 9 months. We have an $18 \ntrillion GDP--$4 trillion or $5 trillion given to us over the next 9 \nmonths. Certainly, this is going to have an impact on what they are \nable to do.\n  What Iran is going to be able to say in 9 months--when we push back \non violations in the agreement, when we push back on terrorism and we \npush back on human rights violations--is that because most of the \nsanctions will be lifted at that moment, they will have their money, \nand their economy will be growing, well, look, if you push back, we \nthink this is unfair. They are already making these statements in Iran: \nWe will just resume our nuclear program.\n  So instead of our having leverage over them, they are going to have \nleverage over us. They are going to have leverage over us. This is in \nthe vacuum of having no Middle Eastern policy. I don't say this to be \npejorative. We know we have no policy in the Middle East to push back \nagainst Iran. We know that. So this agreement is going to end up being \nour de facto policy, and everything is going to be measured by this: \nWhat will Iran do if we push back?\n  What if we push back against the fact that they are giving Hamas \nrockets to fire into Israel? What if we push back against what \nHezbollah is doing in Lebanon and what they are doing in Syria? What if \nwe push back against what the IRGC--the arm of the Supreme Leader--is \ndoing right now to protect Assad? They are the shock force to keep \nAssad in power right now.\n  We know that right now in prisons in Syria people are being tortured. \nWe saw it firsthand. The ranking member and I went over to see what was \nhappening at the Holocaust Memorial Museum presentation where Caesar, \nsomeone working for the Assad regime, took photographs. We know as we \nstand here in these comfortable settings in the Chamber of the Senate, \npeople are being tortured, their genitals are being removed, and Iran \nis supporting that.\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\nWe know that--the fact that they are going to have some resources to do \nmore of that, to do the same thing with the Houthis in Yemen, to \nsupport terrorists and people who are trying to disrupt the Government \nof Bahrain.\n  Look, the leverage shifts to them. All they can say--what they are \ngoing to be able to say--if we push back against those activities is \nthis: Well, look, we think you are being unfair. We are just going to \nresume our program.\n  I don't understand. This is beyond me. I have had no one explain it \nto me. I know the Senator from Illinois had the diplomats from the \nother countries come in. I have no idea why in this last meeting in \nGeneva we agreed to lift the conventional weapons ban after 5 years. \nWhat did that have to do with the nuclear file? And then we lifted the \nballistic missile technology embargo in 8 years? What was that about? \nThen, as we know, with some really weird language that is in the \nagreement, we immediately lifted the ban on ballistic missile testing.\n  I think everyone here knows--the people sitting in the audience, \npeople watching--that Iran has no practical need whatsoever for this \nprogram--none. Let me say that one more time. Here is a country with \n19,000 centrifuges--10,000 of them operating. They have an underground \nfacility at Fordow. They have a facility at Arak that produces \nplutonium. They have all kinds of research and development.\n  And by the way, this agreement approves further research and \ndevelopment of their centrifuges. As a matter of fact, it paves the way \nfor them and also times it out perfectly for them to be in a position \nto be at zero breakout time, which is exactly what the President said \nthey would be at, in 13 years. They can just agree to this agreement, \nand they can just continue to implement this agreement and be in that \nposition. But they have no practical need--none.\n  Some people have said: Well, if they really want to pursue the \ntechnology of medical isotopes, maybe--maybe--they could use 500 \ncentrifuges. Think about this. We have a country with one nuclear \nreactor, a country that could buy the enriched uranium to provide the \nenergy for that cheaply on the market. Instead, they have put their \nentire society through grinding sanctions that have harmed families. \nThey have been doing that for years for something they have no \npractical need for. There is only one need, and we all know that, which \nis to be in the position to be a nuclear-armed country.\n  So let me say one more time that every Senator here supported this \nprocess except for one. The American people deserve to know where their \nelected officials stand on this consequential agreement. I hope people \non both sides will cause this to be a sober debate. I know it will be \nimpassioned, and people will certainly be speaking strongly about the \npros and cons of this agreement.\n  I do hope at the end of the day--while I was gone--I digress--there \nwere discussions about filibustering the right to vote on this Iran \nagreement. I read about it in some magazines here, that instead of this \nbeing about people expressing themselves relative to a policy they felt \nwas important to the country, apparently all of a sudden it became \nabout something else.\n  I would just say to my colleagues, I don't know how we can be in a \nplace where we have said to our constituents that we want to review and \nvote on this agreement and then, over some revisionist statement or \nthought, come up with a process that says: No, we are going to \nfilibuster it; we really don't want people to vote.\n  It is my hope that over the course of the next several days cooler \nheads will prevail and that we of course will have, I believe, a very \nsober debate. I think my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nseen what the leader just did to try to ensure that we keep the debate \nabout approval or disapproval--in this case, disapproval--of this \nparticular deal, and I hope that very soon we will all be able to \nexpress ourselves with a vote on the deal itself, whether we believe it \nis in our Nation's interest. I do not. Some do. Let's have a debate in \na sober way.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORKER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee how much I appreciate his good work, together with \nthe ranking member Senator Cardin, whom he alluded to earlier, but the \nSenator from Tennessee just said something which I think every American \nshould find troubling, and that is perhaps the single-most important \nnational security issue facing the country since the authorization for \nuse of force in Iraq in 2002; that there might be a partisan filibuster \nof our ability even to have that up-or-down vote on the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  I ask the Senator from Tennessee, is he aware of reports that the \nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini has said the Iranian Parliament will \nhave the final word on this deal in Iran?\n  I wonder how the Senator would characterize a partisan filibuster in \nthe U.S. Senate, preventing such an up-or-down vote in the Senate, \nwhile the Iranian Parliament would have the ability for that up-or-down \nvote in that institution.\n  Mr. CORKER. I did read those reports. I said to my friend from \nIllinois earlier: Look, there has been so much that has occurred from \nthe very beginning that has caused people on each side to, in some \ncases, raise the partisan flag or think that this is a debate which \ncould devolve into something that was of that orientation. What we have \ndone, as the Senator mentioned, is we have risen above that, and we \npassed something that allows us to debate and to vote.\n  I read with interest what the Supreme Leader has said. I think he is \nhedging his bets, and no doubt he is going to take it to their \nParliament and allow them to vote and debate. I hope that here, the \ncitizens of our country will be shown that same respect and expect that \ntheir Senators and their House Members will have the opportunity to \nvote on the actual policy which has been negotiated and agreed to by \nthese various countries. I hope that will be the case and, yes, I was \nvery aware of that.\n  With that, without objection, I wish to yield the floor to my great \nfriend, the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee. \nTogether, we have marched through some incredible hearings. I think all \nof us have studied this dutifully. That could not have occurred without \nhis incredible cooperation and that of his staff. I thank him for his \nleadership. I thank him for his willingness to seek a place where the \nSenate can deal with this in the appropriate way.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend Senator \nCorker for his leadership but, more importantly, thank him on behalf of \nthe Senate for standing up for what I think is the appropriate role of \nthe United States Senate in reviewing a major foreign policy issue.\n  I have had the opportunity to serve with four different chairmen in \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee since I have been in the Senate: \nSenator Corker, Senator Menendez, Secretary Kerry, and Vice President \nBiden. All four fought for the Senate having the appropriate role in \nestablishing foreign policy.\n  We are a country that believes our system of democracy serves our \ncountry the best; that is, with separation of branches of government. \nWe don't have a parliamentary system. We have an independent Congress--\na Congress that is expected to provide independence in its reviews of \nthe laws of our country and the policies of our Chief Executive, and \nthat is exactly what we are doing in this debate.\n  I thank Senator Corker for his extraordinary leadership of our \ncommittee. I know I speak for both Democrats and Republicans in saying \nthat we support the independence of the Senate in reviewing our work.\n  Senator Durbin--I listened to his comments. Senator Durbin is a dear \nfriend of mine. The two of us have fought together on human rights \nissues around the globe. We have fought for civil liberties in the \nUnited States. We have worked together on so many important issues, \nincluding in the Middle East. I deeply respect his views.\n  There are Members on both sides who have reached different \nconclusions, but we are all committed to making sure\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\nIran does not become a nuclear weapons state, and we honestly believe \nour view is the best way for that to be accomplished. I don't challenge \nany other Member's decision, and I certainly don't question their \nresolve against Iran becoming a nuclear weapons state or their support \nfor our regional allies. I think each has demonstrated that throughout \ntheir career. Some of us have come to different conclusions.\n  I strongly believe we must prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear \nweapons state. It is a game-changer in the region. We have already \nheard from my colleagues that Iran is one of the principal purveyors of \nterrorism in that region. It would accelerate an arms race that already \nhas too many arms in its region. It would make it so much more \ndifficult to confront Iranian policy if they possess a nuclear weapon. \nPresident Obama is right to say we will not let that happen and that \nall options are on the table to make sure that doesn't happen, and \nCongress is right to say we support all options being on the table to \nmake sure Iran does not become a nuclear weapons state. That is a goal \nwe all have.\n  In this independent review, some of us believe the best way to \naccomplish that is to move forward with the agreement negotiated by the \nObama administration. Others believe that is not the case.\n  I wish to second what Senator Corker said about the Iran Nuclear \nAgreement Review Act. I was proud to be part of putting that bill \ntogether and gaining broad support in the Congress and the support of \nthe administration. I think it put us in a much stronger position in \nnegotiating in Vienna. I think the fact that we had set up the right \nway for a congressional review--that it was going to be a transparent \nreview, a critical review--put our negotiators in the strongest \npossible positions in Vienna. I also think it provided the right type \nof review, so that after the agreement was reached, information would \nbe made available to us, we would have an open process, the American \npeople would learn more about it, and we would be in a better position \nto make our own judgment. It was clear in the review act that no action \nis required. We can't pass resolutions of approval or disapproval.\n  I wish to mention one thing, though, that I disagree with Senator \nCorker, but maybe in the end we will come together on this issue. I \nwasn't part of the original negotiations on the review act. I came into \nit and was able to resolve the differences between the White House and \nthe Congress and many Members of Congress, but it was clear, in talking \nto the architects of this legislation, that they always anticipated \nthere would be a 60-vote threshold for the passage of this resolution \nin the Senate.\n  I agree with Senator Corker that we shouldn't have to use filibusters \nand we shouldn't have to have procedural votes; that we should have a \nvote on the merits. I thought Senator Reid's suggestion was the right \nway to go. I hope we can find a way that we can avoid the procedural \nbattles and be able to take up this issue and let every Member vote \ntheir conscience as to whether to support or disapprove of the \nresolution.\n  I told the people of Maryland after the review--let me say how this \nreview went. We had 2\\1/2\\ weeks of review before the recess, and \nSenator Corker worked our committee unmercifully as far as what we did. \nWe had hearings, we had briefings, we had classified briefings, we had \nMember meetings, and to the credit of the Members of the committee, all \n19 showed up. These meetings went on for about 4 hours each. So we were \nback-to-back-to-back in our briefings and in trying to understand what \nwas in the agreement for the 2\\1/2\\ weeks we were here.\n  I then went back to Maryland, as I am sure my colleagues went back to \ntheir States, and had a chance for the first time to meet with \nMarylanders and to talk with Marylanders, to express and talk with them \nand get their views, and to evaluate whether I thought it was best to \ngo forward. It was a close call, but I decided I could not support the \nagreement.\n  I just wish to share why I cannot support the agreement--and Senator \nCorker mentioned this: It places Iran, after a time period, in the \nposition of enrichment of uranium that is dangerously close to being \nable to break out to a nuclear weapon in compliance with the agreement. \nBeing legal, they can get to that point. At that point, they have \nalready gotten sanctions relief, so they are in a much better financial \nposition to be able to withstand any pressures that could be put on \nIran. We know they want to become a nuclear weapons state. They have \ntried in the past. We know that. That has pretty well been documented. \nWe have no reason to believe they are going to change their intentions. \nSo if they want to become a nuclear weapons state and they make the \ncalculation that we really don't have a sanctioned way to stop them--\nbecause at that point their economic strength is strong enough and \nsanctions take too long to really bite and take effect--it would not be \nan effective deterrent to erase the breakout.\n  Here is the key point of concern to me--and I acknowledge to all my \ncolleagues that I don't know what is going to happen in the future. \nThis is a close call, but I think there is a higher risk of potential \nmilitary operation if we go forward with this agreement because we \ndon't have effective sanctions once they have been removed. That \nconcerns me because I don't think a military option is a good option. I \ndon't believe it will eliminate the threat, and it has a lot of \ncollateral issues involved with the military operation.\n  I acknowledge that if we do not go forward with this agreement, there \nis a risk. There is no question about it. There is high risk in either \ndirection. But if we were to reject the agreement, what would happen? \nWell, no one can tell for sure. No one can tell for sure. There is a \nrisk factor.\n  In my conversations with our European allies, they certainly want us \nto approve this agreement--don't get me wrong--but they know they have \nto work with the United States. They know Europe and the United States \nneed to be in this together, and for their companies to be able to get \nfull access to Iran, they have to work with the United States on a \nsanctions regime. They understand that.\n  Iran also understands that if we reject this agreement and they were \nto rush out to try to develop a nuclear weapon, it would ignite unity \nin the international community of action against Iran. They know that. \nThey have to make that calculation. Iran also wants sanctions relief \nfrom the United States.\n  I can't predict the future, but I believe all parties will want a \ndiplomatic solution. I understand that is not going to be easy, and \nmaybe we will have to mix it up a little bit and put some other issues \non the table. We have a lot of issues with Iran. We know about their \nterrorism, their interference in the region, et cetera. It may give us \nthat opportunity. My point is, no one can predict the future. I came to \nthat conclusion, and I understand others came to different conclusions.\n  There are other concerns I have with the agreement, including the 24-\nday delay. That doesn't concern me on known sites. It concerns me on \nundeclared sites and whether that will be adequate based on our \nintelligence information.\n  I am concerned about the possible military dimension that there isn't \nany consequence, as I see it, in the agreement if there is not an \naccurate account of what happened in the past. I wish it was more \nclear. I don't think the arms embargo relief should have been in this \nagreement.\n  I must say, I am concerned with the language in the agreement that \ntalks about the United States and Iran with mutual respect and \nnormalization. I don't know how we can have mutual respect for a \ncountry that actively foments regional instability and advocates \nIsrael's destruction, kills innocents, and shouts ``Death to \nAmericans,'' so I came to the conclusion that I couldn't support the \nagreement.\n  Others came to opposite views. Each of us did what we thought was \nbest, and I respect that this is a vote of conscience. I do want to \npoint out one comment that was made a little bit earlier by my \ncolleague about the Iraq war. I voted against the Iraq war. It was not \na hard vote for me because, quite frankly, I didn't see the \nintelligence information that would have justified the authorization \nfor use of military force. But it was a controversial vote.\n  In my congressional district, it was an extremely unpopular vote, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nreactions were not too much different than the reactions we are getting \ntoday in regards to this particular agreement with Iran. I voted \nagainst that, along with a lot of my colleagues.\n  When that vote was over and it was a done deal and we pursued our \nmilitary operations in Iraq, I joined with all my colleagues and the \nadministration to give us the best possible chance for America to \nsucceed because that is our responsibility. That is our system. Our \nsystem is independent review. But when the review is over, it is time \nfor us to come together.\n  So, yes, I have been talking to my Republican colleagues. I have been \ntalking to my colleagues who are voting for the agreement and those who \nare voting against it as to how we can work together in a responsible \nmanner when this debate is over so the United States can be in the \nstrongest possible position, working with the administration, to \nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon state. Working together, I \nthink we can help the administration have a stronger position, knowing \nthe independence of Congress.\n  The administration has said and we can underscore that all options \nare on the table to make sure Iran will not become a nuclear weapon \npower. The administration has said and we can underscore that there is \na need for a regional security strategy so that our partners know of \nour commitment to the region against whatever happens with Iran. The \nadministration has suggested and we can reinforce that our closest ally \nin the region, Israel, will have the security it needs as a partner \nwith the United States. The administration has stated and we can \nreinforce that we will be active and pursue terrorism by Iran if they \nincrease their terrorism or attempt terrorism against the United \nStates. We can speak to that. We can make sure that we are better \ninformed and that we have the information we need to see whether Iran \nis using their sanctions relief so that we can act timely with the \nadministration to protect U.S. interests.\n  I think we can speak with a strong voice when this debate is over, \nand I hope that during the next 2 weeks the debate that takes place on \nthe floor of the Senate and the House of Representatives reflects the \nbest tradition of the Congress in our independent review and our firm \ncommitment to work on behalf of America. We must stand firm in our \ndetermination to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. We must \nagree to counter Iranian support for terrorism and confront Iranian \nviolations of ballistic missile protocols and international human \nrights obligations. Congress and the administration cannot dwell on \npast disagreements. Together we must find a functional bipartisan \napproach to Iran. I stand ready to work with my colleagues and the \nadministration to achieve such a result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Maryland \nfor his comments and his tremendous leadership on this issue. I note \nthat Senator Collins is here to speak. It is my understanding that she \nwill speak for approximately 30 minutes. Senator Cornyn may be down \nshortly thereafter to speak and then Senator Kaine.\n  I know some people referred to the fact that it is only those who \nwanted to go to war with Iraq who are supporting this. But not only did \nthe ranking member not support going to war with Iraq, neither did \nSenator Menendez from New Jersey, who, again, opposes this agreement. \nThat type of characterization certainly is not the way that this is. \nThe two most knowledgeable Democrats in the Senate on this issue by far \nboth oppose it.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nwho represents a beautiful State. We thank her for her contributions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee for his leadership on this issue, for \nbriefing us, for arranging for briefings, and for his very thorough \nanalysis. I also want to commend the Senator from Maryland for his vote \nof conviction, for doing what he believed was correct, for showing the \ncourage to cast a vote of true conscience. I was honored to be here on \nthe Senate floor to listen to his comments today.\n  President Obama's agreement with the Iranian Government with respect \nto its nuclear program is one of the most important foreign policy \ndecisions ever to face the Senate. The vote that we shall cast will not \nbe an easy one. The security of our Nation and the stability of the \nMiddle East, as well as America's leadership in the world, are affected \nby this agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or \nthe JCPOA.\n  Thus, I have devoted countless hours to studying the agreement and \nits annexes, attending Intelligence Committee sessions and other \nclassified briefings, questioning Secretary of State John Kerry, \nSecretary of Energy Ernie Moniz, and our intelligence officials, \nincluding the top manager for Iran, talking with our negotiators and \nwith ambassadors, and discussing the agreement with experts with \ndivergent views to ensure that my decision is as well informed as \npossible.\n  Let me begin by making clear that I supported the administration's \nundertaking these negotiations with Iran. Indeed, I was heartened when \nPresident Obama initially said in October of 2012 that ``our goal is to \nget Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide \nby the U.N. resolutions that have been in place.'' He went on to say: \n``The deal we'll accept is, they end their nuclear program. It's very \nstraightforward.''\n  I was optimistic that the administration would produce an agreement \nthat would accomplish the goals the President laid out. Along with six \nof my Republican colleagues, I did not sign a letter to the leaders of \nthe Iranian Government sent in the midst of the negotiations because I \nwanted to give the administration every opportunity to complete an \nagreement that would have accomplished the goals the President himself \noriginally set forth as the purpose of these negotiations.\n  I have long believed that a verifiable diplomatic agreement with Iran \nthat dismantled its nuclear infrastructure and blocked its pathways to \nthe development of a nuclear weapon would be a major achievement--an \naccomplishment that would make the world a safer place. Regrettably, \nthat does not describe the agreement that the administration \nnegotiated. The agreement is fundamentally flawed because it leaves \nIran as capable of building a nuclear weapon at the expiration of the \nagreement as it is today. Indeed, at that time, Iran will be a more \ndangerous and stronger nuclear threshold state--exactly the opposite of \nwhat these negotiations should have produced.\n  Mark Dubowitz, a noted expert on sanctions, testified before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee: ``Even if Iran doesn't violate the \nJCPOA . . . it will have patient pathways to nuclear weapons, an ICBM \nprogram, access to heavy weaponry, an economy immunized against \nsanctions pressure, and a more powerful regional position . . .''\n  Under the agreement, not a single one of Iran's 19,000 centrifuges, \nused to enrich uranium to produce the fissile material for a nuclear \nbomb, will be destroyed. Not a single one. Iran will be able to \ncontinue its research and development on advanced centrifuges able to \nenrich uranium more rapidly and more effectively. Not only will Iran \nretain its nuclear capability, but it will also be a far richer nation \nand one that has more conventional weapons and military technology than \nit possesses today.\n  The lifting of sanctions will give Iran's leaders access ultimately \nto more than $100 billion in the form of frozen assets and overseas \naccounts. Iran also will once again be able to sell its abundant oil in \nglobal markets.\n  The administration has repeatedly argued that Iranian leaders will \ninvest those billions of dollars into their own country to improve the \nlives of their citizens. The record strongly suggests otherwise.\n  Iran today is the world's foremost exporter of terrorism, pouring \nbillions of dollars into terrorist groups throughout the region and \ninto funding the murderous Assad regime in Syria. If Iran is financing, \narming, and equipping terrorist groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, \nand Yemen when its own economy is in shambles and its citizens are \nsuffering, why would anyone believe that it would invest the proceeds\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nof sanctions relief only in its own economy?\n  I do expect that Iran's leaders will invest in a few high-profile \nprojects to help their own citizens. But given their history, it is \ninevitable that billions more will be used to finance terrorism and \nstrengthens Iran's power and proxies throughout the Middle East.\n  It is deeply troubling that the administration secured no concessions \nat all from Iran, designated by our government--by the Director of \nNational Intelligence--as the number one state sponsor of terrorism, to \ncease its support of terrorist groups. Whether it is Hezbollah in \nLebanon, the Shiite militias in Iraq or the Houthis in Yemen, Iran's \nproxies are terrorizing innocent civilians, forcing families to flee \ntheir homes, and causing death and destruction. And incredibly, the \nJCPOA will end the embargoes on selling Iran intercontinental ballistic \nmissile technology and conventional weapons, which the Russians, among \nothers, are very eager to sell them.\n  Think about that for a moment. Why would Iran want to buy \nintercontinental ballistic missile technology? It already has the \ndeeply troubling capacity to launch missile strikes at Israel, which it \nhas pledged to wipe off the face of the Earth. ICBM technology poses a \ndirect threat to our Nation from a nation whose leaders continue to \nchant ``Death to America.''\n  We should also remember that the Iranian Quds forces were the source \nof the most lethal improvised explosive devices that were responsible \nfor the deaths of hundreds of our servicemembers in Iraq.\n  Why would we ever agree to lift the embargo on the sales of \nconventional weapons that could endanger our forces in the region?\n  Let me now turn to the issue of the enforcement of the agreement by \nposing the obvious question: Will Iran abide by the agreement and the \ncorresponding U.N. Security Council resolution or will it cheat? \nDespite being a signatory to the U.N. Charter, Iran has repeatedly \nviolated or ignored the United Nations Security Council resolutions \naimed at curbing its nuclear program.\n  In 2006, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution prohibiting \nIran from enriching uranium. What happened? Iran cheated. It has \nliterally thousands of centrifuges spinning to enrich uranium. Multiple \nU.N. Security Council resolutions require Iran to cooperate fully with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, and to come clean on \nwhat is known as the possible military dimensions of its nuclear \nactivities to understand how far Iran has progressed toward developing \na nuclear device and to have a verified baseline to evaluate future \nnuclear-related activities. What happened?\n  Iran cheated. Not only did it never report to international arms \ncontrol experts about the experiments at its military installation at \nParchin, where Iran is suspected of developing detonators for nuclear \ndevices, but also Iran sanitized buildings at Parchin in a manner that \nthe IAEA has described as likely to have undermined the agency's \nability to conduct effective verification. Remarkably, according to \npublic reporting, Iran has continued these sanitation activities while \nCongress was holding hearings on the agreement this summer.\n  In 2010, the U.N. Security Council adopted another resolution \nrequiring Iran to cease any activities related to ballistic missile \nactivities capable of delivering nuclear weapons. What happened?\n  Iran cheated. It launched ballistic missiles in July 2012. Given this \nhistory, there is no question in my mind that Iran will try to cheat on \nthe new agreement and exploit any loophole in the text or in the \nimplementing Security Council resolution that was, by the way, as the \nchairman has pointed out, adopted before Congress even had a chance to \nvote on the agreement. Given Iran's history of noncompliance, one would \nthink an ironclad inspection process would be put in place. Sadly, that \nis far from the reality of this agreement.\n  Let me make four points about how Iran can stymie inspections. First, \nthroughout the term of the agreement, Iran has the authority to delay \ninspections of undeclared sites. Those are the sites where inspectors \nfrom the IAEA believe that suspicious activities are occurring. \nInexplicably the JCPOA establishes up to a 24-day delay between when \nthe agency requests access to a site and when access is granted. The \nformer Deputy Director General for Safeguards at the IAEA notes that 24 \ndays is sufficient time for Iran to sanitize suspected facilities and \npoints out that past concealment activities carried out by Iran in 2003 \nleft no traces to be detected. This is a long way from the anytime, \nanywhere inspections that should have been part of this agreement given \nIran's sorry history.\n  Second, no American or Canadian experts will be allowed to be part of \nthe IAEA inspection team unless these countries reestablish official \ndiplomatic relations with Iran. I recognize that the IAEA has many \nhighly qualified experts, but the exclusion of some of the most highly \nskilled and experienced experts in the world does not inspire \nconfidence.\n  Third, and most outrageous, according to press reports, the Iranians \nthemselves will be responsible for the photographs and environmental \nsampling at Parchin, a large military installation where nuclear work \nis suspected to have been conducted and may still be underway. IAEA \nweapons inspectors will be denied physical access to Parchin. Note that \nI said ``according to press reports.'' That is because the actual \nagreement between the IAEA and Iran is secret and has been withheld \nfrom Congress.\n  As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have been briefed on the \nagreement, but like every other Member of Congress, I have been denied \naccess to the actual document despite how significant this issue is. \nThe actual text matters because of Iran's repeated efforts to exploit \nloopholes and particularly in light of press reports on what is in that \ndocument.\n  Fourth, Iran is not required to ratify the Additional Protocol before \nsanctions relief is granted, if ever. The Additional Protocol allows \nthe IAEA permanent inspection access to declared and suspected nuclear \nsites in a country in order to detect covert nuclear activities. \nRatification of the protocol would make the AP permanently and legally \nbinding in Iran.\n  Mr. President, 126 countries, including our country, have already \nratified the Additional Protocol. Yet the agreement negotiated by the \nadministration only requires Iran to ``seek ratification'' of the \nAdditional Protocol 8 years from now--in the 8th year of the \nagreement--and to comply with its terms until then. If Iran's past \nbehavior is any guide, Iran may never ratify the Additional Protocol \nand thus be subject to its permanent, legally binding inspection \nregime.\n  To prevent Iran from cheating, the administration has repeatedly \npointed to the prospect of an immediate snapback of sanctions as the \nteeth of the agreement. I will be surprised if they work as advertised. \nFirst, the rhetoric on the snapback of sanctions is inconsistent. On \nthe one hand, the administration says the United States can \nunilaterally cause the international sanctions to be reimposed. At the \nsame time, the administration repeatedly warns us that the sanctions \nregime is falling apart. Which is it?\n  Second, Iran has already made explicit in the text of the agreement \nthat the imposition of any sanctions will be treated as grounds to \nrestart its nuclear program. Included in the JCPOA is this clear \nstatement: ``Iran has stated that if sanctions are reinstated in whole \nor in part, Iran will treat that as grounds to cease performing its \ncommitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.'' In effect, Iran has \ngiven advance notice that if the United States or any of its partners \ninsist on reimposing sanctions, Iran can simply walk away from the \ndeal. Given their investment in the deal, I am very skeptical that any \nof the P5+1 countries will be willing to take that action.\n  After the United Nations Security Council endorsed this agreement on \nJuly 20, the Iranians actually released a statement saying they may \nreconsider its commitments if new sanctions impair the business and \ntrade resulting from the lifting of nuclear sanctions, ``irrespective \nof whether such new sanctions are introduced on nuclear-related or \nother grounds.''\n  Let's think about the implications of that for a moment. The Iranians \nare saying a sanction is a sanction is a\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nsanction, and Iran appears ready to resume its nuclear activities if \nany sanctions are reimposed, even if the purpose is nonnuclear, even if \nthe purpose is to halt Iran's financing of terrorists groups.\n  That means, if the United States reimposes a sanction in response to \nthe Iranians continuing to finance, train, arm, and equip terrorist \ngroups all over the world, Iran, the foremost exporter of terrorism, \naccording to our own Director of National Intelligence, can just walk \naway from the agreement we are being asked to approve.\n  Third, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nthe agreement states that sanctions would not be applied ``with \nretroactive effect to contracts signed between any party and Iran or \nIranian entities prior to the date of application.'' This \ngrandfathering clause will create an immediate rush of businesses to \nlock in long-term business contracts with Iran. Iranian Foreign \nMinister Zarif assured Iranian lawmakers that the swarming of business \nfor reinvesting their money is the biggest barrier to the reimposition \nof sanctions, and he is right.\n  The State Department insists that each case will be worked on an \nindividual basis, but there is no guarantee that any case, much less \nevery case, will be resolved in the short time period necessary.\n  There are alternatives to the deeply flawed agreement reached in \nVienna. While I recognize that it would be difficult, the fact is, the \nadministration could renegotiate a better deal. As Orde Kittrie, the \nformer lead State Department attorney for nuclear issues, recently \nnoted in the Wall Street Journal, the Senate has required changes to \nmore than 200 treaties that were ultimately ratified after \ncongressional concerns were addressed.\n\n  This is not unusual. For example, the 1997 resolution of ratification \nregarding the multilateral Chemical Weapons Convention included 28 \nconditions inserted by the Senate. The treaty was ultimately ratified \nand currently is in force in 191 participating nations, including Iran \nand the United States. Similarly, the Senate insisted that the \nThreshold Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union have additional \nprovisions strengthening compliance measures before it was ratified.\n  Of course, one of the problems with this agreement is that it is not \nin the form of a treaty, which precludes the Senate from inserting \nreservations, understandings, or declarations. But that does not mean \nthis agreement cannot be renegotiated, and there are so many precedents \nfor side agreements or renegotiations of treaties themselves--more than \n200 times.\n  Another alternative to this agreement would be to further wield our \nunilateral financial and economic power against those conducting \nbusiness with key Iranian entities. Juan Zarate, the first Assistant \nSecretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:\n\n       We can't argue in the same breath that ``snapback'' \n     sanctions as constructed offer a real Sword of Damocles to be \n     wielded over the heads of the Iranians for years while \n     arguing that there is no way now for the United States to \n     maintain the crippling financial and economic isolation which \n     helped bring the Iranians to the table.\n\n  Every country and every business would have to choose whether to do \nbusiness with a nuclear Iran or with the United States. I am confident \nthat most countries and most businesses would make the right choice.\n  Despite these options, the administration negotiated a pact in which \nits redlines were abandoned, compromised, or diluted, while the \nIranians held firm to their core principles.\n  The Iranians have secured the following if this agreement moves \nforward: broad sanctions relief, a U.N.-blessed domestic uranium \nenrichment capability, international acceptance of Iran as a nuclear \nthreshold state, international acceptance of its indigenous ballistic \nmissile program, the lifting of the arms and the ICBM embargoes, repeal \nof all previous U.N. Security Council resolutions, and removal of the \nIranian nuclear issue from the U.N. Security Council agenda.\n  Accordingly, I shall cast my vote for the motion of disapproval. I \nbelieve Iran will bide its time, perfect its R on advanced \ncentrifuges, secure an ICBM capability, and build a nuclear weapon as \nthe JCPOA is phased out.\n  It is time for Congress to reject the JCPOA and for the \nadministration to negotiate a new agreement, as has been done so many \ntimes in the past when the Senate raised serious concerns. The stakes \nare simply too high and the risks too great for us to do otherwise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Remembering Lieutenant Joe Gliniewicz\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are many brokenhearted people today \nin the small town of Fox Lake, IL. They are mourning the loss of \nLieutenant Charles Joseph Gliniewicz. His friends and family called him \nJoe. At work they called him GI Joe. That all-American nickname was an \nadmiring tribute to Lieutenant Gliniewicz's nearly 30 years of service \nto the U.S. Army, the Army Reserves, and to his appearance and \ndemeanor.\n  At age 52, Lieutenant Gliniewicz was fit and strong. He stood ramrod \nstraight. He wore his hair high and tight like a drill sergeant. But \nthe physical characteristic people mention most about Lieutenant \nGliniewicz was his smile.\n  Everyone knew GI Joe in Fox Lake, IL. He served on the town's police \nforce for 32 years. He was supposed to retire at the end of last month, \nbut he stayed on just 1 more month to ensure the smooth transition of a \nvolunteer youth program to which he devoted thousands of hours over \nnearly 30 years.\n  A week ago today, September 1--the day that would have been \nLieutenant Gliniewicz's first day of retirement--he was shot and killed \nin the line of duty. It was 8 o'clock in the morning. Lieutenant \nGliniewicz was driving down a road lined with open fields and \nabandoned-looking businesses when he spotted three men who raised \nsuspicion. He radioed the police dispatcher that he was going to pursue \nthem on foot. The dispatcher asked if he needed help. Lieutenant \nGliniewicz said: Sure, send them. When backup officers arrived 3 \nminutes later, they couldn't find him. A few minutes later, they found \nLieutenant Gliniewicz 50 yards from his patrol car. He had been fatally \nshot.\n  Law enforcement agencies are still searching for the three men \nresponsible. They have only a very sketchy description: three men, two \nWhite, one Black.\n  In the days that followed the murder, hundreds of law enforcement \nofficers poured into Fox Lake in Lake County. They were joined by \nmembers of just about every major law enforcement agency, all people \ncan think of, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives, the FBI, and even the Secret Service. Dozens of officers \nsuffered heat exhaustion as they searched the woods and swamps. They \nare still searching today for his killers. We all want to see them \nbrought to justice swiftly.\n  Lieutenant Gliniewicz was married for 26\\1/2\\ years to his wife \nMelodie. They call her Mel for short. They were parents of four sons \nranging in age from early twenties to their teens. One of his sons \nserves in the U.S. Army.\n  The day after Lieutenant Gliniewicz's murder, hundreds of local folks \nturned out for a rally in Fox Lake to show their love for him and his \nfamily. It would just break your heart to see pictures of Melodie \nGliniewicz and her four now fatherless sons smiling through their \nanguish, trying to support each other and their grieving neighbors.\n  Folks in Fox Lake said that Joe Gliniewicz loved his town and he was \nalways the first to volunteer at whatever local administration needed \nhelp with an event. One resident told the local newspaper:\n\n       Everyone in town knew who he was. Whether you were on a \n     first-name basis or knew his rank, you knew he was a great \n     guy.\n\n  This resident added:\n\n       Just being involved in his community, he took pride in it. \n     This is where he lived, and it's what he fought to protect. \n     He took great pride in making the town of Fox Lake the place \n     it is.\n\n  Lieutenant Gliniewicz was a volunteer with the Special Olympics and a \nlot of other groups. The organization he was closest to was the Fox \nLake Police Department Explorers, a group\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\nwho mentors young people who want to aspire to law enforcement. Joe \nGliniewicz established Fox Lake's Explorer Post No. 300 nearly 30 years \nago. Over the years, he has seen hundreds of explorers in training get \ninto law enforcement and the military. His death is felt so deeply by \nthese young people, by Lieutenant Gliniewicz's family, friends, and \nneighbors, and by his brothers and sisters in blue not only in Fox Lake \nbut throughout Illinois and across America.\n  Lieutenant Gliniewicz was the first on-duty officer fatally shot in \nLake County, IL, since 1980 and the third law enforcement fatality in \nIllinois this year, according to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial \nFund. According to the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nfirearms-related deaths of law enforcement officers in the United \nStates are down 24 percent this year compared to the same period last \nyear, January 1 to September 8. There were 34 last year and 26 this \nyear. While that downward trend is good news, even one police officer \nkilled in the line of duty is way too many.\n  In Fox Lake and in towns across America, countless families have \nreplaced the lightbulbs on their front porches with blue lightbulbs to \nshow their support for their local police.\n  Yesterday, on Labor Day, there was a memorial service at the high \nschool for Lieutenant Gliniewicz. They packed it with law enforcement \nofficials from all over--not just Lake County, IL, but the Midwest and \nacross the Nation. It was an 18-mile funeral parade or funeral caravan \nthat went off to the cemetery afterward--18 miles long--and it was \nfilled with admirers and friends and people standing on the roads with \nhomemade signs.\n  Lieutenant Gliniewicz really made a difference in people's lives. It \nis sad to lose him. When we reflect on the great contribution he made \nto his community, to his county, to my State of Illinois, and to our \nNation, it is with heartfelt gratitude that we say to his family: We \nare by your side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as have all of our colleagues, I have been \ntraveling around my State over the last few weeks listening to my \nconstituents and trying to understand what their concerns are. I have \nto tell my colleagues that Washington is not in high repute. People \nsense the country is heading in the wrong direction. They have \nentrusted us with the way to navigate that, and they feel as though we \nhave not succeeded in getting our country back on the right track. I \nknow that when it comes to security issues--and of all the issues the \nFederal Government deals with, national security is the only one we \ncan't delegate to someone else. It is our No. 1 responsibility as a \nFederal Government. State government can't do it. Local government \ncan't do it. We can't do it for ourselves, so we depend on the Federal \nGovernment to make sure our Nation is safe and secure, which is a \nprecondition for all of the other liberties and privileges we enjoy.\n  As part of the roundtables and visits I had, I took part in one in \nHouston, TX, where we addressed a wide variety of issues, but the No. 1 \nissue that came up was the Iranian nuclear deal. There is no issue more \ncompelling or concerning to this particular group of folks or my \nconstituents back home than the President's deal with Iran because \npeople recognize that Iran is a state sponsor of international \nterrorism, and what this does is it paves the way to them getting \nbigger and more lethal weapons.\n  They are also very concerned, as they should be, that this deal \nrequires us to trust an adversary who has done nothing to earn it. I \nknow the President has said there is no trust involved, but in the \nabsence of trust, one would at least think there would be adequate \nverification mechanisms.\n  Of course, I know Secretary Moniz has disavowed his earlier comments \nabout anytime, anywhere inspections, and we then learned that there is \nthis convoluted process of 24 days' notice and some arbitration before \nthe IAEA will gain access to some sites and then, as the Associated \nPress reported, the sidebar deals, which, if these reports in the \npublic domain are accurate, would basically require Iran to inspect \nitself.\n  The reason people are so anxious and concerned about this is there is \nno doubt about that. Their concerns are well taken, but I think of all \nthe things that concern my constituents and the people I talked to \nduring August about this deal, it is Iran's long history of supporting \nterrorism, including attacks on the United States and our allies.\n  It is no exaggeration to say the Iranian regime has American blood on \nits hands, and it has had for many years. Former Secretary of State and \nNational Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice put it well when she said: \nIran has been the country that has, in many ways, been kind of a \ncentral banker for terrorism. It is Iran that has been conducting these \nproxy wars against Israel, the United States, and our allies since the \nregime came into power as a result of the revolution in 1979.\n  Even President Obama and his National Security Advisor Susan Rice \nadmitted earlier this summer that the Iranian Government could use the \n$100 billion in cash they are going to get as a result of sanctions \nrelief to help fund terrorist attacks, to help fund these terrorist \ngroups.\n  Here is what the President said. I guess he has resigned himself to \nit. He said: ``The truth is that Iran has always found a way to fund \nthese efforts.'' Well, that does not make me feel any more at ease, nor \nshould it make any of our allies feel any more at ease about Iran and \nits intentions and what it will do with these funds that will be \nrelieved from sanctions. That does not even address the million barrels \nof oil a day which now Iran will be able to ply to markets all around \nthe world and the revenue they will be able to generate from that.\n  The President may believe that there is nothing we can do about Iran \nfunneling money to terrorist groups that seek to attack us and our \nallies, but we cannot afford to just shrug our shoulders with \nindifference. That seems to be what the President's reaction is: Well, \nIran has always done it and they will do it with this money. But he \nacts as if there is nothing he nor we can or should do about it. Iran's \nhistory of bankrolling terrorist activity deserves our attention and \nshould be the focus of this deal, and it should be a major \nconsideration as we proceed to assess the merits of this nuclear \narrangement and vote on a resolution of disapproval.\n  I wish to pause a minute just to tell the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, not just because he is sitting next to me but \nbecause it is true, that I admire and appreciate his leadership through \nthis very convoluted maze we have had to proceed down until we have \ngotten to this point. But how ironic would it be that after the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, working with the ranking \nmember and getting a vote of Congress and a signature of the President \nallowing a resolution of disapproval--how ironic would it be if a \npartisan filibuster blocks an up-or-down vote on that resolution of \ndisapproval. It is just shocking to me, but that is what the minority \nleader, Senator Reid, and indeed the President of the United States \nhimself apparently are talking about--blocking a vote on the resolution \nof disapproval that they cooperated in crafting and that bears the \nPresident's signature, that process by which that is to play out.\n  But, again, that is another reason people get so disgusted with what \nthey see in Washington--because they feel there is no accountability. \nPeople get away with whatever they can. There is no right and wrong \nanymore. There are no rules that apply to everyone evenly and \nevenhandedly. There is no--in the words above the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States--there is no ``equal justice under the law.'' It does not \nseem to apply.\n  Well, just digressing a moment and talking again about this \nthreatened partisan filibuster of the resolution of disapproval--and \nagain I hope and pray our colleagues across the aisle, the 41 who have \nsaid they will vote against the resolution of disapproval, I hope they \nwill reconsider if they are even thinking about a partisan filibuster \nof the resolution itself and not even getting to the resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  They have every right to vote according to their conscience and as \nthey believe they should vote on the resolution of disapproval, but the \nidea of blocking a vote by a filibuster--it just\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\nstrikes me as reckless and irresponsible, especially in light of this: \nI mentioned this to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee a \nfew moments ago, but I will come back to it because I find it so \nshocking.\n  A few days ago in the Wall Street Journal, there was a discussion or \nactually a report from the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the \nSupreme Leader of Iran, who declared Thursday--it said in this story of \nSeptember 3--that the Iranian Parliament would have the final word on \nthe deal. It says the Parliament speaker delivered a similar message to \nreporters in New York later in the day, saying he supports the deal \nwhich would lift crippling economic sanctions on Iran in return for \ncurbs on the country's nuclear activities. The speaker of the Iranian \nParliament said the agreement needs to be discussed and it needs to be \napproved by the Iranian Parliament. There will be heated discussions \nand debates.\n  I would hate the fact, if it was to occur--and I hope it does not--\nthat the Iranian Parliament would have a more open, accountable, and \ndemocratic process than the Senate. I hope we do not head down the road \nof a partisan filibuster, no matter how this resolution turns out. It \nwould be a mistake, it would be a self-inflicted wound to the Senate \nand to the respect which we would like to garner from the American \npeople.\n  They would see this as business as usual, and I think it would add to \ntheir disgust. I hope Members, as they return to Washington today and \nas we begin to debate this deal, I hope they will recall--and let me, \njust in a brief few minutes, refresh some of their collective live \nmemories about Iran's long history of terrorism against the United \nStates and our allies. I actually had a chance last week when I was in \nDallas, TX, to discuss this matter with a gentleman named Rick Kupke in \nDallas, TX. He actually lives in Arlington, TX, right between Fort \nWorth and Dallas.\n\n  But Rick was a former U.S. Foreign Service officer. He has learned \nfirsthand how the Iranian regime targets and attacks Americans because \nhe was the last American captured in 1979 at the U.S. Embassy in Iran \nduring the Iranian hostage crisis. He was one of dozens of Americans \nheld in captivity for 444 days under the constant threat of death. But \nmany will also remember two other terrorist bombings that occurred in \n1983 that targeted American citizens. One blew up the U.S. Embassy in \nBeirut and the other blew up the U.S. Marine barracks at Beirut \nInternational Airport. Combined, these bombings killed more than 250 \nAmerican citizens, including 8 Texans, 7 of them marines and another a \nsoldier.\n  It is well known and documented that these attacks were perpetrated \nby the terrorist group Hezbollah under the direction of the Iranian \nregime. That is how the Iranian regime does its dirty work. It does it \nthrough proxies, not directly but through proxies like Hezbollah.\n  Iran, while it has denied any involvement in these attacks, does not \nshy away from celebrating these bombings that have killed hundreds of \nAmericans. In 2004, a little more than 20 years after the bombings, the \nIranian Government erected a monument--a monument in its capital to \ncommemorate the ``martyrs'' who carried out those attacks.\n  Later in 1985, Hezbollah, together with another terrorist group, \nhijacked a Trans World Airlines flight, holding hostages and beating \nits passengers for 2 weeks. More than half of those passengers were \nAmerican citizens, including a group of six U.S. Navy sailors, one of \nwhom was murdered.\n  In 1996, a bombing on a housing complex in Saudi Arabia was linked to \nIranian officials that resulted in the death of 19 U.S. servicemembers, \nwounding more than 500.\n  More recently, the Defense Department has acknowledged that during \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, at least 500 Americans died at the hands of \nShiite militias who were equipped by Iran with different types of \nlethal weapons. It became well known that the explosively formed \npenetrators, which melted the armor used to shield Americans and our \nallies in Iraq, were produced by the Iranian Government, and the Quds \nForce trained people to use those against Americans and our allies.\n  Then, right here in our Nation's Capital just 4 years ago, Iranian \nofficials were implicated in a plot to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador \nto the United States. That plot reportedly included plans to bomb the \nIsraeli Embassy in Washington as well. That is a staggering list of \naggressions against the United States and our allies, both at home and \nabroad since the Iranian regime came to power in 1979.\n  I don't have the time right now to discuss the Iranian fingerprints \non the havoc being wreaked in the Middle East, from Yemen to Syria, to \nIraq. In all the major hotspots of the world, Iranian fingerprints are \nall over these activities. Of course, Iran has long sponsored militant \ngroups on Israel's borders, which have attacked Israel with rockets, \nhundreds of rockets and terrorism.\n  In southern Lebanon, Iran funds and supplies Hezbollah, which \nthreatens Israel's northern border, against which Israel went to war in \n2006. In Gaza, on Israel's southwestern border, Iran has long sponsored \nHamas. Particularly as Iranian-Hamas relations have frayed in recent \nyears, Iran has sponsored the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.\n  Suffice it to say that over the years, Iran has sown chaos across the \nMiddle East, attacking the United States and our allies, while publicly \ncelebrating the death of Americans in Tehran. So with this regime's \nlong history of aggression against the United States and its allies, I \nfind it troubling that the President characterizes any thoughtful \nquestioning of the merits of this deal as akin to warmongering. That is \nwhat the President has said: If you don't like this deal, the \nalternative is war. To which I would say: Wrong, Mr. President. The \nalternative to this deal is a better deal.\n  According to the President's twisted logic, those who are skeptical \nof this same Iran, which I have described has time and time again \ndemonstrated its aggression against the United States and which has \narticulated its principle opposition to this deal--the President would \ncharacterize the critics of this deal as the real belligerents \nencouraging war. In fact, he went so far as to say that Republican \nopponents of this deal--he has not said this yet about the opponents of \nthis deal who are members of his political party, but he has about \nRepublicans, that those who share the concerns are ``making common \ncause'' with Iranian hardliners who chant ``Death to America.''\n  Well, this debate and this vote are simply too important for it to \ndegenerate into partisanship. I know this is something the Senator from \nTennessee feels very strongly about. He has tried to elevate the debate \nand to work in a bipartisan way to bring us to this vote on a \nresolution this week.\n  I hope we don't follow the President down this low road of partisan \nrhetoric, which actually only serves to distract us from examining the \ndeal and identifying the true character of the regime that we are \nsomehow making common cause with and hoping against hope that they \nwon't continue at some point to break out and pursue those nuclear \nweapons.\n  This is not like the Soviet Union. This is not Ronald Reagan \nnegotiating with the Soviet Union. This is a theocratic regime that is \nled by an Islamic extremist who has American and other allied blood on \nhis hands and makes no bones about it.\n  So this debate needs to help the American people find the answer to \nthis crucial question. I think it boils down to this: Will this deal \nmake America and our allies safer? I think that ultimately is the \nquestion.\n  As we prepare to vote on this resolution of disapproval, I hope that \nwe will have a civil, enthusiastic, and spirited debate, as the speaker \nof the Iranian Parliament said they will have in their body, and we \nwill be able to openly and honestly discuss different points of view. \nThat is the Senate is supposed to be--a place where that can happen and \nwhere it should happen. The American people deserve that kind of \ndebate, not a partisan filibuster that cuts off the debate prematurely \nand tries to hide accountability for the ultimate outcome on the \nresolution of disapproval.\n  I look forward to that spirited debate, and I hope any thought that \nany of our colleagues might have had about engaging in a partisan \nfilibuster of this important resolution will fade quickly from their \nminds.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                Remembering Alison Parker and Adam Ward\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise today for a sad occasion, and that \nis to remember the lives of two Virginians, Alison Parker and Adam \nWard, the journalists who were gunned down on live TV in Roanoke, VA, \njust a couple of weeks ago, as they covered a local news story.\n  There was a third victim in that shooting, Vicki Gardner, the \npresident of the local chamber of commerce at Smith Mountain Lake, who \nis recovering. She was released from the hospital today, but she still \nhas a long recovery ahead of her.\n  We saw during the summer a set of these tragedies in Roanoke, VA, my \nwife's hometown, in Charleston, SC, in Lafayette, LA, and in \nChattanooga, TN. My friend, the Senator from Tennessee, is on the \nfloor.\n  In Virginia, the shooting in Roanoke, which was carried out on live \ntelevision, was horrific in itself, but it also was horrific because it \nbrought up a lot of bad memories. The Roanoke community is within about \n25 miles from Virginia Tech, where the horrible shooting happened in \n2007 that killed 32 people and wounded dozens of others.\n  I spoke on the Senate floor in April on the eighth anniversary of \nthat shooting. I talked, as is my habit to do in April, about the lives \nof those who lost their lives but also about some who survived and what \nthey are doing today. I am saddened to be here because it is just \nanother example of a horrible shooting in my Commonwealth. It is also \nsad because we really haven't made any progress in this body since I \ncame to it in terms of trying to address this issue.\n  There is a lot of work to be done--legislative and otherwise--to try \nto address the growing litany of these horrific crimes, which deeply \nscar our own psyche and, frankly, I think, portray a picture of who we \nare as a nation to the rest of the world that is not accurate about who \nwe are. I am going to introduce a bill that I think can help us address \nit. It is not the end-all solution because there isn't a single \nsolution. But I am going to talk a little bit about Alison and Adam, \nand then I wish to talk about the bill.\n  Alison and Adam worked on a show on WDBJ, the ``Mornin'' program. \nThey were sort of hometown heroes. Not only were they popular because \nthey worked for the station, they were both from the hometown. Roanoke \nis where my wife grew up. I am very, very familiar with the wonderful \nRoanoke community. They both interned at WDBJ when they were in \ncollege. They were passionate members of this journalistic profession, \nand they were just starting on these great careers.\n  Alison Parker grew up in Martinsville, which is just up the road from \nRoanoke, about a 45-minute drive. She played the trumpet and French \nhorn in high school. She graduated from James Madison University. When \nshe was at James Madison, she interned at WDBJ. They loved her work, \nand they gave her a recommendation.\n  Her first job was not there at WDBJ, but it was in North Carolina. \nBut as soon as she could move from North Carolina back to Virginia, \nthat is what she did. She came back to her hometown station. She \ncovered all kinds of news and human interest stories, including a \nrecent piece on child abuse that was a very powerful one. Her \ncolleagues describe her as ``proactive'' and ``wise beyond her years.'' \nShe met her boyfriend, whom she was planning to marry, while working at \nWDBJ.\n  Adam Ward went to Salem High School. Salem is the city that adjoins \nRoanoke. He graduated in 2007 and played football on two State \nchampionship football teams. Teachers there describe him as \n``vivacious,'' ``kind,'' ``giving,'' ``respectful,'' and ``genuine.'' \nHe had passion for Virginia Tech, the local college. He started to go \nto Tech football games with his dad when he was 3 years old. He \ninterned also at WDBJ when he was a communications student at Tech.\n  His colleagues remembered him as somebody willing to get the image \nthat reporters need. We all know in this line of work the guys behind \nthe camera are so important to it. They make the on-camera talent \nshine, and that was the way Adam was. He loved to play tricks on the \non-camera talent, kind of tweak them and make them not get above their \nstation in life, but he was a wonderful guy.\n  He found love at the station too. He had become engaged to a producer \nat the station who sadly was watching in the station the day that the \nfootage of him being killed was shown, which shocked the world.\n  I really feel for these families. I know we all do. You couldn't have \nwatched that without having a feeling, even if you were a thousand \nmiles away from the Ward and Parker families.\n  I remember having said to the Virginia Tech families this: It would \nbe presumptuous of me, and so I am not going to say I know what you \nhave lost, because I don't know what you have lost. But when you hear \nabout these people, I do feel like I have a sense of what the world \nlost, I have a sense of what the community lost. I don't know what the \nparents and the siblings lost, but you kind of have a sense when you \nhear about these people from those at WDBJ, the Roanoke community, the \ncommunity of journalists. You kind of have a sense of what we lost as a \nsociety when they were killed.\n  I should just say a word. Since 2002, Vicki Gardner has worked at the \nSmith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce. It is a major tourism \narea in Virginia, a State park. It is a feature that was created by a \nhydroelectric dam, and they were celebrating its 35th anniversary. She \nwas deeply involved in the planning.\n  Again, she was badly wounded. She has described maneuvering around to \ntry to duck bullets as she was shot in her back. She has had a couple \nof operations, but, thank God, she has been released to go home today, \nand we are thinking about her too.\n  I said the shooting opened a lot of old wounds in Virginia, and \nespecially in this community, sadly, because Virginia Tech is so close. \nWhen I spoke on the floor in April, I talked about two of these young \npeople, Colin Goddard and Lily Habtu, who survived that shooting. Just \nthink of the effect upon their lives 8 years later, as they deal with \ninjuries that continue to be a challenge, and they deal with the \nhorrible memories of that day. That was probably one of the most \nscarring events in modern history in Virginia. Everybody knows where \nthey were, and everybody knew somebody connected to it.\n  We have revisited the cycle of shock, then anger, then calls for \nchange, then wondering what the right changes were, and sympathy for \nthe families. But we haven't really changed, and I would just humbly \nsubmit that I think there are things that we can do--reasonable things \nwe can do that will bring some accountability. It will not eliminate \nthese instances. It is beyond our power to eliminate evil. We cannot do \nthat. We have to be humble about it. But in every area we work on, we \ncan work in this body with the thought that we can do things that will \nmake situations better and that will promote incremental improvements.\n\n\n                  Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about a bill that I am going to \nintroduce called the Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act. As we all \nknow, current Federal law prohibits nine categories of people from \ngetting weapons. Probably the most known are convicted felons, people \nwho have been adjudicated mentally ill and dangerous, and people who \nare under domestic violence prevention orders.\n  This is a bipartisan Federal law. Categories have been added over \ntime in a bipartisan way by the House and the Senate. As far as I know, \nthere is bipartisan support for this provision because you never see \nbills introduced to eliminate these categories of what I will call \nprohibited persons. These are people whom many in Congress--bicamerally \nand bipartisanly--have determined should not possess weapons.\n  Now, the problem is a whole lot of those people do get weapons \nbecause folks either give or sell them to them.\n  What is the current law with respect to giving or selling a weapon to \nsomebody who is prohibited?\n  The current law basically is kind of a no-responsibility law. You are \ncriminally liable if you give or sell a weapon to somebody who is in \nthose nine prohibited categories, but you are only criminally liable if \nyou knew or should have known that they were prohibited. I practiced \nlaw for a while. That makes prosecution virtually impossible, because \nsomebody will give somebody a\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\nweapon or sell it to them and then they will say: Well, I didn't know \nhe was a felon. I didn't know he had been adjudicated mentally ill or \ndangerous.\n  There is no obligation on behalf of the seller. Now, we have put \nobligations on sellers all the time--affirmative duties and \nobligations--but in this area, we don't put an obligation on the part \nof a seller other than a registered and licensed gun dealer, who must \ngo through a background check. We don't put any kind of obligation on \nanybody to do even minimal, reasonable steps to make sure that somebody \nis lawfully able to possess a weapon.\n  So what the Responsible Transfer of Firearms Act would do is it would \nrevise the current formula. The current formula does have a liability \nfor sellers but only under an elevated standard that really is almost \nimpossible to meet. We would amend the Federal code, not to change the \nnine categories--those are the same--not to change the punishments for \nselling or transferring to them--that would stay the same--but we \nadjust the responsibility. It is a responsibility and accountability \nact.\n  So if you are putting a weapon in somebody's hands, either selling it \nor transferring it, you have to take ``reasonable steps'' to determine \nthat the recipient is not prohibited from having that weapon. \n``Reasonable steps'' is included in the statute--just those words. We \ndon't say: You can only do that by showing one of the following five \nthings. You can take any reasonable steps you think are necessary, but \nyou have to take reasonable steps.\n  That is what this change in law would do. If you cannot show \nsatisfaction to a court that you have taken reasonable steps, then you \nwill be liable for putting the weapon into somebody's hands whom the \nFederal Government has said is not able to possess such a weapon.\n  This shift from the current framework would promote accountability \nand responsibility. Why should we let a seller just casually put a \nfirearm into the hands of somebody who is prohibited by law from having \nit? Why should we do that? Why shouldn't there be some minimal \naccountability for a seller who is putting a weapon in the hands of \nsomebody who has been determined not able to possess a weapon?\n  We put burdens on sellers. This is not a precise analogy, but if you \ngo in and try to buy beer in a place, you are going to get carded. Why \nis that? Well, because we have put an affirmative burden on the sale of \nalcohol so that the seller has to make some effort to determine that \nthe recipient is not prohibited from having it. We do the same thing \nwith tobacco. There are other laws that put burdens on sellers as well, \nand this a minimal one--take reasonable steps.\n  To me the lives of some of these people who have been gunned down in \nthose horrible crimes are just worth it. Let's just take reasonable \nsteps. The reasonable steps won't solve all the cases, but it will help \nkeep weapons out of the hands of those whom we have determined, in this \nbody, shouldn't have them.\n  I close and just say this: Of course, we have to be humble enough to \nacknowledge there is no one solution to the epidemic of gun violence \nnor is there a complete solution to it. There is nothing that we can do \nthat will eliminate the possibility that we could wake up tomorrow and \nsee the same thing on TV. Human beings will do evil things. That is not \ngoing to change. That is not going to be eliminated by what we do here.\n  But what we do as legislators in legislation is basically believe--\nand if we didn't believe this, we wouldn't be in this body--that as we \nlegislate, we can improve situations. We cannot eliminate the \npossibility, but we can improve it. We can make it less likely that one \nof these prohibited individuals will get a weapon in their hands and \nuse it against others.\n  So I just conclude where I started.\n  Alison and Adam were wonderful people. This is a community that is \nstill really grieving. What compounds grief in my experience--not as a \nlegislator but as a person--what compounds and deepens grief is a sense \nof hopelessness. Wow, this horrible thing happened. We have had this \nhorrible loss, and there is nothing we can do about it. That tends to \nturn grief into despair and depression.\n  Sadly, I was Governor when the shooting at Virginia Tech took place, \nand I had to deal with 32 families and more who had been injured, and \nthe broader community was hurting so much. When you have gone through \nan experience--and we see this in our own personal life because \neverybody has had grief in their own personal lives. If you go through \nan experience where there is a lot of grief and loss and you feel that \nit is pointless or there is nothing you can do to improve it or \ntransform it into something better or improve it so that maybe somebody \nelse won't have to suffer through the same experience, that tends to \ntake grief and turn it into something even more damaging--despair and \nhopelessness. I think one of the things we are called to do as \nlegislators in situations where there is grief is to show there is some \nhope we can improve, because I believe we can improve. I have seen too \nmany instances legislatively and in the lives of people that we can \nimprove and we can get better, and as a nation we need to get better on \nthis issue. This bill won't do it all, but I think it will be a \nsensible way to get better and to show those who are suffering and \nmaybe even despairing under this epidemic of gun violence that we are \nnot just going to accept it and sink deeper into despair and grief, but \ngrab on to it and try to make improvements.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the Iran nuclear \ndeal. We are here today because several months ago Senators Corker and \nCardin, the respective chair and ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee worked out an agreement to allow us to have this \ndebate voted on here in the Senate, and there were 98 votes in support \nof allowing a vote on the Iranian nuclear agreement. In fact, it went \nto the President's desk, and the President then signed it into law. \nThat set in place a process, which is where we end up today.\n  I certainly hope our colleagues who voted for this allow us to have \nthat debate. It is an important debate. It has serious consequences for \nAmerica's national security interests, and it certainly is something \nthat shouldn't be minimized in any way. The American people need to \nhave their voices heard in this discussion, which will take place if we \nare allowed to get on that resolution here in the U.S. Senate.\n  So I would hope that our colleagues on the other side--there was some \ndiscussion I read reporting of statements made by the President or by \nmembers of his administration, statements made by some of our \ncolleagues here that perhaps they might block us from even proceeding \nto this resolution. I think that would be a big mistake. It would be a \ntragic outcome with respect to something that is this important to \nAmerica's national security. It certainly is something which the \nAmerican people deserve and have a right to have their voices heard.\n  So I am looking forward to this discussion. I hope throughout the \ncourse of the next few days we will have a chance to air this out \nbecause it is clear that one of the greatest threats to our national \nsecurity is the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran and a nuclear arms \nrace in the Middle East.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama's Iran nuclear deal, which is really a \nnuclear concessions deal, increases rather than decreases that \npossibility.\n  There are numerous reasons to be concerned about a nuclear-armed \nIran. Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. That is \nwell documented. It has been talked about a lot. Iran actively supports \nHezbollah and Hamas, both of which pose an immediate threat to our ally \nIsrael.\n  Iran incites regional instability, supporting the Houthis in Yemen \nand the Assad regime in Syria. Iran continues to commit human rights \nabuses against its own people, and Iran has a history of taking extreme \nmeasures to hide its nuclear enrichment program from the international \ncommunity.\n  In response to Iran's nuclear activities 9 years ago, in 2006, the \nU.N. and the United States began to impose sanctions on Iran's nuclear \nenrichment\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nprogram. These sanctions were dramatically increased in 2010. The \nsanctions targeted Iranian businesses and financial institutions as \nwell as members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps or IRGC, who were \nresponsible for killing hundreds of Americans and froze Iranian assets \nthat would have been used by Iran to support terrorism throughout the \nregion. This had a tremendous impact, effectively bringing Iran to its \nknees.\n  Thanks to the pressures the sanctions exerted on Iran's economy, \nIran's leadership was under immense pressure to negotiate with the \nUnited States and its allies. In 2013 Iran agreed to engage in talks \nregarding its nuclear program. However, soon after Iran agreed to come \nto the negotiating table, the Obama administration inexplicably began \nmaking concession after concession, with Iran giving up very little in \nreturn. The result--a weak deal that is highly unlikely to stop Iran \nfrom becoming a nuclear power.\n  We have already heard from many of my colleagues why this agreement \nis a bad deal. Once this deal goes into effect, right off the bat Iran \nwill have access to roughly $140 billion, which even President Obama \nand Secretary Kerry acknowledge would be partly used to finance \nterrorism. The deal will also increase access to conventional weapons, \nallowing Iran to defend its nuclear infrastructure from military \nstrike. By lifting the ban on ballistic missiles, Iran will be able to \npurchase a delivery system capable of carrying a nuclear warhead well \nbeyond the confines of the Middle East. The deal will also allow Iran \nto continue its research and development into advanced centrifuges, \npermitting Iran to modernize its enrichment infrastructure and reducing \nthe breakout period for a nuclear weapon to a few weeks instead of \nmonths.\n  The outcome of this agreement will be a more prosperous, better \narmed, more dangerous Iran, exerting its regional influence and \ncontinuing to sponsor terror. All of that will be achieved without Iran \nviolating the terms of the agreement.\n  However, if Iran does decide to cheat, this deal will make that more \npossible. To begin with, for suspicious sites not currently on the list \nof Iran's nuclear facilities, Iran gets 24 days' notice before \ninspections can take place. Even more concerning, however, is the \ninformation leaked recently that the secret International Atomic Energy \nAgency agreement with Iran will allow Iran to provide its own soil \nsamples to inspectors from enrichment sites such as the facility at \nParchin. Think about that. The regime which has broken these agreements \nin the past and cheated in the past--again, well documented--will be \nable to furnish its own soil inspections.\n  Unfortunately, instead of acknowledging this when it was raised in \ncommittee, Secretary Kerry took on the role of apologist for Iran, \ndefending the deal by saying that private agreements with the IAEA are \nthe norm. However, if the leaked information regarding soil samples is \ncorrect, this calls into question the entire credibility of the \ninspections regime. For this reason and many others, I strongly oppose \nPresident Obama's nuclear arms concession agreement with Iran, and I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.\n  By rejecting this agreement, we can negotiate a better deal--one that \nwill actually stop Iran's nuclear program and prevent Iran from getting \na nuclear bomb. It is unfortunate that when we have the majority of the \nAmerican people clearly opposing this deal that the President is not \nonly willing to veto their opposition but to call doing so a victory.\n  I would like to expand a little bit of detail on some of the national \nsecurity concerns with this nuclear agreement with Iran.\n  Since the Iran agreement was first announced in July, the Obama \nadministration has repeatedly stated that we should at least give this \ndeal a try, arguing that if Iran breaks its side of the agreement and \npursues a nuclear weapon, we will have the same military options down \nthe road that we have today. However, that is not true. We will not \nhave the same options in the future that we have today. Right now, if a \nsituation arose where Iran entered a breakout period and was pursuing a \nnuclear weapon, the United States or our allies in the region could \nconduct a targeted air strike on Iran's enrichment facilities.\n  For example, if we knew that Iran was using its nuclear enrichment \nfacility at Fordow to enrich weapons-grade uranium, we could utilize \nour air superiority with bunker-buster bombs. Obviously, we would \nprefer to avoid a military strike, but if needed, we have that option, \nand Iran knows this.\n  However, under this agreement, in 10 years' time, Iran will have \nfaster, far more efficient centrifuges that can operate in \nsignificantly smaller facilities that can be placed deeper underground \nwith increased levels of fortification, making a military strike much \nmore complex.\n  Right now Iran is using IR-1 centrifuges, which are basically 1960s \ntechnology; but under this agreement, starting around year 8, Iran can \nbegin testing IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges. In fact, as stated in page 10 \nof Annex 1, after the agreement has been in place for 8\\1/2\\ years, \nIran can construct up to 30 IR-6 centrifuges and 30 IR-8 centrifuges. \nWhy is this so significant? IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges are far more \nadvanced and estimated to be up to 15 times more efficient than the IR-\n1 centrifuges that they are using today. By increasing the efficiency \nof the enrichment process, Iran can significantly reduce the breakout \nperiod that is necessary to create a bomb.\n  On page 17 of Annex 1 of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, \nunder the section titled ``Centrifuge Manufacturing,'' the agreement \nstates that at the end of year 8:\n\n       Iran will commence manufacturing of IR-6 and IR-8 \n     centrifuges without rotors through year 10 at a rate of up to \n     200 centrifuges per year for each type.\n\n  The administration has repeatedly asserted that even if we destroyed \nIran's enrichment facilities with an air strike, we can't turn back \ntime and erase Iran's nuclear enrichment know-how.\n  While that may be true, we absolutely can and should prevent Iran \nfrom increasing its nuclear expertise, but this deal doesn't do that. \nInstead, it ensures Iran's knowledge will increase by solidifying its \nability to develop more advanced centrifuges. Because these IR-6 and \nIR-8 centrifuges are so much more efficient in speeding up the uranium \nenrichment process, they will make it far easier for Iran to conceal \nand protect its nuclear program.\n  Referring once again to the facility at Fordow, when Fordow was first \nconstructed, it was built to contain 3,000 IR-1 centrifuges, which \nmeant that the facility had to be significant in size. IR-8 \ncentrifuges, however, are estimated to be 15 times more efficient than \nthe IR-1 centrifuges used at Fordow, which means that by using IR-8 \ncentrifuges, Iran could replicate the enrichment capability of a \nfacility like Fordow with a building containing not 3,000 centrifuges, \nbut only 200 centrifuges. Such a facility can be the size of a house. \nBy reducing the size of the facilities by this magnitude, Iran could \nbuild many Fordows in multiple locations, hiding them more easily and \nputting them deeper underground. Such facilities could be built within \nexisting mines, making them extremely difficult to find.\n  As mentioned before, this agreement guarantees Iran will have the \nmanufacturing capacity it needs to build these advanced centrifuges. \nEven within the parameters of this agreement, Iran could manufacture \n200 IR-6 centrifuges and 200 IR-8 centrifuges per year starting around \nyear 8. Since Iran would already have the manufacturing capacity for \nbuilding IR-8 centrifuges, it would merely need to ramp up the \nproduction beyond the terms of the agreement and in a short period of \ntime it could have operating enrichment facilities in multiple \nlocations throughout the country. By the time these violations had been \ndiscovered and conformed, the advanced centrifuges would likely be in \nplace, and Iran would have likely enough enriched uranium for a bomb.\n  But there is much more to it than that. Currently, according to \npublicly available sources, Iran's air defense capabilities consist of \ndomestically produced, short-range surface-to-air missiles and Russian \nmade, longer range SA-2 and SA-5 surface-to-air missiles, as well as a \nfew Chinese CSA-1s. These systems are vulnerable to electronic \ncountermeasures and pose very little\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\nthreat to American or even Israeli aircraft.\n  However, that is not where Iran's air defenses will be in 10 \nyears. Under this agreement, the ban on conventional weapons sales to \nIran will be lifted after 5 years. Russia has already agreed to sell \nIran four batteries of S-300 vehicle-launched surface-to-air missiles. \nDepending upon the sophistication of these S-300 missile systems, they \nmay be able to engage aircraft up to 200 miles away.\n\n  As we saw last month with Iran unveiling its new solid-fuel missiles, \nIran's domestic military infrastructure will not remain static. Over \nthe next decade, as Iran acquires more and more increasingly advanced \nweapons systems, its area denial capability will make airstrikes even \nmore difficult. Will a future American President, therefore, have the \nsame military options that we have today, as President Obama and \nSecretary Kerry claim? The answer is no.\n  We will still have military options available to us, but the calculus \nfor carrying out a targeted airstrike will be much different down the \nroad. Therefore, it is not realistic for President Obama to claim that \nfuture Presidents will have the same military options against Iran we \nhave today. And the more the realistic possibility of a military strike \ndecreases, the more likely Iran will be to violate the terms of the \nagreement and go after a bomb.\n  In 10 years' time, under this agreement, our best hope for Iran not \nattaining a nuclear weapon will be the Iranian Government voluntarily \ndeciding it doesn't want one. That is not something I am willing to \nbank on.\n  Madam President, I also want to speak for a moment about Iran's \nsupport for terrorism and the idea put forward by President Obama that \nIran will spend most of the soon-to-be-acquired economic wealth on its \nown economy. Even if we assume Iran's military spending remains what it \nis today as a percentage of Iran's budget, what would that mean going \nforward?\n  Well, there are many estimates on how much Iran spends on its \nmilitary. Some experts put the figure at around $10 billion per year, \nwhile others estimate the figure to be closer to $15 billion or even \nhigher. In addition, of the amount spent on Iran's military, about 65 \npercent is spent on Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps--the IRGC.\n  In the first year of this agreement, between unfrozen assets and \nincreased revenue from oil sales, Iran is expected to see an initial \ninflux of around $140 billion. Now, using conservative numbers, if \nIran's military spending stayed the same in this coming year as a \npercentage of GDP, it would increase to almost $15 billion, with $9.5 \nbillion going to the IRGC.\n  One of the main national security concerns we have regarding the IRGC \nis that Iran uses it to support terrorist organizations. Iran is the \nmain supporter of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, both of which \nhave provoked conflicts with Israel in recent years.\n  In addition, Iran's support of instability in the region is well \nknown, with the Iranian Government providing funding to the Houthis in \nYemen and military assistance to Assad in Syria. Many of our own \ncasualties in Iraq were the result of Iranian-made bombs provided to \ninsurgents by the Iranian Quds Force.\n  Last summer, the missiles being launched at Israel out of Gaza were \nprimarily imported from Iran. It is no wonder Israel has been so \nopposed to this deal.\n  Even the Iron Dome system, which proved so successful during the last \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, can be overwhelmed if enough missiles are \nfired at once. And now Iran, a country bent on Israel's destruction, is \ngoing to see a huge increase in military spending.\n  Even the Quds Force commander, Qassem Suleimani, the man responsible \nfor supplying Iraqi insurgents with bombs that killed U.S. soldiers, \nwill see United Nations and European Union sanctions lifted as a result \nof this deal.\n  President Obama keeps arguing that the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran \nfar outweighs the short-term impact of Iran's increased support for \nterrorism. As we have discussed, I don't think this agreement prevents \nIran from getting a nuclear bomb. But even if my colleagues disagree \nwith me on that point, are we really willing to trade the lives of our \nallies in the short term to try to achieve this goal? That is not a \nrisk I am willing to take.\n  In urging my colleagues to vote against this deal, I would also like \nto speak for just a moment about what would happen if Congress is able \nto stop this deal?\n  The President keeps saying a ``no'' vote on this deal will lead to \nwar. Well, that is unrealistic and a clear attempt by the President to \ngarner support for the agreement by stoking people's fears.\n  Iran is very aware of its own military limitations, and it knows what \nthe outcome of such a war would be. For Iran, in the short term, a much \nmore realistic response would be for it to try to keep its side of the \nagreement in an attempt to gain United Nations and EU sanctions relief. \nHowever, despite this attempt, the United States could double down on \nthe U.N. sanctions that were in place prior to the December framework \nand threaten to use secondary sanctions against foreign businesses who \nwish to do business with Iran.\n  Given the size of the U.S. economy compared to Iran, this is a \npowerful deterrent. Since Iran's economy is already hurting, \nmaintaining sanctions would provide more leverage for the P5+1 to get a \nbetter deal.\n  However, another plausible outcome following congressional rejection \nof the deal would be for Iran to try to capitalize on congressional \ndisapproval by seeking to divide Russia and China from the West to \nundermine the multilateral sanctions regime. Iran could try to achieve \nthis by implementing certain commitments from the agreement but not \nothers.\n  But even if China and Russia wish to do business with Iran, they both \nstill have an incentive to try to achieve the original goal of the \nnegotiations. It is not in China's interest for a nuclear-armed Iran to \ncause greater instability with global energy prices, and Russia doesn't \nwant an Islamist regime in its backyard, which is prone to regional \nconflicts, acquiring nuclear weapons capabilities.\n  These scenarios I am describing have already been echoed by a chorus \nof experts who have pointed out the flaws in this agreement and offered \nalternatives. The vote this week is not--is not--a choice between \nsupporting a bad deal or going to war. The vote this week is an \nopportunity to reject a bad deal in order to achieve a better outcome.\n  That is what we ought to be doing, and I hope we get the chance to \nget on this resolution and that we have the chance to get a full debate \nhere in the Senate where the people's voices can be heard. I hope when \nit is all said and done, Members here in the Senate will come to the \nsame conclusion I and many of my colleagues have, which is that this is \na bad deal for our country, it is a bad deal for our allies in the \nregion, and there is a much better outcome that can be achieved if the \nSenate will reject this bad deal and get us back to negotiations where \nwe can achieve a better outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today we are going to vote on the \nnomination of Roseann Ketchmark. She has been nominated to be a Federal \ndistrict judge in the Western District of Missouri. Now, this is only \nthe sixth judicial nominee that we have voted on since the Senate \nRepublicans took over the majority 8 months ago, so less than 1 a \nmonth. In fact, if we continue at this rate the Republican majority has \nestablished, the Senate this year will confirm the fewest number of \njudges in more than a half century--resulting in a judicial vacancy \ncrisis. I am concerned because the Senate Republican leadership has \nrefused to schedule timely confirmation votes for consensus judicial \nnominees which, I think, demonstrates an astounding neglect of the \nneeds of our independent third branch, which borders on contempt.\n  I am proud to be a lawyer. I have practiced both in the criminal and \ncivil bars and served as a prosecutor. I have appeared before many \ndifferent courts. I look at the men and women who have been on our \ncourts, and I say: Here is an example of the way the judicial system \nshould be--something every country in the world wants to emulate. But \nnow, we are treating that third branch almost with contempt--with \npartisan contempt--and that is going to hurt the whole of the Federal \njudiciary.\n  When Senate Democrats were in the majority, we worked hard to reduce \nthe number of judicial vacancies to just 43--the lowest level since \nthis President took office. This was accomplished through the \nunyielding efforts of then-Majority Leader Reid and Senate Democrats, \nwho prioritized filling judicial vacancies so that our independent \njudiciary would be sufficiently staffed. Our success in reducing the \nnumber of judicial vacancies to such a level in 2014 was remarkable, \ngiven that we had begun the year with over 90 vacancies and the fact \nthat Senate Republicans filibustered every single judicial nominee.\n  Throughout President Obama's tenure, we have seen Senate Republicans \nconsistently prioritize partisan politics over the Senate's \nconstitutional duty of advice and consent. Their relentless obstruction \nover the last 6 years has resulted in an unacceptable number of \nvacancies--often hovering close to or exceeding 90. By the end of last \nyear, the Senate made progress in reducing judicial vacancies to 43, \nbut now we are seeing those gains reversed due to the Republicans' \nrefusal to even schedule confirmation votes this year. In the 8 months \nsince Republicans have been in the majority, judicial vacancies have \nincreased by more than 50 percent. If Republicans keep on this \ndangerous course, we are heading to a judicial vacancy crisis. This is \nmade worse by the fact that the number of Federal court vacancies \ndeemed to be ``judicial emergencies'' by the non-partisan \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts has increased by 158 percent \nsince the beginning of the year. There are now 31 judicial emergency \nvacancies that are affecting communities across the country.\n  I am going to show a couple of things. Republicans campaigned last \nyear on the promise they would govern responsibly if they won the \nmajority, but instead they have created divisive issues that play \nopenly to their political base. One needs to look no further than the \nrecent show vote to defund critical health services for women.\n  I was in Vermont all last month. Everywhere I went--especially rural \nVermont, where it is so difficult and so essential to get health care \nto women--they are asking: Why do the Republicans want to cut off the \nhealth care for women in rural parts of our country? Rather than \nspending 2 days in an unnecessary political exercise, the Senate should \nhave voted to confirm the many judicial nominees pending on the \ncalendar. In fact, rather than pushing bills to strip funding from \nlocal law enforcement for obeying the rules on immigration enforcement, \nwe should be confirming judges to ensure our entire criminal justice \nsystem works for everyone.\n  Let's give one example. The last 2 years of President Bush's tenure \nin office, the Democrats controlled the Senate. By this time, we had \nconfirmed 26 of his judges. Now, with exactly the same situation, with \nRepublicans controlling, they have only allowed five judges. What we \ndid as Democrats for President Bush, we put through five times as many \njudges as Republicans have for President Obama. What you are seeing \nactually is we are going to politicize the Federal courts.\n  Supporting and strengthening our Federal judiciary is not a \nDemocratic or Republican priority; it is a fundamental and \nconstitutional duty of the Senate that we all must share. In fact, the \nSenate Republican leadership's decision to shirk this body's \nconstitutional duty of advice is doing the most harm to States with at \nleast one Republican Senator. Of the 67 current vacancies that exist, \n48 of them--or more than 70 percent--are in States with at least one \nRepublican Senator. Texas, for example, has nine judicial vacancies. \nSeven of those nine are considered judicial emergencies. Incredibly, \none of those district court positions has been vacant for over 4 years. \nA Fifth Circuit position in Texas has been vacant for more than 3 \nyears. Pennsylvania and Alabama face similar crises. They have six and \nfive current vacancies, respectively. Federal courts in several other \nStates are grappling with extended vacancies. They desperately need to \nbe filled.\n  The length of time that some of these vacancies have remained \nunfilled is staggering. In Texas, none of these vacancies currently \nhave nominees because the Texas Senators have been slow in providing \nrecommendations to the President. A similar pattern can be seen with \nthe Alabama vacancies, where two of the positions have been vacant for \nover 2 years, and another has remained vacant for over 1\\1/2\\ years.\n  In Pennsylvania, there are six current vacancies and five nominees \npending. Senate Republicans should be trying to move these nominees as \nexpeditiously as possible. Of great concern is the treatment of Judge \nLuis Felipe Restrepo, who will fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Judge Restrepo was unanimously \nconfirmed 2 years ago by the Senate to serve as a district court judge \nin Pennyslvania. I have heard no objection to his nomination, yet it \ntook 7 months just to get him a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Judge Restrepo has strong bipartisan support from both Pennsylvania \nSenators, and he was voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously \nby voice vote. Once confirmed, Judge Restrepo will become the first \nHispanic judge from Pennsylvania to serve on this court and only the \nsecond Hispanic judge ever to serve on the Third Circuit. No Senate \nDemocrat opposes a vote on his nomination. Senate Republicans are the \nonly thing holding up his nomination. I hope the Republican Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania will implore his leadership to bring this highly \nqualified nominee up for a vote. The continued delay of Judge Restrepo \nis a poor reflection on this body.\n  In the Western District of New York, located in Buffalo, there is not \na single active Federal district judge, even though it has one of the \nbusiest caseloads in the country. And there are more criminal cases \nthan in Washington, DC, Boston, Cleveland, and they don't have a single \nactive judge because Republicans will not allow a vote, up or down, \neven though they have the majority. If you don't like the judge, you \nvote them down. They will not even allow a vote. I should note that the \nhighly qualified nominee to serve in Buffalo was voted unanimously out \nof the Judiciary Committee. They will not allow them to have a vote on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Look at this, how we brought vacancies down when we controlled the \nSenate, and now look at how they shoot up when the Republicans control \nthe Senate. It makes no sense at all. In fact, as\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nI said earlier, the Republican-controlled Senate allowed confirmation \nvotes on just five judges--one, two, three, four, five. They have taken \nvacations, recesses, long weekends, and leave early--but we don't have \ntime to vote on judges, which are normally unanimous votes anyway.\n  We are going to vote on the sixth today. Whoop-de-i-ay. Good for us. \nMy goodness gracious. It hasn't been this way before. As I said, when I \nwas chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in the last 2 years of \nPresident Bush's term, I had put through 26 judges by now. The \nRepublicans have only allowed five judges. This kind of partisanship is \nreally wrong. In fact, it is on pace to be the lowest in recent \nhistory.\n  President Eisenhower had 47 judges confirmed in his last 2 years in \noffice; President Reagan had 85 judges confirmed his last 2 years in \noffice; President Clinton had 73 judges confirmed his last 2 years in \noffice; and President George W. Bush had 68 judges confirmed his last 2 \nyears in office. This is a clear double standard that is being applied \nto President Obama's nominees.\n  Republicans can provide some real leadership if the majority leader \nwould go ahead and allow for a vote on all 14 of the judicial nominees \npending on the Executive Calendar. All of these nominees have \nbipartisan support and were voted out of the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote. Five of them would fill judicial emergency vacancies, \nincluding Judge Restrepo of Pennsylvania. Others would fill judicial \nemergencies in California, New York, and Tennessee. And the five \nnominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims have now been pending \nbefore the full Senate for a year or more.\n  Today we are voting on the nomination of Roseann Ketchmark to fill a \njudicial vacancy in the Federal district court in the Western District \nof Missouri. She has spent her entire 25-year legal career as a \nprosecutor on both the State and Federal levels. Since 2001, Ms. \nKetchmark has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney with the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri. During her time \nin the U.S. Attorney's Office, Ms. Ketchmark has served in supervisory \nand management capacities as both the First Assistant U.S. Attorney and \nas the Executive Assistant Attorney. She began her legal career as an \nAssistant Prosecutor in Kansas City, MO, at the Jackson County \nProsecutor's Office, and subsequently joined the Platte County \nProsecutor's Office in Platte City, MO, as a First Assistant \nProsecutor. Ms. Ketchmark has the bipartisan support of her two home \nState Senators, Senator McCaskill and Senator Blunt. She was voted out \nof the Judiciary Committee by voice vote more than 4 months ago. She \nhas a strong background as a criminal prosecutor and I will support her \nnomination.\n  The majority leader has spoken recently about his desire to avoid \nanother Republican-led government shutdown. I agree, the American \npeople deserve something better than obstructionist shutdowns. While \nthe focus has been on the threat of Republicans shutting down the \ngovernment over women's health services, the Senate Republicans have \nvirtually shut down the judicial confirmation process. It is harming \nour justice system in the short and long term.\n  I have spoken to a number of Republican Senators who realize this is \nwrong. These are the same Senators who came to me at the time of \nPresident Bush and asked: Can you move these judges, even though you \nare in charge? And I said, of course, we will. Some have come \nsheepishly and said: We are sorry we didn't return the favor. What I \nsay is reverse course; I urge Senate Republicans to reverse course and \nrealize the short-term partisan decisions are undermining the ability \nof the judicial system to serve our communities.\n  Tonight's vote to confirm a district court nominee from Missouri is \nlong overdue. I urge the Senate Republican leadership to schedule votes \nfor the remaining 13 consensus judicial nominees on the Executive \nCalendar. They could all be done tomorrow morning in half an hour's \ntime.\n  I have been in the Senate longer than any Member of this body. I have \nbeen here in the majority and the minority, numerous times in both. I \nhave been here with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, \nwith the Republican leaders----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see nobody else seeking recognition. I ask unanimous \nconsent for another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have been here with both Republican and Democratic \nleadership of this body, Republican and Democratic Presidents. I have \nnever, in 41 years, seen the Federal judiciary treated in such a \ncavalier, mean-spirited and, I would say, irresponsible fashion. I know \nmost Senators want to do the right thing. Let's start doing it. This \nThird Branch of government should be treated with respect. If you have \na person who is not competent who is nominated, then vote them down, \nbut if they are competent, let's have a vote on it. Let's not have \nthis.\n  You are not going to find good men and women to agree to serve on the \nFederal bench if they think they are going to be delayed for partisan \nreasons for a year or more at a time. We can do better. We are all \nproud of our Federal judiciary. It is the best in the world, but this \nkind of partisanship could turn it into one of the worst in the world. \nThis Senator does not want to see that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Roseann A. Ketchmark, of Missouri, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri?\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

President Lincoln said:\n\n       It has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have \n     labored, and others have, without labor, enjoyed a large \n     proportion of the fruits. This is wrong, and it should not \n     continue.\n\n  Early in President Obama's term, I printed out that quote and handed \nit to him because it underscores to me the value of labor and the \nwealth that labor creates for our country, our society, and for those \nworkers and their families. I gave the President that quote because it \nis my hope that all of us as elected officials remember how important \nit is that we stand up for workers, organized and unorganized, labor \nunion and nonlabor union members.\n  It is important to stand up for the workers who have built this \ncountry. They laid down the railroad tracks that move people and \nproducts across the country. They work on shop floors. They innovate as \nthey labor. They toil in mines. They dug the coal that would power our \ntrains and our factories. These workers built our strong middle class \nand they continue to be the backbone of our economy.\n  Over the past month, as many of us did in our States, I visited \nfactory floors across Ohio. At each stop, I witnessed the ingenuity and \ndedication of workers. Last Thursday I visited All American Clothing in \nArcanum, OH. It is a family business and a classic American success \nstory. In 2002, Lawson Nickol worked for a blue jeans manufacturing \ncompany. He watched as his company outsourced more and more of its \noperations, more and more of its production to other countries. Lawson \nNickol was appalled as he saw coworkers and friends losing their jobs \nall the way down the supply chain of this company. He knew he had to do \nsomething.\n  He left his job and he founded All American Clothing Company in Darke \nCounty, a rural county west and north of Dayton, OH. He started making \njeans in Arcanum, OH.\n  The first few years were difficult. The company survived on family \nsavings, taking financial risks, working long hours, and having a \nlittle bit of luck. But 13 years later, All American is proof that you \nshould never bet against American workers. The jeans aren't only made \nin Ohio; they are made in other places all over this country. The \ncompany is growing. The company expanded in 2012 with the help of a \n$150,000 low-interest CDBG development loan. Its products are 100 \npercent American made and support Ohio jobs.\n  Lawson's business is a family affair. His son, B.J. Nickol, is a co-\nowner and company president. B.J. told me that ``it is not about greed \nfor us. It is about giving people jobs and making a decent living.''\n  Travel across Ohio and across the country, and you will find more \ncompanies like All American thriving on the talent, tenacity, and hard \nwork, blood, sweat, toil, and tears of American workers.\n  I visited an Airstream plant in Shelby County and a Continental \nContiTech plant in St. Mary's. I toured the Honda Logistics North \nAmerica plant in East Liberty and the GE Testing Facility in Peebles. I \nattended the grand opening of the Hart Schaffner Marx suit facility in \nBrooklyn, OH, a suburb of Cleveland.\n  I wear this suit today, made in Cleveland, OH, by union workers in a \nHugo Boss plant. Since then that plant has been sold to Hart Schaffner \nMarx, which is opening its production right now. When I visited that \nplant in my Hugo Boss suit and talked about the fact that this suit had \nbeen made at this plant with 150 unionized workers, a worker walked up \nto me and said, ``Senator,'' and she touched me on the chest and said, \n``I made that pocket.'' All of these operations are flourishing because \nof Ohio workers.\n  While our workers support our economy, we are not doing enough to \nsupport them. Too often workers have no paid sick leave, no paid family \nleave, and no overtime pay.\n  President Obama is taking important steps to help working families. \nNew overtime rules would expand overtime pay so that 40 percent of \nsalaried workers would be eligible. Think of it this way. A worker--an \nemployee who is the shift manager on the second shift at a fast-food \nrestaurant who is classified as management may be making only $30 or \n$35,000 a year. They work that worker more than 40 hours a week. Yet \nthat worker gets no overtime because that worker is classified as \nsupervisory. That is wrong. Under the President's plan, the rule he \npassed down, 160,000 more Ohioans will earn overtime pay for the work \nthey are already doing at their place of business.\n  This week the administration announced that Federal contractors will \nbe required to provide up to 7 days of paid sick leave each year. It \nwill mean 300,000 Americans working on Federal contracts will be able \nto stay home if they get sick or take a day off to care for a sick \nchild. It means they are less likely to show up to work when they might \ninfect somebody else with the illness they have, so everybody is more \nproductive. These are important steps, but there are limits to \nExecutive action.\n\n  Too many workers are left without paid sick leave, without maternity \nleave, without overtime pay, without predictable work schedules. Too \nmany women still earn less than men for the same work. The President, \nthrough Executive action, can solve some of this, as he should, as he \nis given power by Congress to do, but we need legislative action.\n  Previous generations of workers fought for the protections we take \nfor granted: child labor laws, workplace safety protections, \nunemployment insurance. They fought in union halls, they organized in \nunion halls and church basements. They demanded a government that \nrespects the dignity of work, that passes laws recognizing the decency \nand dedication of workers.\n  After decades of attacks on our unions, laws are often the only \nprotections workers have. Fifty years ago, one in three workers was a \nmember of a union--one-third of workers were members of unions. Now \nthat number is 1 in 10. That is why action from this body is needed \nmore than ever. Workers, when they are organized, when they have a \nunion, are protected so they are paid the overtime they earn. They are \nprotected often with provided sick leave and maternity leave. They are \nprotected because of their union from injury in the workplace.\n  Because not as many people belong to unions today--that is why we \nneed to pass the Healthy Families Act, we need to pass the Paycheck \nFairness Act, we need to pass the Schedules That Work Act, and we need \nto pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This is action we can take \ntoday in celebration of Labor Day that would make a tremendous \ndifference in the lives of American workers who built this economy.\n  This past weekend, we celebrated Labor Day with picnics and barbecues \nand time spent with families, we issued statements honoring American \nworkers. Let's not just honor them with words, let's honor them with \ndeeds. Let's move forward in a way that puts labor, that puts the \nAmerican worker front and center.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6458-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6458-S6459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS'S \n           ACQUISITION OF THOMAS JEFFERSON'S PERSONAL LIBRARY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this year is the 200th anniversary of one \nof the wisest decisions Congress ever made. In 1815, Congress acquired \nthe entirety of Thomas Jefferson's personal library to\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nreplace Congress's library, which was burnt by the British Army the \nprevious year.\n  I would like to take a few moments to recognize this anniversary and \nto focus on the good work one small Library of Congress program does \ntoday.\n  Though the Library of Congress was established in 1800, for the first \n15 years of its existence it was mainly a law library. It was not until \nthe acquisition of Jefferson's personal library that the Library became \nthe broad repository of knowledge that it is today. Some Members of \nCongress opposed the idea of buying Jefferson's entire library, which \nincluded books in many languages, and on a variety of topics, including \nscience, math, philosophy, and religion. However, Thomas Jefferson \nfamously replied, ``I do not know that it contains any branch of \nscience which Congress would wish to exclude from their collection; \nthere is, in fact, no subject to which a Member of Congress may not \nhave occasion to refer.'' Fortunately, this view won the day, and today \nthe Library contains an unparalleled number of items from every branch \nof knowledge, making it the largest library in the world.\n  Forever growing, the Library of Congress receives 20,000 new items \nevery day. However, only about half are kept for the Library's \npermanent collection. It is the program designed to bridge that divide \nwhich has grown to touch so many Oregonians, as well as regular folks \naround the country.\n  The Library of Congress's Surplus Books Program takes the books not \nneeded for the Library's collections and provides them to schools, \nlibraries, and nonprofit institutions around the country. Each week, \nstaff from my office are able to select books, box them up, and send \nthem to Oregon.\n  One recipient in Oregon has been the new library in Halsey, OR. \nHalsey is a small town, but the community has come together to build a \nfantastic new library. I have been able to send them several hundred \nnew books to help them grow and diversify their collection. I expect to \nbe able to send them hundreds more, thanks to the Library of Congress's \nSurplus Books Program.\n  I would be remiss if I failed to recognize Joseph Maher, acquisitions \nspecialist and librarian for the Surplus Books Program. Mr. Maher \nalmost singlehandedly runs the program and often goes above and beyond \nto identify books for particular organizations. Mr. Maher works to find \na good home for each of the books, while simultaneously balancing the \nneeds of the many congressional offices, schools, universities, and \nFederal agencies that select books from the program. He works \ntirelessly knowing that the books they send around the country are \ngoing to make a positive impact on many lives.\n  Reading sparks creativity, learning, passion, and imagination, and \nthe Library of Congress continues to help ignite it. I could not be \nmore pleased to see communities in Oregon benefitting from this \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6459-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING KATIE ROTH\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \ncongratulate a constituent and a great friend of mine, Katie Roth of \nWest Des Moines. This summer Katie was named the 2015 Woman Business \nOwner of the Year, presented by the Business Record.\n  In the spring of 2005, Katie, who is never shy to take on a \nchallenge, opened her own staffing agency and has built it from the \nground up. Ten years later, Portico Staffing has thrived under her \nexceptional leadership, business savvy, and highly regarded reputation \nas a people person. Katie knows how to build relationships and find \nopportunities needed to grow a business. Along the way, she has helped \ncountless Iowa employers and job-seekers find one another. You might \nsay she is a perfect matchmaker. For the last decade, Katie has worked \nhard to carve out a slice of the American dream by owning and growing \nher own business. She knows it comes with sacrifice and risk. And she \nhas worked hard to make her dream come true. Katie is a great mentor \nand role model for the next generation. She shows that perseverance and \npersistence pay off. Always on the job, whether networking in the \ncommunity or listening to her clients, Katie makes good connections \nhappen. And that is a good thing for job seekers and employers looking \nto hire and grow their business.\n  Katie was nominated by her peers for consideration of this \nprestigious award. It is no surprise to me that my fellow Iowans would \nsing her praises. Without hesitation, I endorse Katie's selection as \nthe 2015 Business Owner of the Year. I have had the pleasure of knowing \nKatie Roth since 1980 when she joined my first campaign for the U.S. \nSenate. Always a tireless worker, I have enjoyed watching Katie thrive \nand succeed throughout the years. A loving wife and mother, Katie is \nfiercely loyal and Barbara and I hold her in our highest regard.\n  Barbara and I extend our congratulations to Katie Roth for this well-\ndeserved honor. We wish her the very best as she blazes the trail for \nmany years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6459-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6459-S6460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           RECOGNIZING THE GREATER KANSAS CITY CRIME STOPPERS\n\n Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, as co-chair of the Senate Law \nEnforcement Caucus, I call to the attention of my colleagues an \neffective public-private partnership that was pioneered by the Greater \nKansas City Crime Stoppers.\n  This partnership, which empowers citizens to assist law enforcement \non behalf of public safety, has been a model for the Nation, and \nbeyond.\n  Crime Stoppers is separate from the police emergency phone system or \nother standard methods of contacting police, as it allows a member of \nthe community to provide anonymous information about criminal activity. \nIn 1982, the Kansas City Crime Commission launched a hotline for \nanonymous tips--Crime Stoppers. That first year, 30 tips came in, \nclearing 8 cases.\n  Greater Kansas City Crime Stoppers emerged as a top program, earning \nglobal recognition. In 1999, Sergeant Craig Sarver of the Kansas City \nPolice Department was named International--Crime Stoppers--Coordinator \nof the Year.\n  An innovator, Sergeant Sarver nurtured an idea that has evolved into \na common tool for law enforcement.\n  In the summer of 2002, 19-year-old Ali Kemp was murdered in the pump \nhouse at a community swimming pool near Kansas City. Her father, Roger \nKemp, suggested to police and the local office of Lamar Advertising \nCompany that billboards could help find the killer.\n  Eventually, a tip generated by donated billboards helped resolve this \ncase. A suspect was arrested in Connecticut, tried, and convicted.\n  Since then, ``wanted'' billboards have led to arrests in more than 20 \nmurder cases in the Kansas City area. Sarver, who retired in 2008 after \n33 years on the force, cites two reasons why billboards help generate \nsolid tips for police.\n  First, he says, is the frequency of the message. Tipsters have said \nthey had seen ``wanted'' billboards multiple times before they shared \ntips. Second is the emphasis on anonymity, important to those who fear \nretribution, according to Sergeant Sarver.\n  Now this tactic--to feature a tip line number on billboards along \nwith a suspect's photo--is a common tool for law enforcement. In 2007 \nin Philadelphia, the FBI starting using donated electronic ``digital'' \nbillboards to help find fugitives. The FBI calls these high-tech signs \n``force multipliers.'' Tips generated by digital billboards have \nresolved 53 FBI cases.\n  State and local police also rely on billboards to communicate with \nthe public. After two inmates escaped prison in upstate New York in \nearly June, New York State Police activated 50 digital billboards in \nfour states.\n  Near St. Louis, a motorist opened fire on an Illinois State trooper \nduring a traffic stop on June 23. The trooper was not injured, but the \nshooter fled. In southern Illinois, the District 11 State Police office \nis located near Mid America Outdoor Advertising in Collinsville, IL. \nShortly after police asked Mid America for help, the suspect's photo \nappeared on a digital billboard along a high-traffic interstate en \nroute to St. Louis. The suspect was arrested by the end of the week.\n  In Elyria, OH, the sheriff says 12 fugitives have been arrested \nthanks to tips prompted by digital billboards. Lorain County Sheriff \nPhil R. Stammitti describes these long-sought individuals as ``very \nhard to locate.''\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  Neil Mahan, the retired police chief from Janesville, WI, says \nbillboards help police apprehend suspected criminals and deliver other \ninformation to the public. ``For example,'' he wrote in The Police \nChief magazine, ``an elderly female suffering from Alzheimer's disease \nwandered away from family at a local shopping mall and was found by a \ncitizen using the digital billboard information. When spring floods \nalong the Rock River posed significant danger to the public, billboards \nwere used to post warnings about the danger.''\n  In conclusion, we know that public safety is enhanced when citizens \nare empowered to help law enforcement. I commend the Kansas City Crime \nCommission and Greater Kansas City Crime Stoppers for their \ncontributions in advancing a new communications tool that aides the \ncause of safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6460-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING THE JOHN R. ELLIOTT HERO CAMPAIGN FOR DESIGNATED DRIVERS\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize \nthe John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers on the \noccasion of their 15th anniversary.\n  The John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers was created \nin 2000 following the tragic death of Navy ENS John R. Elliott in a \ndrunk-driving related crash.\n  The campaign's mission is to prevent drunk driving-related crashes \nand deaths through the use of designated drivers. That mission has been \na significant success across New Jersey, with many drivers citing the \nJohn R. Elliott HERO Campaign as a reason why they choose to serve as \ndesignated drivers.\n  Over the last 15 years, the organization has grown from a small group \nfrom Southern New Jersey, to an organization nationally recognized by \nthe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National \nCommission Against Drunk Driving for its efforts.\n  The effects of the John R. Elliott HERO Campaign have gone beyond the \nSouthern New Jersey region. Seven States across our Nation have adopted \nthe HERO Campaign as their designated driver model in an effort to \ndecrease drunk driving fatalities. The HERO Campaign has also partnered \nwith the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Phillies, and other \nprofessional sports franchises in their mission to promote the use of \ndesignated drivers. These partnerships do not include the thousands of \nindividuals across our Nation who have also registered as designated \ndrivers at concerts and sporting events as a pledge to the HERO \ncampaign.\n  The John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for Designated Drivers was \ninstrumental in the passage of John's Law, enacted in 2005, which gave \nStates $145 million in highway grant incentives for establishing car \nimpoundment laws for drivers suspected of drunk driving.\n  The tragic circumstances surrounding Navy ENS John R. Elliott's crash \nhave turned into a long history of meaningful accomplishments across \nnot only New Jersey, but across our Nation. It is my hope that the \nlegacy of John R. Elliott will live on and expand across our country.\n  I applaud the efforts of the John R. Elliott HERO Campaign for \nDesignated Drivers and thank them for their efforts in making our roads \nsafer across our country by promoting the use of designated \ndrivers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6460-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF L. MASON CAPITANI\n\n Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 50th \nAnniversary of L. Mason Capitani CORFAC International. It is a pleasure \nto commemorate this wonderful milestone in the history of a family-\nowned Michigan business.\n  Founded by L. Mason Capitani in 1965, L. Mason Capitani was a one-man \noperation until his son, Mason E. Capitani, joined the company. Mason \ndisplayed an affinity for industry, which helped the company blossom \ninto the full-service brokerage and property management firm it is \ntoday. Mason E. still serves as the company's chairman, but a third \ngeneration of the Capitani family--Jason Capitani and Mason L. \nCapitani--are now managing most of the day-to-day operations of L. \nMason Capitani.\n  Mason E. Capitani credits tenacity and careful planning as two of the \nkeys to L. Mason Capitani's success over the past five decades. From \nits modest beginning, the company has grown into a global organization, \nwith a reach that extends far beyond the State of Michigan. The company \nhas followed a careful path of natural growth, where an honest \nunderstanding of its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the dynamics \nof a global market, have allowed L. Mason Capitani to thrive in a \nvolatile industry.\n  The success of L. Mason Capitani is rooted in more than diligent \nplanning. It is a reflection of the company's dedication to customer \nservice, as well as its commitment to supporting a knowledgeable and \ntalented workforce. The brokers, agents, and support staff at L. Mason \nCapitani are encouraged to provide high-quality customer service \nwithout jeopardizing their ethics, integrity, or dignity. An emphasis \non integrity has allowed L. Mason Capitani to build relationships based \non trust and experience. As a family business, its employees understand \nthe company's success and the family's reputation are inseparable.\n  I applaud the employees of L. Mason Capitani for demonstrating the \nhard work and dedication to service required for 50 years of success. \nFamily businesses like L. Mason Capitani are the main drivers of the \neconomy in Michigan and across the United States. L.

Mr. President, Rhode Island recently lost a \ngood man and dedicated public servant. Joseph Scanlon, from Tiverton, \npassed away on August 24 with his family at his side. For all of us who \nknew him, this was very sad news.\n  Joe wore many hats during the course of his life. He served in the \nU.S. Army in the Korean war. He represented his hometown of Tiverton in \nthe Rhode Island General Assembly. He worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield \nof Rhode Island for 10 years and was a member of the board of directors \nof Home Loan Investment Bank. He was active in local civic and \ncharitable organizations, like the Fogarty Foundation, the Catholic \nCharity Fund, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the Rhode Island \nHeart Association, just to name a few. These items alone make for quite \nan impressive resume.\n  But Joe will always be remembered for his service as administrative \naide to the late U.S. Congressman Fernand St. Germain. For nearly three \ndecades, Joe ran the Congressman's office in Rhode Island. During that \ntime, Joe created an office which focused on helping constituents in \ntheir dealings with the Federal Government. Joe's work was and remains \nthe gold standard for congressional offices and reflects Joe's deep-\nseated commitment to the people of Rhode Island.\n  In this time of partisanship and rancor, it is good to honor Joe's \ndedication to a simple goal: helping people. Joe seemed to like \neveryone he met, and he went out of his way to steer power of \ngovernment to helping people, one by one, as he learned of their \ndifficulties. He was a master of his craft.\n  Although it might not get as much attention as other aspects of the \njob, helping constituents navigate through their government is one of \nthe most important roles we play as Members of Congress. Federal \nbureaucracy can be difficult, overwhelming, and frustrating. We can't \nseek special treatment, but we can ask questions and demand \naccountability, helping to cut the redtape that often stands in a \nconstituent's way.\n  Joe knew the questions to ask and the people to call. He worked \ntirelessly with his staff. He returned calls and wrote letters promptly \nand exhausted\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nevery option available to the constituent. Joe truly cared about Rhode \nIsland and its people. And he got results.\n  Joe was very helpful to me in my run for Senate in 2006. After my \nelection, I sought Joe's advice as I set up my office in Rhode Island. \nHe gave generously of his time and expertise, and many, if not all, of \nhis words of wisdom are in use in my office today. I will always be \ngrateful to him for that.\n  I will also be grateful for his friendship through the years, and I \nwill miss him dearly.\n  I send my condolences to Joe's beloved wife, Jeannine; his children, \nDeborah, Stephen, and Susan; and the entire Scanlon family. Rhode \nIsland was fortunate to have had such a committed, energetic, and \nselfless citizen.\n  Godspeed, my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6461-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6461-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  In executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/senate-section/article/S6461-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2015, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 6, 2015, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Harris) has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 212.
