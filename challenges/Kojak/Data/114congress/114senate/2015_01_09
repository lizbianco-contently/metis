Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed a \nbipartisan terrorism risk insurance bill and sent it to the President \nfor signature. We worked with our colleagues in the House and on the \nother side of the aisle to quickly process that bill in a timely \nmanner, and I thank the Speaker and all Members of the Senate for \ngranting unanimous consent to set up those votes yesterday.\n  This morning we will continue to debate the motion to proceed to the \nKeystone bill. Chairman Murkowski and several members of the energy \ncommittee will be here to talk about this bipartisan infrastructure \nbill.\n  No votes are scheduled for today, but we will have a cloture vote on \nthe motion to proceed on Monday night. It is my hope that Chairman \nMurkowski and Senator Cantwell can begin the amendment process under \nthe regular order. Unfortunately, some of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle continue to block our effort to even get on the bill, \nand therefore the cloture vote on Monday is required.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am here this morning to once again talk \nabout the Keystone XL Pipeline, the legislation we will be voting on \nnext week. We will be voting on cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nlegislation. Then, hopefully, we will be debating that bill and \noffering amendments, which is exactly what we are supposed to be doing \nin this Chamber.\n  On Thursday, yesterday, we had a hearing on the bill. In that hearing \nwe brought the bill forward. It is a bill I have authored. Joe Manchin \nis the lead Democratic cosponsor. We have 60 cosponsors on the bill. So \nwe have strong bipartisan support. It is the Keystone approval bill. \nEssentially, what it does is under the commerce clause of the \nConstitution of the United States, which authorizes Congress to oversee \ntrade with foreign countries, we approve the Keystone XL Pipeline \ncrossing the border from Canada into the United States.\n  A lot of people do not realize the pipeline carries domestic oil from \nplaces such as North Dakota and Montana--the Bakken region of our \ncountry--to refineries, and it carries both\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\nCanadian and domestic crude. But part of the approval requires approval \nfor crossing the border from Canada into the United States. Typically, \nthat is done by a national interest determination by the President of \nthe United States. But the President has been unwilling to do that now \nfor more than 6 years.\n  The company that is trying to build this pipeline, TransCanada, \napplied for approval to build this project pursuant to other pipelines \nit had already built. The original Keystone had already been built. \nThis is the Keystone XL sister pipeline. But in September 2008 they \napplied for approval to build the Keystone XL Pipeline and to get a \ncross-border permit determination by the President that, in fact, this \nvital energy infrastructure is in the national interest.\n  Well, more than 6 years have elapsed, obviously, since September \n2008. The President has still not rendered a final decision, arguing \nthat somehow the process has not been completed after more than 6 \nyears. Of course, America was able to fight and win World War II in \nless than 6 years. But our President feels that somehow that process \nstill has not been completed after more than 6 years on this project.\n  So, of course, the purpose of the bill is, in essence, to say: All \nright, Mr. President, if you will not approve this project, Congress \nwill--under the commerce clause of the Constitution--which we have the \nauthority to do. Earlier we passed legislation. As a matter of fact, I \nhad written a bill in 2011, which we passed in 2012. We attached it to \nthe payroll tax holiday, a bill that got 73 votes, as I recall, which \nrequired the President to make a decision. At that time the decision he \nmade was no, on the basis of the route in Nebraska.\n  So what happened then in 2012 is that the good citizens of Nebraska \nwent to work on a new route in Nebraska. The legislature, the Governor \ndealt with that new route, came up with a new route, and approved it \noverwhelmingly.\n  It was then subsequently challenged by opponents of the project. Some \nof the extreme environmentalists have continued to oppose the project, \nand so that decision went to the supreme court.\n  We learned today the supreme court has now decided in favor of \nTransCanada. The news came out this morning that yet another obstacle, \nafter more than 6 years of obstacles, today has been taken care of. The \nproblem is solved.\n  The Nebraska State Legislature ruled in favor of the Governor--\nGovernor Dave Heineman, whom I know very well, the former Governor of \nNebraska--and the legislature, and it said the way they sited this \npipeline is, in fact, proper and upheld their decision. I will talk \nabout that decision in a few minutes.\n  But the other thing I wish to talk about in terms of the Keystone \nPipeline is the discussion we had yesterday in the energy committee \nbecause it was an opportunity to begin the debate we are going to have \non the floor next week. The proponents had an opportunity to state \ntheir positions and why, and the opponents had their opportunity to \nstate their positions and why. So for several hours we began that \ndebate. We then voted on the legislation and moved it out, without \namendment, on a 13-to-9 vote. It was a bipartisan vote, 13 to 9, and we \nwill have that bill for a vote on the floor Monday.\n  I wish to address some of the arguments the opponents put forward in \nopposition to this project. I will start with the Nebraska court \ndecision because that was one of the issues brought up at our energy \nhearing yesterday. Some of the opponents of the project said: Well, you \nknow what. The process hasn't been concluded--even though it has been \ngoing on for more than 6 years. I will put a diagram up here that shows \nthe route of the pipeline.\n  As I mentioned, the original Keystone pipeline has already been \nbuilt. That is the red. That has already been built. It was permitted. \nIt took 2 years to permit and 2 years to build. I was actually Governor \nof North Dakota at that time. We can see it goes right through our \nState.\n  It seems to me that application was submitted by TransCanada in 2006. \nIt was during the Bush administration, obviously. It was approved \nwithin 2 years, and the project was constructed within 2 years.\n  So from start to conclusion, 4 years to build this pipeline, which I \nthink carries about 640,000 barrels of oil a day. It brings it down to \nCushing so that oil can go into our oil refineries in the gulf. It also \ngoes over here to Patoka, IL, so it can go to our refineries in the \nEast.\n  Based on that project, there are 640,000 barrels a day. TransCanada \nwanted to build a second pipeline. This one is 830,000 barrels a day. I \nthink it is about a $7.9 billion project in all.\n  Not only does this project carry crude from Canada, our closest \nfriend and ally, but it also brings oil out of this Bakken region in \nNorth Dakota and Montana. We put oil on it as well. So both Canadian \nand domestic crude are going to our refineries.\n  Again, it is just basic infrastructure that we need to move energy \nfrom where we produce it to where we refine it and consume it. We can't \nbuild an energy plan for this country without the necessary \ninfrastructure. We have to have pipelines, roads, rail, and electric \ntransmission lines to move electricity.\n  We cannot build what we want, which is either--some people refer to \nit as energy independence. I call it energy security. But, net, we \nproduce more energy than we consume.\n  When we produce more energy than we consume, we get jobs, we get \neconomic growth, we get national security because we don't have to \ndepend on places such as the Middle East or Venezuela or Russia--as \ndoes so much of Europe. Western Europe and Eastern Europe is dependent \non Russia for their oil and gas. What a terrible situation for them. \nThe people of this country don't want to depend on OPEC for their oil.\n  So we produce it here. We are doing that. You know what else. We are \nworking with our closest friend and ally Canada, and already that is \nhappening. We are already moving toward a situation--we already produce \nmore natural gas, but soon, if we keep it up, we will produce more oil. \nWorking together with Canada, we will get a little bit from Mexico, and \nwe will produce more oil and gas than we consume.\n  Some call it energy independence--not really, because it is a global \nmarket for energy. But it is certainly energy security. We don't have \nto depend on anyone else for our energy because we have it right here.\n  Not only does that create jobs directly, but energy is a foundational \nindustry for all of the other industry sectors. Think about it. If you \nare in manufacturing, high-tech--just name it--or if you are in \nfarming, agriculture, you depend on energy. If you have lower costs and \nabundant, available energy, you are more competitive in the global \neconomy, aren't you? So it is a foundational industry as well, and that \nis why we have to have this vital infrastructure as part of the energy \nbuilding plan for our country.\n  It is working. Don't take my word for it. Drive to the gas station. \nGo on over there. Fill up your car. Look at the bill when you are done. \nIt is a lot lower than it was a few years ago, right? Check it out.\n  Every consumer is benefiting at the pump. Small businesses are \nbenefiting across the board. All the industry sectors benefit from \nlower oil and gas prices.\n  Why did that happen? OPEC decided to give us a Christmas present; is \nthat what it is? I don't think so.\n  Russia decided: Oh, gee, to our friends in America, we better send \nthem some oil to reduce the price at the pump. I don't think so.\n  It is because we are producing so much more oil and gas--not only in \nthe Bakken and in the Eagle Ford formation in Texas, which are shale, \nclays for oil, but also natural gas in the Marcellus, other areas of \nour country--in the eastern part--and by working with our closest \nfriend and ally, Canada. We are getting millions of barrels of oil from \nCanada.\n  So the oil we produce at home and the oil we get from Canada we don't \nhave to get from Venezuela, we don't have to get from OPEC, we don't \nhave to get from Russia, and we don't have to get from countries in \nAfrica. When we send those dollars over to other countries, how are \nthey using those dollars? Look at what is going on in Paris today.\n  How many of those petro dollars fund terrorist activities? Isn't it \nbetter, if\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\nwe are not going to produce that energy at home, that we get it from \nCanada? And isn't it better that we produce that energy at home?\n  How are we going to produce that energy at home if we don't have the \ninfrastructure to move it from where it is produced to where it is \nconsumed? Gee, then somebody will say: Well, yeah, that is just common \nsense, of course, right?\n  I mean, that is just basic common sense. Why aren't we doing it? Yet \nhere we are in a process for more than 6 years still waiting to produce \nit because the extreme environmental interests have decided: Well, we \njust don't want to produce more oil. We don't want more oil produced in \nthis country, and we don't want more oil produced in Canada.\n  Of course, you say: Well, then what? We keep buying it from Russia or \nwe keep buying it from OPEC? Oh, no, no, no, we will just keep \ndeveloping all these alternatives. I am all for developing all kinds of \nenergy. I would say go ahead. Let's do it.\n  We worked hard in our State. We have not only oil and gas--we are now \nthe second largest oil-producing State, second only to Texas, but we \nalso produce natural gas. We have coal fired, we have solar, we have \nwind, we have biofuels. We have all of them. I am for all of them.\n\n  What I don't understand is how developing our oil and gas resources, \nbuilding the vital infrastructure--how does that prevent us from \ndeveloping any other type of energy? How does it prevent that? It \ndoesn't.\n  It just makes sure that as we work on anything else, we don't have to \ncontinue to be dependent on OPEC or somebody else for our oil and gas. \nThat is all we are doing.\n  So let's not sit here and pick winners and losers and do that kind of \nthing. Let's create the best business climate we can. Let's develop the \nvital infrastructure we need to move energy around our country, and \nlet's truly become energy secure. That is what this project represents.\n  Make no mistake. At the end of the day, that is what this project is \nabout. It has been held up for more than 6 years with hurdle after \nhurdle. Somebody says: Oh, well, gee, that is TransCanada. That is one \ncompany. Who cares about that?\n  Think about it. If you are going to build a pipeline or move energy \naround this country, if you are going to try to develop oil and gas--\nwhether it is for Canada or anyone else--and you see a company that \nwants to build a simple pipeline--something that has been done, I \nthink, 19 times before--and they have to spend billions of dollars and \ntake years and years and years, and they still don't have it, are you \nstill going to rush out and do that? Are you going to rush out and \nbuild a lot more infrastructure? Probably not.\n  So isn't this really about trying to shut her down? Isn't this the \nopponent saying: No, we are going to shut down developing the energy \nresources in this country. We are not going to work with Canada to do \nit.\n  And then what do we end up doing? We say: Well, we will have all \nthese other things.\n  Maybe we will, maybe we won't or maybe we will go right back to what \nhas been happening--history tends to repeats itself--and we will go \nback to remaining dependent on OPEC oil, back to remaining dependent on \nOPEC. It has to be music to these guys' ears.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes--I know the chairman of our energy \ncommittee will be coming to the floor and speaking on this issue as \nwell--and work to rebut some of the other arguments that have been \nbrought up on this issue, and some of these were brought up yesterday \nat our energy committee.\n  The first one, as I say, was: Well, look, the process isn't done \nbecause the decision in Nebraska hasn't been made.\n  Well, in fact, the decision in Nebraska has been made several times. \nNow the Nebraska Supreme Court put out a ruling today saying that it is \nfine. All the work the legislature in Nebraska did, all the work the \nGovernor in Nebraska did--the rerouting in Nebraska is upheld.\n  That is done. That excuse is gone. As the House works to pass this \nbill today, and as we work to pass it next week, that argument is off \nthe table. That has been taken care of.\n  The biggest argument is the environmental argument. The opponents \nsay: Oh, well, it will produce greenhouse gas emissions. They are \nopposed to oil development because it produces greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Yet the environmental impact statement--I should say the multiple \nenvironmental impact statements done by the State Department--this is \nwhat they say. Understand there have been five different reports--three \ndraft reports and two final reports--over a 6-year timeframe. The State \nDepartment has done this not once, not twice, but three times in draft \nform and two times in final form. They have gone in, and they have \nanalyzed the environmental impact of this project.\n  When you read the report, do you know what it says? ``No significant \nenvironmental impact'' is what it says. That is the Obama \nadministration's State Department environmental impact statement, after \n6 years of study--not once, not twice, but five times between three \ndraft statements and two final statements--``No significant \nenvironmental impact.'' That is what it says.\n  It just stands to reason because if we don't build the pipeline, they \npointed out, then what happens? Well, if you don't have this pipeline, \nthe environmental impact statement pointed out that it will take 1,400 \nrailcars a day to move that oil. So instead of moving that oil from \nCanada, not even counting--I mean, we have to move our oil too. If we \ndon't have the pipeline to move that oil in the safest, most cost-\neffective and efficient way, then it has to be moved by rail. If you \ndon't have a pipeline, you have to move it by rail. Now you have 1,400 \nrailcars a day creating congestion on the rail.\n  That creates more greenhouse gas, that creates more congestion, more \ndifficulty in moving our ag products and other products.\n  We are already seeing that. We already have congestion on our rail \nthat is backing up the shipment of other goods. We had a tremendous \nproblem moving our ag goods this year. So are we going to have another \n1,400 railcars on a railroad system that is already overloaded? It \ndoesn't make much sense.\n  You know what. It creates more greenhouse gas. So by not having the \npipeline, you increase the greenhouse gas emissions. I suppose Canada \ncould say--although it is unlikely because they are already moving it \nby rail.\n  In my home State of North Dakota we are already moving 700,000 \nbarrels a day by railcar because we can't get enough pipeline, and we \nare producing more oil. We are up to 1.2 million barrels a day, moving \n700,000 barrels by railcars because we can't move it by pipeline, \nbenefiting the rest of our country--light, sweet Bakken crude.\n  The other thing with Canada is they say: If we can't bring the \npipeline down and work with our closest friend and ally, the United \nStates, if they would rather work with--I don't know--OPEC than \nCanada--we can't figure that one out. I am sure Prime Minister Harper \nis saying: Oh, boy, that is unbelievable. But OK, then I guess what we \nwill have to do is we will build these pipelines--and they are already \nin the process of doing so--to the west coast of Canada. We will load \nthat oil on tankers, and we will send it all to China because China \nwants it. They are not only willing to buy the oil, but they are trying \nto buy the source of the oil.\n  So then it gets on the pipeline, and then it goes on tankers over to \nChina. Well, those tankers produce greenhouse gas emissions as they \nhaul that oil to China. In China the refineries have much higher \ngreenhouse gas emissions. They are much less efficient. They are much \nless environmentally sound than our refineries in this country. So what \ndo we end up with? We end up with much higher greenhouse gas emissions \nbecause we didn't have the pipeline.\n\n  Oh, and by the way, instead of us then refining it, tankers have to \nbring that petroleum to us from OPEC, from Russia, heavy crude from \nVenezuela, creating some more greenhouse gas. So the net effect is we \nhave increased the environmental impacts by not allowing the pipeline. \nIt increases it. It doesn't reduce it, it increases it.\n  Furthermore, Canada's laws, in terms of environmental stewardship, \nare tougher than ours, but they are continuing to move to what is \ncalled in situ development in the oil sands. What\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\nis in situ development? In situ development is drilling and then the \nuse of steam to bring up the oil rather than excavating, which is the \ntraditional way they produce oil up here. So the greenhouse gas \nfootprint is very similar to drilling in the United States. In fact, it \nhas a lower footprint than the heavy crude that comes out of \nCalifornia--a very environmentally conscious State.\n  Again, when we talk about the environmental impact, let's talk about \nthe facts. Let's talk about reality, and those are the facts. That is \nwhat it is truly about.\n  Safety is another thing they brought up. Something could happen with \nthe pipeline. That is true, and we always have to work on safety. It is \nvery important we always address safety in whatever we do. The best way \nto have a safe infrastructure system to move energy around this country \nis to have the right mix of pipelines and roads and rail--the right mix \nalong with transmission lines--so we move all types of energy as safely \nand as effectively as possible.\n  This graph reflects the pipeline system in our country. Oil and gas \nare moving through millions and millions of miles of pipelines in our \ncountry. This pipeline is going to be the newest, with the latest and \nthe best technology. Oh, by the way, if we don't have the pipeline, as \nI mentioned just a minute ago, we are adding 1,400 railcars a day. \nEveryone can do their own calculation, but do we think we are safer and \nmore likely to have less accidents with another pipeline--with the \nlatest, greatest technologies and safeguards--or would we rather have \n1,400 railcars a day going through our communities loaded with oil? \nCommon sense again, and the statistics support it.\n  There is more. They brought up more concerns, but I am nearing the \nend of my time, in terms of floor time right now, and I know our \nchairman is coming down, so I will have to wrap this up. I went a \nlittle longer on some of these issues they brought up, and they brought \nup others, but here is the good news. We are going to vote on a cloture \nmotion to proceed to the bill on Monday. I am hopeful, with our 60 \nsponsors on this legislation--we will have 60, maybe 63 votes based on \nwhat people have indicated to me as to how they will vote right now--\nthat after the vote on Monday we will be on the bill.\n  Unlike the past several years in the Senate, once we are on the bill, \nwe will be open for business, and we are welcoming amendments. We are \nsaying to Republicans and Democrats alike: Bring them on. Bring on your \namendments. If you have a good idea, come on down. If you have a good \nidea, come on down and let's talk about your amendment. Let's debate \nyour amendment, and you know what. You are going to get a vote, and if \nyou get 60 votes in support of your amendment, then we will make it \npart of this legislation.\n  We are hopeful that in allowing amendments, we can improve the \nlegislation, we can make it more bipartisan, and we can get more \nsupporters, so if in fact the President does decide to veto it, we will \nhave 67 votes instead of 60 or 63 votes. That is how the process is \nsupposed to work. We are supposed to be able to have that debate, offer \nthose amendments, and produce the best product we can. That is what we \nare hoping to do with this legislation.\n  We are also hoping that will not only generate more bipartisan \nsupport on this issue, on this legislation, but on other energy \nlegislation and other legislation of all types so we can get the \nimportant work of the American people done in this body. That is what \nit is all about: finding a way to get things done--get the job done for \nthe American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, yesterday morning those of us on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee had an opportunity for good \ndiscussion about our Nation's energy future. More specific to the \nagenda of yesterday's business meeting was a bill that would allow for \na much-delayed project--the Keystone XL Pipeline--to advance. It moved \nthrough the committee favorably. It moved through the committee with \nbipartisan support.\n  As I noted to several colleagues yesterday, the discussion we had in \nthe committee about the significance of this pipeline--the significance \nof its contribution to our Nation's economy from a jobs perspective and \nfrom a resource perspective is considerable. Obviously there was debate \non both sides--I think good, healthy debate--and it is debate I hope we \nwill see reflected on this floor in the next week and perhaps the week \nfollowing as we have an opportunity to debate. But first we have to get \nonto that bill. We have that process in place. We will have a vote on \nthe motion to proceed the first of next week.\n  I am anxious, as the new chair of the energy committee, to move the \ndebate here in the Senate on issues that are so important to us in this \nNation. When we think about our Nation's security--national security \nand energy security--and when we think about our Nation's economy and \nprosperity, so much of it comes back to energy, access to energy that \nis abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure. These are \nprinciples I have laid out about my views of energy. I am hopeful that \nthe discussion we will have on this floor will help advance us as a \nSenate, as a Congress, and really as a country in moving forward on \nthose policies that will only make us stronger and more secure.\n  I felt the debate yesterday in committee was kind of a precursor of \nsome of the agenda items we will see on this floor that will be brought \nforward by way of amendments. I would encourage colleagues, as they \nthink about next week and as they think about the debate we will have \non energy, let's stick to energy. We haven't had a good, robust debate \non energy in a long while.\n  We have a lot of other concerns. We have colleagues who want to bring \nup the President's initiatives as they relate to immigration or perhaps \nhealth care. We will have plenty of opportunity here in the Senate \nunder Leader McConnell's management to hear and debate issues that are \nof great substance and weight. But we have waited far too long for our \nenergy issues to be fully debated on the floor, so I am welcoming that \ndiscussion.\n  We heard a lot of good reasons within the committee and we have heard \na lot of good reasons here on the floor why the Keystone XL Pipeline is \nsignificant, is important to this country. This morning I wish to take \na few moments to discuss some of the arguments that have been made \nagainst it and perhaps provide some context, some rebuttal, because I \nthink it is fair to acknowledge that the Keystone XL Pipeline evokes \nsome strong feelings, but not all of what we have heard is perhaps as \nfactual as we would like it to be. As we note often around here, people \nare entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their \nown facts. So I would like to address some of the responses.\n  One of the issues we heard yesterday was that this bill is almost too \nmuch. Well, if those on the committee and on the floor would look \ndirectly to the language of the bill, it is pretty simple. The text of \nthe full bill takes up fewer than two pages. It is roughly 400 words \nlong. It doesn't take long to read or understand. It is pretty simple. \nIt is a pretty simple measure. It approves this long-delayed cross-\nborder permit that is needed to construct the Keystone XL Pipeline. \nThat is all it does. It approves a permit. It doesn't give some grand \nsweetheart deal to a foreign company. It doesn't feather the nest of \noil companies. It allows for a permit to cross the border between the \nUnited States and Canada to allow for a construction project, and it \ndoes this while protecting private property rights.\n  It allows Nebraska to find the best possible route for the pipeline, \nand it requires all State and local obligations to be fully met. This \nbill does not deal with routing through the States. It was suggested \nthat somehow or other we here in the Senate and the House are kind of \nlike a zoning committee. That is not what is happening. It doesn't deal \nwith the routing. As we know, that discussion took place at the State \nlevel--and appropriately so. So what this measure does is it just \nallows for that cross-boundary permit.\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\n  Some of the other points raised were that somehow or other this bill \nprovides subsidies--subsidies--whether to TransCanada or to others. It \ndoes not authorize a single taxpayer dollar for any purpose. It doesn't \ncreate any new tax credits. It doesn't reduce current tax rates. The \nbill is simply about approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. It is that \nsimple.\n  I would encourage you to read it. Again, it is pretty brief.\n  Another question raised yesterday in committee: Why the urgency? Why \nthe push right now? We are just in the first week of the 114th \nCongress. Why are we pushing so quickly to advance this?\n  Well, for new Members, such as the Presiding Officer, here today, \nthis is the first opportunity you will have had to weigh in on the \nSenate floor on this very important legislation, but many of us who \nwere here in the 113th Congress recall that it was just about 6 or 7 \nweeks ago that this same measure--in fact, the same language of this \nbill is what we had on this floor just before we departed at the end of \nthe 113th Congress. We fell one vote short of cloture. We had 59 \nsupporters in the Senate. We obviously had very significant Democratic \nsupport. Coming up with 59 votes was substantive. I think folks would \nremember that.\n  In effect, this is a little bit about unfinished business. We were \nworking on it less than 2 months ago--a month and a half ago. We are \nnow back in the 114th Congress. So what has changed? Well, what has \nchanged is that the Presiding Officer is now a Member of the Republican \nParty, and our leader, Senator McConnell, is leading the Senate. We are \nnow in a new Congress with new leadership, and the bill that has been \nintroduced by my friend and colleague from North Dakota has 60 \ncosponsors--60 cosponsors--not people who have said: Yes, I think I am \ngoing to vote for this bill. These are 60 who have committed and signed \ntheir names, and we now have enough votes to pass it in this Chamber. \nSo I think that is a good sign.\n  I think it is not a bad sign that what we are starting with is a bill \nthat is unfinished business but also a bill that has strong bipartisan \nsupport, with 60 cosponsors. It is not very often in this body that we \nhave legislation that has that level of support. So why not start this \nnew Congress off with something that enjoys bipartisan support? I don't \nthink it was the intention of our leader to start off saying: By gosh, \nit is going to be Republican ideas only. We are trying to find those \nideas and those issues that will advance our country. I believe that \nmoving forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline is something that will \nadvance the best interests of our country.\n  So when we talk about timing, I think it is important to note that \nthis is not only a good time, it is the best time to bring up Keystone \nXL. Our colleagues on the other side of the building are taking up the \nKeystone XL Pipeline today.\n  We had, of course, good news coming out of Nebraska this morning with \nthe announcement that that litigation has been resolved, if you will, \nwith the courts effectively upholding the pipeline route.\n  There have been some on the other side of the aisle who have \nsuggested that we shouldn't cut off a process, that we shouldn't move \nuntil things have been resolved in Nebraska. And there are some who \nwould say: Well, OK, that is something we do need to consider. It has \nbeen suggested that until that has been resolved, action on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline is somehow or other premature or untimely.\n  I want to speak to the aspect of timeliness and whether we are moving \ntoo quickly. The Presidential approval process is actually another \nreason we are starting on this bill in this Congress. A final ``yes'' \nor ``no'' decision has now been delayed by more than 2,300 days. I \nthink the exact number is 2,303, and we are counting. That is more than \n6 years--not to build a pipeline; we are not talking about it taking 6 \nyears to build the pipeline; we are talking about 6 years to approve a \npermit to cross from the Canadian side to the U.S. side. The energy \ncommittee is on its fourth chairman since the initial cross-border \napplication was filed.\n  We have seen a lot of process. We have seen a lot of talk here in \nthis body. Literally everything that has happened during the Obama \nadministration--the legislation that has moved, regulations, all of the \nextracurricular stuff that goes on outside--that has all happened while \nthe Keystone XL permit has been pending. One has to look at this and \nsay: 2,300 days and counting, over 6 years--it is pretty clear to me \nthat the President really doesn't want to make this decision, and so if \nthe Congress can step in and make it happen, the Congress should step \nin and make it happen.\n  I mentioned the decision coming out of Nebraska this morning and the \nfact that it allows--the pipeline route was effectively upheld. So that \naspect of the process that individuals have been waiting for I think we \ncan fairly say has been resolved.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy--effectively the veto \nthreat the President has issued on Keystone XL that I would note he \nissued the day we gavelled into the 114th Congress, before we started \nany of our business. In his veto message, the President said the \nlegislation would cut short consideration of important issues relevant \nto the national interests. Again, I would just ask anyone, really? Some \n2,303 days and we think we are somehow or other cutting short a \nprocess?\n  In his veto SAP, he states further that ``the bill would also \nauthorize the project despite uncertainty due to ongoing litigation in \nNebraska.'' Well, it looks as though that part of it has been resolved, \nso that can't be used as the excuse.\n  It is not just in that Statement of Administration Policy. Back in \nApril the Press Secretary for the President, Mr. Carney, stated, \n``Absent a definite route from Nebraska, the decision, as I understand, \nby State is that that can't continue until the situation in Nebraska is \nresolved.'' OK. We are letting you know now that the situation in \nNebraska has been resolved.\n  Further, there was a statement that came out of the State Department \non April 18 in which they note that a core reason for the delay is \n``the potential impact of the Nebraska Supreme Court case which could \nultimately affect the pipeline route.'' All right. The State Department \nalso has word now that we are no longer waiting for that.\n  So when one talks about timeliness, when one talks about why it is \nimperative that we allow this permit to proceed, it is because it has \nbeen 6 years. It is because the decks have been cleared. It is an \ninfrastructure that will benefit our Nation as well as our friends to \nthe northern border.\n  I would like to talk about the issue of job creation. We have talked \na lot about the jobs that are created with a potential Keystone XL \nproject. We heard in the committee discussion yesterday that, hey, this \nis not as advertised. There are only going to be about 55 permanent \njobs and only 4,000 construction jobs that will be created.\n  We have been saying it is closer to 42,000 jobs. There is a lot of \nwater in between 4,000 and 42,000. Who is correct? I think it is \nimportant to note that the numbers we are talking about are drawn from \nthe State Department's final supplemental EIS. It is one of those \nsituations where if you are opposed to it you are going to grab some \nlow numbers, and if you are supportive of it you might grab the high \nnumbers. But I think you need to read the whole thing in context, my \nfriends.\n\n  The final supplemental EIS goes on to say:\n\n       Construction contracts, materials, and support purchased in \n     the United States would total approximately $3.1 billion, \n     with another $233 million spent on construction camps. During \n     construction, this spending would support a combined total of \n     approximately 42,100 average annual jobs and approximately $2 \n     billion in earnings throughout the United States.\n\n  It goes on further to say:\n\n       Approximately 16,100 would be direct jobs at firms that are \n     awarded contracts for goods and services, including \n     construction directly by Keystone. The other approximately \n     26,000 jobs would result from indirect and induced spending; \n     this would consist of goods and services purchased by the \n     construction contractors and spending by employees working \n     for either the construction contractor or for any supplier of \n     goods and services required in the construction process.\n\n  So, again, these aren't Lisa Murkowski's numbers that are drawn from \nthe air or Senator Hoeven, the sponsor of this bill, conjuring up these \nnumbers. These are the numbers that come from the State Department's \nfinal supplemental EIS. This is what they are saying--42,100 average \nannual jobs, $2 billion in earnings, 16,000 direct jobs,\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\n26,000 jobs from indirect and induced spending.\n  The State Department estimates construction workers on a seasonal \nbasis--4 to 8 months per period. On an annual basis that is 1,950 jobs \nper year for 2 years, and that is where they get the 4,000 construction \njobs.\n  But think about it. The nature of the construction business is not \nthat these are jobs in perpetuity. That means you build things, and \nonce they are built you move on to build something else. Of course they \nare not permanent jobs because we are not in a permanent state of \nconstruction. The key here is to approve projects in a timely manner so \nthat these good, skilled, qualified workers can go from one job to the \nnext and have permanent, stable employment--not necessarily on the same \nproject for their entire lifetime but to be able, as a welder, as a \nskilled technician, to move from one project to another.\n  I would support this project even if it were just 4,000 temporary \njobs, but it is not. What we are talking about is supporting over \n42,000 workers over a 2-year period. That is significant. It is \nsignificant given the unemployment levels we are at--we are at 5.6 \npercent now. Isn't this what we are wanting to do, to bring on new \njobs?\n  In my State right now we are trying to figure out how we can move \nAlaska's natural gas to market, not only to benefit our State with \nrevenues but to benefit jobs. We don't have a deal yet that allows us \nto build that pipeline, although our Governor today and our previous \nGovernor and Governors before them have been working diligently to make \nthat happen, and one of these days we are going to see it. But in the \nmeantime, do you think Alaskans are saying: Well, we are not so sure we \nwant this because these are only going to be temporary construction \njobs. Absolutely not. We are building training facilities. We are \ngetting our workforce kind of teed up for that day so that when it \ncomes, we are ready because we want those construction jobs. We \nrecognize it will be a construction project, and by its very definition \nit is not permanent.\n  Don't you think that bolsters my State's economy? Don't you think we \nare hoping every day that we are going to get moving on this project? \nAbsolutely. Is it going to benefit my State? Yes. Is it going to \nbenefit this country? Yes. Let's get moving on it, and let's get moving \non Keystone XL.\n  I get a little frustrated when we talk about the jobs, and we have \nthose who say we should dismiss the fact that if we can't get to a \ncertain number of jobs, the project is not worthwhile. What we are \ndoing is approving a nonsubsidized, nonfederally funded project. This \nis not costing us anything. This will be a benefit to us. It is not an \nentire industry, nor is it a multiple-year funding authorization for \ntransportation projects around the country. I think those kinds of \ncomparisons are inaccurate and to a certain extent unfair.\n  I suggest to those who criticize Keystone XL's job-creating potential \nto be careful. We don't want to put ourselves in a position where we \nare going to wind up opposing nearly all individual projects for any \npurpose all across the country just because they don't create enough \njobs.\n  Take the Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program. It has funded \nsome good programs, in my view, over the years. We have seen some \nrenewable energy projects in recent years that I think have been \nbeneficial to our region. By our count, more than one dozen of these \nprojects would create less than 50 permanent jobs. We are not creating \nhundreds or even thousands of jobs. It will create less than 50 \npermanent jobs. One solar project created 7 permanent jobs, a wind \nproject created 10, a geothermal project created 14, and we had a \ntransmission line that created 15 permanent jobs. I think the question \nthat has to be asked is: Should we have opposed these projects based on \nthe number of permanent jobs that are associated with them? Is there a \nminimum number of jobs we are going to use as a benchmark for approval \nor denial or should we just be glad and encouraged when any new job is \ncreated because it means Americans have found steady work? This is what \nI thought we were working toward.\n  Keep in mind Keystone XL is one project. It is one project. It is one \npipeline. There is one connector between Canada and the United States \nthat connects up to a pipeline that has already been built in the South \nand will feed into our existing system. This is not brandnew frontier. \nWe are allowing for a connector between Canada and the systems we have \nin the United States.\n  Keystone XL is one project. It is one small part of the employment \nthat energy production and infrastructure development can provide for \nour Nation. We already have 19 cross-border oil pipelines. This is \ncoming down from Canada in the North and coming up from Mexico in the \nSouth. We are already building up our LNG export capability and so much \nmore.\n  Again, keep in mind this is not the first time there has been a \nrequest for a cross-border pipeline. We have 19 that are already in \nplace. What makes this one so special?\n  I will have more to say on that issue in the future. I know our \nleaders are expected to come down to the floor shortly. I look forward \nto a good, honest debate about our energy resources, our energy \nopportunities, and our energy challenges. I think the American public \nis ready for this discussion.\n  I don't know what happens around the dinner table in the hometowns of \nGeorgia, but I can tell you in Alaska we talk a lot about energy, and \nwe don't talk about it because we are an energy-producing State. We \ntalk about it because it costs us a lot of money to keep warm in a cold \nplace. It costs us a lot of money because we are not part of anybody \nelse's energy infrastructure.\n  We don't have transmission lines that connect us from one place to \nthe other. We have what we have, and we are thankful to have it. We are \nready to share it with others around the country and around the globe, \nbut we in Alaska talk a lot about the affordability of our energy \nresources. We talk a lot about how we can access our abundant \nresources. We talk a lot about how to use our ingenuity and technology \nto advance us so we can have cleaner energy sources and move to a world \nof renewable energy, and that is so exciting for us.\n  We have a lot of fossil fuel in Alaska--and we have a lot of \neverything else--and we are excited to be developing our geothermal, \nour marine hydrokinetic, our biomass, our wind potential, and our solar \npotential. It is a little dark there now, but our solar potential in \nthe summer is second to none.\n  We are excited as to what we might be able to do in understanding how \nwe can tap into ocean energy resources. It is exciting. We need to do \nmore as a nation when it comes to efficiency and conservation. We \nshould be leading in that way, and that is why I am pleased we will \nhave an opportunity to again revisit the merits of the legislation my \nfriends Senator Portman and Senator Shaheen have been working on so \nlong as it relates to energy efficiency and taking that up as an \nopportunity for amendment. We have such good issues to talk about--\nissues that the American public is talking about because it impacts \nthem, and it impacts their family budget. It impacts their \nopportunities for jobs, and it impacts our Nation's security.\n  I have not talked today about the security aspects of it, but it \ndoesn't take a foreign policy analyst to understand that gaining the \nbenefit from an energy resource from our friends in Canada is better \nthan asking for that same resource from the OPEC nations or Venezuela \nor from any nation that might not like us. That is a debate that again \nis so core to what we are talking about with Keystone XL.\n  We have a healthy relationship with Canada. It is important because \nwhen someone drives to my State, which is a heck of a long drive, they \nhave to go through more of Canada than anyplace else. I want to have a \ngood relationship with Canada, but I can tell you our friends on the \nCanadian border are wondering what is happening in the United States. \nIt has been 2,303 days, and we can't make a decision on whether we \nshould benefit from a jobs perspective, an economic perspective, and a \nnational security perspective.\n  I look forward to the discussion next week, and I look forward to a \nrobust and full debate on good energy amendments that will be coming \nbefore this body.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk \nabout the Keystone XL Pipeline. I see my colleague from Alaska is here \nthis morning, and I think she and I were thinking we would be \ncontinuing this debate next Monday as the Senate moves forward on the \nmotion to proceed to rule XIV of the bill that relates to this issue. \nObviously we had committee action yesterday, but we are both here this \nmorning.\n  I wish to say to my colleague before she leaves the floor that I do \nlook forward to the opportunity where she and I can sit down and talk \nabout an energy strategy and other issues that will help move our \ncountry forward so we can produce jobs.\n  I had a chance to work with Senator Murkowski's father and other \nRepublicans on the energy committee. We produced some very good energy \nlegislation in both 2005 and 2007 that did result in moving our country \nforward. It was bipartisan legislation and definitely not unanimous. I \nmean, there was a great deal of debate about them, but we got them done \nnonetheless. I am looking forward to working with the Senator from \nAlaska on these issues.\n  It is probably safe to say the Senator from Alaska and I had plans \nthis morning other than coming to the Senate floor; nonetheless, I am \nmore than happy to talk about the recent decision by the Nebraska \nSupreme Court and how Congress will continue to discuss the issue of \nKeystone XL approval. Many of my colleagues probably know that the \nHouse will take up this action sometime today. The President has \nconsistently said he is interested in having the process play out in \nNebraska before he makes a decision about whether this pipeline is in \nthe national interest. The President of the United States and the State \nDepartment have the authority and responsibility to look at this issue \nas it relates to what is in the national interest of the United States \nof America.\n  This decision by the Nebraska Supreme Court today is a very \ninteresting decision. It is a very interesting decision because a \nmajority of the Nebraska Supreme Court, four out of the seven justices \non the court, said this law was unconstitutional--this attempt to \ncircumvent the public interest process by which the citizens of \nNebraska can raise concerns about a pipeline going through their \ncommunity. The majority of the supreme court said, yes, that decision \nto short circuit the public process in Nebraska was unconstitutional.\n  Unfortunately for those citizens in Nebraska and those citizens in \nthe United States of America who want to make sure the environmental \nsecurity issues and economic issues are fully discussed, they are \ngetting shut down by a supermajority of the Nebraska Supreme Court. \nThey failed to get five out of the seven supreme court justices to side \nwith them. Nonetheless, I think there is a lot in this decision for all \nof us to think about; that is, just how much this process has been \ncircumvented.\n  To me it is very unusual that the Senate would be asked to vote on a \nbill that would expedite the siting of a pipeline through the United \nStates of America simply because a Canadian company wants us to do so. \nIt is perplexing to me because I hear a lot of people talk about our \nneighbors, and I definitely value the relationship that the United \nStates and Canada have. We are in the process of a major discussion \nwith them on issues that impact the Pacific Northwest, and we have to \nwork with our neighbors.\n  I am struck that my state has a great relationship with British \nColumbia, which is Washington's neighbor to the north. Sixty-eight \npercent of British Columbian residents oppose a tar sands pipeline \nacross their province. That is right, a Canadian province definitely \ndoes not want a tar sands pipeline going through their neighborhood.\n  We have First Nations all across Canada who don't want tar sands \ndevelopment and pipelines across Canada. In addition, there are a lot \nof concerns about environmental practices for tar sands production that \nare in place in Alberta.\n  People should know that the oil and gas producing province of \nAlberta, not the federal government of Canada, regulates tar sands \ndevelopment. Alberta does not require what we in the U.S. would \nconsider ``best practices'' for development of some of the dirtiest oil \nproduction in the world. In the U.S., we actually have federal laws \nthat make oil production cleaner than in Alberta.\n  There is a lot of concern about these not only tar sands production, \nbut also about byproducts, such as pet coke. As my colleague from \nMichigan stated in our business meeting yesterday, uncovered pet coke \nmounds, which could just blow around in the wind, caused serious \nenvironmental concerns in Michigan and Illinois. In addition, I am sure \nmy colleague from California has been down here talking about benzene, \nwhich is a byproduct that is left behind and can adversely affect \nindividuals.\n  To say that just because this Nebraska court decision became final \ntoday, that all those environmental issues and public safety issues \nhave gone away, is surely a misstatement. Congress is being pressured \nto make a sweetheart deal for a business interest.\n  I believe tar sands producers should pay into the oil spill liability \ntrust fund, just as companies that produce other oil products have to \ndo. This is a very important issue for me because oilspills are a \nsituation that we in the Pacific Northwest have cared about for a long \nperiod of time. In fact, the Commandant of the Coast Guard appeared \nbefore the Senate commerce committee last year, and I had a chance to \nask the commandant whether the Coast Guard had a way to respond to a \ntar sands oilspill, and he basically told me that, no, they didn't.\n\n  So, to me, there are a lot of environmental issues, a lot of process \nissues, and issues of paying a fair share for helping to clean up \noilspills--and these issues all add up to serious concerns with \nlegislatively approving a construction project. My colleagues on the \nother side want to turn Congress into a siting commission, to give a \nspecial interest the certainty to move forward on a project that needs \nto go through the proper process and channels.\n  In the State of Nebraska, the public said we have concerns about a \ntar sands pipeline running through our state, straight through the \nenvironmentally sensitive Sand Hills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, \nwhich provides drinking water to six states. Instead of dealing with \nthose environmental issues, the company and its advocates came to the \nCongress and tried to get that route approved. This is why the \nPresident had to reject the proposal in 2012--because TransCanada did \nnot want to do right be the citizens of Nebraska or the environment.\n  The long and short of it is, if TransCanada had been successful in \ngetting the original route approved, that pipeline would go across the \nOgallala Aquifer. There is now a broad consensus that this would have \nbeen the wrong route, endangering the water supply in America's \nagricultural heartland.\n  So, thank God, Congress, which tried to act and give a sweetheart \ndeal to TransCanada, was thwarted by the President. The President said, \nI cannot approve this project now. And guess what happened. The company \nsaid, yes, that is right; we have to figure out a better route for the \npipeline. And TransCanada had to start the process all over with a new \napplication for a better route through Nebraska.\n  In my State, a utility and transportation commission--in the State of \nNebraska I think it is called a public service commission--oversees the \nsiting process for these kinds of infrastructure projects. That \ncommission has a public process and answers all of the questions the \npublic raises, debates the issues that are before the public and makes \nsure those issues are taken into account--I know many of my colleagues \nprobably can relate to this more from the perspective of siting \ntransmission lines or a grid system. I am sure people have seen a \nneighborhood complaining about a transmission line going through their \nneighborhood. This is a pipeline, and for us pipelines are very \nimportant in the Pacific Northwest. We had a natural gas pipeline that \nblew up, killing some young children in the Bellingham area. So, for \nme, pipeline siting, and the process\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\nthat goes into assuring the safety and security of the siting, should \nbe decided in the broad daylight of public discussion through the \nproper channels. In this case, people circumvented that public \ncommission process in Nebraska, circumvented what would have been a \nutilities and transportation commission process, and let the Governor \ndecide the route. Then the decision was sent to the Nebraska Supreme \nCourt to determine whether in fact the Governor had the authority to do \nthat. Four of those seven justices said it was unconstitutional--not \nthe supermajority for sure, but four of them said it was \nunconstitutional. But nothing in that decision corrected the original \nproblem of them circumventing the environmental and economic and \nsecurity issues that a public commission is supposed to go through in \nthis process.\n  I ask my colleagues, why are we in such a big hurry to make this \ndecision on behalf of a utility commission and on behalf of the \nPresident of the United States when there are real issues of safety and \nsecurity that need to be discussed?\n  Next week my colleagues are going to have a lot of discussion on a \nlot of different amendments, but I still advocate that Congress has no \nbusiness deciding for a special interest where a pipeline should go \nwithout the due process of citizens who are affected by pipeline having \ninput to the decision.\n  I hope my colleagues will continue to let the process play out. I \nhope my colleagues will care more about public process and public \ninterest than special interest. There is a great article, which I will \nsubmit for the Record, in Business Week citing welding issues with the \ncurrent Keystone Pipeline. That existing pipeline has had safety \nproblems.\n  We in the Pacific Northwest celebrate that we are a gateway to Asia, \nand we celebrate the fact that a lot of people will want to use that \ngateway.

Mr. President, Louisianians are well-known for our \ndelicious food, rich cultural traditions, and enthusiasm for football. \nLess well known, but just as important, is our deep appreciation for \nreliable air conditioning. During the muggy summer months, every \nLouisianian needs a reliable air conditioning contractor on speed dial. \nAs the newly elected chairman of the Senate Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee, I am honored to recognize a small business \nfrom my State that provides this vital service to its customers--the \nFactory Service Agency--which is celebrating its 40th year of operation \nthis year.\n  Based out of Metairie, LA, Factory Service Agency serves the entire \nNew Orleans metro area. While the business encompasses a multitude of \nmechanical and general contracting specialties, the primary focus is on \nthe installation, service, and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and \nair conditioning equipment. This longstanding Louisiana business \nemphasizes its middle name--``service''--and truly provides outstanding \ncustomer service, including 24-hour emergency assistance and \nmaintenance for airflow and ductwork problems. For four decades, \nFactory Service Agency has gone above and beyond to supply quality \nproducts and service to local hospitals, universities, manufacturing \nfacilities, nursing homes, and more.\n  Small businesses provide the backbone for our economy, and their \nsuccesses would not be possible without the direction of exceptional \nleaders. Mike Mitternight, the owner of Factory Service Agency, is not \nonly responsible for all operations of the business, but also makes \nrepresenting small businesses across the State a top priority. Over the \nyears, Mike Mitternight has served on a variety of notable government \nand business organizations. In addition to his chairmanship of the \nstatewide Louisiana Economic Development Small Business Advisory \nCouncil, he has served as the chairman of the Louisiana Association of \nBusiness and Industry and as a member of the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, Louisiana Workforce Investment Council, and the \nNational Small Business Association, the last of which he was named the \n2010 Advocate of the Year. Small businesses across the country are \nfortunate to have a strong proponent with such valuable experience in \neach aspect of business operations, including financial management, job \ncoordination, and project management.\n  For my first small business of the week as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am honored to \nrecognize a local business that has not only flourished, but has been \nan inspiration for entrepreneurs in Louisiana and across the country. \nSmall businesses consistently provide unmatched attention, \ncommunication, and results to their customers, and I am proud to \nadvocate for them. Once again, I congratulate Factory Service Agency on \nan exceptional 40 years and wish them continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/09/senate-section/article/S128-3", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S128]\n                 REMEMBERING SERGEANT STEPHEN R. PAQUIN\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I have the solemn duty of \nmemorializing SGT Stephen R. Paquin, a soldier and native of Nashua, \nNH, who passed away on December 16 at the age of 27. After serving two \ntours in Afghanistan and a tour in Europe, Sergeant Paquin had recently \ntransitioned from active duty into the U.S. Army Reserves and was \ntraining to become a drill sergeant with 1st Battalion, 304th Regiment \nin Londonderry. Born and raised in Nashua by his parents Kenneth and \nPaula alongside his brother Shawn, he was a graduate of the University \nof New Hampshire and Nashua High School South, where in his senior year \nStephen was a member of the Purple Panthers 2005 State championship \nbaseball team.\n  Stephen will forever be a member of the special community of \nAmericans who selflessly defend our country so that the rest of us may \ncontinue to live in peace and freedom. He bravely joined the military \nat a time when it was almost guaranteed that new recruits would be \ncalled on to serve in a dangerous warzone far from home. It is my hope \nthat during this extremely difficult time, Stephen's family and friends \nwill find comfort in knowing that Americans everywhere deeply \nappreciate his commitment to our Nation.\n  Stephen is survived by his parents, Kenneth and Paula, his brother \nShawn D. Paquin, and Christine Smith of Waltham, MA, his grandmothers \nGloria Paquin of Nashua and Carol Mulligan of Dracut, MA, many aunts, \nuncles, cousins, and friends. This patriot will be missed by all.\n  On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in honoring the life and service of this brave \nAmerican, SGT Stephen Paquin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/01/09/senate-section/article/S128-4", "month": "01", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S128-S129]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:55 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 30.
