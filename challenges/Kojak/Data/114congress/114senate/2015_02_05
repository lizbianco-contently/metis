Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                Measure Placed On The Calendar--H.R. 596\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the \ndesk that is due for a second reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title for the \nsecond time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 596) to repeal the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act and health care-related provisions in the \n     Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In order to place the bill on the calendar under the \nprovisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday Democrats voted once again to \nprotect politicians by blocking Homeland Security funding. I do not \nunderstand why they would want to block the Senate from even debating a \nbill to fund Homeland Security. It really does not make sense. You \nwould think our Democratic friends would at least want to give the \nSenate an opportunity to make improvements to the bill, if they want to \nmake such improvements. Why would our friends want to stand tall for \nthe ability of politicians to do things President Obama himself has \ndescribed as ``unwise and unfair''? Why would our friends go to the mat \nto protect the political class from the consequences of ``overreach'' \nthat President Obama himself has referred to as ``ignoring the law''?\n  Well, here is the good news. There is a way forward. There is a way \nto end this Democratic filibuster. All it requires is a little common \nsense and a little Democratic courage. Remember, several Democrats \npreviously indicated unease with the idea of overreaching in ways \nPresident Obama has seemed to imply would ``violate the law.'' So now \nis the time to back up those words. Now is the time for our friends on \nthe other side of good conscience to vote with us to break this party's \nfilibuster of Homeland Security funding and help us protect American \ndemocracy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed to H.R. 240 be \nagreed to and that it be in order for the managers or their designees \nto offer amendments in alternating fashion, with the majority manager \nor his designee being recognized to offer the first amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n\n                   Recognition Of The Minority Leader\n\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is \nbipartisan objection to the request by the majority leader. It is worth \nour spending a minute or two hearing what Republicans Senators have had \nto say in the last few hours.\n  John McCain, the senior Senator from Arizona: Is that the definition \nof insanity, voting on the same bill over and over again?\n  Jim Inhofe: I think three is enough. There is a division within the \nconference on this.\n  Jeff Flake of Arizona: We can go through the motions, sure, but I \ndon't think we are fooling anybody.\n  Another Republican Senator: I wish we could take no for an answer and \nfigure out the next step.\n  Well, what has happened in the last 30 hours? We knew 30 hours ago \nabout ISIS. We have watched their brutality, killing thousands and \nthousands of innocent people, going back, I guess, in memory to the \ndays we thought would never exist again: Tamerlane killing thousands \nand thousands of people those many centuries ago, Genghis\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nKhan killing thousands and thousands of innocent people. ISIS has been \ndoing this, but they have also added some things that we have watched \nnot because we wanted to but because they forced us to: beheadings. \nSomebody kneels down in front of them, and they cut off their head with \na knife. They film that and send it around the world for us to watch.\n  But what happened 30 hours ago? The brutality we thought had reached \nits pinnacle got worse. What ISIS did approximately 30 hours ago is put \na Jordanian pilot in a cage--a cage--dump flammable liquid over that \ncage, and then film that man being burned alive for 22 minutes. We have \nbeen forced to watch that. Yes, ISIS is awful. The worst. Uncivilized. \nBut that is what we are dealing with. We are dealing with that. Now \nRepublicans forced an entirely unnecessary debate.\n  All the papers--not only the Nevada papers, but pick up the New York \nTimes, pick up the Washington Post, and you will see a picture of a \nyoung woman from Nevada. Her name is Blanca Gamez. A young woman now, \nshe came to the United States as a baby--a baby. Because of the \ndirection taken by the President of the United States, this young woman \nand hundreds of thousands of others who dreamed of being able to lead a \ndifferent life are now leading a different life. Blanca has gotten two \ncollege degrees. She is going to law school next year. She works. She \npays taxes. Why in the world are Republicans afraid of Blanca Gamez? \nWhy?\n  It has been said by Martin Heinrich and by Claire McCaskill that it \nappears Republicans in the Senate are more afraid of the DREAMers than \nthey are of ISIS. Well, I know the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, as it relates to appropriations, came to the floor \nyesterday and talked about regular order. I say to my friend that \nregular order in the Senate has a number of different connotations. One \nof them is clear, so clear, and that is why John McCain spoke out, Jeff \nFlake, Jim Inhofe, and others spoke out, because in the Senate we need \nto fund our different subcommittees on appropriations. We have done \nthat, except Homeland Security.\n  We have these terrorist acts all over the world taking place right \nnow. We saw it in Canada. We saw it in Australia, all over the European \nUnion, in Paris. All over. We have had so many frightening things \nhappen. We in the United States of America are in a position where we \nare not going to fund Homeland Security because of Blanca Gamez.\n  We would love to debate immigration. We have done it here on the \nSenate floor before. It was a wonderful bipartisan debate. We are \nwilling to do it again.\n  I am going to offer a consent request. I am going to object to my \nfriend's consent request. That is on the record. I am going to make my \nown consent request. I am going to make a consent request that seems to \nme to be pretty good.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the enactment of the text of \nS. 272, which is the Homeland Security Appropriations Act for this \nyear, 2015, at a time to be determined by Senator McConnell, after \nconsultation with me, but no later than Monday, March 16, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the Border Security, Economic \nOpportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, as passed by the Senate \nby a vote of 68 to 32 on June 27, 2013, the text of which is at the \ndesk. That is my consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an objection to the request of the \nmajority leader.\n  Is there an objection to the request of the Democratic leader?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just a \ncorrection to my good friend the majority leader. There is no \nRepublican opposition to the consent request that the Democratic leader \nobjected to. It is clear on our side. It would allow us to have a fair \namendment process. If there are differences with the House, regular \norder has a remedy. It is called going to conference. None of this is \npossible while the Democrats continue filibustering even getting on the \nbill. So therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me again state words I did not make up. \nJohn McCain--he is actually paraphrasing what Albert Einstein said: The \ndefinition of insanity is someone who keeps doing the same thing over \nand over again and expecting different results.\n  That is what John McCain said. Is that the definition of insanity--\nvoting on the same bill over and over again and expecting a different \nresult?\n  Jim Inhofe: I think three is enough.\n  Jeff Flake: We can go through the motions, sure, but I don't think we \nare fooling anybody.\n  Another Republican said: I wish we could take no for an answer.\n  There is bipartisan support to move forward on a freestanding bill \nthat sends Homeland Security funding directly to the President. We want \nto do that. That is what should be done. That is regular order.\n  If the Presiding Officer and the rest of the Republicans want to come \nand debate immigration, we are willing to do that. That is what my \nconsent request calls for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my good friend the Democratic leader \nreminded me for 8 years, the majority leader always gets the last word. \nSo let me say again that the consent request that I offered, to which \nthe Democratic leader objected, was unanimously approved on our side. \nWhat it would do would be to set up an order for amendments, rotating \nfrom side to side, which is exactly the open amendment process the \nDemocratic leader seems to feel somehow we are preventing. That is \nexactly what I offered. I am not going to propound it again, but I will \njust lay out what it said: to offer amendments in an alternating \nfashion, with the majority manager or his designee being recognized to \noffer the first amendment. We would go back and forth and back and \nforth. So that is about as open as I can imagine. And there were no \nobjections to it on the Republican side. Regardless of how Members who \nare being quoted by the Democratic leader may have observed the overall \nprocess for going forward, there is no objection over here to having \namendments on both sides, alternating from one side to another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. The American people are crying out that we defend our \nhomeland. They are doing it around the rest of the world, why shouldn't \nwe? That is what this is all about.\n  If they want to debate immigration, go ahead and debate immigration \nbut not on the back of Homeland Security, leaving it totally naked and \nnot giving us the ability to do what needs to be done to protect our \nhomeland.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is a bipartisan desire to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security, and I am sure we will resolve this sometime in the \nnext few weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the leadership time \nis reserved.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 11:30 a.m. will be equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Calendar of Business has been put on \nthe desk of Senators. The Calendar of Business makes reference on page \n12 to S. 272.\n  That is a bill that has been introduced by Senator Shaheen of New \nHampshire, who is on the floor and is the ranking member of the \nAppropriations subcommittee responsible for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, as well as Senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, who is the \nranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.\n  On page 128 is the answer to our dilemma. This solves our problem.\n  S. 272 is a bill that is going to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity for the remainder of this year. This Department that we count \non every minute of every day to protect America will receive all the \nfunds they need and they will receive them almost immediately because \nthere is no debate between the House and the Senate about how much to \nsend the Department. The debate comes down to all the other extraneous \nmatters which\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\nthe House Republicans added to this bill.\n  So if we are looking for a solution to the problem, I thank the \nSenator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Maryland. We have page \n12, S 272.\n  What the Senate heard just a few moments ago from our Democratic \nleader is something none of us will ever get out of our minds. \nImagine--imagine--this Jordanian pilot captured by ISIS, put in a cage, \ncovered with flammable fluids, liquids. They started a fire and burned \nhim to death.\n  The King of Jordan was visiting the Capitol when that horrible news \ncame out and rushed back to be with his countrymen. He has now vowed \nthat Jordan, which has played a judicial role in trying to find peace \nin the Middle East, is now dedicated to stopping ISIS even more.\n  So if ISIS thought they were going to break the resolve of the King \nof Jordan and the Jordanian people, exactly the opposite occurred. If \nISIS is resolute in their barbarity, we need to be resolute in \nprotecting our country. To think that we are caught up in this \npolitical debate over immigration, the President's actions, and not \nfunding the Department of Homeland Security is disgraceful.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security came to our \nlunch just 1 or 2 days ago and he said: Trying to operate this \nDepartment, the Department of Homeland Security, with this temporary \nfunding is like trying to drive a car with a gas tank that only holds 5 \ngallons and you don't know where the next gas station is going to be.\n  That is what he is up against. So the Department of Homeland Security \nis unable to fund critical, necessary investments.\n  So what is the issue? What is the political issue that is so \nimportant to the Republicans that they would stop the funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security? Well, I will say what the lead issue \nis. The lead issue is DREAMers.\n  Fourteen years ago I introduced the DREAM Act that said if you were \nbrought to America as a child--a toddler, an infant, a small child by \nyour family--and they didn't file the papers so you could be legal in \nAmerica, and you knew grew up in this country and had no serious \nproblems in your background, graduated from high school and wanted to \nbe part of America, we would give you a chance. You would get a chance \nat the dream. Oh, you have to go on to school beyond high school or \nenlist in our military, and we will put you on the path to legal \nstatus. We couldn't pass that despite 14 years of efforts. It would \npass in the Senate, not in the House, and so forth.\n  Finally, President Obama stepped up 2\\1/2\\ years ago and said: OK. \nThere are about 2 million young people in America--just like this--\nbrought to the country when they were kids, and now they want a chance \nto work here, to live here, and to even go to school here without fear \nof deportation.\n  He created something called DACA. The DACA Program allowed them to \nregister, pay their fees, and be protected from deportation--600,000 \nsigned up, 35,000 in the State of Illinois.\n  They signed up so they could get protection from deportation. The \nHouse Republicans and the Republicans in the Senate have insisted we \ndeport these young people. I wish to give the story of one of these \nyoung people very quickly because I know there are other Senators \nseeking recognition.\n  This is Everardo Arias. He was brought to the United States from \nMexico in 1997 at the age of 7. He grew up in Costa Mesa, CA. He was an \noutstanding student in school. He dreamed of being a doctor. It was not \nuntil he applied to college that he realized his immigration status \nmade that next to impossible. He was accepted at the University of \nCalifornia, Riverside, but because he was undocumented he didn't \nqualify for a penny of Federal assistance to get through school.\n  When he was a sophomore, he met with a counselor to ask him: How am I \ngoing to get to medical school? The counselor told him: You can't go to \nmedical school. You are undocumented in the United States of America.\n  He didn't give up. He did not give up. In 2012 he graduated from the \nUniversity of California, Riverside, with a chemistry major and \nresearch honors. Then a miracle occurred. President Obama issued an \nExecutive order called DACA and Everardo Arias was given a chance to \nsign up for protection with this Presidential order and he did.\n  After he received this DACA protection, Everardo worked for 1 year as \na mentor for at-risk kids in his own hometown of Costa Mesa. The \nfollowing year, through AmeriCorps, Everardo worked as a health \neducator with seven local clinics, volunteering and working through \nAmeriCorps with some of the poorest people in his community.\n  During his year as a health educator, he decided now, with the \nprotection of DACA, to apply to go to medical school. Everardo Arias is \nin his first year at Loyola University in Chicago, Stritch School of \nMedicine. He is one of seven protected by DACA who had a chance to go \nto school, but there is a catch. Loyola University said: You can go to \nmedical school here, but for every year you are in medical school, you \nhave to promise to give 1 year of your professional life working with \nthe poorest people in my home State of Illinois, in small towns and \nrural areas as well as big cities, and he agreed to it.\n  He has a giving, caring heart. He agreed to it, to finish medical \nschool, and to give the years of service necessary to the poorest \npeople in my State.\n  Why do the Republicans want to deport Everardo Arias. Why do they \nwant to take this outstanding individual who has struggled and \nsucceeded in life, who knows no other country but America, and deport \nhim to Mexico?\n  Will we be a better nation if this young man is not a doctor? Will we \nbe a better country if he is not given a chance to give back?\n  This is what he wrote to me in a letter about this DACA Program which \nthe Republicans want to abolish. Everardo wrote:\n\n       DACA changed my life. It opened the door to the future \n     ahead of me. If it weren't for DACA I would not be here and I \n     probably would not have pursued medicine. I'm blessed to have \n     the opportunity to do what I love to do and to give back to \n     the country that has given me so much.\n\n  We are a nation of immigrants. Immigrants have come to this country \nand made it what it is. We should never forget that. This is the latest \ngeneration of immigrants who want to give back to America and make us a \nstronger nation. Why the Republicans are opposed to giving them that \nopportunity, I cannot understand. They clearly have not met these young \nmen and women. If they did, their feelings would change.\n  So let's debate. Let's have the debate on DACA but not at the expense \nof the appropriations for this Department.\n  Page 12 of the Senate Calendar, S. 272, offered by Senator Shaheen \nand Senator Mikulski is our answer, a clean bill to fund America to \nprotect against terrorism and, as the Democratic leader suggested, then \nstart the debate on immigration. That is the right thing to do for our \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in light of the eloquent remarks from the \nassistant Democratic leader who is my friend, I hope he will listen \ncarefully to the proposal I am about to outline.\n  In just over 3 weeks the law that funds the Department of Homeland \nSecurity will expire, jeopardizing the Department's ability to carry \nout its critical mission. Legislation to provide funding to the \nDepartment throughout the remainder of this fiscal year has passed the \nHouse and is awaiting action in the Senate, but progress has stalled. \nThe Democrats have blocked it from even being considered because it is \nnot a clean bill.\n  On my side of the aisle House Republicans have insisted that \nprovisions remain in the bill directing the administration to spend no \nfunds implementing a series of Presidential orders issued over the past \nfew years.\n  The Senate has held two votes this week to try to begin debate on \nthis bill, both of which have failed on near-party lines. Thus, we have \nreached an impasse.\n  In an attempt to find a path forward, yesterday I filed an amendment \nin the nature of a substitute that would accomplish three goals. First, \nit would ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is fully \nfunded to perform its vital mission to protect our\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\npeople. Second, it would allow the Senate to go on record in strong \nopposition to the President's extraordinarily broad immigration \nExecutive order issued last November. Third, it would protect the \nDREAMers whom Senator Durbin just talked about.\n  I wish to go back to the November Executive order. This particular \nExecutive order represents a misuse of the President's authority that \nthreatens to undermine the separation of powers doctrine in our \nConstitution. As the President himself has said more than 20 times, he \ndoes not have the authority to expand the law in this manner. He made \nthe exact point in remarks of July 2011 when he said:\n\n       I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books. . . . Now, \n     I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the \n     laws on my own. . . . But that's not how our system works. \n     That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our \n     Constitution is written.\n\n  The President was exactly right when he stated that reality. The \nsubstitute I proposed would block the sweeping 2014 Executive order, \nbut it does not overturn the more limited Executive orders from past \nyears.\n  Specifically, my amendment would not undo the 2012 deferred action \nprogram that allowed DREAMers, young people brought to the United \nStates by their parents years ago, to receive legal status as long as \nthey meet certain requirements.\n  The House bill includes a controversial amendment, which I do not \nsupport, that would invalidate this 2012 program retroactively.\n  My substitute accomplishes my third goal of protecting these children \nwho have grown up here, who speak English, have clean criminal records, \nand often know no other country. They did not make the choice to come \nto America. That decision was made by their parent or parents.\n  My substitute amendment, therefore, is straightforward. First, the \namendment mirrors the underlying bill with respect to the funding \nlevels provided to the Department of Homeland Security so it can carry \nout its functions. Ironically, there is no dispute over those funding \nlevels. Second, it strikes the House provision restricting the \nexpenditure of funds to implement the DREAMers Program that I described \nand that Senator Durbin just commented on.\n  And third, it retains the House prohibition on expenditures to fund \nthe President's unauthorized action on immigration announced in \nNovember of last year.\n  Now, let me make clear that Congress should consider comprehensive \nimmigration reform. The fact that there are now an estimated 11 million \nillegal immigrants in the United States is irrefutable evidence that \nour immigration and border security systems are badly broken. That is \nwhy I supported the bipartisan immigration reform bill that passed the \nSenate in 2013.\n  While I was disappointed that immigration reform legislation of some \nsort did not become law, I reject the notion that its failure can serve \nas the justification for the action taken by the President last \nNovember. He cannot do by Executive fiat what Congress refused to pass, \nregardless of the wisdom of Congress's decision. Such unilateral action \nis contrary to how our constitutional system is supposed to work, and \nit risks undermining the separation of powers doctrine, which is \ncentral to our constitutional framework.\n  Our Constitution vests the power to make law in the legislative \nbranch--with Congress--not with the President. To the President it \nassigns the obligation to take care that the laws are faithfully \nexecuted. That was the rule used by the Supreme Court in 1952 in the \nfamous Youngstown Sheet & Tubing case that overturned President \nTruman's Executive Order nationalizing the steel industry to prevent a \nstrike during the Korean War.\n  As the Court explained, the President's power to faithfully execute \nthe laws does not make him a lawmaker. The Court said:\n\n       (T)he Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking \n     process to the recommending of laws that he thinks wise and \n     the vetoing of laws he thinks bad.\n\n  In other words, the President is not free to pick and choose among \nlaws, enforcing the ones that he likes and ignoring the ones that he \ndoesn't.\n  The President is fully aware of this fact. He has often made the \npoint that he could go no further than to protect the DREAMers. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       Congress has said ``here is the law'' when it comes to \n     those who are undocumented. . . . What we can do is to carve \n     out the DREAM Act, saying young people who have basically \n     grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. . . . But \n     if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be \n     ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very \n     difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option.\n\n  Those are the President's own words. The action taken by the \nPresident in November is a direct contradiction to his own statements. \nBy acting unilaterally, ironically, the President is making it less \nlikely that Congress will act to pass comprehensive reforms. He is \nundermining the efforts of those of us who favor immigration reform by \ndiverting energy and attention from that goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to give consideration to the proposed compromise \nthat I filed as a substitute yesterday. It will ensure that the men and \nwomen on the front lines of the Department of Homeland Security can do \ntheir vitally important jobs, it will overturn the President's misuse \nof his Executive authority last November, and it will protect the legal \nstatus of children brought to this country by their parents years ago.\n  Mr. President, I believe I have put forth a reasonable, constructive \ncompromise that could get us out of this impasse that is such a \ndisservice to so many. I hope my colleagues will join together and \nsupport the substitute I have proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I want to compliment once again my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Maine. She is always looking for a \ncompromise. She is always looking to try to work in a constructive way. \nWhile I don't appreciate the results she has asked for--which I will \ntalk about in a second--I always appreciate her efforts.\n  We have a very simple position here. It is a position that is \nlogical. It is a position that even Republicans, as Leader Reid has \nmentioned, have talked about: Pass a clean homeland security bill and \nthen go to the floor and debate amendments. Debate the amendment of \nSenator Collins, debate the amendment of Senator Cruz, and debate any \nimmigration amendments you want.\n  To repeat, we will not be held hostage. The American people don't \nwant a gun to their head, particularly when it involves security, to \ndebate immigration. We know that. We know what the junior Senator from \nTexas is doing. Everyone on the other side knows it; and, of course, we \nare not going to go along.\n  So my dear friend from Maine comes up with a new solution. It is \nstill hostage taking because it is attached to funding the Homeland \nSecurity bill. We are now only debating the size of the ransom. We will \nnot do it. We are not going to be pressured, be bullied into doing this \nor that immigration reform as a price to funding Homeland Security.\n  Homeland Security is too vital to America. It is too vital to our \ncountry. It is not the way legislating should work. My dear colleagues \non the other side should have learned this lesson a year and a half ago \nwhen they threatened to shut down the government unless they got their \nway. No matter how deeply they feel about the substance, they lose.\n  The junior Senator from Texas is leading his Republican colleagues at \nbest into a cul-de-sac and at worst over a cliff, and I don't think \nthey want to follow. But the House is in a box and says: Show us the \nSenate won't pass the bill. Well, we won't. We are not into hostage \ntaking, we are not into being bullied, and we are not into legislating \nwith a gun to our heads. And my guess is the White House would not \nsupport anything like this either.\n  So I say to my dear Republican friends, go back to the drawing board. \nYou control the Senate. You are in charge. It is your responsibility to \nfind a way out of this. Our way is simple, as Leader Reid outlined. \nFirst, pass a clean Homeland Security bill to protect our security, and \nthen place on the floor immigration. We welcome the debate. We welcome \nthe debate on the\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\namendment of Senator Cruz. We welcome debate on the amendment of \nSenator Collins--but not as a hostage taker. Again, all Senator Collins \nis doing is saying what the size of the ransom is, but we are still \ndoing hostage taking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to encourage the Senate to start \ndebate on H.R. 240, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations \nAct of 2015. I am puzzled by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who insist on blocking debate on this bill, particularly after \nmany of those individuals criticized the majority for spending 3 weeks \non the Keystone XL bill.\n  This body has a constitutional obligation to consider appropriations \nbills. As a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee, I understand the important role that the Department \nof Homeland Security plays in protecting our Nation at its borders and \nin our communities. As the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I \nalso understand the substantial amount of resources it takes to fund \nCustoms and Border Protection, FEMA, Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement, the Coast Guard, and TSA.\n  It was not all that long ago, President Obama criticized \nCongressional Republicans by saying it was time to, ``get out of the \nhabit of governing by crisis.'' Well, here we are just shy of a month \nbefore funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires. This \nbill has already passed the House with substantial support and now the \nSenate has the time to debate it, amend it, and pass it. However, \nnobody will get a chance to offer amendments unless our colleagues join \nus in allowing debate to begin on this bill.\n  I also believe President Obama acted unconstitutionally with his \nExecutive actions on immigration last year. A number of my colleagues \nfeel the same way and this bill is an opportunity for the Senate to \ndebate and fix this administration's failure to enforce the law.\n  I do not buy the arguments that the Senate should consider its own \nbill to fund the Department. I would like to take this time to remind \nmy colleagues that the Constitution requires revenue and spending bills \nto originate in the House. Why not call up the House bill and then \noffer our own amendments?\n  It is important that the Senate continue the regular order that \nrejuvenated this body with the start of the 114th Congress. I have long \nspoken on the merits of considering bills, amending bills, and passing \nbills under regular order. It is a process that our constituents demand \nand it is one that makes the Senate a healthier institution.\n  I for one do not wish to play chicken with the Department that keeps \nour skies safe, protects our borders and enforces a substantial body of \nFederal law. This is why I encourage my colleagues to move forward with \ndebate on this bill at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask to be notified after 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the key part of the President's unlawful \nexecutive amnesty, the overwhelming majority of it that actually is \ninvolved in the House bill, deals with adults and providing them work \npermits. It is not about the young people, as has been discussed. It \ninvolves 4 million-plus people.\n  We have talked at length about the President's executive action and \nhow he is unlawfully, unconstitutionally making law--Senator Collins \nlaid that out--when only Congress can make law. We have shown that the \nlaw he has created is law that he proposed and that Congress \nspecifically rejected. We have shown that the President himself has at \nleast 20 times said he does not have the power to take this action, \nrightly declaring he is not an emperor--those are his words--and that \nCongress makes laws.\n  So now Senator McConnell has moved to bring up the House-passed \nlegislation that fully funds all lawful aspects of the Department of \nHomeland Security and all its lawful actions to protect the homeland. \nBut the legislation has a provision in it that simply bars the \nPresident from spending any money to execute his unlawful Executive \ndirections. It stops the Department of Homeland Security from outlaw \nactivities. This is a matter of great constitutional importance.\n  It is, in addition, a matter of great importance to working \nAmericans. What the President is doing is giving lawful status to over \n4 million adults--persons who entered our country against the law or \ncame in and overstayed their time. These persons, under current law, \ncannot be hired by any business or employer, but the President wants \nthem to work anyway.\n  Congress considered and rejected this plan. The result is that the \nPresident's plan will be a further kick in the teeth to down and \nstruggling American workers. The facts are clear. I am not seeing them \ndisputed.\n  Median family income since the recession of 2007 to 2009 has declined \nby almost $5,000. This is a catastrophic event. This is unbelievable \ndamage to America's middle-class workers. Such a decline is \nunprecedented since the Great Depression 80 years ago. While some say \njobs and wages are recovering and we can stop worrying about that, the \nfacts show otherwise. In addition to depressed incomes, America has the \nlowest percentage of persons in their working years who are actually \nworking in nearly 40 years.\n  So consider this. There were huge worker layoffs during the 2009 \nrecession, and many more had their hours reduced as a result of \nObamaCare and other events.\n  There are other factors that combine to reveal that job and wage \nconditions are much worse than the unemployment rates would indicate.\n  Despite these problems--a slow economy, job-killing automation, and \nlow wages--the President is carrying out his unlawful plan rejected by \nCongress that we give 5 million persons unlawfully here legal status--a \nSocial Security number, a photo ID, and the right to take any job that \nmay be available in America. The President's policies are in perfect \naccord with those of his nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch. \nWhen I asked her this simple question last week, I got a surprising \nanswer.\n  Question:\n\n       Who has more right to a job in this country? A lawful \n     immigrant who's here, or citizen--or a person who entered the \n     country unlawfully?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one \n     that's shared by everyone in this country regardless of how \n     they came here. And certainly, if someone is here, regardless \n     of status, I would prefer that they would be participating in \n     the workplace than not participating in the workplace.\n\n  That is the testimony last week by the chief law enforcement officer \nin the land who is supposed to be enforcing the laws of the country. \nThat is her view of who should be working: Regardless of how you came \nhere, you are entitled to work and apparently take any job in America.\n  This was a moment of inadvertent candor. She tried to modify that \nlater, I acknowledge, but essentially all she said was: Well, I don't \nthink anybody should work except those the President says should work--\nand that would include the 5 million who are here unlawfully.\n  Let's be clear. These 5 million persons, with their new government-\nissued documents, will be able to apply for and take any of the few \njobs now available in the economy. Sadly, the problem in America is not \ntoo few workers, but too few jobs. Last year, the administration \ncelebrated the creation of over 2 million jobs. The President's actions \nwould create from unlawful immigration over twice that many workers in \none single amnesty act. Millions more Americans who lost jobs during \nthe recession still haven't found work today.\n  Is this the right thing to do? I don't think so, and neither do the \nAmerican people--by a wide margin. But, arrogantly, the President \nrefuses to listen to the legitimate concerns of hurting Americans. He \ndismisses them, and supported by his palace guards in the Senate who \nblocked legislation----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and will wrap up and save some time \nfor Senator Hoeven.\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\n  He pushes on to advance the interests of immigration activists, \npolitical consultants lusting after votes for the next election, and \nbig business interests lusting after low wage labor. Businesses, who \nhave become so transnational that their interests and those of the \nAmerican workers are often incompatible.\n  President Obama supports these business interests. But I ask: Who \nrepresents the interests of dutiful American citizens and the lawful \nimmigrant who followed the rules? Who is speaking out for their \ninterests? They are the ones who are forgotten.\n  I am going to make a prediction: Their voices are going to be heard. \nNo longer, in secret, will the legitimate wishes of good and decent \nAmericans be denied. The people's voice will be heard. The day of the \nspecial-interest operatives, tone-deaf politicians, and those who would \nallow this--their voices will end. This time, the American people will \nget what they rightly demand--the protection of the laws already on the \nbooks. They will force the political class to end the massive \nlawlessness, and to produce an immigration system that serves the \nnational interests, not the special interests. They will force these \nself-interested forces out of the seats of power and demand policies \nthat protect their wages, their jobs, their national security, and \ntheir government budgets.\n  I thank the Chair. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this, and \nI hope, when we vote soon, our colleagues will recognize it is time to \nconsider the opportunities Senator Collins has said will be provided \nhere--to have amendments and to go forth and do the right thing for the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, both from Alabama \nand from Maine, for coming down to the floor and saying: Let's do the \nwork of the Senate. Let's advance to this Department of Homeland \nSecurity bill, let's offer amendments, let's have the debate. Let's \nfund the Department.\n  But let's make sure we do it in the right way, and where we protect \nthe checks and balances built into this government by our forefathers.\n  For the last few days I have come to the floor to call attention to \nthe importance of voting ``yes'' on the motion to proceed to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill for 2015--H.R. 240.\n  I wish that weren't the case. I had hoped that by now we would be \nmuch closer to passing a funding bill for the Department; that the \nSenate would have proceeded to the DHS appropriations bill, and that we \ncould begin the process of debate, of considering amendments, and of \ndeveloping consensus--of getting our work done.\n  Yet here we are on the third day, just trying to proceed to funding \nthe Department of Homeland Security--a Department that everyone agrees \nis vital.\n  That is what this bill does: It funds the Department fully and \ncompletely, and it does it in the right way by enforcing the law.\n  I don't have to tell my colleagues that the defining attributes of \nthe Senate come from the Senators' ability to debate and to amend \nlegislation. Debate and amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I certainly want to give my colleague time to finish \nhis remarks. I just want to make sure there would be an opportunity for \nme to also speak before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be advised there is 9 minutes \n54 seconds remaining.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. That is fine. Thank you.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I would be willing to defer in the order \ntoo if my colleague from New Hampshire prefers to go, and I can follow; \neither way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I wish to thank the Senator from the great State of New \nHampshire.\n  Debate and amendment. Debate and amendment. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n  We are talking about going to this bill that funds the Department of \nHomeland Security and having the debate and offering amendments. That \nis what I am asking for. That is what we need in order to address the \nissues such as the one that my good friend and colleague from New \nHampshire raised on Tuesday. She is the ranking member on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee of the Department of Homeland Security. She \nmade a request in terms of a parliamentary point of order--budget point \nof order--and she made the inquiry. It is a valid point of order, one \nthat can and should be debated, and we should have the opportunity to \nvote on it. But we can't vote on it unless we proceed to the bill. So \nlet's proceed to the bill. Let's have that debate. Bring up the point \nof order, and let's have a vote. And let's have amendments. That is how \nwe do our work in the Senate.\n  But despite the best efforts of Republicans to provide that \nopportunity for debate by proceeding to this bill to move forward, we \nare met with no's from the other side of the aisle. In essence, we are \nbeing filibustered--a tactic that was decried as obstructionist in the \nprevious Congress.\n  In case my friends on the other side of the aisle think this is going \nunnoticed, they should check the headlines. Look no further than an \narticle from CNN on Tuesday: ``Democrats block funding for DHS to \nprotect Obama immigration orders.''\n  Or the Washington Times: ``Democrats filibuster DHS spending bill, \nblock GOP on amnesty debate.''\n  These headlines speak to a central flaw in the arguments of those who \nsay we need a DHS bill, but then vote against this Senate proceeding to \nthat very bill.\n  On the one hand, they are saying we need a bill, but they won't go to \nthe funding bill that is here before us. That is exactly what we are \nvoting and trying to do, is to proceed to the DHS funding bill--with an \namendment process, with open debate.\n  Yesterday, one of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nstated that if the Senate takes up H.R. 240, the homeland security \nappropriations bill, it would simply be a delaying tactic.\n  Well, how can moving to the bill that directly addresses the DHS \nfunding issue constitute delay? In order to pass the DHS funding bill, \nwe have to be allowed to proceed to the bill. The truth, of course, is \nthe delay is in fact coming from those who won't allow us to take up \nthe bill, debate it, and consider amendments and pass it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, in a few minutes the Senate is going to \nhave yet another procedural vote on the Department of Homeland Security \nfunding bill.\n  The bill before us, the House-passed version of the funding bill, \ncan't become law. We have already heard the President reaffirm \nyesterday that he is going to veto the House-passed bill before us. \nThat means we could face a shutdown of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  At this point, given the threats from terrorism, given the work that \nis done by the Department of Homeland Security, that is not a tenable \nposition to begin.\n  Let me say, I very much appreciate the efforts of my colleague from \nmy neighboring State of Maine, the senior Senator from Maine, Senator \nCollins. But the amendment she has put forward still raises some \nserious concerns about the impact on our security, because it includes \nlanguage that would defund all of the Department of Homeland Security \ndirectives from November 20, 2014. So it would defund those provisions \nthat direct law enforcement officers to place top priority on national \nsecurity threats, convicted felons, gang members, illegal entrants \napprehended at the border. It also defunds the southern border and \napproaches campaign which establishes three joint task forces to reduce \nthe terrorism risk to the Nation. And, as she has indicated, it defunds \nthe deferred action programs.\n  While she suggested that it would allow the 2012 Executive action \nthat refers to the DREAMers to stay in place,\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\nit raises serious questions about whether USCIS could effectively \nprocess renewables of those DREAMers--such as the young man whom \nSenator Durbin spoke so eloquently about--so who knows what the court \naction could be on that.\n  While I appreciate the effort, I don't think it adequately addresses \nthe concerns we have in the Democratic caucus, that we need to pass a \nclean bill. We need to have a separate debate about immigration.\n  The Presiding Officer worked very hard 2 years ago to help us get a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill that most of us didn't agree with \neverything in it, but most of us supported. We are happy to have that \ndebate, but what we need now is a clean bill--one that allows the \nfunding for the Department of Homeland Security to go forward.\n  I noticed on the news this morning, one of the issues that is at risk \nin this debate over whether we are going to support funding for the \nDepartment and the security of this Nation versus an ideological \nobjection to the President--this morning one of the lead items on the \nnews had to do with the cyber security breach at Anthem, the second \nlargest health insurance company in the country. I happen to have my \nhealth insurance through Anthem, so I paid particular attention to \nthis.\n  But one of the things that is in this clean bill that was agreed to \nlast December by Senator Mikulski and Congressman Rogers was funding \nfor the cyber security center within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to address the next-generation threat to our cyber networks.\n  That is critical funding we need if we are going to intercept the \nkinds of breaches we saw with Anthem and heard about this morning. Yet \nthat funding is at risk because there is not agreement to get a clean \nbill done to fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  What we have heard from almost everybody who has spoken is: We agree \nwe should fund the Department of Homeland Security; we agree to the \ndollar levels that are in that bill; we agree to making sure the safety \nand security of this country should be paramount. We have heard a \nnumber of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle and from the \nHouse who have said ultimately this is about getting a clean bill. So \nwe should do that now. We should provide certainty, we should get this \ndone, and we should stop having an ideological debate about whether we \nare going to support immigration and the President, or whether we are \ngoing to support the safety and security of this Nation.\n  I think we should all be able to agree that the safety and security \nof America comes first. We should get this clean bill done, and then we \ncan go on and debate immigration reform.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I think it is worth noting some of the great work done \nby the Department of Homeland Security, which interfaces with the \nAmerican people more than any other department.\n  Every day Customs and Border Protection processes nearly 1 million \ntravelers entering the United States and seizes 19,000 pounds of \nillegal drugs between the ports of entry. The Transportation Security \nAdministration--the people who work at our airports--screen 2 million \npassengers and their baggage. The Coast Guard patrols 3.4 million \nsquare miles of U.S. waterways and conducts 54 search and rescue \nmissions that save lives annually.\n  Every day FEMA provides $3.7 million in Federal disaster grants to \nindividuals and households and provides $22 million to States and local \ncommunities for disaster response and recovery. Every day the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Training Center trains 8,000 officers from across the \ncountry. This work is just too important for our security to be delayed \nor disrupted because of ideological reasons concerning immigration \nreform.\n  We need to pass a clean, full-year Homeland Security funding bill. We \nneed to pass it without controversial riders, and I hope we will do \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 240, making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2015.\n         Mitch McConnell, Thad Cochran, Tom Cotton, Roger F. \n           Wicker, David Vitter, Jerry Moran, Daniel Coats, \n           Michael B.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 240, an act making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2015, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 52, \nthe nays are 47.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I enter a motion to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, Republicans in the Senate are ready to \nbegin debating the bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. \nBut in order to do that, we must first vote to proceed to the bill, and \nDemocrats have blocked us from doing that. They have done that yet \nagain today.\n  This is simply a procedural vote, but it is a very important \nprocedural vote. It is a threshold vote, without which other votes \ncannot and will not occur.\n  Voting yes on a motion to proceed to this bill doesn't mean you \nsupport the bill. Regardless of which way you vote, it doesn't signal \nwhich way you lean on the underlying merits of this bill. It doesn't \nmean you support this or that amendment. It simply means you are \nwilling to engage in an open, transparent, and public debate about the \nfuture of Homeland Security and about making sure the Department \ncharged with this task is funded.\n  Why would our friends across the aisle be afraid of that? Some may \nargue that they voted against proceeding to this bill somehow because \nthey support funding Homeland Security, but that is not true. This bill\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nfunds Homeland Security. Why then are my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle voting against proceeding to this bill?\n  Well, the difference that might be found is that many of them also \nsupport the President's incredibly unpopular and controversial action \nto grant amnesty to 5 million illegals who are here illegally inside \nthe United States, individuals who will now be eligible for work \npermits and in some cases entitlement benefits. But the American people \ndo not support that. They certainly do not support the action the \nPresident took and the way he did it. They oppose the way President \nObama went around Congress. They oppose the fact that President Obama \nignored the law. They oppose the damage this policy will do to American \nworkers who are already struggling to find work and remain employed. \nThey oppose the crisis this kind of action is creating and will \ncontinue to create at the border, as we saw last summer with so many \nchildren making that dangerous trip to get into the country and to do \nit the wrong way, to get here illegally.\n  Now that the American people have put Republicans in charge, in the \nmajority, in the Senate, we are trying to keep our promise to them, to \ndo what they sent us here to do, and to hold a vote on President \nObama's action in this regard. But the Democrats seem to be reluctant \nto take that vote. They seem to not want to take it. Perhaps they are \nafraid of it; I do not know. Maybe that is why they refuse to even \nbegin consideration of this bill, plain and simple. This effort to try \nto hide from the American people is embarrassing, and it is wrong.\n  My friends across the aisle may say that they have an alternative \nbill and that we should pass their alternative bill immediately. There \nare at least two problems with this approach.\n  First, that may have been the way the Senate functioned under the \nprevious majority--writing bills in back rooms, waiting until the last \nminute to make bills public, then filling the tree, which means making \nit impossible for anyone to amend the bill once it gets to the floor, \nhaving virtually no debate, and then ramming the bill through without \nany input from the American people, without adequate debate here, \nwithout virtually any debate here. That is not the way the Senate is \nsupposed to work. That is not the way the Senate does work and will \ncontinue to work under the Republican majority.\n  Second, traditionally appropriations bills do not start in the \nSenate. In fact, the House has not considered a Senate-originated \nappropriations bill for over 100 years--since at least 1901, the period \nfor which these kinds of records are readily available. Unfortunately \nfor them, the bill the Democrats want is not supported in the House. \nWhy? Well, precisely because it is not supported by the American \npeople.\n  It is time to stop delaying democracy. It is time to stop hiding from \nthe American people. It is time to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It is time to have this debate and this discussion about the \nPresident's actions--actions that many people regard as unlawful, \nactions that people have different feelings about as far as the \nunderlying policies but that the overwhelming majority of the American \npeople look at and say: Look, even if I like the underlying policy \nhere, I do not like the way the President did it.\n  If the President does not like the law, he needs to change the law. \nThe way to change the law under our constitutional system is to go to \nCongress and to get something passed through Congress. Ours is not a \ngovernment of one; ours is a government in which we have two entities \nwithin Congress that are charged with making the law. The President \ncannot act alone.\n  So my plea to my colleagues, particularly those across the aisle, is \nlet's have a vote and then let's have a debate. When we have a vote and \nwe have a debate, we will get to the point where we can fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and keep our Nation safe. We should not \nbe keeping these important programs--we should not be holding them back \nsimply out of a desire to protect the President and his actions that \nare outside the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S810-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEE.

Madam President, I rise to urge my colleagues to pass a \nclean appropriations bill that funds the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS. Listening to my friend the Senator from Utah, it is very \nclear that the Republicans' position on this bill that is before us \ntoday is totally dependent on their assertion that the President's \nrecent actions on immigration are illegal. Democrats do not concur with \nthat. In fact, I thought illegality of any actions should be determined \nby courts of law. What the President did recently is no different from \nlike Presidential actions taken by Presidents Reagan and Bush, I might \nadd. So we must fund DHS and resist the temptation to govern though \nmanufactured crises and political games. Our national security is at \nstake.\n  Surely my colleagues remember when DHS was created in direct response \nto the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Just 11 days after 9/\n11, DHS started to take shape. President George W. Bush named Gov. Tom \nRidge to lead an office to oversee and coordinate a comprehensive and \nnational strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism and \nrespond to any future attacks.\n  DHS's mission is to protect our homeland, as its name makes perfectly \nclear. DHS is responsible for border security and immigration \nenforcement. It is tasked with keeping our airports safe through TSA, \nwith emergency management response through FEMA, and protecting our \ncoasts through the Coast Guard.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, I know how important the work DHS \ndoes is in keeping our Nation safe. Let's take a step back and remember \nwhy DHS was created in the first place and what their mission is. Why \nshould we play politics with the Department that exists to protect \nAmerica?\n  DHS's funding runs out at the end of this month. The clock is \nticking. The nearly 200,000 who work for DHS do not want us spending \nvaluable time scoring political points; they want the certainty that \ntheir important work will be funded by Congress. If the Department is \nnot funded by the end of the month, we probably will once again resort \nto passing a continuing resolution to keep the Department going. A \ncontinuing resolution is only a stopgap; it is a waste of time and \nmoney.\n  DHS Secretary Johnson said: Operating in a stop-and-go cycle of \ncontinuing resolutions is like trying to drive a car across the country \non no more than 5 gallons of gas at a time and without knowing the \ndistance to the next gas station.\n  Of the nearly 200,000 DHS employees across the country, 2,000 are \nbased in Hawaii. Nobody will get paid if DHS gets shut down. Some will \nbe furloughed, while many others will be forced, as essential \nemployees, to continue showing up for work without pay. We count on the \nCoast Guard, the TSA, Customs, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices--which are all part of the DHS--to be on the job every day.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues insist that before we fund the \ncritical work of Homeland Security, we must first undo the President's \ncommonsense immigration actions that helped millions of families across \nthe country. The House bill before us holds DHS funding hostage to make \npolitical points against the President. This is a manufactured \nstandoff.\n  The House bill attacks undocumented persons who have American-born \nchildren. Those are U.S. citizen children. The President's actions \nenabled these families to step out of the shadows, pass background \nchecks, pay their taxes, and work in the open without the daily threat \nof deportation.\n  The House bill attacks DREAMers, the students who have been helped \nthrough the DACA problem for nearly 3 years. Just yesterday President \nObama met with six DREAMers in the Oval Office who represent some of \nthe very\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\nbest our country has to offer. The House bill says to these DREAMers: \nYou, too, like the parents of U.S.-born children, should live under the \ndaily threat of deportation. There are 600,000 DREAMers in the DACA \nProgram throughout the country.\n  The House bill reverses longstanding enforcement priorities and \ndirectives that DHS has implemented. These directives tell immigration \nenforcement officers to focus on the bad guys rather than on the moms, \nthe dads, and other contributing members of our communities. The House \nbill, in removing all administrative discretion on who should be \ndeported, in effect says that all 12 million undocumented persons in \nour country can be deported. This is totally unrealistic and \nunnecessary.\n  I stand with my colleagues who are ready and willing to come together \nto pass bipartisan immigration reform. We did that last Congress with \n68 bipartisan votes. As Republican Senator Heller said recently, the \nHouse bill that is before us ``only includes language that complicates \nthe process of finding a solution when it comes to immigration \nreform.''\n  This House bill emphasizes a policy of mass deportation that would \nharm our economy, costing trillions in economic loss, not to mention \nthe devastating impact on the people. Economists have told us that \ncomprehensive immigration reform will provide an enormous boost to our \neconomy, helping all workers across the country.\n  The House bill does not reform our system. The House bill does not \nhelp millions of students and families come out of the shadows. It does \nnot provide more resources to our hard-working Border Patrol agents. It \ndoes not help those who have been stuck in our visa backlog for \ndecades.\n  Rather than debating comprehensive immigration reform, the House has \nonce again ducked the issue, this time holding DHS hostage so that a \nsmall minority of their colleagues can have their way. This is like \n``Groundhog Day''--a repeat scenario that brings us continuing \nresolutions to keep government going in a stop-and-go fashion and \nindeed a scenario that brought us the government shutdown in 2013. We \ndo not have to keep repeating failed scenarios. Let's bring a clean DHS \nfunding bill to the floor. Let's get that done and then move on to a \ndebate on comprehensive immigration reform that is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 2 days ago ABC ran a story on its \n``Nightline'' program that brought to light issues with the immigrant \ninvestor program. This program is also known as EB-5. This immigration \nprogram was created by Congress in 1990. It was created to stimulate \nthe U.S. economy through job creation and capital investment by foreign \ninvestors. In 1992 Congress further added the regional center component \nthat allows participants to pool dollars for foreign investors.\n  The story on ``Nightline'' detailed how visas and green cards are for \nsale for more than $500,000. It also highlighted how spies and \nterrorists can use the program to enter the country, risking our \nnational security and undermining the real intent of the program.\n  For the past few years, whistleblowers have come to me about the \nfraud, abuse, and national security problems with that program.\n  A December 2013 audit of the EB-5 program conducted by the Department \nof Homeland Security Office of Inspector General substantiated several \nof these concerns. The OIG report concluded that the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services is unable to demonstrate the benefits of \nforeign investment into the U.S. economy--in other words, questioning \nwhether the original intent of the program was being accomplished.\n  Specifically, the Office of the Inspector General found that the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services could not validate whether the EB-\n5 program actually created 49,000 jobs.\n  In addition, a 2013 internal memorandum from the U.S. Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, Homeland Security Investigations noted that ``the \nnature of indirect job growth is problematic.''\n  Allow me, please, to discuss the fraud issues related to the program.\n  The EB-5 program requires a foreign national to invest $1 million in \norder to obtain a visa. However, there is a lower threshold for \nprojects that are in high unemployment or rural areas.\n  Investors have exploited this loophole. As noted in press reports, \nsome metropolitan areas are drawing their own maps or gerrymandering in \norder to meet this low threshold. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices ignores the problem and doesn't question it.\n  Additionally, there are serious concerns that the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services does not adequately verify the documentation \nand the source of funds from investors.\n  Adjudicators do not thoroughly check how an investor has received \n$500,000 and whether the funds are even legitimate.\n  Finally, I wish to elaborate what is probably more important, the \nnational security concerns. Remember, the Federal Government's No. 1 \nresponsibility is the national security of this country.\n  In regard to those national security concerns, in 2012, several \nagencies came together to draft a forensic assessment of financial \nflows relating to the EB-5 Regional Center Program, and the Department \nof Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis produced an \nintelligence report of the program's vulnerabilities. The same ICE \nmemorandum that highlighted its issues with regional centers also \nidentified seven main areas of vulnerability within the EB-5 program. I \nwon't go into all seven of them, but I wish to use four as an example.\n  No. 1, export-sensitive technology and economic espionage;\n  No. 2, use by foreign government agents and espionage;\n  No. 3, use by terrorists; and,\n  No. 4, illicit financing and money laundering.\n  Let me make it very clear that this ICE memorandum identified seven \nareas of vulnerability and I just gave us four dealing with sensitive \ntechnology and economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and \nespionage, use by terrorists, and illicit financing and money \nlaundering.\n  I know I repeated that, but the EB-5 program is being undercut by \npeople who don't mind hurting the national security of our country.\n  So to be repetitive on an important point, there are numerous \nnational security concerns. That is why, in my September 2014 ``Dear \nColleague'' letter, I invited my colleagues--all of them--to review \nclassified information on this program.\n  Today I renew this invitation and urge Senators and those staff who \nhave clearances to view these documents to do so in the Office of \nSenate Security.\n  I will be sending another copy of that ``Dear Colleague'' letter, \nwhich contains the document numbers to access the material at the \nOffice of Senate Security.\n  Summing up, we have whistleblower allegations supported by \ndocumentation. We have findings by the Office of the Inspector General. \nWe have classified information about attempts to exploit the \nvulnerabilities of the program and, finally, we have numerous press \nreports that highlight the fraud and the abuse.\n  So I think it is time Congress asks whether this program is worth the \nnational security risks posed and whether this program can be fixed to \naccomplish the goals that were set out in 1990.\n  The EB-5 program will require reauthorization by the end of fiscal \nyear 2015 and I want my colleagues to know that I will be demanding \nreform before this is done, or in conjunction with any renewal.\n  I do believe that if changes are made, the EB-5 program could benefit \nthe U.S. economy as originally intended by Congress in 1990.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S812-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S812-S813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I come today to support legislation \nto fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, without any \nextraneous or politically controversial policy riders.\n  Let me be clear. The immigration provisions that are approved in the \nHouse are bill killers. We have now had three votes on cloture. The \nvotes have held steady. It is clear the votes are not here to pass a \nbill out of the Senate with the riders attached to it.\n  I just want to speak of the importance of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity because I was in the Senate when the Department was developed. \nIt is a combination of 22 agencies. It has over 200,000 employees. Over \nthe years it has become more and more vital to efforts to prevent \nterrorist attacks on this country.\n  So how, you might ask? TSA, a member of that Department, funded by \nthat Department, screens airline passengers within the United States, \nwhile Customs and Border Protection screens passenger data of travelers \nentering the country. So it is irresponsible to endanger these missions \nin the wake of terrorist attacks in Paris, Ottawa, Sydney, and \nelsewhere.\n  Secondly, DHS plays a critical role in responding to natural \ndisasters. Resources and personnel from FEMA, which is funded through \nDHS, are vital in times of flooding, earthquakes, hurricanes, \nwildfires, and other disasters.\n  Third, DHS also guards against cyber warfare through network \nsecurity, electronic crimes investigations, and State and local \ncybercrime training. So it is hard to fathom delaying $861 million for \ncyber security the same day we learn about the massive cyber attack \nagainst Anthem Blue Cross.\n  A number of key national security programs unrelated to immigration \nwould also be in danger. These include the Federal Air Marshal Service, \nthe Secret Service, the Transportation Security Administration, and DHS \nintelligence activities.\n  Ironically, blocking this bill over immigration riders would also \ndelay increased funding for border patrols and more manpower to combat \nhuman smuggling and trafficking, which so many Members of this Congress \nwant.\n  Holding up this bill will also delay and reduce more than $2.5 \nbillion in grants for State and local law enforcement agencies and \nemergency responders. This puts our country in jeopardy. These grants \nhelp with transit and port security, firefighter assistance, and State \nhomeland security.\n  Make no mistake, the Department of Homeland Security is very active \nin securing our borders and deporting dangerous individuals.\n  It has a wonderful Secretary. I think every Member of this body \nappreciates Jeh Johnson and knows the role he played with managing the \nsudden influx of children into our country on the southern border. We \nknow of his effectiveness in bringing together what has been a very \nungainly combination of 22 agencies into a smoothly run entity. This \nmust be very disappointing to him.\n  In fiscal year 2014, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported \n315,943 people, focusing its efforts on removing criminals, and the \nagency was successful in that goal. Fifty-six percent of those removed \nlast year had been convicted of crimes. That is 177,960 fewer criminals \non our streets. I would say good job.\n  Rather than holding DHS and our national security hostage, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill introduced by Senators Mikulski and \nShaheen to provide full funding for DHS at levels necessary to do its \njob. We can't keep funding this agency with short-term continuing \nresolutions. It doesn't make sense. We certainly can't keep threatening \nto shut it down.\n  Yesterday in our joint meeting I had an opportunity to say what this \nbody was like when I came to it. I think I can say with certainty this \nwouldn't have happened 20 years ago. We would have recognized the \nimportance of the agency and told people to come back with another bill \nat another time.\n  The importance of getting some regular order in our appropriations \nbills is important because we are not getting regular appropriations \nbills passed. This is so important that I think everyone thought it \nwouldn't be disturbed. Instead, these policy riders are stuck on it, \nand the people who put them on know they are offensive to just about \nhalf of this body and it is going to present a major challenge to get a \nbill passed.\n  Let me talk a little bit about the issue; that is, the five riders \nthat Republicans want to add to the bill. The goal of the riders, I \nthink--and I think everyone would agree with this--is to unravel \ntemporary actions President Obama has taken in an effort to make sense \nof what is, we all admit, a broken immigration system.\n  These actions, I would note, wouldn't have been necessary if the \nHouse had voted on the bipartisan Senate immigration reform bill that \npassed in 2013 by a vote of 68 to 32--68 to 32. It was the product of \nmonths of intense negotiations and hearings.\n  I remember it well. There were eight bipartisan Members who \nnegotiated a bill to put before the Judiciary Committee. I am a member \nof the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee debated the bill \nfor weeks. A total of some 300 amendments were filed, with 212 \namendments in committee that were considered, half of which were \nRepublican, and 136 amendments were adopted.\n  The House refused to even debate this bill, which in my view--and I \nhave been here a long time--has been the result of one of the most \nprofound bipartisan efforts on a big bill in the last 20 years. The \nHouse even refused to recognize it by a debate, let alone a vote, let \nalone passing something, some part of the bill, so there could be a \nconference and differences reconciled.\n  Now the House comes to us by putting what they know are going to be \nhighly problematic riders on what is an absolutely crucial \nappropriations bill. This is the kind of thing I tried to say \nyesterday. It just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n  It would not have happened some time ago. People would not have tried \nto force their will through on an important bill when they knew they \ndidn't have the votes. If three votes on cloture don't show that, I \ndon't know what really will.\n  The Presiding Officer knows this as well as I do. But the root of the \nproblem is that we have more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants in \nour country, and Congress only provides enough funding to deport around \n400,000 people a year. Clearly we can't deport everybody. So choices \nhave to be made.\n  So do we focus limited enforcement resources on real threats, such as \ncriminals and terrorists? I say yes. Or, do we spread our resources \nthin, treating murderers the same way we treat school children who have \nbeen in the country for years? I say no. I stand firmly with the \nPresident in the belief that we must focus on actual threats and we \nmust prioritize.\n  One of the temporary programs that the other side seeks to eliminate \nis known as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. I hate \nacronyms, but the acronym is DACA.\n  This program allows law-abiding individuals brought to the United \nStates as children to remain here without fear of being deported from \nthe only home they have ever known. They can stay for 3-year increments \nas long as they don't break the law. Republicans want to scrap this \nprogram and place these individuals into the same category as dangerous \ncriminals.\n  In California, my State, that would mean 450,000 young people who \nwere brought to the United States as children, who have lived nowhere \nelse, would immediately be eligible for deportation.\n  The House riders also seek to remove protections for parents of \nUnited States citizens and permanent residents, including 1.1 million \nparents in California. That would have the effect of breaking up many \nfamilies that have lived here for years.\n  I personally know of it happening in San Diego, when, in the middle \nof the night, immigration officers came into a home, picked up the \nparents and deported them, leaving the three children in the home. The \nparents had been here, they were working, they had paid their taxes, \nand now the children were left. Fortunately, as I understand that \nincident, relatives were able to come because the children were born \nhere, and they helped to take care of them. But we can imagine the \ncases where there was no one to help. So this clearly has an effect of \nbreaking up many\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nfamilies that may have lived here for years.\n  So let me be clear. The political--I really believe they are \npolitical--riders weighing down this appropriations bill are not \ndesigned to fix our immigration system but rather to weaken it--and \nwith the goal of embarrassing the President. We should not do that on \nany bill--let alone a bill as important as this one.\n  It is not just Senate Democrats who think these riders are bad \npolicy. Sixty-two percent of Americans in last month's January poll \nsupported ``an Executive Order that would allow some illegal immigrants \nalready in the United States to stay here temporarily and apply for a \nwork permit if certain requirements are met.'' So 62 percent of the \npeople said yes to that question. That is precisely what the President \nhas done.\n  A combined 69 percent of Americans supported an immigration policy \nthat lets unauthorized immigrants remain in the United States, 54 \npercent supported a path to citizenship, and another 15 percent \nsupported legal status but no path to citizenship.\n  So to the extent we get our guidance from the American people rather \nthan from this or that political party, we can see what the view of \nAmericans are on this. I think it is because we have had this issue \ndebated in this forum several times. This isn't the first big \nimmigration bill. It is the second in about the last 6 or 8 years that \nhas come out of committee, come to the floor with an agreement, and \nfallen apart. And it had been negotiated in a bipartisan manner.\n  So then to have this bill that we passed go to the House, and the \nHouse would have a legitimate chance to make any amendments they might \nwant to make--rather than put this rider on this bill--and pass over to \nus a bill which could then go to conference and we could work on around \na table--the way business should be done--to come together to present \nwhat we can agree upon in both Houses to pass into law.\n  That is the process here, and that is one of the really big changes \nin this body over recent history. We always tried to follow regular \norder. Appropriations bills in regular order now are really \nnonexistent. It is really too bad because it weakens the committee \nstructure, it weakens the institution as a whole, it makes us beholden \nto a few, and it doesn't do the people's business. And, as I said \nyesterday, it is one of the reasons why our favorability rating as a \nCongress is something near 16 percent favorable.\n  So I say, please, let's take these policy riders off. Let's learn \nfrom the experience. Let's pass this bill. It is a new Congress. I \nrecognize the bill has to be reintroduced, but the immigration bill \ncertainly can be reintroduced. We have had a lot of experience in \nworking it, and we can do it once again. Then perhaps the House would \nbe willing to look at it, to debate it, and maybe even then to give us \nthe respect of voting on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse).

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, this afternoon I would like to discuss an issue of very \nserious concern to tens of millions of Americans; that is, the \nRepublican effort to cut Social Security disability insurance benefits \nand perhaps benefits for Social Security retirees. In my view and in \nthe view of seniors throughout the State of Vermont, this is a very bad \nidea.\n  As you know, on the very first day of the new Congress, House \nRepublicans passed a rule--later adopted by the full House--which would \nprevent the common practice of rebalancing funds from the Social \nSecurity retirement program to the Social Security disability program. \nThis rule adopted by the Republicans in the House would lay the \ngroundwork for a 19-percent cut in disability benefits next year.\n  President Obama, in his budget, did exactly what has been done on 11 \nseparate occasions in the past, always--and here is the point I want to \nmake time and time again and why this is a manufactured crisis--this \nhas been done 11 times in the past, always in a noncontroversial way, \nand that is to rebalance the funds between the two programs. This is \nnot a big deal. The Republicans are manufacturing a crisis where none \nexists. Time and time again, Democratic Presidents and Republican \nPresidents, with absolutely no controversy, have done what President \nObama has proposed. This was done in 1968 under President Johnson; in \n1970 under President Nixon; in 1978, 1979, and 1980 under President \nCarter; in 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1987 under President Ronald Reagan; in \n1994, 1996, 1997, 2000, and beyond under President Bill Clinton. In \nother words, this is a totally noncontroversial process that has been \ndone time and time again under Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents.\n  What the President is suggesting today is that we reallocate funds \nfrom the senior retirement fund to the disability fund. But \ninterestingly enough, of the 11 times the funds were reallocated, it \nturns out that on five occasions it was money going from the disability \nfund to temporarily help out the retirement fund.\n  There are some people who sadly are trying to divide the senior \npopulation from the disability population. What they are saying in a \nway that is untruthful and unfair is that by reallocating money into \nthe disability fund, we are taking funding away from seniors and the \nretirement fund. This is absolutely untrue because, as I have \nindicated, on 11 occasions we have seen this reallocation, and \nsometimes, in fact, it comes from the disability fund to help the \nretirement fund.\n  I am very happy to tell you that virtually every senior organization \nin America--organizations representing tens of millions of senior \ncitizens--has made it clear that we must reallocate funds, we must \nprevent a cut in disability benefits, and we must do what has been done \ntime and time again.\n  Let me briefly read a letter from the AARP. The AARP is the largest \nsenior organization in America. This letter was written on July 22, \n2014. It went to chairman Ron Wyden and ranking member Orrin Hatch of \nthe Finance Committee. What the letter says:\n\n       As the largest nonprofit, nonpartisan organization \n     representing the interests of Americans age 50 and older and \n     their families, we write in advance of the Committee's \n     legislative hearing on the Social Security Disability \n     Insurance program (SSDI) to express our support for Social \n     Security, including its disability insurance functions, and \n     our support of rebalancing payroll taxes to ensure the earned \n     benefits of 11 million disabled Americans and their families \n     are not reduced or put at risk.\n\n  Once again, AARP: We ``support the rebalancing of payroll taxes to \nensure the earned benefits of 11 million disabled Americans and their \nfamilies are not reduced or put at risk.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2014.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Wyden and Senator Hatch: As the largest \n     nonprofit, nonpartisan organization representing the \n     interests of Americans age 50 and older and their families, \n     we write in advance of the Committee's legislative hearing on \n     the Social Security Disability Insurance program (SSDI) to \n     express our support for Social Security, including its \n     disability insurance functions, and our support of \n     rebalancing payroll taxes to ensure the earned benefits of 11 \n     million disabled Americans and their families are not reduced \n     or put at risk. AARP recognizes the need to address the \n     overall funding shortfall\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\n     facing Social Security in the next 20 years, and we stand \n     ready to engage with Congress, our members and other \n     Americans on ways to strengthen Social Security, now and in \n     the future. But, we also recognize that without rebalancing \n     in the near-term, SSDI beneficiaries are at risk of \n     significant benefit cuts. This is of particular concern to \n     older workers who are most likely to rely heavily on SSDI in \n     part because of higher rates of chronic illness and \n     disability at older ages.\n       Income support in the event of a disability is a critical \n     lifeline for millions of American families. Congress wisely \n     added disability insurance protection to the Social Security \n     system in 1956, under President Eisenhower, and has since \n     then modified and improved the program many times. It should \n     be noted that since the creation of the SSDI program in 1956, \n     the United States workforce has more than doubled from 62 \n     million to over 140 million workers, and women today \n     represent half of the workforce and almost half of the SSDI \n     beneficiaries.\n       By law, Social Security maintains two trust funds--the Old-\n     Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and the Disability \n     Insurance (DI) trust funds--and they operate independently. \n     Congress has faced shortfalls in both the OASI and DI trust \n     funds many times in the past. Most recently, in 1994, \n     Congress rebalanced the allocation of Social Security payroll \n     taxes between the OASI trust and the DI trust, estimating the \n     rebalancing would adequately fund SSDI benefits for \n     approximately 20 years. Congress forecast accurately, as the \n     Social Security Trustees estimate that the payroll taxes \n     allocated to the Disability Insurance trust fund will cease \n     being adequate to pay full benefits in late 2016. After that, \n     according to the Social Security Actuaries as of 2013, \n     ``[p]rojected revenue from non-interest income specified for \n     the DI program is sufficient to support 80 percent of program \n     cost after trust fund depletion in 2016, increasing slightly \n     to 81% of program cost in 2087.'' CBO maintains similar \n     projections.\n       Many experts, including the Congressional Budget Office, \n     have estimated the shortfall is largely due to: 1) general \n     population growth, 2) women's entrance into the labor force \n     and consequent eligibility for SSDI benefits, 3) the increase \n     in the Social Security normal retirement age from 65 to 67, \n     and 4) the aging of the Baby Boom population leading to a \n     higher percentage of older people vulnerable to illness and \n     disability. All of these factors also contribute to other \n     challenges in the SSDI program.\n       One of the most significant challenges facing the SSDI \n     program is the unacceptably long delay in processing \n     applications of disabled workers who have earned the right to \n     their benefits. A large and growing backlog both at the \n     initial claims and appeals level has caused lengthy delays \n     and imposes severe hardships on disabled workers and their \n     families. AARP has long urged an increase in funding to meet \n     the increase in the administrative workload. We also \n     recognize that the SSDI program needs greater program \n     integrity efforts both over initial eligibility approvals and \n     continuing disability reviews. AARP has been among the \n     staunchest advocates requesting program integrity funding; we \n     regret that in recent years this funding has been cut, \n     reducing the Social Security Administration's ability to \n     maximize integrity efforts.\n       The Committee's upcoming hearing is a welcome opportunity \n     to examine the resources that will be needed to ensure the \n     continuing success of the SSDI program. We believe SSDI \n     program reforms and improvements can be identified that would \n     both improve the fairness of the process for disabled \n     claimants and encourage greater work participation for those \n     who have limited ability to work. We support and will \n     continue to urge that Congress provide adequate resources for \n     the Social Security Administration to conduct timely initial \n     and continuing disability reviews. But, the highest priority \n     in the near term is to ensure that SSDI beneficiaries--most \n     of whom are older Americans--are not at risk of a 20% benefit \n     cut in the very near future. To prevent any imminent \n     reductions in SSDI benefits, we urge you to rebalance the \n     allocation of Social Security payroll taxes between the OASI \n     trust and the DI trust, as Congress has done with success in \n     the past.\n       Because of SSDI, millions of disabled Americans are able to \n     live their lives with dignity and support their families. We \n     look forward to continuing to work with you and the other \n     members of the Committee to ensure that all aspects of the \n     Social Security program remain strong for future generations \n     of American workers and their families. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to call me, or have your staff \n     contact Michele Varnhagen on our Government Affairs staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Joyce Rogers,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, it is not just the AARP that holds that \nview. It is dozens and dozens of senior organizations all across the \ncountry. Let me read very briefly from a letter written by the \nLeadership Council of Aging Organizations, dated October 9, 2014. It is \na letter that goes to the President--to President Obama. What it says \nis:\n\n       We urge you to include a non-controversial, commonsense \n     legislative adjustment in your 2016 budget for Congress to \n     temporarily reallocate the Social Security payroll \n     contributions to address the anticipated shortfall in the \n     Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. We also \n     strongly urge you to reject proposals to cut Social Security \n     benefits, coverage, or eligibility.\n\n  That is the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Leadership Council of Aging Organizations, Debra B. \n           Whitman, Chair,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2014.\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: On behalf of the Leadership Council \n     of Aging Organizations (LCAO), a coalition of national not-\n     for-profit organizations representing over 60 million older \n     Americans, we write to ask you to maintain a vital part of \n     our Social Security system in your 2016 budget proposal. We \n     urge you to include a non-controversial, commonsense \n     legislative adjustment in your 2016 budget for Congress to \n     temporarily reallocate the Social Security payroll \n     contributions to address the anticipated shortfall in the \n     Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) program. We also \n     strongly urge you to reject proposals to cut Social Security \n     benefits, coverage, or eligibility.\n       Social Security's Disability Insurance (DI) fund reserves \n     are projected to be depleted in 2016, at which point revenue \n     coming into the system would cover only 80% of benefits. This \n     projected shortfall is not a surprise and Congress should \n     rebalance income across the Social Security Trust Funds, as \n     it has done 11 times before, to cover the anticipated \n     shortfall. As Treasury Secretary Lew stated in July, ``it's \n     going to be important for there to be legislation that does \n     reallocate the payroll tax to support the disability fund.''\n       A modest, temporary reallocation of part of Social \n     Security's 6.2% tax rate from the Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance (OASI) fund to the DI fund would put both funds on \n     an equal footing. Congress has rebalanced tax rates between \n     the two funds 11 times since the DI trust fund was \n     established in 1956. About half the time Congress increased \n     the share going to the OASI fund and about half the time it \n     increased the share for DI. Congress has never failed to act \n     when it was necessary to rebalance the two funds, and it has \n     consistently done so in a bipartisan basis. It is time to do \n     so again, and can be done today without compromising the \n     ability of the overall Social Security program to pay full \n     benefits from both trust funds for the next 20 years.\n       When Congress acted to rebalance the two funds in 1994, it \n     was clear it would have to take action again in 2016. The \n     1995 Social Security Trustees Report showed that the DI \n     reserves would be depleted in 2016, primarily due to a rapid, \n     but temporary, increase in the number of DI beneficiaries as \n     baby boomers passed through their 50s and early 60s when the \n     risk of disability is greatest.\n       The typical DI beneficiary is in his or her late 50s. \n     Seventy percent are over age 50, and 30 percent are 60 or \n     older. These beneficiaries depend on Social Security for a \n     significant portion of their income. Without benefits, fifty-\n     five percent of families with a disabled worker would have \n     incomes below the poverty line. And, since the benefits they \n     receive continue as they grow older, the DI program helps to \n     ensure that these disabled workers don't fall into poverty as \n     they age.\n       Another factor that has led to an increase in the number of \n     DI beneficiaries is a rise in the full retirement age. When \n     DI beneficiaries reach Social Security's full retirement age, \n     they begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits \n     rather than DI. The increase in the full retirement age to 66 \n     has delayed that conversion. In December 2013, more than \n     450,000 people between ages 65 and 66--over 5 percent of DI \n     beneficiaries--collected DI benefits. Under the rules in \n     place until 2003, they would have received retirement \n     benefits instead. This is just one example of how closely the \n     retirement and disability components of Social Security are \n     interwoven.\n       The growth in DI is leveling off as boomers enter \n     retirement and shift to OASI benefits. The need to rebalance \n     by 2016 reflects a long-anticipated, but temporary, shift in \n     the funding requirements of the two funds. Rebalancing would \n     not affect the long-term financing of the combined Social \n     Security system, which would remain solvent through 2033. \n     Rebalancing can and should be done without cutting benefits \n     or narrowing coverage or eligibility. This sensible action \n     will give policymakers ample time to strengthen Social \n     Security for the long-term.\n       For these reasons, the undersigned organizations urge you \n     to include a legislative proposal to rebalance the Social \n     Security funds in your 2016 budget, and to exclude proposals \n     to cut Social Security benefits, coverage or eligibility.\n           Sincerely,\n       AFL-CIO, AFSCME Retirees, Alliance for Retired Americans, \n     American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), American \n     Foundation for the Blind (AFB), American Postal Workers Union \n     Retirees (APWU) American Society on Aging (ASA), Asociacion \n     Nacional Pro Personas Mayores (ANPPM)/ National Association \n     for Hispanic\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\n     Elderly, Association For Gerontology and Human Development in \n     Historically Black Colleges and Universities (AGHDHBCU), \n     Association of Jewish Aging Services (AJAS), B'nai B'rith \n     International, Caring Across Generations, Center for Elder \n     Care and Advanced Illness--Altarum Institute.\n       Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc., Easter Seals, Military \n     Officers Association of America (MOAA), National Academy of \n     Elder Law Attorneys (NAELA), National Active and Retired \n     Federal Employees Association (NARFE), National Adult Day \n     Services Association (NADSA), National Adult Protective \n     Services Association (NAPSA), National Alliance for \n     Caregiving, National Association for Home Care & Hospice, \n     National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (n4a), \n     National Association of Retired and Senior Volunteer Program \n     Directors, INC.

Mr. President, let me be very clear and say that this \nfight--what some of us see on our TV screens and what we hear from some \npoliticians--the simple truth is that Social Security is not going \nbroke. Social Security is not going broke. Today, Social Security has a \n$2.8 trillion surplus in its trust fund and can pay out all benefits to \nall beneficiaries, the elderly and the disabled, for the next 18 years.\n  This is not the opinion of Senator Bernie Sanders. This is the \nopinion of the Social Security Administration in their latest report. \nThere is and can be no debate about these simple facts. If we rebalance \nfunds, as President Obama and many others have proposed, all benefits--\nretiree benefits for our older Americans and disabled benefits for \ndisabled Americans--would be paid out for the next 18 years--the next \n18 years.\n  So people who come before you and say Social Security is going broke, \nthey are simply not telling the truth. While this 18-year period makes \nit clear that we do not have an imminent crisis with regard to Social \nSecurity, I do agree with those who want to make sure Social Security \nis solvent for a lot longer than 18 years, for our kids and for our \ngrandchildren.\n  Frankly, when we talk about the long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity, and that of course includes disability insurance as well, \nthere are two basic approaches we can take for those who want to extend \nSocial Security for many decades. One approach is what many of my \nRepublican colleagues are talking about. What they are saying, in \nessence, is that in order to save Social Security we have to cut Social \nSecurity. Some are talking about a so-called chained CPI, which would \nmean a cut in cost-of-living adjustments, some are talking about \nraising the retirement age, at which point seniors will be able to get \nbenefits, and some in fact are talking about privatizing Social \nSecurity and giving that program over to Wall Street. That is one \napproach. That is one way we could deal with Social Security and the \nfuture of the program. Needless to say that is an approach I very \nstrongly disagree with.\n  The other approach, an approach which is widely supported in poll \nafter poll by the American people, extends Social Security and protects \nSocial Security in a very different way than many Republicans are \nproposing; that is, it addresses the issue that right now, as most \nAmericans know, there is a cap on the income that is subject to the \nSocial Security payroll tax.\n  That cap is now at $118,500; in other words, one individual makes \n$11.8 million a year but only pays 6.2 percent on the first $118,500 he \nearns. The second individual makes $118,500 and pays Social Security \ntaxes on all of that income. That, I think most Americans believe, is \npatently unfair.\n  I have introduced legislation in the past, and I am now working with \nother Senators who have introduced similar types of legislation which \neliminates the cap on income subject to the Social Security payroll \ntax. My own view is we should apply the Social Security payroll tax to \nincome above $250,000.\n  If we do that, if we go down that very simple and fair route of \nasking very wealthy individuals--the top 1 percent, the top 1\\1/2\\ \npercent--to contribute more into the Social Security trust fund, the \nfact is we could extend Social Security for decades, disability \nbenefits for decades, and in fact we would have enough money to expand \nbenefits, not cut them.\n  On March 19, 2013, in response to a letter I wrote to the Social \nSecurity Chief Actuary, he wrote back and he told us that taking the \napproach my legislation lays out, raising the cap on taxable income \nstarting at $250,000, would extend the life of Social Security past the \nyear 2060.\n  So for anybody to come on this floor and say in order to save Social \nSecurity we have to cut benefits, at a time when millions of senior \ncitizens in this country are struggling to pay for the medicine they \nneed, to keep warm in the winter, to buy the food they need, people out \nthere living on $13,000, $14,000 a year--and there are some who say we \nhave to cut Social Security--let me go on record and say I strongly \ndisagree.\n  The far better and far fairer approach is to lift the cap on taxable \nincome and start at $250,000. So if we are serious about extending the \nlife of Social Security, if we are serious about not cutting disability \nbenefits, there is a path forward. Yes, it does ask the people on top \nto contribute a little bit more. I know that with all of the lobbyists \nand all the campaign contributions coming in here that sometimes \nbecomes tough, but it is the right thing to do.\n  Let's stand with the millions of seniors who are struggling to stay \nalive economically in these tough times, rather than wealthy campaign \ncontributors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the March 19, 2013, letter from the \nChief Actuary of the Social Security Administration be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Social Security Administration,\n\n\n                                  Office of the Chief Actuary,\n\n                                    Baltimore, MD, March 19, 2013.\n     Hon. Bernie Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: I am writing in response to your \n     request for estimates of the financial effects on Social \n     Security of a proposal to apply the Social Security payroll \n     tax to earned income over $250,000 beginning in 2014. The \n     estimates and analysis provided in this letter reflect the \n     intent, as discussed with Warren Gunnels of your staff, of S. \n     500, ``Keeping Our Social Security Promises Act,'' which you \n     introduced on March 7, 2013.\n       We estimate that enactment of this Bill would extend full \n     solvency of the OASDI program for an additional 28 years, \n     with the projected depletion of combined OASI and DI Trust \n     Fund reserves moving from 2033 under current law to 2061 \n     under the proposal. All estimates are based on the \n     intermediate assumptions of the 2012 Trustees Report. The \n     estimates presented reflect the combined efforts of many in \n     our office, but particularly Alice Wade, Christopher \n     Chaplain, Dan Nickerson, Kyle Burkhalter, Katie Sutton, and \n     William Piet. A detailed description of our understanding of \n     the intent of the Bill is included immediately below.\n       The intent of this proposal is identical to the Bill you \n     introduced in September 2011 and H.R. 797 introduced in the \n     House of Representatives in February 2011 by Mr. DeFazio. Our \n     earlier estimates for both of these Bills, reflecting \n     baseline assumptions from the 2011 and 2010 Trustees Reports, \n     respectively, are available at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/\nsolvency/index.html.\n       S. 500 would modify the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     subject a worker's OASDI covered earnings in excess of \n     $250,000 in any calendar year after 2013 to the combined \n     OASDI payroll tax rate of 12.4 percent. This is the same tax \n     rate that is applied, under current law, to OASDI covered \n     earnings up to the contribution and benefit base ($113,700 \n     for 2013). Under present law, the contribution and benefit \n     base is scheduled to increase in the future based on \n     increases in the average wage in the U.S. economy. However, \n     the threshold of $250,000 would be constant after 2014 until \n     the contribution and benefit base exceeds this level (in the \n     year 2033), at which point the threshold would be set equal \n     to the contribution and benefit base for that and all \n     subsequent years. Earnings subject to tax above the threshold \n     would not be included in earnings credited for the purpose of \n     OASDI benefit computation.\n       All wages and self-employment earnings in OASDI covered \n     employment during a given year would be reflected in the \n     determination of earnings above the threshold. For workers \n     with more than one employer (including self employment) for a \n     given year, total tax liability for the year would be \n     computed as if all earnings had been received from a single \n     employer for the year, but in no case would any employee or \n     employer pay less tax than they would under current law. To \n     the extent adjustments of payroll tax liability are needed \n     for a given year, employees would make such adjustments on \n     their income tax filing forms. SSA would contact employers \n     regarding any additional tax liability due to multiple jobs \n     for employees during the year.\n       The balance of this letter provides summary and detailed \n     estimates of the effects of enactment of the proposal.\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\n                 summary of effects on actuarial status\n\n       Figure 1 illustrates the expected change in the combined \n     Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and Disability \n     Insurance (DI) Trust Fund reserves, expressed as a percent of \n     annual program cost, assuming enactment of this Bill. \n     Assuming enactment, the OASDI program would be expected to be \n     fully solvent for an additional 28 years, under the \n     intermediate assumptions of the 2012 Trustees Report.\n       The level of reserves for the theoretical combined OASI and \n     DI Trust Funds would decline from 340 percent of annual \n     program cost at the beginning of 2012 until these reserves \n     would become depleted in 2061 (28 years later than projected \n     depletion under current law). At the time of reserve \n     depletion in 2061, the program would be able to pay about 91 \n     percent of then scheduled benefits with continuing taxes \n     (under current law, 75 percent of scheduled benefits are \n     projected to be payable in 2033 after depletion). By 2086, 88 \n     percent of benefits scheduled under the proposal would be \n     payable compared to 73 percent of scheduled benefits payable \n     under present law.\n       Enactment of this Bill would eliminate about 80 percent of \n     the long-range OASDI actuarial deficit of 2.67 percent of \n     taxable payroll under current law, lowering the OASDI \n     actuarial deficit to 0.55 percent of payroll for the long-\n     range period.\n       Figure 2 illustrates annual projected levels of cost, \n     expenditures, and non-interest income as a percent of the \n     current-law taxable payroll. The projected levels of cost \n     reflect the full cost of scheduled benefits under both \n     present law and the proposal. After trust fund reserve \n     depletion, projected expenditures under current law and under \n     the proposal include only amounts payable from projected tax \n     revenues (non-interest income), which are less than projected \n     cost.\n       Figure 2 shows that the estimated cost of the OASDI program \n     would be very slightly reduced under this proposal. A slight \n     decrease in benefits is projected to follow from a small \n     decrease in the proportion of employee compensation that \n     would be paid in the form of wages under the current-law \n     contribution and benefit base. This small reduction in wages \n     as a percentage of employee compensation reflects the assumed \n     behavioral response of employees and employers to the \n     additional payroll taxes under the proposal.\n       It is also useful to consider the projected cost and income \n     for the OASDI program expressed as a percentage of Gross \n     Domestic Product (GDP). The graph illustrates these levels \n     under both present law and this proposal.\n\n\n                       detailed financial results\n\n                         Benefit Illustrations\n\n       Benefit illustrations are not provided for the proposal \n     because benefit levels would not be materially changed from \n     the scheduled benefit levels under current law.\n\n                         Trust Fund Operations\n\n       Table 1 shows the annual cost and income rates, annual \n     balances, and trust fund ratios (reserves as percent of \n     annual program cost) for OASDI assuming enactment of the \n     proposal. This table also shows the change from present law \n     in these cost rates, income rates, and balances. Included at \n     the bottom of this table are summarized rates for the 75-year \n     (long-range) period.\n       Table 1 indicates that the OASDI program is projected to be \n     solvent for an additional 28 years assuming enactment of the \n     proposal. The year in which the combined reserves of the OASI \n     and DI Trust Funds are projected to deplete would change from \n     2033 under current law to 2061 under the proposal. Even after \n     depletion of the trust fund reserves, however, the actuarial \n     status of the program is improved as continuing income would \n     be sufficient to pay a higher percentage of scheduled \n     benefits than under current law. Under current law, 75 \n     percent of benefits are projected to be payable at trust fund \n     reserve depletion in 2033, declining to 73 percent payable by \n     2086. Under this proposal, 100 percent of the scheduled \n     benefits would be fully payable through 2060, and 91 percent \n     would be payable at trust fund reserve depletion in 2061, \n     declining to 88 percent payable by 2086.\n       The actuarial deficit for the OASDI program over the 75-\n     year projection period is reduced by 2.12 percent of taxable \n     payroll, from an actuarial deficit of 2.67 percent of payroll \n     under current law to an actuarial deficit estimated at 0.55 \n     percent of taxable payroll under the proposal.\n       We project annual balances (annual income rate minus annual \n     cost rate) to become positive for years 2014 through 2021 \n     under the proposal and to be negative thereafter. Annual \n     deficits (negative annual balances) after 2028 are projected \n     to be smaller than the deficits projected under current law \n     by more than 2 percentage points through 2086.\n\n                  Program Transfers and Asset Reserves\n\n       Column 4 of Table 1a provides a projection of the level of \n     reserves for the theoretical combined OASI and DI Trust Funds \n     under the proposal, expressed in present value dollars \n     discounted to January 1, 2012. The table indicates that the \n     proposal includes no new specified transfers of general \n     revenue to the trust funds. For purpose of comparison, the \n     OASDI Trust Fund reserves, expressed in present value \n     dollars, are also shown for the current-law Social Security \n     program both without the added general fund transfers (if \n     any) provided under the proposal (column 6) and with the \n     proposal added transfers (column 7). Note that negative \n     values in columns 4, 6, and 7 represent the ``unfunded \n     obligation'' for the program through the year. The unfunded \n     obligation is the present value of the shortfall of revenue \n     needed to pay full scheduled benefits on a timely basis from \n     the date of trust fund reserve depletion to the end of the \n     indicated year. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), expressed in \n     present value dollars, is shown in column 5 for comparison \n     with other values in the table.\n\n                      Effect on the Federal Budget\n\n       Table 1b shows the projected effect, in present value \n     discounted dollars, on the Federal budget (unified-budget and \n     on-budget) cash flows and balances, assuming enactment of \n     proposal. Table 1b.n provides the estimated nominal dollar \n     effect of enactment of the proposal on the annual budget \n     balances for years 2012 through 2022. All values in these \n     tables represent the amount of the change from the level \n     projected under current law.\n       The effect of the proposal on unified budget cash flow \n     (column 3) is expected to be positive starting for 2014, \n     reflecting the application of the payroll tax to earnings \n     above the current-law taxable maximum amount.\n       Column 4 of Table 1b indicates that the projected effect of \n     implementing this Bill is a reduction, starting in 2014, of \n     the Federal debt held by the public, reaching about $7.2 \n     trillion in present value by 2086. Column 5 provides the \n     projected effect of the proposal on the annual unified budget \n     balances, including both the cash flow effect in column 3 and \n     the additional interest on the accumulated debt indicated in \n     column 4. Columns 6 and 7 indicate that the proposal would \n     have no expected direct effects on the on-budget cash flow, \n     or on the total Federal debt, in the future.\n       It is important to note that these estimates are based on \n     the intermediate assumptions of the 2012 Trustees Report and \n     thus are not consistent with estimates made by the Office of \n     Budget and Management or the Congressional Budget Office \n     based on their assumptions.\n\n          Annual Trust Fund Operations as a Percentage of GDP\n\n       Table 1c provides annual cost, annual expenditures (on a \n     payable basis), and annual tax income for the OASDI program \n     expressed as a percentage of GDP. These values are shown for \n     both present law and assuming enactment of the Bill. Showing \n     the annual trust fund flows as a percent of GDP provides an \n     additional perspective on these trust fund operations in \n     relation to the total value of goods and services produced in \n     the United States. The relationship between income and cost \n     is similar when expressed as a percent of GDP to that when \n     expressed as a percent of taxable payroll (see Table 1).\n\n        Effects on Trust Fund Reserves and Unfunded Obligations\n\n       Table 1d provides estimates of the changes due to the \n     proposal in the level of projected trust fund reserves under \n     present law and, for years after trust fund exhaustion, the \n     level of unfunded obligations under present law. All values \n     in the table are expressed in present-value discounted \n     dollars. For the 75-year long-range period as a whole, the \n     present-law unfunded obligation of $8.6 trillion in present \n     value is reduced to an unfunded obligation of $1.4 trillion \n     in present value. This change is the combination of the \n     following:\n       A $7.1 trillion increase in revenue from applying the \n     payroll tax to covered earnings above the present-law \n     contribution and benefit base (column 2), less\n       A $0.1 trillion reduction in cost from the behavioral \n     response to additional payroll tax, causing a small decrease \n     in the share of employee compensation that is received in \n     wages, and thus a small decrease in total benefits (column \n     3).\n       We hope these estimates will be helpful. Please let me know \n     if we may provide further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen C. Goss,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S816-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S816-S818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 338\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to tell my colleagues that shortly I \nintend to ask unanimous consent to call up S. 338, but prior to that I \nwould like to say a few things about it. S. 338 was introduced by \nmyself, Senator Bennet, and Senator Ayotte. What it would do is \npermanently authorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It would \nalso guarantee that a small portion of any appropriated money goes \ntoward maintaining access for those who use our public lands, the \nAmerican people.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is essential to making public \nlands public, by securing recreational areas, particularly where \nopportunities for sportsmen and others to access existing public lands \nare limited or precluded. As I am sure the Presiding Officer is aware, \nthis program expires on September 30 and we can no longer\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\nwait to reauthorize what I believe is dollar for dollar one of the most \neffective government programs we have.\n  This is an investment that rivals any Wall Street honey of a deal \nthat I have ever heard of. Every $1 spent has roughly $4 rates of \nreturn in either matching funds or money contributed back into our \neconomy. This is an economic driver. The bait and the tackle shop, the \noutdoor apparel equipment store, the guide service, the mom-and-pop \nlodge, these are all local jobs. They cannot be outsourced. I realize \nthis town does not take care of--it does not care much about budgets or \nresponsible spending, but the simple truth is this program is a trust \nfund codified by law--by law--every year. No less than $900 million in \nroyalties are paid by energy companies drilling for oil and gas on the \nOuter Continental Shelf. They are put into this fund--royalties off of \nenergy exploration, something Congress when they in their infinite \nwisdom set up this program said they were a good thing.\n  Every year no less than $900 million in royalties are paid and go \ninto this fund. The money is intended to, one, protect areas around \nnational parks, rivers, and lakes. I note to my colleagues not \n``create'' national parks, to ``protect''; two, to provide buffers for \nnational forests and national wildlife refuges from development; three, \nto provide matching grants for State and local parks and recreation \nprojects. In fiscal year 2013, the Department of the Interior collected \nmore than $29 billion from offshore production. How much of that went \nto LWCF--$306 million. That is barely one-third of the amount deposited \nat the Treasury Department for this purpose. Talk about highway \nrobbery.\n  I can point to numerous years where this has been the case. Over the \nlife of the program more than $18 billion of land and water \nconservation funding has been diverted into the general fund to pay for \nprograms other than what they were intended to be there for. This is a \ncovenant with the American people that we have broken time and time and \ntime again. It needs to stop.\n  My colleagues, this is not a land grab. It is not a land grab program \nas some have suggested it is. I would suggest to everyone it is a land \nsolution. It is a tool. The LWCF goes toward the purchase of \ninholdings, those pieces of property that are inside a protected piece \nthat is valuable for the future. The only reason there are inholdings \nis that they were not available when that tract was put together. It is \nused to buy property adjacent to existing boundaries and can help solve \nmanagement problems rather than add to them.\n\n  I wish to give my colleagues one example: Clarks River National \nWildlife Refuge in the great State of Kentucky. Acquisition of the \ntract there completed a connection between the refuge lands and the \nClarks River. Previously, access to the river required excessive hiking \nbecause there was no approved vehicle access.\n  These access issues also limited the refuge's ability to provide \nenvironmental education and interpretation programs. Now the site \nprovides access to the river for school groups, their transportation, \nand allows refuge staff to provide hands-on environmental instruction \nto students.\n  We went from a situation where you can only walk to this land to an \nacquisition by a conservation component funded by royalties of oil and \ngas exploration, and now vehicles can actually ride on it. School \nchildren can go there and go through transitional education for the \npurposes of understanding why this is so valuable to protect.\n  Most lands acquired with LWCF funds are within the existing \nboundaries of a Federal park, refuge, forest or other recreational \nareas. Much of the rest is used for conservation easements and State \ngrants, which do not add to Federal management costs.\n  Let me state that again. When we allow this process to take place, we \nactually reduced the burden on Federal agencies from a standpoint of \ntheir management responsibilities with Federal dollars.\n  These partnerships through LWCF easements are a win-win. They keep \nranchers and farmers on their land while maintaining wildlife habitat \nand open spaces. Strategic LWCF purchases can defuse conflicts with \nprivate landowners by securing permanent access for sportsmen.\n  With changing land use and ownership patterns, areas that were once \nopen and usable are now either blocked or cut off. Public lands are \noften sometimes inherently sequestered from roads and towns by narrow \npieces of private-ownership land. LWCF funds bring together sportsmen \nand willing sellers with the intent of open access for everyone.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a down payment. It is a down \npayment on an investment that sustains the American way of life. The \nbest part, I say to my colleagues, is that it is paid for.\n  I am not here to suggest that I want to tackle the pittance that the \nfund receives and how much it was promised. I am only here today, along \nwith my colleague from Colorado, to call up the bill to permanently \nauthorize this program so that we don't go through this exercise every \ntime that reauthorization is needed.\n  In a country that continues to explore for energy--and I hope we \ncontinue and become self-sufficient--let's use the portion of the \nresources that we can to fuel the beach renourishment, to rebuild the \ndunes, to buy those inholdings to get buffer zones around those \ntreasures we try to protect. As we do that, let's open it up to \nAmerican sportsmen to hunt, to fish, to use. That is what LWCF is \nabout.\n  Let's start acting as if the agreement we made with the American \npeople 50 years ago actually means something. Let's authorize \npermanently the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic \nleader, the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 338; that there \nbe up to 1 hour equally divided in the usual form; that following the \nuse or yielding back of that time, the bill be read a third time, and \nthe Senate vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund is used for a number of purposes, although the \nprimary purpose involves the acquisition of new Federal land. Funding \nthe acquisition of new Federal land at a time when Federal agencies can \nbarely take care of the land they already have does raise some rather \nsignificant questions that need to be addressed.\n  The Department of Interior faces a combined maintenance backlog of \nover $20 billion--$13 billion in our National Park Service alone. We \nstruggle with ways to fund the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program, the \nintent of which was to mitigate the burden of Federal land to local \ncommunities where there is an abundance of Federal land that can't be \ntaxed.\n  Coming from a State that is dominated by Federal land ownership--two-\nthirds of the land in Utah is controlled by Federal agencies. Any new \nFederal land ownership must be examined with a healthy degree of \nskepticism. There are many issues that need to be considered and \ndebated before we reauthorize any program that would potentially expand \nthe Federal Government's land holdings.\n  I certainly support opening our public lands for recreation, \nincluding for purposes related to hunting and fishing, and I believe \nthat the Land and Water Conservation Fund could also be used to \nmitigate the negative impacts of Federal regulations on private \nproperty such as listings under the Endangered Species Act.\n  But reform isn't likely to happen. In fact, reform may well be \nimpossible if we allow this bill to pass as is without going through \nthe proper procedures. This bill should be subject to debate and \namendment, first at the committee level and then on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  That is what needs to happen, and on that basis I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank my friend from North Carolina for his efforts, \nand I wish to echo a lot of the points he already made so well, \nespecially about how we stand here today having this fair, reasonable, \nunanimous consent request that the Senator from North\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\nCarolina has asked for, as we stand here today when essentially what we \nare talking about is a promise that has been broken by this Congress to \nthe American people for 50 years.\n  I thank, through the Chair, my colleague from North Carolina for \ntrying to rectify that.\n  I am disappointed that our unanimous consent request was objected to, \nbut I know this measure has plenty of support. As he mentioned, we led \nan amendment on the floor last week with the exact same text of the \nbill that we are discussing today. When the dust settled, that \namendment received 59 votes, but I have a hunch that it would \ncomfortably clear the 60-vote threshold were it to be considered again. \nAnd it should be considered again.\n  The measure is simple. As Senator Burr said, it simply reauthorizes \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund and ensures that a dedicated \nportion of LWCF funds go to provide new access for our Nation's sports \nmen and women.\n  As most in this body know, LWCF is one of the country's best \nconservation programs. It provides $900 million annually to preserve \nour public lands and increase access to them. Not only do we need to \npass this bill to reauthorize the program, but we need to ensure that \nwe dedicate full and mandatory funding to the initiative, as Congress \nintended when we created the program in 1964.\n  Historically, LWCF resources have been used for all types of \nprojects, ranging from building city parks to purchasing small parcels \nof isolated land from willing sellers and all the way to preserving our \nNation's historic battlefields.\n  In Colorado, we have used LWCF for a wide variety of projects beyond \ntraditional conservation. For example, LWCF was of critical importance \nto our State following a major natural disaster in 1976. That year an \nintense rainstorm caused massive flooding around Colorado's Big \nThompson River. The flood claimed the lives of 145 Coloradans and \ncaused more than $35 million in damages.\n  Once the horrible tragedy passed, the community had to rebuild. \nRather than constructing houses back in the flood plain, Larimer County \nturned to LWCF to acquire the affected land and compensated the \nfamilies whose homes were destroyed.\n  Those flood plains are now home to four new county parks--popular \ndestinations for birdwatchers, anglers, and family picnics--instead of \nvulnerable structures. When another huge flood hit in the fall of 2013, \nthe rivers ran black and eventually surged over their banks, as we can \nsee from this photo I have in the Chamber.\n  Luckily, the flood plains, protected by LWCF and the creativity of \nour local folks, saw much less damage this time. The floodwaters \ninundated the open, undeveloped spaces instead of destroying homes and \nbusinesses, and Larimer County avoided about $16 million in estimated \nproperty damages.\n  It is incredible to think that an LWCF investment of just over $1 \nmillion in 1976 saved us more than 15 times that amount in 2013.\n  Beyond the example from Larimer County, communities all across \nColorado have used LWCF to preserve sensitive landscapes and to help \ntheir local economies. This past summer, we completed a huge LWCF \nproject in the San Juan National Forest near the town of Ophir. I spoke \nbriefly about this project last week, and I will mention it again today \nbecause the work of the town of Ophir and the people of Ophir, along \nwith their partners, the Trust for Public Land, were truly remarkable.\n  If memory serves, it is a project that took 12 years from start to \nfinish. It had to be done in phases. LWCF funds were used to acquire \nseveral old mining claims above town, preserving the scenic beauty and \nensuring that the area will remain undeveloped forever.\n  In this picture, if you ignore the center with these people in front \nof me, we can see how beautiful it is. This is a picture of the newly \npreserved landscape in Ophir. A group of us gathered to celebrate the \naccomplishment this past summer.\n  Most of these mountain communities get huge portions of their revenue \nand business from recreation and tourism. It is for some of these \nreasons that the town felt the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nliterally helped secure their economic future.\n  This is a small, rural community in my home State. It is far away \nfrom this floor. LWCF has made a huge difference for Ophir.\n  These are two stories from Colorado, but I know they have been \nreplicated thousands of times across the country and in all 50 States. \nThose stories and accomplishments alone make this bill worth \nsupporting.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Congress wrote and passed LWCF in 1964, and \nit is beyond time to reauthorize it. Senator Burr has shown great \nleadership in crafting a bill to do just that.\n  Conservation policies--from LWCF to farm bill easement programs, from \nwilderness to national parks--are important to the American people. The \nAmerican people support this work. Protecting our land and water is \npart of our everyday lives in Colorado, and I know our State is not the \nonly one.\n  Conserved lands and wide-open spaces are a huge economic driver \nacross the country, a huge part of our culture. They are who we are in \nthe West. We should do right by the American people and reauthorize \nthis program as soon as possible. Then we ought to work together to \nensure that LWCF gets the full and mandatory funding going forward that \nwas promised 50 years ago by Congress.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S818-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S818-S820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING AMBASSADOR ROBERT E. WHITE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on January 13 of this year, our country \nlost one of its most courageous diplomats--Ambassador Robert E. White. \nAmbassador White was 88 years old.\n  I knew Bob White, who graduated from my alma mater, Saint Michael's \nCollege in Vermont, in 1952, just 9 years before I did. But I would \nhave admired him greatly no matter what college he went to because he \nhad the qualities every American diplomat should possess--outstanding \nintellect, unimpeachable integrity, great courage, and a devotion to \nthe ideals and values of this country.\n  In the 1980s, during the civil war in El Salvador, the United \nStates--in what most historians now know was a tragic mistake--\nsteadfastly supported the Salvadoran Army despite abundant evidence \nthat some of its elite units were operating as death squads, \narbitrarily arresting, torturing, and murdering civilians suspected of \nsupporting the FMLN rebels.\n  Unlike some other U.S. officials who turned blind eyes to the heinous \ncrimes that were being committed in the name of fighting communism, \nAmbassador White refused to remain silent. He publicly condemned the \nSalvadoran military and their rightwing backers who were implicated in \natrocities such as the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who \njust days ago was put on the path to sainthood by Pope Francis, and the \nmassacre of four American churchwomen.\n  For speaking out on behalf of the victims of those crimes, Bob White \npaid dearly. He was ridiculed by some in Congress and he was summarily \nremoved from his job by then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig.\n  A January 15 obituary in the Washington Post describes Bob's life and \ncareer. As I was reading it, I could not help but wonder how things \nmight have turned out differently if the powers-that-be during the \n1980s had listened to him. My wife Marcelle and I talked about that. We \nasked ourselves: How many lives might have been saved if the Reagan \nadministration, instead of firing Bob in 1981, had recognized the truth \nof what he was saying and supported negotiations to end the war in El \nSalvador.\n  Instead, the war dragged on for another decade, costing the lives of \ntens of thousands of people, mostly civilians. The tide only started to \nturn in 1989 after the cold-blooded murder of the six Jesuit priests, \ntheir housekeeper and her daughter, at the University of Central \nAmerica. It was a\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nhorrific crime that top-ranking army officers tried to cover up.\n  It was thanks to the late Congressman Joe Moakley and his then-staff \naide, now Congressman Jim McGovern, Bob Woodward, and Salvadoran \ninvestigator Leonel Gomez, whom I also came to know and respect, that \nthe plot was uncovered and the killers identified.\n  During this time I talked often with Bob and I learned even more \nabout those who were involved. After talking with him I went to El \nSalvador. The Salvadoran officials wanted me to see how they were \ninvestigating what had happened. They knew I had prosecuted murder \ncases, and they arranged for me to meet with the country's chief \ninvestigator. As he described the so-called investigation it just \nconfirmed Ambassador White's suspicions. I told the Salvadoran \ninvestigator, and I told the press who were there, that they were \nconducting an obvious cover-up. Anybody who saw what they were calling \nan investigation would realize what they were doing.\n  As I left El Salvador, it was so obvious that rather than shamelessly \nremoving Ambassador White from his post how much better things might \nhave been if the State Department had recognized him for the true \npatriot he was and treated him as an example of what other U.S. \ndiplomats should emulate.\n  Bob didn't stop when he left the Foreign Service. He went on to head \nthe Center for International Policy where he continued his advocacy for \nhuman rights, defending the ideals and championing the causes he \nbelieved in right up to his death.\n  I like to think that all of our Foreign Service Officers aspire to \nfollow in the footsteps of Ambassador Robert White. I hope they will \nlearn from his example. If they do, the United States will be better \nserved and the world will be a better place.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington \nPost obituary, and an article about Ambassador White by Margaret \nO'Brien Steinfels in Commonweal magazine.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 15, 2015]\n\n     Robert E. White, Who Criticized Policy on El Salvador as U.S. \n                         Ambassador, Dies at 88\n\n                         (By Pamela Constable)\n\n       In 1980, when El Salvador was erupting in guerrilla war and \n     military violence, the Carter administration sent a little-\n     known Foreign Service officer into the maelstrom as its new \n     ambassador, hoping he could help the U.S.-backed government \n     there find a reformist middle ground and prevent a full-scale \n     revolution.\n       Instead, Robert E. White became a controversial and \n     outspoken critic of assassinations and massacres being \n     carried out by American-trained military units and private \n     right-wing death squads. His views cost him his diplomatic \n     career but earned him the respect of many Salvadorans and, \n     ultimately, the vindication of history.\n       Mr. White, who had previously served as U.S. ambassador to \n     Paraguay, died Jan. 14 at a hospice in Arlington, Va. He was \n     88. The cause was bladder and prostate cancer, said a \n     daughter, Claire White.\n       His brief tenure in San Salvador was marked by atrocities \n     that became synonymous with right-wing violence during an era \n     of ideological conflicts in Central America: the \n     assassination of Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero in March \n     1980 while he was saying Mass in the national cathedral, and \n     the abduction and killing that December of four American \n     women church workers: Maryknoll sisters Ita Ford and Maura \n     Clark, Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel and lay missioner Jean \n     Donovan.\n       Mr. White, who once said he was inspired to join the \n     Foreign Service by a ``quotient of idealism,'' worked to \n     promote human rights, economic reforms and political \n     negotiations between leftist rebels and El Salvador's civil-\n     military junta. But he soon found himself at loggerheads with \n     the rightist military and land-owning establishment, which \n     had powerful allies in Washington and Miami.\n       Unable to keep silent as security abuses mounted, Mr. White \n     began denouncing them in diplomatic cables, then in \n     interviews and congressional testimony. He famously called \n     rightist political leader Roberto D'Aubuisson a \n     ``pathological killer'' and charged that he had orchestrated \n     the execution of Romero.\n       Mr. White also accused the Salvadoran national guard of \n     murdering the Maryknoll women--two of whom he had dined with \n     the night before their disappearance. He was there when the \n     women's bodies were dug up, and he was quoted as vowing \n     angrily, ``This time the bastards won't get away with it.''\n       ``Bob was transformed by those events, especially the \n     killings of the Maryknolls, from a diplomatic functionary \n     into a person whose ethical and moral convictions conflicted \n     with his job,'' said Francisco Altschul, the current \n     Salvadoran ambassador to the United States, who was a leftist \n     political activist at the time. ``It took a lot of courage \n     and integrity to say what he did and to face the \n     consequences.''\n       Mr. White's outspoken posture drew praise from human rights \n     groups but death threats in El Salvador. His wife once \n     described being warned by her security guard in their \n     affluent San Salvador enclave that ``your neighbors would \n     like to kill you.''\n       The ambassador also faced strong opposition from powerful \n     Washington hawks including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who had \n     been annoyed with Mr. White's earlier human rights activism \n     in Paraguay and compared his posting to El Salvador to ``a \n     torch tossed in a pool of oil.''\n       By 1981, after the election of Ronald Reagan as president \n     ushered in a new era of anticommunist fervor in Washington, \n     Mr. White's days as ambassador were numbered. After coming \n     into conflict with Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr., \n     Mr. White was removed from his post less than two weeks after \n     Reagan took office. He soon retired from the Foreign Service \n     after a 25-year career, claiming that he had been forced out \n     for political reasons.\n       ``In El Salvador, Bob believed the authoritarian regime was \n     morally repugnant and needed to change, but he worked very \n     hard to avoid the escalation of war and negotiate a \n     solution,'' said William M. LeoGrande, a professor at \n     American University and author of ``Our Own Backyard: The \n     United States in Central America, 1977-1992.''\n       ``The tragedy was that U.S. policy changed, El Salvador \n     became a Cold War proxy, and another decade of conflict \n     followed,'' LeoGrande said.\n       Once free of the constraints of diplomacy, Mr. White spent \n     much of the next three decades speaking his mind on U.S. \n     policy and official abuses in Latin America, while holding a \n     series of jobs, including a professorship at Simmons College \n     in Massachusetts and a senior associate position at the \n     Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.\n       He was a sarcastic critic of Washington's Cold War-era \n     policies in Latin America, particularly what he called the \n     ``primitive anti-communism'' that produced the U.S. embargo \n     against Fidel Castro's Cuba and support for hemispheric \n     dictators such as Gen. Augusto Pinochet in Chile and Gen. \n     Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay. He accused the Reagan \n     administration in 1984 of covering up its knowledge of \n     D'Aubuisson's role in the Romero assassination. \n     Administration officials denied the allegations.\n       In 1989, Mr. White was named president of the Center for \n     International Policy, a liberal think tank in Washington, and \n     held that position at the time of his death. He also visited \n     numerous countries, from Haiti to Afghanistan, with \n     delegations to monitor elections and human rights.\n       Robert Edward White was born Sept. 21, 1926, in Melrose, \n     Mass. He served in the Navy as a radio operator in the \n     Pacific during World War II. He attended Saint Michael's \n     College in Vermont on the G.I. Bill, graduating in 1952, and \n     completed a master's degree in 1954 at Tufts University's \n     Fletcher School in Medford, Mass.\n       He joined the Foreign Service in 1955 and served in a \n     variety of positions related to Latin America. He was posted \n     in Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Nicaragua, served as \n     regional director of the Peace Corps and was a U.S. \n     representative to the Organization of American States. He was \n     ambassador to Paraguay from 1977 to 1980, when he was \n     transferred to El Salvador.\n       Survivors include his wife of 59 years, Maryanne Cahill \n     White of Alexandria, Va.; three children, Chris White of \n     Manassas, Va., Claire White of Cambridge, Mass., and Mary Lou \n     White of Evanston, Ill.; a brother, David White of \n     Alexandria; and three grandchildren.\n       A son, Kevin White, died in 2009; a daughter, Laura White, \n     died in 2014.\n       Mr. White always described himself as a diplomat and a \n     democrat rather than a leftist or moral zealot.\n       ``I don't go out looking for windmills to joust,'' he told \n     an interviewer from Commonweal magazine in 2001. ``And the \n     idea that I'm some sort of martyr? Well, I'm not.''\n       He argued that to avoid ending up on the wrong side of \n     history or in Vietnam-style military quagmires, the United \n     States needed to seek negotiated solutions to all conflicts, \n     maintain a moral component in its dealings with all regimes \n     and respect the will of local populations.\n       ``The military dictators of the world fear democracy more \n     than anything else,'' he told the Fletcher Forum, a \n     publication of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, in \n     1981. ``U.S. policy toward Latin America can be summed up in \n     three words: fear of revolution. Because we feared \n     revolution, we consistently opposed the forces of change \n     while uncritically supporting dictatorships and small \n     economic elites. We blinked at repression and participated in \n     the perversion of democracy throughout the hemisphere.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From Commonweal Magazine, Jan. 19, 2015]\n\n                       Robert E. White, 1926-2015\n\n                    (By Margaret O'Brien Steinfels)\n\n       Robert White, who spent a quarter century in the U.S. \n     Foreign Service and was ambassador to El Salvador at the \n     beginning of its civil war, seems never to have forgotten \n     anything. Among the things he never forgot\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\n     were the murders of Jean Donovan and Sisters Dorothy Kazel, \n     Maura Clarke, and Ita Ford. White was present when their \n     bodies were recovered from shallow graves on December 4, \n     1980. He returned to the embassy as angry as his wife, \n     MaryAnne, had ever seen him. It changed him, she told me in \n     2001, when I interviewed her for a profile of Bob I wrote for \n     Commonweal. Indeed, his refusal to cover up Salvadoran \n     military involvement in their murders--and those of thousands \n     of Salvadorans, including Archbishop Oscar Romero--led to his \n     resignation from the Foreign Service in 1981. He continued \n     his work for democratic reforms and human rights in the \n     Caribbean and Latin America at the Carnegie Endowment for \n     Peace and the Center for International Policy.\n       Bob, who died on January 13 at the age of eighty-eight, was \n     a great interview; in 2001 I left his Washington office with \n     tapes full of details. He could summon conversations from \n     years past and recount policy details lost in the fog of \n     diplomatic maneuvering. Not only did he remember names and \n     details of long-past events, he was also forthcoming in his \n     analysis of U.S. foreign policy. He had joined the Foreign \n     Service in 1955; after President John Kennedy announced the \n     ``Alliance for Progress,'' he requested assignment in Latin \n     America. Designed to encourage democracy and human rights, \n     the new policy was a turn away from, as White put it, doing \n     the work of ``the colonial office.'' That derogatory title \n     summed up the tangled political and economic relationship \n     between the U.S. and its neighbors to the South. Even when \n     support in Washington faltered after Kennedy's assassination, \n     White tried to keep the policies of the Alliance in play. \n     Full-blown Cold War policies had returned in 1968 with \n     Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, coloring White's years in \n     Honduras, Nicaragua, Columbia, Paraguay, and El Salvador. \n     While serving as U.S. representative to the Organization of \n     American States, he faced down Kissinger, whose statements \n     supporting Pinochet were contrary to U.S. policy. This \n     brought White to the edge of dismissal; he won the battle and \n     stayed on to serve in his final post, El Salvador.\n       A long history of interventions and exploitation of the \n     continent's natural resources made the United States the \n     imperial power that both democratic reformers and Marxists \n     loved to hate. White saw in the reformers the path to more \n     democratic governments and respect for human rights. \n     Washington, focused on Soviet threats and Fidel Castro's \n     support for guerrillas, increasingly favored the dictators \n     and caudillos. Secret agreements were struck between U.S. \n     military and intelligence agencies and their Latin \n     counterparts. This often put the Department of State, though \n     the official representative of the United States, on the \n     margins of both policy and practices. Jimmy Carter's victory \n     in 1976 pressed U.S. policy once again into a human rights \n     agenda; that ended with Ronald Reagan's election in 1980.\n       White had long found himself the middleman in many of the \n     struggles between Latin American governments and reformers as \n     well as with his own government. His job was to work with \n     each country's political leaders, notwithstanding their anti-\n     democratic policies. While they might tolerate his cajoling \n     and plain speaking about land reform, fair elections, and \n     human rights, they usually had a U.S. military representative \n     or CIA agent to turn to for direct contact with Washington \n     (often someone on the ambassador's own embassy staff). At the \n     same time, White made it his business to seek out and get to \n     know sympathetic academics, journalists, labor leaders, \n     clergy, and reformers in the Christian Democratic tradition. \n     He understood the central role the Catholic Church, \n     especially its cardinals and bishops, played among the social \n     and political elites. His friendship with some and parrying \n     with others gave him behind-the-scenes influence; his \n     attendance at Mass could be the occasion for a pointed homily \n     on topics a prelate might otherwise avoid. If White was \n     regarded with suspicion and contempt, especially by \n     Salvadoran politicians and military, his reputation among \n     Americans (and American Catholics) opposed to their endemic \n     violence and abuse was hardly better. The U.S. ambassador was \n     seen to be compromised by his position and not to be trusted.\n       After his resignation, White more than any U.S. official \n     exposed the hidden ties between U.S. military and \n     intelligence and their Latin American counterparts. He \n     testified against Salvadoran military for their complicity in \n     torture and murder, especially of the American churchwomen. \n     He never ceased pressing for better political and economic \n     conditions in Latin America, termination of sanctions against \n     Cuba, and an end to human rights abuses not only by \n     dictatorships but also by democracies. Bob's work as an \n     ambassador--from the United States at its best--never really \n     ended.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, for the second time in 2 days our friends \nacross the aisle have killed important funding for the Department of \nHomeland Security, a bill worth about $40 billion that was passed by \nthe House of Representatives and sent over for the Senate to consider.\n  I continue to be amazed, watching Member after Member across the \naisle come down here and vote to block this important piece of \nlegislation, and then, in the same breath, accuse the majority of \nthreatening to shut down the government. It strikes me as surreal. They \nare the ones filibustering the funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and they are claiming we are trying to shut down the \ngovernment.\n  I know it is sometimes hard to explain what happens in the Halls of \nCongress and Washington, DC, but my folks back home can't understand \nhow they can block something and then claim they are for it--and then \nthe people who are actually advocating for the passage of this funding, \nclaiming somehow we are going to shut down the government. It just \ndoesn't make any sense, and it is the kind of double talk I think \npeople have come to despise and associate with Washington, DC, and \nCongress.\n  That is one reason voters so overwhelmingly repudiated the status quo \non November 4 and said: We want new management, and we don't want \nbusiness as usual in Washington, DC.\n  Speaking of saying one thing and doing another, on this side of the \naisle we pointed out some of the tough talk from some of our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, Senate Democrats, last fall when the \nPresident made clear he intended to follow through on a series of \nunilateral immigration actions that he, himself, on 22 different \noccasions had said he did not have the authority to take.\n  Indeed, it is my view this is unconstitutional. He can't pass or make \na new law without following the constitutional pathway, which requires \nCongress to consider it, vote on it--both Houses--and then send it to \nthe President for signature. For the President just simply to make it \nup out of whole cloth is dangerous, to say the least.\n  I guess if the President doesn't like any other aspect of our laws, \nthis President--or any future President--might claim the sole authority \nto change it without following the procedures laid out in the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I know what the President did last fall in this Executive action on \nimmigration makes a number of our colleagues across the aisle \nuncomfortable because they are quoted in the newspaper as saying so. \nBut now somehow in this mind meld going on, on the minority side, they \nnow are walking in lockstep, voting against proceeding to consider this \nHomeland Security appropriations bill, even though, by my count, at \nleast seven Democrats expressed deep concern with the President's \nunconstitutional action.\n  Here is what the Senator from West Virginia said, talking about the \nPresident:\n\n       I wish he wouldn't do it.\n\n  The junior Senator from Minnesota said:\n\n       I have concerns about executive action.\n\n  The same kind of concerns I have just expressed.\n  The senior Senator from Missouri felt the same way, saying about the \nPresident's unilateral action:\n\n       How this is coming about makes me uncomfortable, [and] I \n     think it probably makes most Missourians uncomfortable.\n\n  It made the President of the United States uncomfortable, so \nuncomfortable on 22 occasions he said he couldn't do it--and then he \ndid it.\n  It makes me extremely uncomfortable, too, and it certainly makes the \nvast majority of the people I represent back in Texas uncomfortable as \nwell.\n  We are a nation of laws. I know we say that all the time, but it is \none of the things that distinguishes us from so much of the rest of the \nworld where, no matter who you are--whether you are the President of \nthe United States or the most humble person in the country--the rules \napply to you equally. That is what it says over the top of the Supreme \nCourt Building. Look at the front of the building. It says, ``Equal \nJustice Under Law.''\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\n  The idea that the President can--after 22 times saying he didn't have \nthe authority--become a law unto himself and try to get away with it is \njust unprecedented and it is dangerous.\n  Despite the fact that many of our colleagues on the Democratic side \nhave said what the President did made them feel uncomfortable, they \napparently lost their sense of discomfort when they voted in lockstep \nto block this funding bill.\n  In order to justify their filibuster, a number of Senate Democrats \nhave said: I don't like the bill the House sent over because it has \nsome things in it that I don't like. I like the funding, but I don't \nlike the spending restrictions.\n  I know the Presiding Officer understands as well that we can't change \na piece of legislation in the Senate unless we vote to get on the bill. \nIt is the same thing as saying you can't finish a journey until you \nstart it, and our friends across the aisle are unwilling to even start \nthat journey.\n  To state the obvious, if our friends in the minority would like to \nchange the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, they ought to \nstop blocking it from being debated and amend it. If they have ideas, \nlet's bring them to the floor.\n  One of the things that has distinguished this 114th Congress from the \nway things ran last year is we have actually had an open amendment \nprocess. Indeed, we found out in the first month of this year and this \nnew Congress that we had more votes than all of last year combined.\n  So there is going to be an opportunity for anybody with a better idea \nto come down and get a vote. But this whole idea of saying, I am not \neven going to participate in the process and--worse than that--I am \ngoing to block a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security \nbecause I don't like what is in it is just--well, it is just impossible \nto explain.\n  We know some of our colleagues on the other side are using this to \nplay games because they basically have admitted it.\n  Just yesterday in the Huffington Post, the senior Senator from New \nYork, a member of the leadership of his own party, said that ``it is \nreally fun to be in the minority.'' That strikes me as extraordinarily \ncynical because we were not sent to play games, particularly with \nmatters as important as homeland security. That is not what the \nAmerican people sent us to do, and that is certainly not what they \nratified or what they voted for on November 4.\n  They rejected business as usual in Washington, DC, and they said: \nLet's do something different, and we may not necessarily endorse \neverything that Republicans stand for, but, boy, we are sure going to \ngive them a chance to show that they can do better than the management \nin the 113th Congress.\n  I think we began to make some positive steps in the right direction, \nparticularly with passing important legislation.\n  We passed three important pieces of legislation in the 114th \nCongress: the veterans suicide bill that we voted on earlier this week, \nwe have passed the terrorism risk insurance bill, and we passed, as the \nPresiding Officer knows, a very important piece of legislation to our \neconomy and job creation and energy security known as the Keystone XL \nPipeline. That is not bad. That is not bad.\n  We would like to do what I think falls in the category of governance \n101, something that is pretty basic. We have to pay to keep the \ngovernment functioning and particularly the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I know our friends on the other side of the aisle say: We don't like \nthe bill the way it is, and we don't like the tools that are being used \nby the majority party to rein in the President's Executive action. \nWell, I am not going to make any apology for that because what the \nPresident did was unconstitutional. It was illegal. He has no authority \nto do that on his own. Again, it is not just me saying that. It is not \njust my opinion. It is his opinion. How cynical. How cynical.\n  I guess he figures he is going to get away with it, and our friends \non the other side of the aisle are going to be the enablers, to enable \nthe President to get away with something he said he didn't have the \nauthority to do on 22 times.\n  I sure wouldn't want the folks back home to see me in that same \nlight. I would have a hard time explaining to my constituents back \nhome, saying, yes, I am helping the President do something that he said \nwas illegal and he didn't have the authority to do, and we are going to \nplay games by blocking important funding for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity in order to facilitate him getting away with it.\n  That is a cynical game and it is dangerous, particularly in the \nthreat environment we are living in.\n  So I come to the floor for the third time this week to ask our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--especially those who have \nboldly stood up to their own President, a member of their own party, \nthe leader of their own party, a few short months ago--to ask them to \nstand up again and to tell the President and to tell their own \nleadership that we want to have a Senate that actually works, where the \nminority and the majority get to participate through an open amendment \nprocess. But we are going to respect the Constitution, we are going to \nrespect this institution and, yes, we are going to respect the role of \nthe Presidency under our Constitution enough to rein in this \nPresident's overreach, and we are not going to jeopardize funding for \nthe Department of Homeland Security and allow that to be held hostage \nto the President's unconstitutional act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, earlier this week we learned about the \nyoung Jordanian pilot who was horrifically burned alive in a cage at \nthe hands of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL. This is \nthe same group that haunts us with images of beheadings and mass \nmurders week after week and enslaves women into servitude. It is the \nsame group that recently declared it is determined to ``reach \nAmerica.''\n  My friends, we live in a world that is scary. And it is not just \nISIL. It is the lone wolves who gather ammunition and equipment and \ncarefully draft plans to attack us where we work, such as the attack we \nsaw last year in Ottawa and last month in Paris, as well as the \nindividual from Ohio who was planning to attack the Capitol right here \nin Washington, DC.\n  It is pandemics such as Ebola. It is the criminals trying to traffic \nillegal drugs and human beings across our borders and through our ports \nof entry. It is those individuals trying to sabotage our airplanes and \nour trains. It is those people trying to attack our computer networks \nand critical infrastructure.\n  But thanks in large part to the work of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and its employees, Americans are safe--at least a lot safer \nthan we otherwise would be. Our airplanes and our airports are \nprotected 24/7. Our borders and our ports throughout our country are \nsecure. Trafficking of illegal drugs and human beings is better \ncontrolled, and our critical infrastructure networks are better \nprotected.\n  For anybody who thinks it makes sense to put the Department of \nHomeland Security out of business, to put it on the sidelines at this \npoint in time in this world in which we live, I ask: Have we lost our \nminds? I hope not. I hope not. Yet today, here in the Congress, we are \nlocked in a political debate about whether we fund that very agency \nthat is charged with keeping Americans safe--those who live here with \nus--from the Islamic State and any other number of additional threats. \nThat is irresponsible and shameful behavior. In order for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to officially and effectively carry out \nits critical role in combating the multiple and ever-changing threats \nour country faces, the Department needs fiscal certainty and the full \nsupport of this Congress.\n  Throughout this week I joined nearly half of my Senate colleagues to \nreject the House funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security, \nH.R. 240, which contains riders that block the President's recent \nimmigration actions. Many of our colleagues on both\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\nsides of the aisle have significant concerns with these amendments, and \nthe President has promised he would veto this bill if these amendments \nwere not stripped from it.\n  My colleagues' insistence that we accept these House amendments is \njeopardizing timely enactment of a vital and bipartisan Homeland \nSecurity funding bill and threatens to prolong the crippling budget \nuncertainty the Department of Homeland Security has been operating \nunder since last year.\n  On top of that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice, this House bill with the amendments would increase deficits \nover the next 10 years by a total of $7.5 billion. Instead of helping \nour Nation move forward with our economic recovery and our deficit \nreduction, this bill would move us backwards.\n  I understand why some of our colleagues are upset about the \nPresident's immigration policies. We can and we should have a debate \nabout those concerns. We started the process just yesterday in the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, where I serve \nas ranking member.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that we wouldn't even be here having this \nconversation today or at that hearing yesterday if Congress had \nfinished the job we began some 2 years ago in the Senate, right here on \nthis floor. As most of my colleagues in this Chamber will recall, two-\nthirds of the Senate came together in 2013. We passed by a wide margin \na comprehensive immigration reform bill. Was it perfect? No, but we \ntook significant steps to fix our badly broken and outdated immigration \nsystem and to enhance the security of our borders.\n  At the same time, the bill would have reduced our budget deficit by \nnearly $1 trillion--$1 trillion--over the next 20 years, according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office. Let me repeat that. Comprehensive \nimmigration reform adopted here by a two-thirds vote would reduce our \ndeficit by nearly $1 trillion over the next 20 years. We demonstrated \nalmost 2 years ago that we can debate our Nation's immigration policies \nin a thoughtful way in the Senate, and, I think, over in the House. \nThere is no reason why we can't do it again. We need to have this \ndebate on the Senate floor as we did last Congress.\n  We need to have this debate in committees as we did in the last \nCongress. We need to have this debate in our towns and States across \nAmerica as we did in the last Congress. But we should not have this \ndebate while we are deciding the fate of the budget of the Nation's \nmost critical national security agency, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I am not the only one who thinks so. All three former Department of \nHomeland Security Secretaries--Republicans Tom Ridge and Michael \nChertoff and Democrat Janet Napolitano--wrote to the Republican \nleadership last week and this is what they said:\n\n       We do not question your desire to have a larger debate \n     about the Nation's immigration laws. However, we cannot \n     emphasize enough that the DHS's responsibilities are much \n     broader than its responsibility to oversee the federal \n     immigration agencies and to protect our borders. . . . And \n     funding for the entire agency should not be put in jeopardy \n     by the debate about immigration.\n\n  The Washington Post's editorial board has also weighed in. Last week, \nhere is what they wrote:\n\n       If congressional Republicans want to attack those--\n\n  Talking about immigration--\n\n     actions responsibly, with discrete legislation, they are free \n     to try. . . . However, it is another thing to wield their \n     frustration over immigration as a cudgel, holding hostage an \n     entire department of government that is critical to the \n     nation's security. That is as irresponsible as it is \n     politically ill-advised.\n\n  I could not agree more. We need to focus now on doing the job we were \nsent here to do--to provide the funding necessary to keep America safe \nin an ever more dangerous world. Once we have done that, we should \nengage in an urgent debate on how to amend America's immigration \npolicies for the 21st century.\n  If we choose instead to continue down this irresponsible path toward \na shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, we will actually put \nAmerica at greater risk. Why would we do that? Why would we do that?\n  If we allow the Department of Homeland Security to shut down, here is \nwhat is going to happen--a few things that will happen. First of all, \nover 50,000 TSA security screeners keeping terrorists off of airplanes \nare going to go without pay. We want them to do their jobs, but we are \njust not going to pay them for it. Over 40,000 Customs and Border \nProtection officers needed to keep our borders secure are going to go \nwithout pay, too. We want them to do their jobs. We are not going to \npay them, either.\n\n  In addition, over 13,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, \nenforcing our immigration laws and combatting human and drug \ntrafficking, are going to go without pay too. We want them to do their \njobs. We are not going to pay them, either. Essentially, a large part \nof our Federal homeland security personnel would be working on an IOU. \nNow you say: How is that fair? How is that fair? Well, it is not. Even \nif we avoid a shutdown but continue to keep the Department on a \ncontinuing resolution, we prevent the men and women who work there from \ndoing their jobs as effectively and as efficiently as they can.\n  For example, we will not be able to replace obsolete surveillance \ntechnology along the high-risk areas of our border with Mexico. Our \nNation will have significantly fewer resources to respond to any future \nsurges of unaccompanied minors along the Southwest border. Morale will \ncontinue to degrade at the Department, which already ranks dead last \nfor morale among other major Federal agencies. This is not how we want \nto be treated. It is no way for us to treat the men and women who are \nworking around the clock to keep us safe.\n  It is also an egregious waste of money. As we have learned over the \nyears, crisis budgeting costs taxpayers millions of dollars. This \nlatest situation is no exception. Employee hiring and research efforts \nat the Department would come to a halt. The contracts for a variety of \nsecurity projects would be stalled and would need to be renegotiated, \nin all likelihood at a higher cost to taxpayers.\n  For example, a continuing resolution would delay a $600 million \ncontract to build a national security cutter that the Coast Guard \nurgently needs--keep it from being awarded. This cutter is critical to \nstopping the illegal trafficking off of our shores and ports of entry, \nincluding illegal immigration and drug and human trafficking. That is \njust one example.\n  As any business owner would tell us, this is not the way to run a \nbusiness. It is certainly no way to run a vital national security \nagency of the United States.\n  So how are we going to remedy this situation? Fortunately, we have a \nsolution sitting right in front of us, the bill that Senators Mikulski \nand Shaheen have introduced. It is S. 272. It is a clean fiscal year \n2015 appropriations bill, which both Democrats and Republicans agreed \nto just this past December, 2 months ago. This measure provides the \nstable full-year funding that the Department of Homeland Security and \nour national security need without demanding a ransom.\n  In closing, I want to urge, as strongly as I can, my colleagues in \nthis Chamber, in this body, to join me in doing the right thing. \nSupport passage of this clean full-year appropriations legislation for \nthe Department of Homeland Security. Reject the amendments approved by \nthe House. Once we have done that, let's begin a fulsome and badly \nneeded debate that will enable us to hammer out a thoughtful, 21st \ncentury immigration policy for America, a policy that is fair, a policy \nthat will significantly reduce our Nation's budget deficit, and a \npolicy that will strengthen the economic recovery in this country that \nis now underway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S822-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S822-S823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, the Affordable Care Act is working. It is \nworking better, frankly, than many of us who were there at its \ninception believed it would at this early stage in its implementation. \nThe numbers are pretty hard to argue with. You have got now upwards of \n10 million people who are on either private insurance with tax credits \nto help them get that coverage, or are on Medicaid through different \nState plans.\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\n  That is a big deal, because in just about 1 year, we have reduced the \nnumber of people without insurance by 25 percent in this country. In my \nState of Connecticut, which probably has the best-run exchange in the \ncountry, we have actually reduced the number of people without \ninsurance by 50 percent.\n  Better news is the quality is getting better. Some of the \nmeasurements we most closely watch to decide whether people are getting \nbetter care--things such as hospital-acquired infections and \nreadmission rates after surgery--are going down. That is really good \nnews. Of course, maybe the best news of all is the taxpayers are saving \nmoney, an extraordinary leveling off of health care inflation.\n  Health care spending never goes down from year to year. We used to \nhave 7-percent to 8-percent increases in spending on an annual basis. \nWe are now seeing 2-percent or 3-percent increases. In fact, the lowest \nrate of increase since we started tracking health care spending \nhappened in this last year. Federal taxpayers are saving, on average, \n$1,000 per Medicare beneficiary compared to what the Congressional \nBudget Office thought we would be spending when we passed the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  That does not mean we do not have a lot of work to do. But it does \nmean the conversation we should be having today is about perfecting the \nAffordable Care Act, making it work even better, not repealing the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  It is not just me. I have been down to the floor over and over again \nto make this case, that the numbers simply do not lie. The press, \nuniversally, perhaps, reporting on this overwhelming avalanche of data, \ntells us that the Affordable Care Act is working. I literally in the 5 \nminutes before I came to the floor did a quick search to see what \npeople were saying. New York magazine: ``Four new studies. ObamaCare is \nworking incredibly well.''\n  Forbes: ``More solid proof that ObamaCare is working.''\n  Washington Post: ``Despite the critics, ObamaCare works.''\n  Business Insider: ``Major new study says ObamaCare is working.''\n  Rolling Stone: ``ObamaCare: It's working.''\n  I could do a full 10 minutes just on the headlines that tell you the \nAffordable Care Act is working. But instead of talking about making it \nwork better, today we are talking again about repealing it. The House \ntook, I think, their 56th vote to repeal all or part of the bill. This \nmorning several of our colleagues unveiled a proposal to replace the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Now I give my colleagues credit. It has been 5 years. This is the \nfirst time we have seen even a memo on what would be this replacement \nwe have been hearing a lot about. But it is still a memo, as far as I \ncan tell. We do not have any legislative text or any CBO score. But I \nwanted to come to the floor and talk for a minute about what this \nreplacement would mean.\n  The replacement memo we looked at this morning, offered by two of our \nSenate colleagues and one of our House colleagues, all really \nthoughtful legislators on this issue--I want to give them credit for \nputting this on the table. It would really mean the retraction of \nhealth care coverage for millions of Americans. People who have finally \nbeen able to afford health care because of the Affordable Care Act now \nwould go back onto the rolls of the uninsured.\n  Why? Well, for two major reasons. Their plan reduces the number of \npeople who would be eligible for the subsidies by millions, and then \ngreatly reduces the amount of the subsidy. They admit that is the best \nway to get coverage, so we are not arguing any longer, at least, over \nwhether providing tax credits in order for people to buy private \ninsurance is the right way to go about expanding coverage. They want to \nlessen the amount of money we are providing in tax credits, meaning a \nlot less people are going to get insured. So you would have millions \nand millions of people who would go back onto the rolls of the \nuninsured, people who would once again be at the mercy of insurance \ncompanies, would lose everything, their house, their savings, their \ncar, just because their kid got sick.\n  But the second thing it does is really puts insurance companies back \nin charge of our health care. It gets rid of the prohibition on gender \nrating, which is a complicated way of saying that in the old system, \ninsurance companies charged women more just because they were women. \nThe Affordable Care Act does not allow that any longer. But that is \nwhat we would go back to under this alternative. It used to be that \ninsurance companies would say: You are only going to get a certain \namount of insurance per year and then we cut you off. Well, for a \nfamily I know in Simsbury, CT, whose son has a fairly rare blood \ndisorder, that meant they had to pull out of their savings every year \nin order to afford his expensive drugs. That discriminatory treatment \nwould come back.\n  While the bill tries to address the issue of preexisting conditions, \nit seems to say that you would have a one-time chance to get on an \naffordable care policy if you had a preexisting condition. But if you \ndid not sign up in that opening moment, in that special offer, then you \nwould not be able to sign up later on. So if you got sick later on, it \nwould be too late for you, or if you lost your coverage at any point, \nlike, on average, 89 million Americans have over the last 3 years, you \nwould not get the chance to have insurance with a preexisting condition \nat the same rate as people without preexisting conditions.\n  What this bill is about is people paying more and getting less. It is \nabout going back to the day when people could not afford health care \nand they lost everything simply because they or a loved one, a spouse \nor a child, got sick. Never mind the fact that some of the pieces I \nthought we all agreed on are repealed in this proposal. The doughnut \nhole is an outrage, the idea that seniors who are trying to buy \nprescription drugs on Medicare get a little bit of coverage, then no \ncoverage, then a lot of coverage. Middle-income seniors cannot afford \nthat gap in coverage.\n  Well, the Affordable Care Act effectively eliminates the doughnut \nhole. That has saved seniors $11 billion since 2010. This memo we have \nseen from the Republican side would apparently get rid of those \nsavings, putting the doughnut hole back, putting millions of seniors \nback on the hook for all of these costs when they lose coverage. This \neffort to replace the Affordable Care Act is a giant step backwards for \nmillions of American families.\n  Here is the conversation we should be having: We should be talking \nabout how to make this law work even better. It is a major concession, \nfrankly, from the Republicans that tax credits are the appropriate way \nto get people more insurance. It is a concession that we should be at \nleast addressing the issue of discrimination against sick people. But \nthe protection they are offering is minimal, and the expense that would \nbe passed on to seniors, families, hard-working Americans is immense.\n  So I am looking forward to seeing this introduced as a piece of \nlegislation. I am looking forward to seeing the CBO score on it. \nClearly the American people do not want us to have this debate over \nrepeal any longer. They are sick and tired of it. They want us to be \ntalking about creating jobs, protecting this country, making college \nmore affordable, and making small, meaningful changes to the Affordable \nCare Act to make it work even better.\n  The data does not lie. The numbers do not lie. The increasing stories \nof people all across this country who are benefitting from the \nAffordable Care Act do not lie. The Affordable Care Act is working. We \nshould stop having this tired debate over repealing it and replacing it \nwith something that is much lesser coverage for much more cost and \ninvest in a conversation about how to make sure the good news continues \nabout the Affordable Care Act working for millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S823-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S823-S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am disappointed that earlier today \nonce\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\nagain our Democratic colleagues have--like the palace guard protecting \nthe White House--blocked and filibustered moving to the Homeland \nSecurity bill--a bill that the House has passed and that would fully \nfund every lawful program of Homeland Security.\n  The House has passed a bill that funds Homeland Security, they have \nsent it to the Senate, and the Democrats are refusing to let it come to \nthe floor to even be debated. They are filibustering a motion to \nproceed to the bill, where amendments can be offered.\n  Senator McConnell has said we will have amendments. Senator Collins \nhas already reached out with amendments she thinks have bipartisan \nsupport. That is the way the process in the Senate is supposed to work. \nThat is what we should do.\n  Amazingly and incredibly, our Democratic colleagues say that the \nRepublicans want to shut down Homeland Security and that the Democrats \nare trying to keep that from happening. They claim Republicans have put \nriders on the bill. But I would say that I think, if there is any logic \nleft in this body, that the riders were put on Homeland Security \nunilaterally and unlawfully by the President of the United States. He \nput those riders on Homeland Security when--after Congress refused to \npass his amnesty bill that had in it the right to work for people who \nare illegally in the country--he gave legal status to people illegally \nin the country; he gave them a Social Security card with a photo ID--he \nwants to provide all of them with that and let them participate in \nSocial Security and Medicare. That is what the President wants to do. \nAll of those things fall outside the law governing Homeland Security \nand all of the items and programs that are involved in that homeland \nsecurity process. This amnesty is outside of it. In fact, amnesty is \nnot pro-homeland security, it is anti-homeland security. It is anti-\nlaw. It rewards people who have violated the law. It is going to create \na mechanism where these people who get these photo IDs will have the \nability to take any job in America, and nobody is going to check them \nin any effective way. In fact, it is quite clear that the \nAdministration doesn't even intend to have personal interviews with \nthem because the Administration doesn't have the time or the people. \nBut they are spending money out of the lawful part of Homeland Security \nto create an office across the river in Crystal City, and they are \nhiring 1,000 people to process these individuals.\n  So Congress simply said: Mr. President, we oppose that. We won't \napprove that process. You said 20 times it is not lawful for you to \ngrant amnesty, but you have changed your mind and you are going to do \nit anyway. So we are going to fund all the programs of Homeland \nSecurity just like last year--with some increase, I suppose--but we are \nnot going to fund this office across the river to make people lawful \nwho, under the law, are unlawful. That is what the bill is.\n  So my Democratic colleagues say that somehow this doesn't fund \nHomeland Security and that Congress has no right to decide what it \nfunds and doesn't fund. But it is a fundamental power of the people's \nelected representatives to control the purse strings, to decide what \ngets funded and what does not get funded. Congress can fund programs \nthat it doesn't like as a matter of policy or it could defund those \nprograms, and it could defund programs it believes are illegal.\n  As a matter of fact, I would say Congress has an absolute duty to \nrefuse to fund programs set up by the President of the United States \nthat he would like to carry out if Congress believes those programs are \nunlawful. So that is where we are.\n  It is beyond my comprehension that our friends on the other side--at \nleast seven have said in clear statements that they oppose the \nPresident's Executive amnesty, and they are now voting unanimously to \nnot go to the bill and even allow it to be considered.\n  Now, one thing is not being considered enough. This amnesty is more \nthan prosecutorial discretion. The President of the United States is \ngiving work authorizations to more than 4 million people, and for the \nmost part they are adults. Almost all of them are adults. Even the so-\ncalled DACA proportion--many of them are in their thirties. So this is \nan adult job legalization program. And we talked about why Congress \ndidn't approve and it didn't pass, and why the President shouldn't \ncarry out on his own that which Congress has rejected and for which he \nhas no lawful basis.\n  But let's go further. Let's ask on behalf of the American people, the \nAmerican working people, is this a good idea? Is it a good idea at this \ntime of low wages--a time when the percentage of Americans in the \nworking population who are actually working and have jobs is at the \nlowest it has been since the 1970s? Is this the right time to advance \nanother 5 million people into the job market--a time when we admit 1 \nmillion lawful immigrants to the United States a year? I believe we \nhave 700,000 guest workers from abroad working in America on top of \nthat, and we're adding another 5 million who can take any job in the \neconomy?\n  Frankly, the problem, colleagues, is not that we have a shortage of \nworkers in America; the problem is we have a shortage of jobs and we \nhave the lowest workforce participation that we have had in a long \ntime.\n  Gallup recently noted that if someone works just a few hours a week, \nthey are counted as an employee. People used to work 40 hours--overtime \nmaybe--now they work 10 hours a week, and they are counted as an \nemployee. If you are an engineer working at a fast food restaurant, you \nare counted as employed. So there are a whole bunch of factors that \nthey know are out there that are causing the American people to be very \nconcerned about their futures, even though politicians in Washington \nare saying things are so great.\n  Wages fell in December--I think the last full month for which we have \nthe data--5 cents an hour. So it is not getting much better. That is \nnot disputable data. We want wages to go up, not down.\n  So I think this is all important, and it is time for Congress to \nunderstand whom we represent and whom our focus should be on. We want \nto treat people who come to America well. We want to give them every \nlawful benefit when they immigrate to America properly. And people who \nenter unlawfully need to be treated humanely and processed properly, \nand the laws need to be enforced. We don't want to mistreat those \npeople.\n  But what is it that is critical? What is critical is that we know \nwhom we represent. We represent lawful immigrants and citizens of the \nUnited States of America. Our duty is to them. We should establish an \nimmigration policy that serves their interests.\n  Years ago a witness before the Judiciary Committee told that \ncommittee--and I was a member--that, `well, if your policy is to do \nwhat is best for poor people around the world, it is almost always the \nright thing to let them come to America. If they get in trouble health-\nwise, the hospitals will take care of them. Their children get a free \neducation. If they get in trouble otherwise, this country helps them.'\n  But what we have to decide is what is a good policy for the United \nStates of America and how to execute the national interests, not \nspecial interests.\n  Let me point this out. The numbers are stunning, colleagues, and we \nare going to have to learn these numbers. I am going to insist that we \nknow what we are doing as we go forward with the ever-expanding \nprograms to bring in more workers from abroad.\n  One of the more remarkable but least-reported trends in our economy \nis the disproportionate share of jobs being filled by foreign workers. \nMost people do not understand this. The following is new data from the \nBureau of Labor Statistics--not my opinion; these numbers come straight \nfrom BLS tables. I challenge my colleagues, if these numbers are wrong, \ntell us they are wrong. It comes right off the BLS table. I don't think \nthey are disputable. I don't think anybody is disputing them.\n\n  The total number of persons employed in the United States has \nincreased by 1 million since 2007. Frankly, that is not many jobs at \nall over that number of years. It sounds like a lot, but it is not \nmany. So we have had a total increase of 1 million jobs since 2007, but \nduring this same time the number of jobs for U.S.-born workers--\ncitizens--declined by 1 million.\n  How is that possible? During this same time the number of foreign \nworkers with jobs increased by 2 million. So\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nthat is where the net gain occurred. This means that all net employment \ngains since the recession have gone to workers brought in from abroad.\n  How many workers should we be bringing into America? Shouldn't we ask \nhow the economy is doing? We are having the slowest recovery since the \nGreat Depression 80 years ago. Shouldn't we ask questions about that? \nHow many people are on food stamps and welfare and all kinds of aid \nprograms? How many people have claimed disability?\n  During this same time--get this, colleagues--the population of \nAmericans 16 and older increased by 11 million, but one-fifth of a \nmillion fewer Americans are employed.\n  Here is a chart that will reflect some of this data. This reflects \nthat natives--people born in the country--accounted for two-thirds of \nthe increase in the working-age population. It is a myth we are having \ndeclining birth rates to the extent we have fewer people coming into \nthe working ages. That is not so. Since 2000 we have added increases of \n16.8 million working age people, but all the employment gains went to \nimmigrants from 2000 to 2014.\n  I was surprised at this. I knew we were having issues with this, and \npeople have shared that with me, but I did not realize the numbers were \nthis stark.\n  Let's look at this. This is the change in the working age on these \ntwo parts of the chart. We have an increase in immigrants from 2000 to \n2014 by 8.8 million people, while the native population in their \nworking ages increased by 16.8 million people--twice the number of \nworking age immigrants, basically. But where did the jobs go, the few \njobs we have been creating as we are recovering from the recession? We \ncreated 5.7 million jobs since 2000 that went to the immigrant \npopulation--this 8.8 million--and the native population showed a \ndecline of 100,000 jobs. So even though we had a 16.8 million increase \nin that working-age group, we had a decline in native-born workers \nactually working.\n  I would say those are stunning numbers, and it calls on us to \nreevaluate our policies. We are not against immigration. I am not \nsaying we should end immigration, I am saying it is time for us to \nreview our immigration policies, as any sensible, sane nation would do. \nIt is time to do that.\n  The President's policy goes in exactly the opposite direction. By \noverwhelming polling data, Americans--including Hispanics--agree that \namnesty has created more of an illegal immigration flow, and yet this \namnesty rewards 5 million people for what they did illegally.\n  Let's look at a little more of the reality of how this plays out in \nthe world. Here is a dramatic article in Computerworld about the big \npower company in California--Southern California Edison. What have they \ndone recently? Information technology workers at Southern California \nEdison are being laid off and replaced by workers from India. Some \nemployees are training their H-1B visa-holding replacements, and many \nhave already lost their jobs. The employees are upset and they say they \ncan't understand how H-1B guest workers can be used to replace them \nsince they are already doing the job now.\n  Apparently, Southern California Edison--a power company rooted in the \nUnited States of America--is converting, laying off, and terminating \nthe employment of people who have been with them for a number of years. \nSouthern California Edison is transitioning those positions to foreign \nemployees who have come in under the H-1B visa program for the sole \npurpose of taking a job. They are not coming under the immigration \npolicy where they would move from green card into permanent residence \nand into citizenship. They come solely for a limited period of time to \ntake a job, and they work for less pay too often.\n  This is what one person said:\n\n       ``They are bringing in people with a couple of years' \n     experience to replace us and then we have to train them,'' \n     said one long-time IT worker. ``It's demoralizing and in a \n     way I kind of felt betrayed by the company.''\n\n  I bet he did. Continuing to quote from the article:\n\n       SCE, Southern California's largest utility--\n\n  Which is a quasi-almost-government entity under the regulatory powers \nof the State--\n\n     has confirmed the layoffs and the hiring of Infosys, based in \n     Bangalore, and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in Mumbai. \n     They are two of the largest users of H-1B visas.\n\n  Apparently what happens is these companies sign up workers in--in \nthis case--India, and they call up the big power company and say: Look, \nwe have all these young people who have an education, and your salaries \nare real generous to them, they like your salaries, and we will just \nsend them over on H-1B visas. They can stay 3 years and then return to \ntheir country and you can get rid of all those American workers. Maybe \nyou will not have to pay such high retirement or health care benefits.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Computerworld interviewed, separately, four affected SCE IT \n     employees. They agreed to talk on the condition that their \n     names not be used. The IT employees at SCE are ``beyond \n     furious,'' said a second IT worker. The H-1B program ``was \n     supposed to be for projects and jobs that American workers \n     could not fill,'' this worker said, ``But we're doing our \n     job. It's not like they are bringing in these guys for new \n     positions that nobody can fill.''\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       ``Not one of these jobs being filled by India was a job \n     that an Edison employee wasn't already performing,'' he said.\n\n  It goes on to talk about this. Professor Ron Hira, who studied this \nin great depth and has written about this problem for some time, made \nsome comments on it too:\n\n       The SCE outsourcing ``is one more case, in a long line of \n     them, of injustice where American workers are being replaced \n     by H-1B's,'' said Ron Hira, a public policy professor at \n     Howard University, and a researcher on offshore outsourcing. \n     Adding to the injustice, American workers are being forced to \n     do `knowledge transfer,' an ugly euphemism for being forced \n     to train their foreign replacements.''\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       ``Americans should be outraged that most of our politicians \n     have sat idly by while outsourcing firms have hijacked the \n     guest worker programs.''\n\n  So the guest worker program is supposed to help businesses. If they \ncan't get people to work, then they can apply to this program, which \nhas some limits. Yet the President proposes doubling the number of \npeople who can come in with H-1B visas to work. He wants to double that \nnumber. He has been demanding that. But Mr. Hira said:\n\n       The majority of the H-1B program is now being used to \n     replace Americans and to facilitate offshoring of high wage \n     jobs.\n\n  So this is a pretty thorough article in Computerworld, and it is a \ngrowing problem in the high-tech industry.\n  Professor Hal Salzman, who is a sociologist and public policy \nprofessor at the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at \nRutgers University, wrote about this last September. This is not \nsomething new. This has been understood for some time. This is what he \nsays in U.S. News and World Report:\n\n       All credible research finds the same evidence about the \n     STEM workforce: ample supply, stagnant wages and, by industry \n     accounts, thousands of applicants for any advertised job. The \n     real concern should be about the dim employment prospects for \n     our best STEM graduates.\n\n  Who are STEM graduates? Science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics. We have been telling our children they can have good jobs. \nParents have borrowed money, invested in the college savings plans; \nstudents have borrowed money themselves to get degrees in STEM fields, \nand now we find STEM salaries are flat since 2000--that only 40 percent \nof STEM graduates are actually working in STEM jobs.\n  This is what Professor Salzman and five others said in an op-ed in \nUSA Today, condemning what we are doing in America today:\n\n       Average wages in the IT industry are the same as those that \n     prevailed when Bill Clinton was President, despite industry \n     cries of a shortage. Overall, U.S. colleges produced twice \n     the number of STEM graduates than annually find jobs in those \n     fields.\n\n  We have to think about how to get our people, our children, our \nconstituents into good-paying jobs. I wish there were more of them. I \nwish there weren't enough jobs and we had to import workers, but it is \nnot so.\n  The Salzman article goes on:\n\n       . . . the growth of STEM shortage claims is driven by heavy \n     industry funding for lobbyists and think tanks. Their goal is \n     government intervention in the market under the guise of \n     solving national economic problems. The highly profitable IT \n     industry, for example, is devoting millions to convince \n     Congress and the White House to provide it with\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\n     more low-cost, foreign guest workers instead of trying to \n     attract and retain employees from an ample domestic labor \n     pool of native and immigrant citizens and permanent \n     residents. Guest workers currently make up two-thirds of all \n     new IT hires, but employers are demanding further increases. \n     If such lobbying efforts succeed, firms will have enough \n     guest workers to last for at least 100 percent of their new \n     hiring and can continue to legally substitute these younger \n     workers for current employees holding down wages for both \n     them and new hires. . . . the Census Bureau reports that only \n     about one in four STEM bachelor's degree holders has a STEM \n     job, and Microsoft plans to downsize by 18,000 workers over \n     the next year.\n\n  Microsoft signed a letter to the President and Congress just a few \nmonths ago demanding more foreign workers in the same week they \nannounced laying off 18,000 workers, and this is a pattern throughout \nthe industry. They are lobbying for more and more while they are laying \noff workers.\n\n  Here is a statement our office obtained from a union representative \nat IBM:\n\n       On January 28, 2015, IBM embarked on another of its regular \n     ``resource actions'' or job cuts at sites and divisions \n     around the US. Although IBM won't say how many employees were \n     notified that their employment was being terminated, the \n     Alliance@IBM estimates the number at around 5,000.\n\n  I continue to read from their statement:\n\n       This has been almost a quarterly experience for IBM \n     employees. One of the biggest drivers of the job cuts is off \n     shoring and bringing in guest workers from other countries.\n\n  So they are laying off Americans and bringing in people from abroad.\n  The statement goes on to say:\n\n       The terminating of regular IBM U.S. employees while keeping \n     H-1b visa or L1 visa workers on the payroll has been ongoing \n     at IBM for years.\n       As one worker stated in an email to the Alliance just this \n     past week:\n       ``Received `RA' notice (termination notice) yesterday. . . \n     . I was told last October that I was being replaced by an IBM \n     India Landed Resource. . . . ''\n\n  That is a guest worker.\n  Another employee e-mailed:\n\n       ``I would estimate that of the 20 people in my IBM \n     department, at least 80% were immigrants on Visa's working on \n     a so called government contract.''\n\n  They were working on a government contract. They were bringing \nforeign workers.\n  And it goes on.\n  Here is an article in the Engineering Journal about IBM: ``Massive \nWorldwide Layoff Underway At IBM.''\n  Look, I am not saying a company can't lay off and be more efficient. \nThe business market changes, and they are just not able to stay in \nbusiness if they are paying people to do work that doesn't exist. I \nunderstand that.\n  What I am saying is that at the same time they are laying off people, \nthey are demanding the right to bring in more foreign workers, further \ndriving down wages.\n  Here is what this article says:\n\n       Project Chrome, a massive layoff that IBM is pretending is \n     not a massive layoff, is under way. First reported by Robert \n     X. Cringely in Forbes, about 26 percent of the company's \n     global workforce is being shown the door. At more than \n     100,000 people, that makes it the largest mass layoff at any \n     U.S. corporation in at least 20 years.\n\n  So these groups have all come together in a lobbying group, Compete \nAmerica, the Alliance for a Competitive Workforce. IBM is one of them. \nI think Hewlett-Packard laid off 12,000 not too long ago; they are part \nof it. Microsoft, laying off 18,000, is part of it--demanding more \nguest workers.\n  Cringely wrote that notices have started going out, and most of the \nhundred thousand-plus will likely be gone by the end of February.\n  How does it impact us? Does it impact Americans?\n\n       Alliance@IBM, the IBM employees' union, says it has so far \n     collected reports of 5,000 jobs eliminated, including 250 in \n     Boulder, Colo., 150 in Columbia, Missouri, and 202 in \n     Dubuque, Iowa. Layoffs in Littleton, Mass., are reportedly \n     ``massive,'' but no specific numbers have been published.\n\n  Here is a story in timesunion.com about Governor Cuomo in New York. \nHis program of IT work in New York is being outsourced by IBM.\n\n       . . . IBM has brought hundreds of workers from India to \n     fill jobs in Albany for which--in theory--plenty of Americans \n     are qualified.\n\n  Walt Disney World's information technology department laid off 500 \nworkers, while Disney's profit margin has gone up and the stock price \nis rising.\n  We are going to be talking about this for some time. We need to ask \nourselves: What is in the interest of American workers at a time when \nwe are laying off large numbers of workers--skilled and unskilled? I \nhave been talking about skilled.\n  Do we really need massive increases in foreign workers? Do we need to \npass legislation that would double the number of guest workers that \ncome into the country at this time? I think not.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these thoughts. I see my \ncolleague.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Collins not to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S826-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S826-S828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SMALL BREW ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that Senator Collins and \nI have introduced legislation known as the Small Brewer Reinvestment \nand Expanding Workforce Act, S. 375. The two of us have led the effort \nto try to help the craft brewing industry. The craft beer industry is \ncomposed of small businesses that have used their ingenuity to create \nbeers that are becoming very, very popular.\n  It is interesting that when we developed the excise tax on beer, I \ndon't think we thought of the craft beer industry at the time. The \ncraft beer industry, as I said, generally consists of small businesses \nwho are struggling to find capital in order to expand. The current law \nimposes an excise tax on the first 60,000 barrels at $7 per barrel for \nbreweries that produce 2 million or fewer barrels annually. The Small \nBREW Act would modify that, by increasing the threshold to 6 million \nbarrels. Under the bill, brewers producing 6 million or few barrels \neach year would pay $3.50 per barrel on the first 60,000 barrels, and \n$16 per barrel on their annual production between 60,001 and 2 million \nbarrels. So the Small BREW Act would reduce the amount they pay in \nfederal excise taxes.\n  I wish to take a moment and then yield to my colleague to explain the \nrationale as to why we have introduced this legislation.\n  As I said a moment ago, when we imposed the excise tax on beer, I \nbelieve we thought about the big companies and that we wanted to have \ntaxes on distilled spirits, wine, and beer as an excise tax.\n  When we take a look at the craft breweries, they are really burdened \nby this tax. They are creating jobs, they are creating a different \nproduct, and they are creating new markets for beer in this country. I \nwish to share some of these numbers because I think they are pretty \nimpressive.\n  In 1989 there were 247 breweries in the entire United States. Today \nthere are over 3,200 small and independent breweries and brew pubs in \nthe United States that employ over 110,000 Americans. So this has been \na real growth industry. Here are jobs that can't be outsourced, and \nthey have created a better product, a better way of doing business. But \nthe challenge is that they are really strapped for capital. It is not \neasy for them to invest in the type of equipment necessary to expand \ntheir capacity.\n  Brewers Association CEO Bob Pease said last month in testimony \nsubmitted to the House Ways and Means Committee:\n\n       America's small brewers are quintessentially small Main \n     Street manufacturers. They typically employ 10 to 100 \n     workers, and many began as home brewers before devoting \n     themselves full time to the brewing industry.\n\n  I think that the No. 1 problem for craft brewers trying to expand \ntheir capacity is access to sufficient capital. An article in \nyesterday's New York Times entitled ``Betting on the Growth of \nMicrobreweries'' quotes Brewers Association economist Dr. Bart Watson:\n\n       Brewery after brewery is looking for ways to grow because \n     when you talk to these companies, the biggest constraint is \n     capacity. They're selling beer as fast as they can make it.\n\n  I recently visited Heavy Seas Brewery in Baltimore. Now, I know this \nbrewery quite well because I helped Hugh Sisson, the owner and CEO, tap \nthe very first keg he produced in a micropub when he was doing this \nbasically as a hobby. Well, he has expanded\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nhis operations a couple of times now, and it wasn't easy to do this. He \nhas invested a lot of money, and he has hired additional people, \ncreating more jobs in Baltimore. Hugh hired 8 people in 2013, another \n10 last year, and he expects to hire at least 6 more people this year. \nThese are good jobs. But he needs the capital, and the relief provided \nby this act would allow him to be able to do this.\n  So Senator Collins and I wanted to bring attention to this \nlegislation which provides some very modest relief from the excise \ntaxes I mentioned earlier. It would reduce the $7 per barrel on the \nfirst 60,000 barrels to $3.50 and establish a new rate of $16 per \nbarrel after that up to 2 million barrels for breweries producing up to \n6 million barrels annually.\n  It doesn't seem like much, but that would be the difference in making \nthe investment to expand the microbrewery and hire another 6, 8 or 10 \npeople or to start another brewery, to create the excitement in a \ncommunity that comes with these brew pubs, which I think all of us \nwould agree should not be subject to a special tax which prevents them \nfrom expanding.\n  This is an important business in my community. It is a growing \nbusiness in Baltimore. It is a growing business around the country. I \nhope we all would want to help these small businesses.\n  In this Congress I have assumed a new role as the ranking Democrat on \nthe Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. We are going to be \nlooking for ways in which we can help small businesses in our country \nbecause we know that small businesses are the growth engine for \ninnovation and change and good jobs.\n  So if we can help the microbreweries, if we can pass this \nlegislation, we will help small businesses, and we will help economic \ngrowth in our communities.\n  I am pleased that Senator Collins and I are joined by 23 of our \ncolleagues. Between all of use, 25 percent of the Senate has already \ncosponsored S. 375. We hope we will be able to find a way to move this \nlegislation early this year so we can help economic growth.\n  In Maryland we are currently home to 43 craft breweries--up from 34 \nin 2013--and 24 more are in the planning stages. I have been to many of \nthese craft breweries. I enjoy their product, but, more importantly, I \nenjoy their entrepreneurial spirit, which they have been able to show \nin a growth industry in our country and of which we all can be proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Maine and Maryland have in common not \nonly delicious seafood but also fine craft beers.\n  I am delighted to join my friend and colleague Senator Cardin in \nsupport of the legislation that we have introduced, S. 375, the Small \nBrewer Reinvestment and Expanding Workforce Act, or Small BREW Act.\n  The title is more than just a clever acronym. It is a statement of \nwhat our bipartisan bill really is all about. This is a jobs bill, and \nthose covered by the bill are small businesses, entrepreneurs who are \ntaking risks and creating jobs in communities around the country.\n  We often talk in this Chamber about what we can do to help create the \nenvironment that encourages job creation. Our bill is one such \npractical means where we can spur the creation of new jobs as well as \ngreat products.\n\n  In Maine, we are proud to boast that our State is now home to more \nthan 60 breweries that produce more than 200 different brands. Maine \nbeer is shipped around the country and has developed a real following \namong connoisseurs who have come to appreciate its quality and \ncraftsmanship. This, in turn, has led to new tourism opportunities as \nvisitors are drawn to our State to sample our delicious Maine craft \nbeers. As the craft beer industry grows, so too does demand for \nAmerican-grown barley and hops and American-made brewing, bottling, \ncanning, and other equipment. Beyond creating delicious beer, these \nbreweries are creating jobs. That is the whole rationale behind the \nbill we have introduced.\n  In Maine alone, our craft breweries employ more than 1,400 people. \nThat is an extraordinary number of jobs. As the Senator from Maryland \nhas pointed out, these are jobs that are going to stay right here in \nAmerica. They are not going to be outsourced. These are small \nbusinesses in our communities that are hiring people and making a \ndifference.\n  Nationally small and independent brewers employ more than 110,000 \nfull- and part-time employees, generating more than $3 billion in wages \nand benefits, and pay more than $2.3 billion in business, personal, and \nconsumption taxes, according to the Brewers Association.\n  What could we do to encourage even more employment in this area? The \nanswer is to reduce the Federal excise tax on small craft brewers, and \nthat is exactly what our bill would do. It would free up capital so \nthese small business owners can reinvest in their companies and create \nmore jobs.\n  Under the current law, as Senator Cardin has pointed out, these small \nbusinesses pay $7 per barrel in Federal excise tax on the first 60,000 \nbarrels they brew and $18 per barrel on every barrel thereafter. The \nSmall BREW Act would reduce these rates to $3.50 on the first 60,000 \nbarrels and $16 for production between 60,000 and 2 million barrels. \nThereafter, the rate would remain at $18 per barrel.\n  We know from the economic analysis that has been done that such a \nchange would have a significant positive economic impact. A June 2013 \nstudy prepared by a professor, then at Harvard's Kennedy School of \nGovernment, estimated that our bill would increase economic activity by \n$1 billion over 5 years, create more than 5,000 new jobs in the first \nyear to 18 months after passage, and create approximately 400 new jobs \nannually thereafter.\n  Again, I want to repeat, this is a jobs bill, and I am proud to \nsponsor it with my friend Senator Cardin. I am also delighted that we \nhave the support of such a large number of colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle, including my colleague from Maine, Senator King.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to take a look at this bill. If you want \nto do something that is concrete and we know will create more jobs for \na growing industry that is carving out a niche in so many States across \nthis Nation, then work with us to achieve passage of the Small BREW \nAct.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins not only for her \nleadership but for also pointing out something very important here: \nThis is a jobs bill. The passage of this bill will create more jobs. We \nknow that because we know that craft breweries are strapped for \ncapital. Every dollar they save here will be reinvested and create more \njobs because they don't have the capacity to meet the current demand \nfor their beers. If they could produce more beer today, they would sell \nmore beer, but they don't have the capital to make the investments.\n  Senator Collins is absolutely right when she says this is a jobs bill \nthat will create more jobs.\n  It also creates a lot of indirect jobs. I was pleased Senator Collins \npointed out that many of the ingredients the craft breweries use come \nfrom the community. They are helping local farmers and local industries \ngrow, which are also generally small businesses. So as they grow, they \nhelp other small businesses grow.\n  One interesting fact is we are now starting to see an increase in \ncraft beer exports. There is a real desire for our craft brews outside \nof the United States. It is a relatively new phenomenon, but exports \ngrew by 49 percent in 2013. We exported 283,000 barrels in 2013, and I \nexpect we will see those numbers greatly increase.\n  This chart shows some of the Maryland craft breweries. They are \nbecoming well known outside of my State of Maryland. I already \nmentioned Heavy Seas, and Flying Dog is another brewery I had a chance \nto visit. There are many other breweries, including some with names \nthat are synonymous with my State, such as Raven Beer, Ellicott Mills \nBrewing Company, Eastern Shore, and Antietam. These are companies and \nbrand names that are now becoming better known because they are \nproducing a great product and people really do like to encourage this \ntype of industry.\n  I thank Senator Collins and our 23 cosponsors. I see Senator King is \non\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\nthe floor, and I thank the Senator for his help on this bill. I hope we \nwill have an opportunity to show, in a bipartisan fashion, that we can \npass legislation to help job growth here in the United States.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, first I wish to associate myself with the \ncomments of the Senator from Maryland and my senior colleague from \nMaine. I know this industry is growing in Maine. It is entrepreneurial, \nexciting, energetic, and they are adding jobs and only want to continue \nto grow.\n  I think this bill makes total sense. It is a way we can express \nsupport for the entrepreneurial and innovative growth of businesses in \nall of our States. I am delighted to be able to join and essentially \nadd my encouragement and support to your work on this bill. Since it is \na bipartisan bill, I hope we can move it through this body in a \nreasonably short period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S828-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CYBER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, there are two items I want to touch on \ntoday. One is bad news and the other is good news. This week we learned \nthere was a data breach of 80 million people's records--300,000 in \nMaine--at Anthem. Fortunately the data breach did not include credit \ncard numbers, but it did include Social Security numbers. This news \ncomes about a month after Sony.\n  What is it going to take for this body, for this Congress, for this \ncity, to act to protect us against these threats? We keep getting \nwarning shots, and we keep ignoring them.\n  I am going to have to go home this weekend, and 300,000 people in \nMaine are going to say: What have you done to keep this from happening? \nAm I really going to be able to say: Well, it is complicated; we have \nfour committees of jurisdiction and it is very difficult for us to make \nthese decisions and it takes some time? That is not good enough.\n  The intelligence committee reported out a bill last July. We had a \nbill on the floor here in the fall. It is time for us to act. We keep \ngetting warned, and we keep not doing anything.\n  I can't justify it. There is no excuse for us not taking steps--\nconcrete steps--to protect this country against cyber attacks. They \nkeep happening.\n  My regional representatives in Maine have surveyed both small \nbusinesses and health care facilities, and all of them either have been \nattacked or are concerned about attacks. Whether it is from a foreign \ncountry or whether it is from garden-variety criminals, the point is \nthis is a major threat facing this country, and it is one we have \nwithin our power--we can't control it, but we can at least work \ntogether to try to prevent it and to minimize the damage. It is beyond \ntime--way beyond time--for us to take action on this subject.\n  I hope my colleagues on all the relevant committees can come together \nin the next several months--before the summer--to take action to deal \nwith this problem. There is no excuse, particularly given the \ncontinuous warnings we are having, for not dealing with the issue of \nthe cyber threat to this country.\n  This week it is Anthem. A few weeks ago it was Sony. What is going to \nhappen when it is the gas pipeline system, when it is the financial \nsystem, when it is the New York Stock Exchange, when people's bank \naccounts disappear overnight? It is time for us to act, and it is time \nfor us to act promptly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S828-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S828-S829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICAL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I also come to the floor today with some \ngood news. It comes as no surprise that our debates here in the Senate \nfocus generally on challenges, such as the one I just outlined, that \nface the United States. After all, that is our task and it is our \nfundamental responsibility to identify our Nation's problems and work \ntogether to find solutions.\n  But too often--and I am sure everyone in this body realizes--the bad \nnews gets more attention than the good news. The old saying is, bad \nnews gets halfway around the world before good news gets its shoes \ntied. The problems we face should not, I believe, drown out the \naccomplishments of our citizens as we go about our work every day here \nin the United States.\n  I think we should take a little time every now and then to reflect on \nthe great things that are happening all over America, and in my case in \nMaine. There are stories of perseverance, innovation, individual \naccomplishments, and community effort. It is in that spirit that I rise \ntoday with good news from my home State of Maine.\n  I will spend a few minutes talking about Dr. Ed Bilsky and the \nimpressive work he and a dedicated team of scientists, physicians, and \nstudents have been doing at one of my favorite schools, the University \nof New England in Biddeford, ME, to better understand and treat chronic \npain.\n  Dr. Bilsky was recently named a member of the Dana Alliance for Brain \nInitiatives, a group of neuroscientists who work together to advance \npublic education about the progress and benefits of brain research and \nto provide information on the brain in a way that is understandable and \naccessible for those of us who don't have a Ph.D. in neuroscience.\n  His inclusion in this group is recognition of his terrific work to \nadvance our understanding of chronic pain. It is also a reflection of \nthe prominent role he and his colleagues are playing in a critical \nnational effort to address this problem. Chronic pain--and that means \npain that persists for days, weeks, and months at a time--can be \nabsolutely debilitating for people in Maine and around the country and \nis responsible for more than $500 billion a year--$\\1/2\\ trillion a \nyear--in direct and indirect medical costs.\n  Periodically in my life I have experienced back pain, and when it \npersists for a period of time, it changes everything. It changes your \nmood, it changes your attitude, it changes your ability to get anything \ndone, to focus on the work at hand. There are people in this country \nwho are suffering--the estimate is 100 million people suffer chronic \npain at some point in their lives. That is why the work done at the \nUniversity of New England Center for the Study of Pain and Sensory \nFunction, where Dr. Bilsky is one of the leaders, is so important.\n  This center is built around a core group of scientists, educators, \nhealth care professionals, whose research at the University of New \nEngland is focused on understanding the neurobiology of pain. How does \nit happen? How is it caused? What can we do about it?\n  Faculty and students work together to study the causes of chronic \npain and apply this knowledge to preventing and better treating this \nvery challenging and very prevalent condition. Projects include working \nto develop new kinds of nonopioid painkillers. That is a big deal \nbecause of all of the side effects and dangers of opioid painkillers \nwhich we are experiencing in our society. To develop nonopioid \npainkillers would be a tremendous boon to this country, those which \ndon't have the side effects of opioids. They are also studying the \ngenes and proteins that can turn acute pain into chronic pain and \ntrying to find out the genetic and chromosomal basis of this terrible \nproblem.\n\n  As with any success story, certain key events, people, and \ninvestments have made this research community what it is today. The \nrecruitment of key faculty scientists, such as Dr. Bilsky and his \ncodirector Dr. Ian Meng, in the early 2000s was pivotal to this effort. \nThe addition of complementary research-driven faculty and \nadministrators as well as the launch at the university of the Center \nfor Excellence in the Neurosciences continue to move this project \nforward.\n  I should mention here the leadership of Daniel Ripich, the president \nof the University of New England, who is a true visionary and a great \nleader in the advancement of science and medicine as well as the \nmission of this great university.\n  The NIH took notice, awarding the university a 5-year, $10 million \ngrant in 2012 to create the Center for the Study of Pain and Sensory \nFunction, focusing on the neurobiology of pain. As is often the case, \nthat Federal investment in research, which I believe is one of the most \nimportant and valuable investments the Federal Government can make, has \nbeen critical to the growth of these research opportunities and \nprojects and has helped to attract further Federal and private \ninvestment.\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n  The importance of cooperation and collaboration in a project such as \nthis cannot be overstated. Dr. Bilsky and his colleagues have developed \nin-State and national networks for collaborative research, training, \nand public advocacy. They have partnered with clinicians, other \nresearchers, the private sector, community leaders, and schools \nthroughout Maine and the country to not only further their research and \nadvance the bodies of knowledge relating to chronic pain, but also to \nmaximize the positive impact of that research by applying it in their \ncommunities. This improves the lives of our citizens by helping them \nunderstand the causes and potential treatments for their pain.\n  Any university's primary mission is to educate, and Dr. Bilsky and \nhis colleagues have taken their important work into the surrounding \ncommunity. They have developed a vibrant and award-winning K-12 \noutreach program led by Dr. Mike Burman that focuses on brain safety \nand brain awareness. This innovative approach to STEM education has \nbeen recognized by the White House Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy. This program engages more than 3,000 local kids each year and \ninspires kids to enter STEM-related careers, which is one of the most \nimportant objectives we can encourage in this country.\n  The research has also helped to spur economic development in Maine. \nFaculty members work in partnership with local biotech and \npharmaceutical companies, helping the private sector with local \nresearch and development they may otherwise be unable to afford. This \ncooperation has helped Maine companies grow and create jobs. It is a \nwin-win for everyone involved. It has built the reputation of the \nUniversity of New England, and it draws positive attention to the State \nof Maine and, most importantly, it helps change lives.\n  If my colleagues can't tell, I am very proud of this work done in my \nState. As we go about our work here in this body, it is important, I \nbelieve, every now and then to recognize the success stories at home. \nWe might even learn a thing or two from them.\n  With that positive thought, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S829-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING RICHARD ``DICK'' RICHARDS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to pay \ntribute to a respected political leader, a cherished friend, and an \nexceptional human being--Richard ``Dick'' Richards. A native of Ogden, \nUT, Dick touched the lives of many and was deeply respected for his \nwisdom, his no-nonsense approach, and his remarkable integrity.\n  When I first considered running for the Senate in 1976, Dick was \nserving as the Utah Republican Party chairman. At the time, I was a \npolitical novice, but Dick's early encouragement and counsel were \ninstrumental in my candidacy and subsequent victory. I will always be \ngrateful for his invaluable support during my first term as a Senator.\n  Dick and I shared a great admiration and respect for President Ronald \nReagan. We were both early supporters who campaigned tirelessly to help \nget President Reagan elected in 1980. In President Reagan, we saw a \nleader who shared our conservative values and our willingness to take a \nstand on hard issues. Impressed with Reagan's integrity, Dick and I put \nour whole heart and energy into campaigning for this great man.\n  For many years, Dick and President Reagan shared a close friendship \nbased on mutual love and respect. During the campaign, President Reagan \nnoted Dick's political savvy and leadership skills and later tapped him \nto head the National Republican Committee from 1981-82. As chairman, \nDick raised the Republican Party's profile and fought passionately for \nconservative principles across all levels of government. His leadership \non the national stage set a course for many more years of campaign \nactivity and advisory roles in Utah and across the Nation.\n  Capping Dick's successful career in politics was his tireless help in \nestablishing the Richard Richards Institute for Ethics at his alma \nmater, Weber State University. The institute is carrying on Dick's \nlegacy to inspire future leaders to enter politics and government and \nlead with integrity and strength. In his book, ``Climbing the Political \nLadder, One Rung at a Time,'' Dick discusses the virtues of civic \nengagement and encourages youth to become actively involved in the \npolitical process.\n  Dick's public accomplishments were numerous, but his most significant \nachievements were personal. His greatest source of pride was his loving \npartnership with his wife Annette, their 5 children, 11 grandchildren, \nand 15 great-grandchildren. He deeply cared for each of them and always \nmade family his top priority.\n  Dick also donated countless hours of service to his community and his \nfaith. He served in many important leadership positions in the Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and was always generous with his \ntime.\n  Dick Richards was a truly remarkable man who led by example, hard \nwork, and a desire to do what is right. His impact on Utah will be felt \nfor generations to come. Elaine and I send our deepest condolences to \nhis beautiful wife Annette, whose loyal companionship and counsel \nsustained Dick throughout his career. May God's love embrace Annette \nand her family with peace and comfort during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S829-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S829-S830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING THE BOYD GAMING CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 40th anniversary \nof the Boyd Gaming Corporation, a leader in today's gaming industry \nthat is respected in Nevada and across the Nation.\n  Boyd Gaming Corporation was founded in 1975, but the legacy of the \ncompany began in 1941, when Sam Boyd moved his family to Las Vegas, NV. \nSam started his career as a table dealer and quickly gained experience \nby working his way across the Silver State through an array of jobs in \nthe gaming industry. By 1952, he had saved enough money to purchase a \nsmall stake in the legendary Sahara Hotel and Casino. Sam's small stake \nin the Sahara eventually led to him becoming the general manager of the \nMint, which was a hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas.\n  Sam's son, Bill, has been a force in gaming in Nevada and throughout \nthe United States. Bill is an accomplished lawyer, and now, an \naccomplished businessman. I am happy to call him a friend. Bill first \npartnered with Sam and others in acquiring a stake in the Eldorado \nCasino, but it was not until New Year's Day 1975 that the father and \nson partnership became the Boyd Gaming Corporation. The corporation's \nfirst major project was the California Hotel and Casino in downtown Las \nVegas, which quickly became a success.\n  In 1979, Boyd Gaming opened ``Sam's Town'' on a 13 acre lot off \nBoulder Highway. The project carried the name of one of its founders, \nSam Boyd, and for the first time, provided Las Vegas locals with a \nfull-scale resort. While their California Hotel and Casino property was \ninspiring innovative marketing strategies, across town at the Sam's \nTown property, the corporation was providing an entirely new experience \nto local Nevadans.\n  Since then, Boyd Gaming has grown into a large corporation with 22 \nproperties across the country, and enjoyed tremendous success. \nThroughout their history, Boyd Gaming has remained deeply rooted in its \nNevadan history and has been guided by the principles of family and \nintegrity first laid out by Sam Boyd. As an inductee in the Gaming Hall \nof Fame, Sam will always be remembered as one of the most influential \nbusinessmen and innovators in Las Vegas gaming history. I remember Sam \nnot only for his entrepreneurship and business sense, but also as a \nfriend who championed diversity among his employees, and would go out \nof his way to give back to the community.\n  I am honored to congratulate Boyd Gaming Corporation on reaching this\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\nmilestone and I wish the corporation, and the Boyd family the best on \nall future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S830-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SAFE FOOD ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the issue that \nimpacts the lives of every American--food safety.\n  In 1997, I introduced a bill to consolidate at one agency the Federal \noversight of food safety, and I have introduced that bill seven times, \nincluding most recently just last week. So I found it heartening to see \nthe President's proposal to consolidate most of those responsibilities \ninto one agency as part of the fiscal year 2016 budget.\n  Today, 15 different Federal agencies have food safety \nresponsibilities. This patchwork of oversight makes it harder to focus \non the highest risks in our food system and makes foodborne illness \noutbreaks more difficult to manage. President Obama's budget puts in \nmotion a plan to create the efficiencies we have been talking about \nsince 1997.\n  The President's plan would create a single new agency within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. That agency would have primary \nresponsibility for food safety inspections, as well as enforcement, \napplied research, and outbreak response and mitigation. And the \nproposed agency would be the Federal point for coordinating with State \nand local entities and food safety stakeholders. This is an important \nstep toward creating a single food agency.\n  I first got involved in updating our food safety system in response \nto a letter from constituent. The letter shared the story of a mother \npurchasing, cooking, and serving her 6-year-old son a hamburger. Very \nfew foods are more basic in American than hamburger, but on this day \nthat hamburger was contaminated with E.coli. This simple hamburger \nended up taking her son's life. This story, as sad as it is, is only \none of many. Each year, 48 million Americans become sick as a result of \nfoodborne illnesses. That is one in every six people. Mr. President, \n128,000 of those will be so sick they will need hospitalization, and \n3,000 of those will not survive their illnesses.\n  While we have made significant reforms to our food safety system with \npassage of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act--which will improve \nour food safety--we have still not solved this problem.\n  Recently, the New Yorker ran an article called ``A Bug in the \nSystem.'' The story details the experience of Rick Schiller, who had \ncontracted a form of the salmonella bacterium, known as Salmonella \nHeidelberg. The condition led to multiple days in the hospital. After \nhis release, he was contacted by the Centers for Disease Control, and \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture collected some chicken from his \nfreezer as a potential source for the foodborne illness. More than a \nyear later, he had not heard back from the investigator and he still \nwasn't sure that it was the chicken that almost killed him.\n  This New Yorker article highlights problems that have been identified \nby the Government Accountability Office, the National Research Council, \nand the Institute of Medicine for decades. Simply determining which of \n15 Federal agencies is responsible for inspection of a particular food \ncan leave the average citizen scratching their head.\n  In the current regulatory regime, a pepperoni pizza--because it \ncontains meat--has ingredients that will be inspected three times \nbefore the product hits the grocery store freezer. A vegetarian pizza \nproduced at the same facility, however, will probably not undergo any \ninspection.\n  For eggs, it is even more scrambled. If it is a fresh egg, it is \ninspected by U.S. Department of Agriculture. But if that egg is part of \npremade product like a breakfast biscuit, it is the Food and Drug \nAdministration. It just does not make sense. The experts said it, the \ndata reflects it, and we can be left with only one conclusion.\n  The fragmented nature of our food safety system has left us more \nvulnerable to risk of foodborne illness and too often forced consumers \nto go it alone in the case of outbreak. I agree with the President that \nit is time for a new governmentwide approach. I would like to take it a \nstep further and establish a single food safety agency.\n  The Safe Food Act I introduced last week would transfer and \nconsolidate food safety authorities for inspections, enforcement, \nlabeling, and research into a single food safety agency. That will \nallow us to prioritize system-wide food safety goals and targets. With \na single food safety agency, food producers and manufacturers will just \nhave a single Federal regulatory structure.\n  An egg is an egg is an egg and will be regulated by the same agency \nregardless of how you cook, process, or serve it. This should make it \neasier for those in the food industry to comply with food safety laws, \neven if those laws are no less stringent. The bill also modernizes \ncertain aspects of our federal food safety laws to protect and improve \npublic health.\n  Specifically, the bill would authorize mandatory recall for all \nfoods. Today, it is easier to recall toys than tainted meat. The bill \nrequires facilities to use risk-based analysis to identify and protect \nagainst potential hazards at their facility. The bill will authorize \nperformance standards for pathogens like salmonella and campylobacter \nand for the first time authorize the agency to prevent products that \nare not meeting those standards from entering the market. The bill will \nprovide for full trace-back of foods to better identify and stop the \noutbreak at its source. Finally, the bill provides a single point of \ncontact for families harmed by foodborne illness to turn to for \nanswers.\n  This new agency will help those families navigate the differing \nFederal, State, and local food safety agencies to get the answers they \ndeserve. It is bad enough to suffer severe illness or lose a loved one \nto foodborne illness; you should not have to spend months going from \nagency to agency trying to get as simple an answer to a question like, \nDid this chicken make me sick?\n  This is not the only approach to creating an agency with the primary \nresponsibilities for overseeing and directing food safety, but we think \nit will help close existing gaps in our food safety system, reduce the \nlikelihood of foodborne illness, clarify our inspection regimes for \nindustry, and provide more clear assistance to people made sick by \nfoodborne illness.\n  In closing, I want to take a moment to thank some of my colleagues. I \nwould like to thank Senators Feinstein, Blumenthal, and Gillibrand for \njoining me in introducing this bill, and I stand ready to work with any \nMember on either side of the aisle who wants to tackle this issue.\n  I commend the administration for embracing this idea of consolidating \noversight of food safety. I hope it doesn't take another serious \nfoodborne outbreak before we decide to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S830-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S830-S831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  150TH ANNIVERSARY OF LINCOLN COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the 150th anniversary for \nLincoln College in Lincoln, IL. One hundred fifty years ago tomorrow, \nthe Illinois General Assembly granted a charter establishing the new \ncollege, originally known as Lincoln University. Just 6 days later, on \nPresident Abraham Lincoln's 56th birthday, ground was broken for \nUniversity Hall, a building still in use today. Lincoln University was \nthe first institution to be named for Abraham Lincoln and the only \nduring his lifetime. The first commencement in 1868 included a total of \nthree students--two men and one woman. Lincoln College has come a long \nway.\n  This year, Lincoln College enrolled about 640 students, and 90 \npercent of those who graduate will continue their education at a 4-year \nuniversity. Lincoln College now has campuses in Lincoln and Normal, IL, \nwith a tradition of personal education. By providing a low faculty to \nstudent ratio, Lincoln College offers individualized attention that \nmakes the difference between failure and success for many students. The \nschool provides a springboard for students who go on to continue their \neducation and helps students find good paying jobs.\n  Lincoln College offers more than just great student services and \nacademic programs that are second to none. Lincoln College fields a \nnumber of varsity sports teams that have won national championships, \nhosts a speaker series, and maintains Civil War era artifacts at the \nLincoln Heritage Museum.\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\n  I thank President John Blackburn for his leadership at Lincoln \nCollege and congratulate the institution on 150 years of providing \nIllinois students with a quality affordable education.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S831-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         California Casualties\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, small businesses across the country \nhave the unique opportunity to put their special stamp on the \ntraditions that mark their communities. In honor of Black History \nMonth, I would like to recognize Loretta Harrison, owner and operator \nof a successful New Orleans-based praline company. Through the \nhardships of starting a business to persevering and even expanding \nthrough one of the most tragic natural disasters to hit the United \nStates, this small business has gone above and beyond the past 35 years \nto carry the tradition of this special treat to the people of New \nOrleans. It is my pleasure to recognize Loretta's Authentic Pralines as \nthis week's Small Business of the Week.\n  Before she felt the calling to bring her family's special praline \nrecipe to her community, Loretta--who serves as president and CEO--\nworked as a medical librarian at Louisiana State University. Pralines \nare a common Louisiana dessert, with roots that go all the way back to \nthe original French settlers. They are made of ingredients that are \nplentiful to the region, which include an intricate mix of sugar, \nbutter, cream, and pecans. Through Loretta's hard work and \ndetermination, what started as a praline stand at the New Orleans Jazz \nand Heritage Festival has now grown into a storefront in both the \nMarigny and the French Market. Not only does Loretta's Pralines serve a \nwide variety of signature pralines, but it has expanded the menu to \ninclude other delicious desserts, such as king cakes, coconut \nmacaroons, fudge, and oatmeal raisin cookies. The store in the Marigny \nalso doubles as a cafe for breakfast and lunch, serving sweet and \nsavory favorites like sweet potato pancakes and shrimp and grits.\n  Apart from the legacy of being some of the best pralines in New \nOrleans, which is no easy feat, Loretta's Pralines is known for its \nstrength and support during the rebuilding of the city after Hurricane \nKatrina. With the blessing of minimal damage to her store, Loretta \nrecognized that there was an important void in her community that she \nimmediately stepped in to fill. By temporarily changing the business \nmodel from a sweet shop to a restaurant, Loretta was able to feed the \nvolunteers, workers, and reporters who were helping to rebuild the city \nshe knew and loved. Loretta's Pralines also became a sort of haven for \nthose whose lives had changed dramatically, a familiar meeting place as \npart of a larger community during the recovery. This act of benevolence \nin the midst of the hardship cemented Loretta's Pralines as a New \nOrleans institution.\n  Small business owners like Loretta Harrison are what make our State \ntruly unique--indeed, we would not be the same without their examples \nof courage and kindness. I am honored to recognize a small business \nthat has shown compassion during the devastating times, as well as \ningenuity and success in expanding their business across the city. \nCongratulations again to Loretta's Authentic Pralines. I wish you all \nthe best and more in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S831-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S831-S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RECOGNIZING ED HUNTER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to honor Ed Hunter, \non the occasion of his retirement as the Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention's Washington office.\n  Ed has had a long career in public service. He has served the Nation \nfor over 40 years at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nCDC. He began his career at the CDC's National Center for Health \nStatistics in 1975 while he was still a student at the University of \nMaryland.\n  In this role, Ed helped establish a national health information \ninfrastructure that is critical to making evidence-based public health \npolicy. He, along with two of his colleagues, conceived and edited \n``Health Statistics: Shaping Policy and Practice to Improve the \nPopulation's Health,'' the first textbook to cover the development, \nuse, and improvement of health statistics.\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\n  In his work on data policy, Ed created and led a cross agency \ncommittee to develop recommendations on the health data collection \nprogram of the entire Federal Government. His efforts have led to \ngreater efficiency, increased emphasis on statistical rigor, and \ngreater data usability. When you read a health statistic in a newspaper \narticle, it is more trustworthy because of Ed Hunter.\n  Most recently, as the Director of the CDC's Washington office, Ed has \nbeen essential in keeping Members of Congress and their staffs informed \nabout urgent public health crises and communicating critical public \nhealth information. From ricin in the halls of Congress to Ebola on the \nother side of the world, Ed helped us make policy decisions based on \nsound science.\n  Today, I want to recognize Ed for his 40 years at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, for his dedication to public service, \nand for a lifetime of work that has truly made a difference in the \nhealth of our Nation and around the world. On behalf of the U.S. \nCongress, your fellow statesmen in Maryland, and a grateful nation, I \nwant to thank Ed for all of the important work he has done and wish him \nthe very best in his next phase of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S832-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S832-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S832-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 50.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntemporary dividends received deduction for dividends received from a \ncontrolled foreign corporation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Foreign Earnings \nReinvestment Act that would generate the flow of an estimated $1.9 \ntrillion back into the American economy by temporarily allowing \ncompanies to return profits earned overseas to the U.S. at a reduced \ntax rate. It is no secret that one of the primary reasons why this \nmoney is laying idle and doing nothing to spur job creation is due to \nthe fact that our Nation has the highest corporate tax rate in the free \nworld at 35 percent. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development, OECD, when you add in additional State and \nlocal taxes the combined corporate rate jumps to a staggering 39.1 \npercent. Whereas, the average combined corporate tax rate for the rest \nof the developed world, excluding the U.S. is around 25 percent.\n  Congress has long debated tax reform and has failed to act. It is my \nhope that, under a Republican controlled Congress, we will be able to \nmove forward with tax reform, which includes lowering both the personal \nand corporate tax rate and eliminating tax loopholes. If we are not \ngoing to act on behalf of the American taxpayer than we need to make \navailable temporary tax incentives to bring this money back home \nproviding a much needed boost to our economy.\n  The Foreign Earnings Reinvestment Act would encourage American \ncompanies to bring overseas earnings back to the United States and \ncreates strong incentives for those firms to invest these earnings in \nU.S. employees.\n  Specifically, the bill would temporarily reduce the current 35 \npercent corporate rate to an 8.75 percent effective rate on foreign \nearnings brought back to the United States. If companies are able to \nshow that they are expanding their payroll by 10 percent through net \njob creation or higher payroll, the bill would allow these corporations \nto obtain up to a 5.25 percent effective repatriation rate In addition, \nthe bill discourages U.S. companies from reducing employment by \nincluding in a company's gross income calculation of $75,000 per full-\ntime position that is eliminated.\n  This common sense legislation will drive the roughly $1.9 trillion \ncurrently parked overseas back here to the United States, boosting our \neconomy and spurring job creation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Rubio):\n  S. 401. A bill to amend rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure to improve attorney accountability, and for\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

A bill to protect and enhance opportunities for recreational \nhunting, fishing, and shooting, and for other purposes; read the first \ntime.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am here on the floor today with my \nfriend and colleague from the State of Idaho to speak in support of \nlegislation we have just dropped today; that is, the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act of 2015. I have introduced it today, along with the \nprime cosponsor, Senator Heinrich from New Mexico.\n  I think it is important to recognize that this bipartisan bill is \nsupported with original cosponsors, including the Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Risch, Senator Manchin, Senator Fischer, and Senator Heitkamp, as \nwell as myself and Senator Heinrich. I wish to acknowledge the role of \nSenator Heinrich in this and his staff for working with us to revise \nand reintroduce this important bill. I would also like to acknowledge \nthe great work the bipartisan leadership of the Senate's Sportsmen's \nCaucus has done on this issue, led ably by my friend from Idaho. I \nthink it is important to recognize the groundwork, the leg work that \nwent into the development of this bill and the work the caucus did in \ndoing so. So I thank my colleagues for all of their good, hard work.\n  We are here today to not only announce this reintroduction--because \nthis is now the third Congress we have tried to advance the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act--but also to really kind of re-up the conversation \nabout its importance and really to urge the Senate to come together to \npass legislation such as we are talking about today.\n  We have sportsmen all over the country. I come from a big State that \nis wide open, and people come to Alaska to hunt and to fish. They never \nwant to leave, and that is fine. That is how my husband came to \nAlaska--it was the lure of sport fishing on the Kenai River. So many of \nour military are on assignment to Alaska, and they end up staying \nbecause of the hunting and fishing and other recreational opportunities \nAlaska offers. It is not just places such as Alaska and Idaho that \noffer great outdoors opportunities; it is all over the country, from \nbig cities to small towns, North and South.\n  For so many of us, hunting is a tradition that is passed down from \ngeneration to generation. Certainly my family is evidence of that. I \nthink it is important to recognize that while we talk about hunting and \nfishing as being the best known recreational opportunities, we also \ninclude with this legislation enthusiasts who go outside to go boating \nand so many of the other outdoor activities.\n  We speak often on this floor about jobs and economic opportunities \nand what they bring to our Nation, the important role they play. \nSportsmen and sportswomen really are economic contributors when we \nthink about their role. Back in 2013 there were approximately 37 \nmillion people who hunted or fished in America. That is roughly equal \nto the entire population of the State of California. Those numbers are \nalways on the rise. Again, when we have strong numbers, we also have \nstrong economic impacts. Sports men and women spent roughly $90 billion \nin 2013. Those numbers have probably risen since then. Those dollars go \nnot only to the gear and equipment, which is what we would expect, but \nalso to the travel industry, to the hospitality industry, and to so \nmany other sectors of the economy.\n  Spending by sports men and women also aids our conservation efforts. \nExcise taxes on fishing and hunting and shooting equipment, motorboat \nfuel, as well as the fees for licenses and stamps are all dedicated to \nState fish and wildlife management and conservation. These folks care \ndeeply about the environment and conservation, and that is why these \nexcise taxes are in place to take care of our natural resources. Since \ntheir establishment, the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Programs \nhave contributed over $14.5 billion to conservation.\n  I mentioned Alaska and its role as kind of a magnet for those who \nlike to hunt and fish. In my State alone, we have over 125,000 \nindividuals who engage in hunting every year. It has created more than \n$439 million in retail sales and $195 million in salaries and wages. In \nAlaska, we bring in over $53 million to the State and local governments \neach year. We had a big holiday a year or so ago when Cabela's opened \nits doors. It was as though we had finally arrived on the scene. All of \nour sportsmen--hunters and fishermen--were loving it.\n  On the fishing side, when we think about the economic impact in my \nState, it is even more impressive. Last year over 460,000 people bought \nfishing licenses to take part in some of the best fishing in the world. \nIt brought about $1.4 billion to Alaska's economy. These are huge \ncontributors to our tax base, to our economy, and they are key to who \nwe are as a State.\n  Our Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015 that we are introducing today \nbuilds on the efforts of last year. Last year's bill saw 46 Members of \nthis Chamber coming together to support it. We have taken all of the \nprovisions from the previous bill except for two that were enacted in \nother legislation and then we have added some additional bipartisan \nprovisions. We have Senator Heinrich's revised HUNT Act. We have a \ncouple of others that are new to the bill. All told, these measures \nincrease access to provide greater opportunities for sports men and \nwomen to enjoy our public lands.\n  There are a lot of different components in the bill. I know my \ncolleague from Idaho will speak to several of them. I wish to highlight \na couple that I think are important in this discussion.\n  First is a bill I have championed for several years now called the \nRecreational Fishing and Hunting Heritage and Opportunities Act. It \nprotects recreational hunting and fishing on our BLM and our National \nForest Service lands while reaffirming other prior congressional \nactions enacted to protect hunting and wildlife conservation. So the \nbill we have introduced--again, this is the same one we have had \npreviously--requires BLM and Forest Service lands to be open to \nhunting, to recreational fishing, or recreational shooting as a matter \nof law unless the managing agency acts to close lands to such activity. \nSo it is open unless otherwise closed. Leaving lands open unless closed \nmeans that agencies need not take action then to open them up to \nhunting and fishing. Agencies are still permitted to close or put \nrestrictions on land for a number of purposes, such as resource \nconservation and public safety. But on the whole this is really an \naffirmation that sportsmen and sportswomen are welcome on our public \nlands. Isn't that what our public lands are supposed to be all about, \nwhich is being able to access them?\n  The Hunting, Fishing, and Recreational Shooting Protection Act has \nagain been included in this bill. This\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nwas introduced previously by Senators Thune and Klobuchar as a \nstandalone bill, but its language is very important to many of us and \nto nearly all the sportsmen's groups we have heard from.\n  We also have provisions in the bill that deal with some of the \nefforts to limit ammunition and fishing tackle by some organizations. I \nthink we know that if we can't access, if we can't afford traditional \nammunition and fishing tackle, it makes it pretty tough to go out and \nenjoy these opportunities.\n  We have good pieces in here relating to conservation priorities, \nincluding the North American Wetlands Conservation Act and the National \nFish and Wildlife Foundation.\n  I again the Sportsmen's Caucus and Senator Heinrich as the prime \nDemocratic lead on this bill. My hope is that we will be able to build \nthis coalition on the floor and get even beyond the number 46, which is \nwhat we had last go-around with this legislation.\n  I think we will have good discussion within the committee and here on \nthe Senate floor. My hope is that the third time is going to be the \ncharm for this sportsmen's legislation. It is important to us, it is \nimportant to our economy, and it is an issue which I am certainly \nwilling to take aim at. Sorry for the pun.\n  With that, I yield to my friend from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today also in support of the \nBipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015. I am honored to be here today with \nSenator Murkowski. Idahoans and Alaskans have a lot in common when it \ncomes to outdoor sporting activities, including hunting and fishing. \nSenator Crapo and I were honored to host Senator Murkowski in Idaho. \nAlthough we don't have the acres Alaska has, we certainly have that \ndiverse environment for hunting and fishing in many different areas of \nthe State that support and will continue to support both fishing and \ngame.\n  This bill is cosponsored by a bipartisan team of Senators who are \ncommitted to advancing the agenda of sportsmen and sportswomen. \nSenators Murkowski and Heinrich, along with the leaders of the \nCongressional Sportsmen's Caucus--myself and Senator Manchin as the co-\nchairmen and Senator Fischer and Senator Heitkamp as the co-vice \nchairmen--make up the largest bipartisan caucus in Congress, and we \nhave diligently labored to craft this bipartisan legislation that is \nsupported by a broad coalition of sportsmen's groups. Indeed, we have \nworked on it substantially more since the first of the year. Last year \nwe labored over it at great length and were not able to get it across \nthe finish line, but we are cautiously optimistic this year that we \nhave hit that right spot where we actually can get this across the \nfinish line this year.\n  One provision of this package will encourage States to create and \nmaintain public shooting ranges. This will promote gun safety by \nproviding a venue to teach young adults about firearms. These public \nranges can also serve as a place to hold hunter education classes and \ncan be used as facilities to train police forces.\n  This bill will also allow any legal gun owner to carry a firearm on \nland administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This provision \nwill require the Army Corps to conform their regulations to align with \nlocal laws related to firearms. I wish to thank my colleague from \nIdaho, Senator Mike Crapo, for his hard work and leadership on this \nparticular issue. I know the sportsmen of Idaho and across the country \nare pleased to know that this legislation will allow firearms on Army \nCorps land and that it is included in this bipartisan sportsmen's \npackage.\n  This bill will also reauthorize the Federal Land Transaction \nFacilitation Act, a program that enables the Bureau of Land Management \nto sell public land for community development and other projects. This \nland-for-land approach creates jobs and generates funding for the BLM \nto acquire critical inholdings from willing sellers.\n  I am also proud to include a provision supported by my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, to allow archery equipment to be \ntransported and possessed in national parks. Archery is one of the \nfastest growing sports in America. It should not be illegal to carry a \nbow in a national park.\n  I am happy to work with my colleagues to include this important \nprovision in this Sportsmen's Act. Whether you hunt or fish to put food \non the table or for sport or to pass down a tradition to your family or \nfor game-management purposes, there is something in this bill for you.\n  With more than half a million sportsmen and sportswomen in the State \nof Idaho, this legislation will ensure they can continue to access \ntheir favorite hunting or fishing sport. In fact, the number of people \nwho hunt each year in Idaho would fill Boise State Broncos stadium more \nthan 6\\1/2\\ times. Most of you are familiar with that stadium since it \nis the only stadium in America that has blue turf, and most everyone \nhas seen that.\n  For those of us who hunt and fish, it is difficult to put into words \nwhy this legislation is so important. I ask everyone I talk to about \nthese issues to encourage and teach youngsters about hunting and \nfishing. In Idaho this last year 14,000 kids purchased a junior fishing \nlicense, and approximately 14,000 purchased a junior hunting license. \nThese numbers could be higher, and they should be higher. It is \nimportant to teach and mentor these future generations--those coming \nbehind us--about hunting and fishing and to hand down this culture to \nthem. Hunting and fishing give us a great reason to be in the great \noutdoors, a great reason to hand down traditions, and a great reason to \nsupport the Bipartisan Sportsmen's Act of 2015.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with \nthis bipartisan coalition we put together, to cosponsor and to work \nwith us to pass this legislation.\n  Ms. HEITIKAMP. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my \ncolleagues from Alaska and New Mexico in introducing the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act.\n  In North Dakota, hunting and fishing are a huge part of our lives. We \nhave opening day circled on our calendars like we do birthdays and \nanniversaries. It was in North Dakota where America's conservationist \nPresident, Theodore Roosevelt, fell in love with our State and \nrecognized the need to preserve our Nation's fish and game for future \ngenerations. As President Roosevelt once said:\n\n       The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources \n     as assets which it must turn over to the next generation \n     increased and not impaired in value. Conservation means \n     development as much as it does protection.\n\n  It is an honor to be able to help introduce this important \nlegislation and continue to advance voluntary conservation measures \nthat have kept our State a world-class destination for hunters and \nfishermen.\n  This bill would continue programs such as the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation which have successful track records of working with \nnonprofits, State and local governments and private landowners to \npromote voluntary conservation of fish and game habitat.\n  It also includes a number of provisions that will enable our hunters \nand fishers to access the lands their tax dollars pay to maintain. \nAdditionally, it would set aside funds from the Land and Water \nConservation Fund for improving recreational access to Federal lands. \nIt would also direct agencies to identify high-priority Federal hunting \nand fishing lands where there is currently no access and work to \nprovide access to sportsmen.\n  One section of the bill is particularly important to my State--\nenabling greater use of funds for public shooting ranges. We have a \nnumber of extremely popular target ranges in North Dakota and, with the \ngreat influx in population to the area, they have been under \nconsiderable stress. One such range in the city of Watford City has had \nto shut down as the city expanded around it. This bill would allow \nNorth Dakota Game and Fish to work with the city to move and reopen the \nrange and provide a safe place for hunters to practice their skills.\n  I want to thank Senators Murkowski and Heinrich, as well as Senators \nRisch, Manchin, and Fisher for being excellent partners through the \nSportsmen's Caucus to introduce this bipartisan bill. I look forward to \nworking with them to bring this bill to the floor and sending it to the \nPresident to become law.\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Bipartisan \nSportsmen's Act. I am pleased to join my colleague in introducing this \nlegislation.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity to work with my colleagues on \nlegislation that will promote our country's hunting, fishing, and \nconservation heritage.\n  This bill does a lot of good things. It prevents antihunting groups \nfrom restricting sportsmen's ammunition choices, which would \nunnecessarily drive up hunting costs, impede participation in shooting \nsports, and consequently decrease conservation funding.\n  The Sportsmen's Act provides States with more flexibility to build \nand maintain public shooting ranges in order to provide Americans with \nmore opportunities to engage in recreational and competitive shooting \nactivities. The legislation also expands and enhances hunting and \nfishing opportunities on Federal lands by establishing a more open \npolicy for access to recreational activities on our public lands.\n  I am especially encouraged by the fact that this bill contains \nprovisions I have championed that would increase transparency regarding \nthe judgment fund. It has the potential to help our efforts to track \ntaxpayer-funded litigation that impacts our public lands policies.\n  As my colleagues may or may not know, the judgment fund is \nadministered by the Treasury Department and is used to pay certain \ncourt judgments and settlements against the Federal Government. \nEssentially, this fund acts as an unlimited amount of money that is set \naside to pay for Federal Government liability. It is not subject to the \nannual appropriations process, and, even more remarkably, the Treasury \nDepartment has no reporting requirements, so these funds are paid out \nwith very little oversight or scrutiny.\n  This is no small matter, as the judgment fund disburses billions of \ndollars in payments every year. Because the Treasury Department has no \nbinding reporting requirements, few public details exist about where \nthese funds are going and why.\n  The Public Lands Council has decried the lack of oversight of the \njudgment fund by stating:\n\n       Certain groups continuously sue the federal government, and \n     [the] Treasury simply writes a check to foot the bill without \n     providing Members of Congress and the American taxpayers \n     basic information about the payment.\n\n  This kind of litigation can have a big impact on sportsmen and others \nwho enjoy multiple uses of Federal lands. This is because the \ngovernment is permitted to blindly fund lawsuits by activist groups who \nuse the court as a backdoor to policy making.\n  A recent report from the GAO found that cases filed against the EPA \nhave shown a pattern of these groups working in unison with big law \nfirms to sue under the same statutes in order to push their political \nagenda through the courts.\n  The legislation I introduced this week with Senator Gardner, known as \nthe Judgment Fund Transparency Act, will bring these cases to light. \nThat bill has been included as a provision to the Sportsmen's Act and \nwill provide even greater transparency and accountability.\n  I am proud to be a vice chair of the Sportsmen's Caucus, and I look \nforward to continuing our work to advance these important legislative \nmeasures.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss our truly \nbipartisan sportsmen's bill. This is a bipartisan bill which has been \nworked on for quite some time, and I think its time has come. They say \nPaul Masson's wine's time has come. It has. We have Senators Lisa \nMurkowski from Alaska, Mark Heinrich from New Mexico, Jim Risch from \nIdaho, myself from West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp from North Dakota, and \nDeb Fischer from Nebraska. It is balanced. I think we will find total \nsupport hopefully on both sides.\n  Let me talk about the bill and what it does. It is good for \nsportsmen, hunters, and lovers of the outdoors. This is a bill which \nshows that Democrats and Republicans can truly come together and work \ntogether. The bill should be a model for how we can make things work \nhere in Washington, and we hope the country will be watching.\n  West Virginia has more than 1.6 million acres of public land open to \nhunting. In a State that is our size, if they flatten the State, it \nwould be bigger than Texas. But with all the mountains and hills and \neverything, it is an absolutely wonderful and beautiful place to grow \nup and live and hunt and enjoy the outdoors.\n  We have a year-round fishing season with more than 20,000 miles of \nstreams and more than 100 public fishing lakes. In 2011 West Virginia \nsaw more than 400,000 hunters and sportsmen supporting more than 12,000 \njobs--400,000 hunters supporting 12,000 West Virginia jobs. These \nsportsmen spent $870 million on hunting and fishing in West Virginia \nand generated $81 million in State and local taxes. That is an industry \nwithin itself. In a small State such as ours, we are very appreciative \nof every job and every dollar that helps us provide a better quality of \nlife.\n  Let me tell you about growing up in West Virginia. It was funny. I \nhad a conversation on the floor of the Senate with some of my \ncolleagues, and we were talking about many issues. We started talking \nabout how we grew up and this and that, and he said: You know, Joe, I \ngrew up in a community in a part of the city where I never knew anybody \nwho owned a gun.\n  I was thinking how much he missed. That means he had never been \nhunting. No one ever taught him how to shoot and be safe--the safety \nthings we should learn. I kept thinking about that. I thought to myself \nand I told him: You know something, I grew up in a town where I didn't \nknow anybody who didn't have a gun. It is just the cultures we have.\n  If this bill helps introduce people to the love of the outdoors, to \nthe sporting, whether it is just shooting from the standpoint of \ntargets or sports shooting or actually hunting and basically the game--\nit is very nutritional and very healthy. Venison is a big staple of the \ndiet in West Virginia. It is very good quality meat and very low in \nfat, very high in protein and fiber. It is great.\n  You start learning about gun safety. My father was not a hunter. My \nfather never got into it. My grandfather was not a hunter. My uncles \nwere very much involved. But my dad made sure we had a sporting club in \nthe little town, a little coal mining town, and the people who were \nvery astute in this basically took all of us under their wing. They \nwould teach us how to shoot. They would teach us the safety. They would \nteach us how to respect where we--if we are going to shoot something, \nwe should be able to harvest the game or know somebody who would use it \nfor nutritional values. Don't waste a thing. But also go out in the \nwoods and enjoy the beauty God gave us. I look back on those days.\n  Then I took my grandson hunting the first time. First of all, I \ncouldn't believe how good his eyesight was and how good he could shoot. \nIt is something that now he is fixated on, and he does a great job, and \nI am so happy to see him. My son loves fishing, and I take him with me \nall the time. It is a family tradition. We do it once a year. We do a \nwhole family trip where everybody goes.\n  This bill, the Sportsmen's Act of 2015, does so many things all over \nAmerica. It really helps us promote and continue to promote the love of \nthe outdoors, the love of hunting, the love of fishing, basically of \nsports shooting, competitive sports shooting, pleasurable sports \nshooting, learning the safety of a gun, what we should and should not \ndo, learning to respect others around us, making sure safety is the \nfirst and foremost thing we do.\n  I hope this bill gets very quick action, very favorable action. We \ncan start out this new year, if you will, on something that is truly \noverwhelmingly a bipartisan bill. I am sure there will be people who \nhave something they might object to in any piece of legislation. They \nwill have to work hard to find something in this bill they can object \nto because I think it is put together the right way, in a bipartisan \nway. It is good for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S839-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S839-S840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 69--CALLING FOR THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS MINORITY \n                     RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WORLDWIDE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Boozman, Mr.\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nPortman, Mr. King, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Lankford) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 69\n\n       Whereas it is a human right for all peoples to enjoy the \n     fundamental freedom of religion, and the United States \n     remains committed to promoting and protecting those that have \n     been marginalized and persecuted because of their faith;\n       Whereas Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights recognizes that ``everyone has the right to freedom of \n     thought, conscience, and religion; this right includes \n     freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either \n     alone or in community with others and in public or private, \n     to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, \n     worship, and observance'';\n       Whereas the freedom to worship by minority religious \n     communities worldwide has come under repeated and deadly \n     attack, and often religious minorities are regarded as \n     enemies of the state;\n       Whereas the freedom to proselytize by minority religious \n     communities has also come under repeated and deadly attack in \n     recent years through so-called blasphemy laws and anti-\n     conversion laws that are punishable by fines, imprisonment, \n     and death;\n       Whereas, on November 1, 2010, the deadliest ever recorded \n     attack on Iraqi Christians occurred at the Sayidat al-Nejat \n     Catholic Cathedral located in central Baghdad, where \n     militants stormed the church and detonated 2 suicide vests \n     filled with ball bearings, killing 58, including 2 priests, \n     and wounding 78 parishioners;\n       Whereas, in November 2010, Aasia Bibi, a Christian mother \n     of five, was fined $1,100 and sentenced to death by hanging \n     for blasphemy, becoming the first woman condemned to death on \n     blasphemy charges in Pakistan, and remains jailed today \n     appealing her sentence;\n       Whereas, on December 29, 2011, the Shia religious leader \n     Tajul Muluk's Islamic boarding school in Madura Island, \n     Indonesia was burned down in an arson attack by 300 anti-\n     Shi'ite protestors, causing 500 Shia residents to flee from \n     their homes, and on January 1, 2012, the Indonesian Ulema \n     Council issued a fatwa against his teachings, leading to \n     blasphemy charges and the arrest of Muluk on April 12, 2012, \n     in Sampang, where he remains in prison;\n       Whereas, on July 28, 2012, Saeed Abedini, a Christian \n     pastor with dual Iranian and United States citizenship, was \n     arrested on charges solely based on his Christian faith, \n     convicted, and sentenced to eight years in a brutal Iranian \n     prison where he remains today;\n       Whereas, on October 17, 2013, 10 bombs exploded in the \n     minority Shi'ite districts of Baghdad, killing 44 people, \n     including 6 children, and on that same day a suicide bomber \n     drove into a village in the northern province of Ninebeh, \n     killing 15 Shabaks, who are mainly Shi'ites and are viewed as \n     apostates by extreme Sunni Islamists;\n       Whereas, on November 16, 2013, Zhang Shaojie, a member of \n     Three-Self church and pastor of the government-sanctioned \n     Nanle County Christian Church, China, was arrested, fined \n     $16,000, and given a 12 year prison sentence for ``gathering \n     a crowd to disrupt the public order,'' in what is believed to \n     be retaliation for his advocacy on behalf of his congregation \n     and community;\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2014, a Sudanese Christian woman, \n     Meriam Ibrahim, was imprisoned and sentenced to death by \n     hanging for allegedly committing apostasy from Islam and \n     faced constant pressure to renounce her faith of Christianity \n     while in prison, and only after immediate and sustained \n     pressure by the United States Senate and the Department of \n     State was she released and allowed to leave the country, \n     settling in New Hampshire with her husband and two children;\n       Whereas, on November 10, 2014, a young Christian Pakistani \n     couple, Shama Bibi and Sajjad Maseeh, who was four months \n     pregnant with her fifth child, were brutally beaten by a mob \n     in Punjab Province, had their legs broken so they could not \n     flee, and were locked in a brick kiln to burn to death while \n     a crowd of 1,200 watched for alleged blasphemy of the \n     desecration of a Koran;\n       Whereas, since 2010, the Nigerian terrorist organization \n     Boko Haram, which translates to ``western education is a \n     sin,'' has destroyed more than 1,000 churches across Nigeria, \n     abducted hundreds of Christians to forcibly convert to Islam, \n     and in increasingly violent attacks beginning in 2014, has \n     killed more than 1,700 Christians;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom, over 15,000 people in North \n     Korea are presently incarcerated in prison labor camps for \n     attempting to practice their religion and face constant abuse \n     in attempts to force them to renounce their faith;\n       Whereas, since the beginning of its reign of terror, ISIL \n     has sought to destroy any person of faith that does not \n     embrace their own perverted interpretation of Islam, leading \n     to the destruction of Jonah's tomb in Mosul, the destruction \n     of Sunni shrines and mosques in Ninevah, the destruction of \n     Christian churches in Syria, and the slaughter of anyone who \n     resists their teachings; and\n       Whereas seven Indian states have so-called ``anti-\n     conversion'' apostasy laws that require officials to assess \n     the legality of conversions, and fine and/or imprison those \n     responsible for the conversions if it is determined to be \n     illegal: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) remains committed to protecting the human right and the \n     fundamental freedom of religion, especially those of \n     religious minorities;\n       (2) recognizes that government policies prohibiting the \n     freedom of thought and religion are designed to harass and \n     intimidate religious groups; and\n       (3) urges in the strongest terms that the United States \n     Government lead the international effort in calling for the \n     repeal of all existing apostasy and blasphemy laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url":

Res. 70\n\n       Whereas carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas that \n     is produced whenever any fuel, such as natural gas, propane, \n     gasoline, oil, kerosene, wood, or charcoal, is burned;\n       Whereas devices that produce carbon monoxide include cars, \n     boats, gasoline engines, stoves, and heating systems, and \n     carbon monoxide produced from these sources can build up in \n     enclosed or semi-enclosed spaces;\n       Whereas carbon monoxide is often referred to as the \n     ``silent killer'' because it is colorless, odorless, \n     tasteless, and nonirritating, and ignoring early stages of \n     carbon monoxide poisoning may cause unconsciousness and \n     continual exposure to danger;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, each year in the United States, carbon monoxide \n     poisoning kills more than 400 individuals and sends \n     approximately 20,000 individuals to emergency rooms;\n       Whereas when people breathe in carbon monoxide, the \n     poisonous gas enters the bloodstream and prevents adequate \n     intake of oxygen, which can damage tissues and result in \n     death;\n       Whereas given their common preexisting medical conditions, \n     individuals older than age 65 are particularly vulnerable to \n     carbon monoxide poisoning;\n       Whereas for most individuals who suffer from carbon \n     monoxide poisoning, the early signs of exposure to low \n     concentrations of carbon monoxide include mild headaches and \n     breathlessness upon moderate exercise;\n       Whereas sustained or increased exposure to carbon monoxide \n     can lead to flu-like symptoms, including severe headaches, \n     dizziness, tiredness, nausea, confusion, irritability, and \n     impaired judgment, memory, and coordination;\n       Whereas breathing in low concentrations of carbon monoxide \n     can cause long-term health damage, even after exposure to the \n     gas ends;\n       Whereas most cases of carbon monoxide exposure occur during \n     the winter months of December, January, and February when oil \n     and gas heaters are more heavily in use;\n       Whereas on January 17, 2009, Amanda J. Hansen, a junior and \n     member of the swim team at West Seneca West High School, in \n     West Seneca, New York, passed away from carbon monoxide \n     poisoning while sleeping near a faulty basement boiler during \n     a sleepover party;\n       Whereas Amanda J. Hansen loved Spanish, was a member of the \n     Spanish Honor Society at West Seneca West High School, and \n     wanted to eventually teach Spanish;\n       Whereas Amanda J. Hansen hoped to attend college at the \n     University of North Carolina;\n       Whereas responding to tragedy, Ken and Kim Hansen \n     established the Amanda Hansen Foundation to honor their \n     daughter by raising money for a scholarship fund and \n     spreading awareness about the dangers of carbon monoxide and \n     the importance of taking safety measures, such as using \n     carbon monoxide detectors in residences;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation works with lawmakers \n     and local communities to educate the public on the dangers of \n     carbon monoxide poisoning;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation raises money for \n     purchasing carbon monoxide detectors for individuals who \n     cannot afford them and has given away 17,000 carbon monoxide \n     detectors;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation and Ken and Kim Hansen \n     through their work with the Foundation collaborate with other \n     national organizations to ensure that carbon monoxide \n     detectors are as ubiquitous as possible;\n       Whereas the Hansen family fought in 2010 for the passage of \n     ``Amanda's Law'', a law that mandates the installation of \n     carbon monoxide detectors in new and existing residences with \n     fuel burning appliances and the replacement of such detectors \n     every 5 years;\n       Whereas the Amanda Hansen Foundation has paid to replace \n     furnaces in the Buffalo, New York area with furnaces that are \n     safer and more energy efficient; and\n       Whereas in memory of their daughter, the Hansen family has \n     worked tirelessly to make New York and the rest of the United \n     States a safer place: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates February 2015 as \n     ``National Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Awareness Month''.\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/05/senate-section/article/S841-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 71--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF FEBRUARY 8 THROUGH \n      FEBRUARY 14, 2015, AS ``INTERNET GOVERNANCE AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Warner, Mr. Coons, and Mr. \nInhofe) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                               S. Res. 71\n\n       Whereas the United States remains committed to the \n     multistakeholder model of Internet governance, in which the \n     private sector works in collaboration with civil society, \n     governments, and technical experts in a consensus fashion;\n       Whereas the United States has, through its stewardship of \n     key Internet domain name functions, maintained an important \n     role in the protection of the Internet as presently \n     constituted;\n       Whereas on March 14, 2014, the National Telecommunications \n     and Information Administration (referred to in this preamble \n     as the ``NTIA'') announced its intent to transition these key \n     Internet domain name functions to the global multistakeholder \n     community;\n       Whereas the transition process demonstrates that the United \n     States supports and is committed to the multistakeholder \n     model of Internet governance;\n       Whereas the NTIA has asked the Internet Corporation for \n     Assigned Names and Numbers (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``ICANN'') to convene global stakeholders to develop a \n     proposal to transition the current role played by the NTIA in \n     the coordination of the Internet's domain name system \n     (referred to in this preamble as the ``DNS'');\n       Whereas the NTIA has stated that there is no deadline for \n     the transition, and that the transition proposal must have \n     broad community support and must--\n       (1) support and enhance the multistakeholder model;\n       (2) maintain the security, stability, and resiliency of the \n     Internet DNS;\n       (3) meet the needs and expectations of the global customers \n     and partners of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority; and\n       (4) maintain the openness of the Internet;\n       Whereas the NTIA has also stated that it will not accept a \n     proposal that replaces the NTIA with a government-led or an \n     inter-governmental organization, a position that is \n     consistent with S.
