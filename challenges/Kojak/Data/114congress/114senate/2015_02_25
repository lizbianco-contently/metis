Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 5, H.R. 240, a bill \n     making appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday President Obama took the \nextreme step of vetoing good American jobs. He sided with partisan \nextremists and powerful special interests over the middle class.\n  It says a lot about the priorities of this administration. But if the \nWhite House thinks this is the end of the new Congress's push for \nAmerican jobs, it is wrong. I will soon have more to say about this and \nwhat the Senate plans to do.\n  For the moment, the Senate is focused on overcoming another extreme \nidea: the Democrats' Homeland Security filibuster to defend Executive \noverreach.\n  Many Senate Democrats led their constituents to believe they would do \nsomething about the kind of Executive overreach President Obama \nreferred to as ``unwise and unfair'' and ignoring the law. Those are \nthe words of the President of the United States. We have since heard \nexcuses from Democrats to cover for their refusal to do so. But the \ntime for excuses has now passed. Democrats will soon have another \nchance to prove they were serious.\n  Later this week, the Senate will consider a bill from the senior \nSenator from Maine that is about as reasonable as you can get. \nObviously, President Obama was right to refer to the kind of overreach \nhe took in November as ignoring the law. Senator Collins' sensible bill \nfocuses simply on preventing the most egregious example of Executive \noverreach from taking effect. It is as simple as that.\n  The Collins bill is not tied to funding of DHS, either. So there are \nno excuses left. Democrats should join us in voting for this \ncommonsense legislation.\n  In the meantime, we have offered Democrats a chance to prove they \nwere serious about something else, and that is funding the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  It is really something to watch Democrats vote and block funding for \nthis Department one day and then hold a hypocritical press conference \nthe next. Democrats need to end their weeks-long filibuster of Homeland \nSecurity funding and end it right now.\n  We have continually offered them sensible opportunities to do so. \nYesterday, we offered them yet another. But it will require their \ncooperation to achieve.\n  The dual-pronged approach I have outlined--allowing the Senate to \nstop unwise and unfair overreach on the one hand and to fund DHS \nthrough the fiscal year on the other--is a sensible way forward, but it \ncan't be achieved without cross-partisan cooperation.\n  The onus continues to be on the Democratic Party to keep the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funded. Democrats can fund DHS now--not \nby holding more hypocritical press conferences but by ending their \nsenseless filibuster and cooperating across the aisle.\n  That is what Americans expect. That is what Democrats can finally \nwork together with us on to get done now.\n\n\n                       reservation of leader time\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I reran for the Senate in 2010, there \nwere two major issues that dominated the campaign and that continue to \ndominate the discussion and debate in the Senate postelection. One was \nthe Affordable Care Act, now called ObamaCare, which was pushed through \nwithout any bipartisan support. There was a lot of concern among the \nAmerican people about the impact this would have on their lives. That \nwas an issue of intense discussion and debate during that campaign.\n  The second was the plunge into debt at a level Americans had never \nseen before in the history of the country. It took nearly 200 years, \nfrom the beginning of our Nation until 1981, to reach the $1 trillion \ndebt mark. That is a lot of governing. That is a lot of growth of \nAmerica. But we were essentially on a path--including expenditures for \nwar and so forth--that didn't take us deeply into debt relative to our \ngross domestic product.\n  All of a sudden, in 2010, there was the revelation that debt held by \nthe public was rapidly nearing the $10 trillion mark--a tenfold \nincrease in less than 30 years. It took 190 plus years to get to the \nfirst $1 trillion and only 30 years to add ten times that amount. That \nwas a hot topic of debate during the 2010 election. During that \nelection, the American people came out in significant numbers and said: \nGet to Washington and do something about this.\n  In the background, a debt clock was ticking away, and not only on my \nwebsite but clocks around the country at different times, and people \nwere astonished at how fast those numbers were churning.\n  That led to a pretty intense effort on the part of both parties and \non the part of many organizations. I can remember Simpson-Bowles--a \nformer Chief of Staff of President Bill Clinton along with a former \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming, a Republican and a Democrat \ntogether--Simpson-Bowles. The public was getting behind this--a $4 \ntrillion, over 10 year fix to the problem. It was pretty dramatic, yet \nthere was a lot of momentum for it. That was shot down, unfortunately, \nby the President when it was presented.\n  Following that, we had the Gang of 6, a bipartisan effort, and the \nJoint Committee on Deficit Reduction--the group of 12, 6 Democrats and \n6 Republicans working diligently to try to put something together, \nalong with outside organizations, to fix the debt. There were any \nnumber of these--the Domenici Rivlin task force--proposals that were \nworked on together in a bipartisan way, realizing that as the debt was \ncontinuing to accumulate it was going to have major negative \nconsequences to the future of our children and grandchildren and \nperhaps even our own generation.\n  We stand here today, having gone through all that--the Vitter \ncommittee, which I was a part of; eight of us agreeing with the \nPresident, with no staff and no press, closed room, months and months \nand months of negotiation--only once again to come up short. \nUltimately, we sacrificed so many things we thought we needed to do \njust to get something going. But once again it was shot down in the end \nby a President who really wasn't willing to accept even the provisions \nhe had proposed in his budget proposal that was publicly proposed. We \ntook those and said: Can we at least do these, Mr. President? You have \nannounced this is your initiative. But it was a no go.\n  Well, as a member of the Committee on Appropriations, I then tried to \nwork with various agencies. They all had to come before us to make \ntheir requests known for the coming year. I asked them: Do you have a \nplan B in place? What do you mean plan B? What is plan B all about?\n  Plan B is the fact that mandatory spending is running away with our \nbudget and the available amount of money for your discretionary \nspending is shrinking every year. So what is your plan B in terms of \nhaving less money available, whether it is for health care, for \neducation, for building roads? All of the discretionary issues that \nfall under the discretionary spending that we are in control of, we no \nlonger have control of. That is shrinking and you are going to have to \ndo more with less. And I asked that they provide a plan B before they \ncould get my clearance in terms of supporting their requests.\n  They never came forward. No, we have to stay with what the \nPresident's budget is and so forth. So here we are now, over $8 \ntrillion more than where we were in 2010, and an $18 trillion-plus \ndeficit.\n  Everyone knows this is unsustainable. Everyone in America knows we \nare careening toward insolvency, with an inability to cover even some \nof the most basic functions of government.\n  I talk to agencies about a policy of triage. I suggested they \nseparate out what they absolutely essentially have to do and we will \nfund it. Then part B is what they would like to do if they had the \nmoney to do it. Part C is their asking: Why are we doing that in the \nfirst place or that program is long past its need, its existence or it \nhasn't worked. Let's start there, with part C, and let's get rid of \nexcess spending that has no real function going forward or it is \nduplication or fraud or waste or whatever.\n  That leads me now to this poster. I have kind of gone from acting \nlike the President's Chief of Staff to the co-chair of the ``go big \nguy'' in terms of what we need to do. We can't go there, but maybe we \ncan go a little. And we are all the way down now to what I call ``waste \nof the week.''\n  Let us at least identify those things that the Government \nAccountability Office and the Congressional Budget Office have \nidentified as those things we know don't work, that we know are a \nwaste, that we know are duplication, and let's see if we can get at \nleast some start in terms of dealing with this debt.\n  Senator Coburn took the lead on that in the last several sessions of \nCongress. We are going to miss him because no one can do it better than \nhe did in pointing out and really embarrassing a lot of us in asking: \nWhy are we funding that? I am not trying to take his place. But I did, \nwith my staff, come up with the idea to at least let our colleagues \nknow--those who say we can't cut a penny more, we have cut too much--\nthat, yes, we can cut more. We can at least do something to address \nthis debt or have money to offset a needed funding program.\n  So we are going to inaugurate ``waste of the week'' today. In its \ndebut, I will go back to something I tried to amend when we were \naddressing the unemployment insurance issue. Ultimately, I was not able \nto offer the amendment thanks to the majority leader's filling of the \ntree and not allowing any amendments. I made a big stink about it. I \ndidn't understand why we could not at least take that up.\n  So waste of the week this week is the cost to the taxpayer for those \nin the safety net receiving Social Security Disability Insurance or \nunemployment insurance and getting checks from both agencies.\n  Now, if you can prove to the appropriate government agency that you \ncan't work, you can be eligible if you go through the process for \nSocial Security Disability Insurance. But if you go to the Social \nSecurity Disability Insurance agency and make your claim, you can't \nthen go to the unemployment insurance agency and say you can't work, \nthat you can't find work, that you are able to work but that you need \nto get that check from that agency. What has been documented now is the \nfact that there are very significant numbers of people who are gaming \nthis issue and receiving checks from both agencies.\n\n  Either you can work or you can't work. You are eligible for one \nsafety net program or the other, but not both. That totals $5.7 billion \nof duplication.\n  My amendment that I had offered under the unemployment insurance \nextension in the last Congress was simply to say you can't do both, and \nwe are going to put procedures in place so we can find out who is doing \nboth.\n  One would think this would be pretty simple, even in the paper age, \nbut we are in the digital age. I don't understand why the people \nadministering\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\nthis can't simply take the Social Security number and plug it into \nunemployment insurance and say: Do you have this person's name with \nthis Social Security number? Are they receiving unemployment insurance? \nOr vice versa. It ought to be the push of a button on a computer so \nthat it is not all that costly and makes a great deal of sense.\n  The worst they would have to do is pick up the phone and say: I have \nJohn Doe here whose Social Security number is X. He is applying for \nSocial Security Disability Insurance. Do you have him on the \nunemployment role? Or vice versa. I am sorry, Mr. Doe, but you can't do \nboth, and you are gaming the system. This duplication of benefits costs \n$5.7 billion. That is a pretty good savings.\n  This is the first of what will be a weekly presentation of programs \nthat are no longer needed, that are duplicative, where there is fraud \nor waste involved. I am going to bring this forward every week, and we \nare going to try to add it all up.\n  We start here with $5.7 billion, and I have my spending thermometer \ngoing up to $100 billion. I think we can go much higher than that. Tom \nCoburn said we could, through his Wastebook and the work he has done.\n  So we have already inked it in here. We are going to start filling \nthis in by coming here every week.\n  People may say: Well, that is small change. Look, $5.7 billion is not \nsmall change. In comparison to our debt, does it solve the problem? \nAbsolutely not. It is at least a start. Can we at least not come \ntogether in sensible things such as this and at least get started in \nthe right direction?\n  In the meantime, I think we are still going to be pushed into \nsituations by crisis, when no longer the countenance of the investment \nworld in America in terms of the rate of return is acceptable, because \nthe debt continues to accumulate.\n  So here we are, back to 2010, back to where we were. I know it is not \ntalked about very much at this stage. We have foreign policy issues and \ndomestic issues we have to engage in. But the clock is ticking away, \nminute after minute, second after second, and it is a continued plunge \nof the deficit spending--borrowing money we don't have in order to pay \nfor things we need, but also paying for things we don't need.\n  So I will be here every week with a new proposal. We will be filling \nin this chart, and hopefully at least start us on the process once \nagain of getting through to one major challenge we have here in this \nSenate, the Congress, and the executive branch, and that is dealing \nwith our debt. It is generational theft. It is putting the burden on \nour children and grandchildren, and even on workers here today. It is \nholding down our economy. It is one of the major challenges this \nCongress has not successfully addressed and which this administration \nhas not successfully addressed. It is kicking the can down the road to \nthe extreme, and we do not need to forget that. We need to emphasize \nit. This is my small step, after many large steps that have failed, to \ntry to continue to alert the American people and alert my colleagues \nthat there is money we can save and spend and run a much more \nefficient, effective government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past week while I was home in \nWyoming traveling around our State, I had a chance to talk with \nstudents about their hopes for the future, and I talked with many small \nbusiness owners about their efforts in trying to create jobs.\n  The people of Wyoming work hard and take seriously the Western values \nof family and community. They are committed--they are committed--to \npreserving the West's role in providing natural resources that improve \nthe lives of millions of people all across America.\n  This commitment is shared by the Senate Western Caucus--a caucus \nwhich I chair in the Senate--as well as is shared by the Congressional \nWestern Caucus under the leadership of Wyoming Congressman Cynthia \nLummis.\n  Recently, we released a joint report titled ``Principled Stewardship \nof the American West.'' This new report has details about specific \nthings we should be doing right here in Congress, specific things \nWashington should let the people in the West do for themselves. The \nwhole report is available on my Web site, Barrasso.senate.gov.\n\n  Now I want to talk about four specific principles that guide the work \nof the Western Caucus that are contained in this very report. These \nprinciples are based on the idea that the people who live on the land \nare the best stewards of the land. Our main goal is to empower the \nresidents, the workers, and the leaders in the West and local leaders \nthroughout the country to make the decisions that best serve their \nfamilies and their communities. These principles stand in stark \ncontrast to the failed approach Washington has taken for far too long.\n  The first principle in our report has to do with energy. The members \nof the Western Caucus are united. We will promote access to our \nNation's abundant, affordable, secure, diverse, and reliable energy and \nmineral resources. That means increasing energy security for the United \nStates. We can do that by producing more energy responsibly right here \nat home. It also means opening access to international markets so we \ncan help the energy security of our allies as well.\n  The second principle we talk about in the report ``Principled \nStewardship of the American West'' focuses on environmental stewardship \nin the West. We take very seriously our commitment to ensuring the \nhealth of the land, the wildlife, and the environment. Thousands of \npeople are working across the West to protect our communities. These \nare people who live in the West, not bureaucrats in Washington, DC. \nNobody is better qualified than the people who actually walk the land \nand breathe the air they are trying to protect.\n  Our report encourages locally led conservation partnerships to build \non the work being done by people who rely on the health and the safety \nof the land. This means making sure regulators base their decisions on \nscience, not on personal ideology, and that their work is done out in \nthe open. On this front I will be introducing legislation to stop the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's takeover of the waters of the United \nStates.\n  The third principle in this report focuses on agriculture and \nforestry. As an environmental stewardship, the Western Caucus believes \nthe States are better equipped than Washington to develop good farm \npolicies. Crops, breeds of livestock, soil types, and the growing \nseasons vary greatly across this country. These factors come together \nin the West very differently from what might be seen in the Northeast \nor in the South. A bureaucrat in Washington simply cannot write \nregulations that cover every part of the country with any hope of \nsuccess. Western States must be allowed to make these decisions for \nthemselves to help the farming and ranching way of life continue to \nthrive in America.\n  One task we can do at the national level is to promote active \nmanagement of our forests to ensure that our forests remain healthy. As \nmany as 82 million acres of our National Forest System need treatment \nto deal with the threats of fire, insects, and invasive species. When \nforests deteriorate, they are more vulnerable to wildfire. Fires cause \nerosion and threaten water quality. When forests get overgrown and \nunhealthy, they stifle habitats critical for deer, elk, wild turkeys, \nand other animals. The members of the Western Caucus know how important \nit is to responsibly manage our national forests, and we will push for \nlegislation to make sure that continues to happen.\n  Finally, the report focuses on a Western approach to judicial and \nregulatory reform. This includes stopping the lawsuit abuse that \nspecial interest groups have used to set public policy without the \npublic actually being involved. It includes protecting private property \nowners from excessive Washington regulations.\n\n[[Page S1088]]\n\n  Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. \nForest Service have a history of interfering with the use of private \nproperty. These agencies have fined and bullied landowners throughout \nthe West. Too often the goal of the bureaucrats is to protect their own \nturf, not to protect the land or to serve the people. Honest, hard-\nworking taxpayers get crushed beneath the resources of a Federal legal \nsystem that operates without oversight. The Western Caucus favors \nconservation through local cooperation and partnership, not through \nintimidation and an attitude that ``Washington knows best.''\n  This report's four principles and the ideas it discusses are based on \nwhat members in the Western Caucus hear back home. These are the topics \nI hear from people as I travel around Wyoming. These principles promote \nresponsible energy, food and timber production, while preserving what \nmakes the West a unique place in America.\n  Last year more than 10 million people from around the world visited \nWyoming. They are drawn by its beauty and natural splendor. The people \nof Wyoming and all Western States know they have a responsibility to \nmanage and protect the land and waters in a way that allows all of us \nto enjoy them. The goal of the Senate and Congressional Western Caucus \nis to preserve and protect everything that is special about the West so \nthat families who have lived there for generations can continue to live \nthere for generations in the future.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks the 25th anniversary of a law \nthat has affected millions of Americans. It was a law that came about \nbecause of a dare. It happened in an airport in Phoenix, AZ. I was \ncatching a flight from Phoenix to St. Louis--I think to Chicago--and I \nwas late. I ran up to the United Airlines counter, and the ticket agent \nstarted processing my ticket to get on the flight.\n  She said to me, ``Here is your boarding pass,'' and I looked at it \nand noticed she had put me in the smoking section on the airplane.\n  I said to her, ``I don't want to sit in the smoking section. Isn't \nthere something you can do about this?''\n  She said, ``You came here too late. And incidentally, Congressman, \nthere is something you can do about it.''\n  I got on that airplane and got stuck in the middle seat in the \nsmoking section in the back of the plane, surrounded by smokers, wedged \nin there, and I looked around the plane and thought: This makes no \nsense at all. There is an older person who may have a pulmonary \nproblem. There is a mother with a baby sitting in a nonsmoking section \ntwo rows away from me. And I thought to myself: I am going to do \nsomething to change this.\n  I went back to the House of Representatives. I was a relatively new \nMember of Congress. I introduced a bill to ban smoking on airplanes. My \nstaff thought it was crazy. Nobody had ever beaten the tobacco lobby at \nanything. To take them and most of the airline industry on was a fool's \nerrand, but I did it anyway. I got a lot of help along the way from \nsome amazing colleagues. I finally got a chance to bring it to the \nfloor for a vote, and to the shock and surprise of the tobacco lobby, \nwe won. We banned smoking on airplane flights of 2 hours or more.\n  I called my friend Frank Lautenberg, who was a Senator from New \nJersey, and I asked him if he would take up the cause in the U.S. \nSenate. He agreed to, and he passed the same measure.\n  So this day marks the 25th anniversary of the signing into law a ban \non smoking on airplanes. It is obvious why it passed. Members of \nCongress are part of the largest frequent flyer program in the world, \nand they hated it as much as I did on that flight from Phoenix to \nChicago. But it did something I never imagined. Malcolm Gladwell wrote \na book called ``The Tipping Point.'' It turns out that moment was a \ntipping point because people all across America 25 years ago started \nasking a very basic question: If secondhand smoke is dangerous in an \nairplane, isn't it dangerous in a train, on a bus, in an office, in \nhospitals, in restaurants, in a tavern, in a bingo hall--and the list \nwent on and on. All across the United States, States started changing \nlaws and banning smoking.\n  Today, if you walked into the doors of the Capitol here smoking a \ncigarette, somebody would stop you and say: Wait a minute, we don't do \nthat here. In the old days, nobody would think twice and there were \nashtrays all over.\n  When I first came to the Senate, there were no rules when it came to \nsmoking--none. We developed them after I made a few points to those in \ncharge. But that was the culture and the situation 25 years ago.\n  I think that effort to take smoking off airplanes has led to a lot of \nother dramatic efforts to protect Americans from secondhand smoke and \nfrom dangerous situations. I think lives have been saved. There are so \nmany of us who can tell family stories about losses related to lung \ncancer and pulmonary disease. I can tell my story.\n  I was 14 years old when my father died of lung cancer. He was 53 \nyears old and smoked two packs of Camels a day. He died an early death. \nI didn't stand by his bed at the hospital and say ``I will get even \nwith that tobacco lobby,'' but I remembered him as I started this ban.\n  So I just wanted to make a note in the Record today in the Senate to \nsalute the memory of my friend Frank Lautenberg, who was my partner in \npassing this important legislation, and to remind us there are other \nthings we can do to make this world a little better and a little safer. \nOne of those things relates to e-cigarettes, a new invention tobacco \ncompanies are jumping up and down to market to children in America. We \nhave seen in a short period of time the number of kids using these \nelectronic cigarettes double. It has a chemical in it, the same one \nthat is in cigarettes--nicotine--that is addictive. Tobacco companies \nknow that if they can lure children into cigarettes or e-cigarettes, \nthey are going to create an addiction in these young people that will \nbe tough to break and won't be healthy at all.\n  I hope the Food and Drug Administration will step up and do their job \nand regulate these products and these e-cigarette products to protect \nthe children across America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1088-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1088-S1090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this week we are deciding whether we are \ngoing to shut down the Government of the United States of America \nagain. Again. I think it was about a year and a half ago that the \nSenator from Texas on the other side of the aisle took to the floor and \ncalled for shutting down the Government of the United States of \nAmerica, protesting President Obama's Affordable Care Act. He did it, \nand the hardship that created for people all across the United States \nwho relied on essential government services is well documented. The \nimpact it had on the men and women who work in our government was also \ndocumented. It cost our economy. It was a bad thing to do. It was a \npolitical strategy which on reflection was the absolute worst, to shut \ndown our government.\n  Well, this week we face another shutdown, and this time it is the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. This Department is the one Department \nthat is charged with keeping America safe from the threat of terrorism. \nIt was created after 9/11 because we wanted to make sure we put \ntogether 22 agencies that worked together to protect us. You see them \nin so many different places. This agency runs the Coast Guard. Its \ncutters are patrolling Lake Michigan and our coastline--the Atlantic \nand Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico as well. You see them when you go to \nthe airport--TSA is under the supervision of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. You may not know it, but your local fire department is \ndepending on grants from this same agency so they can buy new equipment \nand train the people who are responding to fires in their community.\n  Over and over again the Department of Homeland Security invests in \nthe safety of America. So why in God's name would we have a political \nstrategy to stop funding the Department of Homeland Security? That is \nexactly\n\n[[Page S1089]]\n\nwhat we are faced with--exactly. Come the end of this week, this \nDepartment will basically lose its funding and be on emergency status. \nWhy would we do that at a time when we have been warned about terrorist \ngroups attacking malls across America? We are going to shut down the \nagency, stop funding the agency that protects us against terrorism in \nthe streets of America.\n  At a time when ISIS is kidnapping people from all over the world, \nbeheading them, burning them to death, killing them by execution, we \nare going to drop our guard and say: Well, we are not going to fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Why in the world would any politicians \nin either House of Congress think this is a wise tactical move?\n  It turns out this funding bill was sent to us by the House of \nRepresentatives on the condition that we take up the debate over \nimmigration policy in America. I think we need to debate that policy. I \nhave no objection to it. I feel very strongly about some aspects of it. \nBut why would we make the Department of Homeland Security play the role \nof hostage over this debate on immigration? The right thing to do to \nprotect America and the people who live here is to fund the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  I offered a unanimous consent on the floor 2 weeks ago asking the \nRepublicans to join the Democrats in funding this Department. Senator \nMcConnell, the majority leader, objected. I think that was a mistake. \nNow I think we understand, as we reach this deadline of shutting down \nthis valuable agency of our government, that we cannot let this happen.\n  What is it about this immigration debate that has driven some \npoliticians in Congress to the point where they are threatening to shut \ndown this Department, to cut off its funding? It turns out they object \nto some of the Executive orders issued by the President on immigration.\n  Remember, it was the Senate that passed a comprehensive immigration \nbill 2 years ago. I was part of the group that wrote it. We passed it \non the floor with 68 votes, and the Republican House of Representatives \nrefused to even call the bill, or any bill, on the subject. And when \nthey failed do anything to fix our broken immigration system, the \nPresident said: I am going to issue some Executive orders to deal with \nthis problem if Congress refuses to act, and he did.\n  The Republicans hated those Executive orders by President Obama like \nthe devil hates holy water. They hate them so much that they would shut \ndown the Department of Homeland Security in protest over the \nPresident's action. One of the things that troubles them the most is \nsomething called DACA. DACA is a shorthand description of the \nPresident's Executive order which allows those who would qualify under \nthe DREAM Act to stay in the United States and not be deported.\n  The DREAM Act is a bill I introduced 14 years ago. I introduced it \nbecause I learned there were children brought to America by their \nundocumented parents, who grew up in this country, went to school in \nthis country, were good citizens in America, but had no future because \nthey had no home. My DREAM Act said if you were one of those children \nbrought here by your parents, we are not going to hold you responsible \nfor your parents' decision. We will give you a chance to become legal \nin America. That is what the DREAM Act said. That is all it said. The \nPresident's Executive order said: We are not going to deport these \nyoung children now growing up in America. We are going to give them a \nchance to stay here, to study here, and to work here. Many of the \nRepublicans hate the idea of giving these young people a chance. Sadly, \nwhat they are doing is turning down an opportunity for America to \nbenefit from some of these extraordinary young people.\n  Time and again I have come to the floor of the Senate to tell the \nstories of these young DREAMers, and I will tell another one today.\n  This lovely young woman is Mithi Del Rosario. Her parents brought \nMithi to the United States from the Philippines when she was 5 years \nold. There was no question about whether she was going to come; she was \npart of the family.\n  She grew up in California. She was an excellent student and her \nlifetime goal was to be a medical doctor. In high school she was on the \nprincipal's honor roll and an AP scholar. She received a Golden State \nSeal Merit Diploma and a Governor's Scholar Award. She was quite the \nstudent.\n  Mithi was admitted to the University of California at Los Angeles, \none of the Nation's top universities. At UCLA she volunteered as a \nresearch assistant. She wanted to get into a lab that studied the high \nrisk of infants to develop autism.\n  Mithi also volunteered, while a student at UCLA, as a crisis \ncounselor for their peer helpline, advising students who were the \nvictim of rape, child abuse, and substance abuse. She eventually became \na trainer for new counselors. Mithi also volunteered as a mentor and \ntutor for at-risk middle school children in the city of Los Angeles.\n  She graduated from UCLA with a degree in psychology. Her options were \nlimited in terms of medical school because she is undocumented. She was \nunable to pursue her dream to become a doctor. Then in 2012, President \nObama issued an Executive order establishing the DACA Program, allowing \nstudents such as her a chance to stay in America and not be deported. \nHer whole world changed.\n  She began working as a research assistant at the UCLA School of \nMedicine, and she has applied to attend medical school. She still \nvolunteers at the autism research lab where she started her research \ncareer 7 years ago. Her ambition is to be part of the treatment and \nresearch effort to help children with autism. She also has served as \npeer mentor to 10 undergraduate students at UCLA.\n  She wrote me a letter and asked that I relay a message to the Members \nof Congress who are engaged in the debate on whether to shut down the \nDACA Program which gives her a chance to stay in the United States. \nThese are her words:\n\n       Please, please listen to our stories. This is my home, and \n     the only country I know. DACA gives us greater opportunities \n     to give back to the country we love.\n\n  This young lady, and millions like her, grew up in the classrooms of \nAmerica pledging allegiance to that flag. It is the only flag they have \never known. They can only sing one national anthem--the national anthem \nthat is closest to their heart for the United States of America. But \nnow there is an effort underway by some politicians in Congress to \ndeport her and send her back to the Philippines, and to say: Despite \nall you have done with your young life, despite all the talents which \nyou bring to Los Angeles and to California, despite your promise to \nenter into the medical profession and to serve in a cause that all of \nus realize is so important, autism research--despite all of that, leave \nAmerica. That is the message that comes through in this bill sent to us \nby the House Republicans.\n  They want to deport Mithi Del Rosario. They want to send her out of \nthis country and toss her away despite all of the investment we made, \nand she has made, in her life. Mithi, and other DREAMers like her, have \nso much to contribute.\n  The Republican bill that is before us would deport hundreds of \nthousands of young people just like her, and it would stop the \nPresident's effort to give the parents of citizens--American citizen \nchildren--a chance to work temporarily and legally in the United \nStates.\n  It is hard to imagine that so many on the other side of the aisle \nhave lost sight of who we are as a nation. We are a nation of \nimmigrants, and that immigrant spirit has made us different in this \nworld we live in.\n  The people who risked everything to come to the United States, to a \ncountry where they may not have even spoken the language and gave up \neverything and came here--they are a special brand of risk takers, and \nwe have a little bit of their DNA in our blood.\n  My mother was an immigrant. She was brought here at the age of 2, and \nher son now serves in the U.S. Senate. As I have said so many times on \nthe floor, that is my story, it is my family's story, and it is \nAmerica's story.\n  I cannot believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nforgotten America's history and America's story and are willing to turn \ntheir backs on a young woman such as this and say:\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\nWe don't need you. You can leave. In fact, we are going to make you \nleave. We are going to force you out of this country.\n  America won't be a stronger country if we deport Mithi and others \nlike her. We are not going to be a better country if we tear apart \nAmerican families. We are not going to be safer when we should be \ndeporting criminals, not those who aspire to be medical researchers.\n  Instead of trying to deport DREAMers and mothers and fathers, \ncongressional Republicans should support a clean appropriations bill. \nLet's do that. Let's pass a bill to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Let's get that done so once again we don't have a Republican \nshutdown of any branch of our Federal Government. Let's get that part \ndone. And then if we are going to engage in a real debate on \nimmigration, let's do it. The majority is controlled by the Republicans \nin the House and the Senate and they can do that any time they want. \nLet's engage in that debate and let's do it in an honest fashion. Let's \ndo it in a hopeful and positive view of what America's future will be \nwhen young people such as Mithi Del Rosario have their chance to become \npart of an America that embraces talent and skill and thanks young \npeople for the sacrifice they made to make a better life for all of us \nwho live in this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      The Middle East and Ukraine\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, a lot of us are deeply concerned about the \nsituation in the Middle East, in Ukraine, in China, to which we have \npaid very little attention to as they expand their territory.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a huge credibility gap. The \nWashington Post probably said it better than I probably could, and it \nis entitled ``A credibility gap,'' in the Washington Post, by Fred \nHiatt, editorial page editor, February 22. He says: ``If his \nnegotiators strike an agreement next month, we already know that it \nwill be far from ideal,'' talking about the Iranian nuclear deal.\n  He continues:\n\n       The partisanship needs no explanation, but the record of \n     foreign-policy assurances is worth recalling:\n\n  This is very interesting and I think deserves the attention of all \nAmericans.\n\n       In 2011, when he decided to pull all U.S. troops out of \n     Iraq, Obama belittled worries that instability might result. \n     Iraq and the United States would maintain ``a strong and \n     enduring partnership,'' Obama said. Iraq would be ``stable, \n     secure and self-reliant,'' and Iraqis would build a future \n     ``worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization.''\n       Today [as we know] Iraq is in deep trouble, with a \n     murderous ``caliphate'' occupying much of its territory and \n     predatory Shiite militia roaming through much of the rest.\n       The same year, Obama touted his bombing campaign in Libya \n     as a model of U.S. intervention and promised, ``That's not to \n     say that our work is complete. In addition to our NATO \n     responsibilities, we will work with the international \n     community to provide assistance to the people of Libya.''\n\n  My friends, we all know what has happened in Libya and the reason \nis--despite what Senator Graham and our then-former colleague Senator \nLieberman said--we had to do some things in Libya to make sure there \nwas stability in Libya. Obama then walked away.\n  Continuing from the article:\n\n       Obama also said then, ``Some nations may be able to turn a \n     blind eye to atrocities in other countries. The United States \n     of America is different. And as president, I refused to wait \n     for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking \n     action.'' That was before Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's \n     barrel bombs, systematic and well-documented prison torture \n     and other depredations of civil war killed 200,000 of his \n     compatriots, and drove millions more from their homes.\n       In August 2011, Obama declared that Assad must ``step \n     aside.'' In a background briefing a senior White House \n     official added, ``We are certain Assad is on the way out.'' \n     In August 2013 came Obama's statement that ``the worst \n     chemical attack of the 21st century . . . must be confronted \n     . . . I have decided that the United States should take \n     military action against Syrian regime [military] targets.''\n\n  As a personal aside, the Senator from South Carolina came over to the \nWhite House, and the President of the United States assured us that he \nwas going to take military action and we were going to degrade Bashar \nal-Assad and upgrade the Syrian Army, and, obviously, the article \nstates that ``no military action was taken, and Assad remains in \npower.''\n  Defeating the Islamic State is one we have successfully pursued in \nYemen and Somalia for years--successful in Yemen and Somalia that we \nhave pursued for years. Just last month in the State of the Union \nAddress, President Obama presented his Ukraine policy as a triumph of \n``. . . American strength and diplomacy. We are upholding the principle \nthat bigger nations can't bully the small by opposing Russian \naggression supporting Ukraine's democracy,'' he said.\n  We all know. We have watched Ukrainians slaughtered, slaughtered with \nthe most modern equipment that Vladimir Putin has. That great national \nbloodletting is going on, and we are watching, thanks to the assistance \nof the Chancellor of Germany and the President of France--in the finest \ntraditions of Neville Chamberlain--we are standing by and watching that \ncountry be dismembered.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina and I are trying to say is what \nGeneral Keane said the other day:\n\n     . . . al Qaeda and its affiliates exceeds Iran and is \n     beginning to dominate multiple countries. In fact, al-Qaeda \n     has grown fourfold in the last five years.\n\n\n[[Page S1091]]\n\n\n  Radical Islam is clearly on the rise, and I think our policy of \ndisengaging from the Middle East has contributed to that rise.\n  So there is no policy in Iraq, there is no policy in Syria, there is \nno combating or assisting even the Ukrainians as they attempt to defend \nthemselves against the wholesale slaughter of their countrymen by \nVladimir Putin.\n  My friends, we have had ample testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee, people who served this country with distinction for many \nyears--Republican and Democratic administrations. All of them have said \nthey have never seen the world in more turmoil, and these things don't \nhappen by accident. It is not like hurricanes or earthquakes, it is a \nmatter of a failed, feckless foreign policy that began in 2009 and the \nchickens are coming home to roost.\n  May I mention--my friend from South Carolina--this is where we are \nwith the Islamic State. We are hearing from the administration, I \nbelieve, that we are gaining. Look at the Islamic State, January 10, of \nSyria in red--this is the Islamic State and contested places--and look \nat August 31. Obviously, there are significant gains. One more chart, \nplease.\n  Looking at this chart, these are the areas of all of that part of the \nworld that are now controlled or under attack by ISIS, including, by \nthe way, we now see ISIS gaining a foothold in Libya.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  What I would like the body to recognize is that our Presiding \nOfficer, who just left, Senator Cotton, was an infantry officer in \nIraq, and I can't imagine how he must feel. Our current Presiding \nOfficer is a reservist in the Marine Corps who has served in harm's way \nin battlefield areas, and he was a commander in the Marine Corps. It is \ngreat to have people in the Senate who have worn the uniform and they \nunderstand what is at stake here.\n  Senator McCain and I have tried to be consistent, if nothing else, \nabout this situation. Here is the first question America has to answer: \nIs this someone else's war? I have heard very prominent commentators on \ncable television say: I am tired of fighting other people's wars.\n  Does ISIL represent a threat to our homeland? I think it does. And \nmore importantly, they indicate they mean to hit us here. The head of \nISIL, the Islamic State and the Levant is what I want to call it, \nserved time in a military prison in Camp Bucca in Iraq, where I did \nsome reserve duty, and when he was released from the camp and turned \nover to the Iraqis he told the colonel in charge of his release: I will \nsee you in New York.\n  They are recruiting foreign fighters coming in by the thousands. They \nhold passports that would allow them to go to Europe and come back to \nour country, and their goal is not only to purify their religion, to \nkill or convert every Christian they find, but also to attack us.\n  So to those who say this is not our fight, I think you are making a \nhuge mistake, as we did before 9/11.\n  Regional forces have to be part of the mix. The goal to degrade and \ndestroy ISIL is the right goal. The strategy will fail as currently \nbeing considered unless we visit this issue.\n  As Senator McCain said, what you see on this map is not an accident. \nIt is a predictable outcome of three things. The President's decision \nin 2011 not to leave a residual force behind in Iraq to secure our \ngains has come back to haunt us. The military command infrastructure of \nthis country advised a minimum of 10,000 troops to be left behind as a \nresidual force.\n  I visited Baghdad, along with Senators McCain and Lieberman, to try \nto persuade the Iraqi political leadership to enter into an agreement \nto allow us to have a residual force. Prime Minister Maliki said: I am \nwilling to do it if the other groups in Iraq are willing to do it. They \nwere all willing to do it. He asked me: How many troops are you talking \nabout? I turned to our ambassador and our commander at the time, and \nthey tell him and me: We are still working on that.\n  Press reports simultaneously were suggesting the White House, led by \nthe Vice President, by the way, was driving the residual force to below \n3,000--a number incapable of making a difference.\n  So when the President of the United States says he was willing to \nleave a residual force behind, that is not accurate. In a debate with \nGovernor Romney, Governor Romney suggested he would support a residual \nforce of 10,000, as President Obama was contemplating, and President \nObama interrupted him and said: No, I am not contemplating that.\n  He held our departure in Iraq as the fulfillment of a campaign \npromise. He said: We can leave with our heads held high. We have \naccomplished our task.\n  Here is what I said on April 3, 2011:\n\n       If we're not smart enough to work with the Iraqis to have \n     10,000 to 15,000 American troops in Iraq in 2012, Iraq could \n     go to hell. I'm urging the Obama administration to work with \n     the Maliki administration in Iraq to make sure we have enough \n     troops--10,000 to 15,000--beginning in 2012 to secure the \n     gains we have achieved. This is a defining moment in the \n     future of Iraq, and in my view they are going down the wrong \n     road in Iraq.\n\n  I am referring there to the Obama administration when I say ``they \nare going down the wrong road.''\n  No voice was louder than that of Senator McCain. Senator McCain \nadvocated, above all others, the surge when Iraq was slipping away \nunder the Bush administration. When Senator McCain told President Bush \nhis strategy was not working, President Bush, to his great credit, \nadjusted his strategy.\n  Senator McCain, 3 years ago, was the leading voice in this country to \nargue for a no-fly zone in Syria so that Assad, who was on the ropes, \ncould be taken down, and to train a Free Syrian Army at a time when it \nreally would have mattered. The President ignored the advice not only \nof Senator McCain and myself but his entire national security team.\n  So the President got the answer he wanted in Iraq. He pulled the plug \non troops. And what we hoped wouldn't happen did happen. When he said \nno to a no-fly zone and the training of a Free Syrian Army, the vacuum \nthat had been created in Syria was filled by ISIL. ISIL is a direct \nresult of Al Qaeda in Iraq, which was on its knees in 2010, being able \nto come back because we withdrew troops and we allowed a safe haven to \nbe formed in Syria.\n  So, President Obama, this map is the result of bad policy choices on \nyour part, and you are doubling down on bad policy choices.\n  The third thing that was a huge mistake is drawing a redline when \nAssad used chemical weapons against his own people and virtually doing \nnothing about it. I am glad the chemical weapons have been taken out of \nSyria--at least we think all of them have been taken out--but 220,000 \nSyrians have been killed with initial forces by Assad, and Assad is \nstronger than ever. He is nowhere near going or leaving.\n  Between Assad and ISIL, they represent the dominant military force \ninside Syria. Syria is truly hell on Earth, and all of this is going to \ncome back to haunt us here at home.\n  So the reason we are here on the floor today is to learn from the \npast. I have made mistakes. Everybody has made mistakes. But the key is \nto adjust when you make mistakes. The strategy President Obama is \nemploying to degrade and destroy ISIL will fail, and let me tell you \nwhy.\n  If you could liberate Mosul with the Iraqi security forces and the \nKurds, we are going to need more than 3,000 U.S. forces to accomplish \nthat task, because they do not have the capability that our military \npossesses to ensure victory.\n  Once you liberate Mosul, you have to hold and build Mosul. Anbar \nProvince has yet to be liberated. We have to convince the Sunni tribal \nleaders in Anbar to disassociate with ISIL and join us, and they are \nnot going to do that unless we are part of a team on the ground. They \ndon't trust the Iraqi security forces that are mainly Shia. So unless \nwe get more capacity on the ground to ensure success, we will fail in \nIraq. But Syria is the weak link in the chain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Before my colleague leaves Iraq, is it not true that the \nonly real fighting being done now is the Peshmerga Kurds but also the \nShia militia, who are inflicting human rights violations on the Sunni, \nand the same people we fought against during the surge that my \ncolleague talked about before, which is Iranian backed and Iranian \ntrained?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Right. The Iraqi security forces have crumbled. The most\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\ndominant power on the ground is the Shia militia, backed by Iran and \nthe Kurds in the north. And by the way, the aid we are providing to the \nKurds never gets up to Erbil, and we need to fix that.\n  Iran has inordinate influence in Baghdad. So to get the Sunni tribes \nto pull off of ISIL, they have to believe that Baghdad is going to be a \nbetter venue for them in terms of their political grievances, but they \nalso need to see Americans on the ground to make sure this thing will \nwork. They are not going to pull off ISIL unless we are there. They do \nnot trust the Iraqi security forces.\n  As to Syria, Syria is the biggest problem of all. That is where most \nof ISIL resides. That is where their leadership resides. That is where \nthey have the largest number of fighters. There is no ground game in \nSyria. There is no Kurdish presence that has the capability to dislodge \nISIL. The Free Syrian Army are being killed as fast as we can train \nthem.\n  Here is the flaw. The goal is to train the Free Syrian Army's young \nmen throughout the region and send them into Syria to destroy ISIL. The \nproblem with that is the moment we send them into Syria to defeat ISIL, \nAssad will attack them because he knows one day they will turn on him.\n  So we have asked the question, under the authorization to use \nmilitary force that is being sent over from the White House, could we \nstop an air attack by Assad's forces so they will not kill the people \nwe train to fight ISIL, and they said no.\n  So we are training people to go into Syria to fight ISIL who will be \nslaughtered by Assad if we do not have the ability under this \nauthorization to protect the people we train. Senator McCain said this \nover and over again. That is immoral and militarily unsound. There is \nno strategy indeed to deal with Syria that has any chance of success. \nAnd if we don't get Syria right, we can't hold the gains we make in \nIraq.\n  So the President, after all these years, with 220,000 people being \nkilled, having the largest terrorist army in the history of terrorism \noccupying a space the size of Indiana, with 30,000 to 50,000 fighters, \ndepending on who you believe, still hasn't come to grips with a \nstrategy that will protect this nation. He doesn't understand the \nmistakes he has been making for the last 3 or 4 years. He is not self-\ncorrecting. He is perpetuating what I think is a military fraud.\n  The longer it takes to destroy ISIL, the more exposed we are here. \nAnd at the end of the day, the Iranians are sizing us up and they see \nus as a paper tiger.\n  The last thing I would say about Ukraine is that Russia has invaded \nUkraine. When they say they have no weapons inside Ukraine, when they \nsay they have no troops, they are liars.\n  Russia has dismembered their neighbor, Ukraine. We in the Western \nworld have sat on the sidelines and watched this happen. They have \ntrampled all over the Budapest memorandum, where we persuaded \nUkrainians to give up their nuclear weapons in the late 1990s and we \nwould guarantee their sovereignty. When they need us to provide \ndefensive weapons, we are absolutely absent at their time of dire need. \nThe Iranians are watching our response to Putin. How could they feel we \nare serious about stopping their nuclear program when we seem not to be \nserious about anything else?\n  The reason we will not be more aggressive in Syria is because \nPresident Obama doesn't want to deal with Assad, who is a puppet of \nIran. He doesn't want to jeopardize the negotiations we have ongoing \nwith the Iranians regarding their nuclear ambitions. His desire to get \na deal with Iran is preventing us from degrading and destroying ISIL, \nand we will pay a heavy price for these mistakes.\n  How would my colleague sum up where we are?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I just mention to my colleague--and it has been \nmade perhaps larger than it should have been, with all of the crises \nand the tragedies that are transpiring, but the President of the United \nStates refuses to refer to this as radical Islam. Why that is is hard \nto understand because it is clearly radical Islam. It is a perversion \nof an honorable religion, but everything they are doing is based on \ntheir perverted interpretation of the Koran. They are Islamic. While we \nrespect the religion and we respect the people, we don't respect \nradical Islam and we have to recognize it for what it is.\n  Let me read this, from February 24:\n\n       Scores of Syrian Christians Kidnapped by Islamic State--\n     Islamic State militants swept into several of Assyrian \n     Christian villages in northeastern Syria in recent days, \n     taking scores of hostages, including both civilians and \n     fighters, according to numerous interviews with residents. . \n     . . The attacks have displaced hundreds of families and \n     sharpened Middle Eastern Christians' fears of the Islamic \n     State.\n\n  Which the President of the United States refuses to recognize as \nradical Islam. When you don't even recognize it or identify it for what \nit is, how in the world are you going to be able to combat it?\n  Finally, I would say to my friend one more time, if he would respond, \nthat the Ukrainians wanted to defend themselves. One of the richest and \nproudest aspects of American history is that we have helped people who \nare struggling for freedom, whether it be in Afghanistan after Russia's \ninvasion or others. And others have helped us, going all the way back \nto our Revolution when the French and Polish and others came in and \nhelped us. How can we rationalize our failure to give them weapons to \ndefend themselves by saying: Well, they can't beat the Russians anyway.\n  Why don't we listen to their pleas for help? Why don't we listen to \ntheir cries? Why don't we listen to the fact they have lost 5,000; that \nright now the most sophisticated weaponry the Russians provided these \n``separatists'' is being used to slaughter them?\n  To me it is the most unbelievable view, that somehow we don't want to \nprovoke Vladimir Putin, who has taken Crimea--they have written that \noff--shot down an airplane, at least with Russian equipment; moved and \ndislocated eastern Ukraine; and has caused an economic crisis. And we \ndon't want to provoke Vladimir Putin? It is staggering.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. In conclusion, in 1998 we were a signatory to Budapest \nmemorandum that asked the Ukrainian people to give up over 2,000 \nnuclear weapons housed on their soil in return for a guarantee of their \nsovereignty.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That included the State of Crimea as part of the \nterritorial integrity of Ukraine.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Exactly. The Russians were a signatory to that Budapest \nmemorandum.\n  Clearly, the Russians have stepped all over it, and we are not doing \nanything. So in the future, would you give up your nuclear weapons \nrelying on a promise by the United States?\n  This is important because we want to deter Iran from trying to get a \nnuclear weapon. I think this emboldens them to get a nuclear weapon.\n  As to radical Islam, it is hard to defeat an enemy if you don't \nunderstand what motivates them.\n  The Nazis did not want just the German-speaking regions surrounding \nGermany. It wasn't about the Sudetenland. It wasn't about the \nRheinland. It wasn't about the issues Hitler claimed at the time. He \nwrote a book telling us what he wanted to do. People should have read \nthe book. It was about creating a master race to govern other races. \nThe Aryan race would be the dominant race on the planet--with some \npeople not worthy of living, such as the Jews, and others would be \nslaves.\n  When we listen to what ISIL is saying and what motivates them, they \nwant a master religion for the world, not a master race. If you are a \nChristian, you can pay a tax and convert or die. If you are a Muslim \noutside of their view of the faith, you just die. If you are an \nagnostic, you die. If you are a libertarian, you die. If you are an \nAmerican--Republican or Democrat; they could care less--you die.\n  They are taught by their interpretation of the Koran literally to \nkill all that stands in their way of the caliphate. We can close Gitmo \ntomorrow. We could throw the Palestinians under the bus or give the \nPalestinians everything they want and throw Israel under the bus. It \nwouldn't matter.\n  We didn't bring this war on ourselves. These people are motivated by \nreligious doctrine not widely accepted in the faith. But that doctrine \nrequires them to kill everything in their path and to turn the world \ninto a religion where they dominate, and there is no alternative to \ntheir religion.\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\n  That may sound crazy to you. It sounds a little crazy to me. Hitler \nis crazy to me. I can't explain why somebody wants to kill all the \nJews. I can't explain why somebody believes that one race should rule \nthe world and everybody else be under their boot. I can't explain what \nmakes these people tick. I can only tell you what they do and why they \ndo it. There is no appeasement with radical Islam, any more than there \nwould be an appeasement with Hitler. We tried that in the 1930s, and 50 \nmillion people got killed.\n  So here is our choice: Face the enemy as it is, degrade and destroy \nin a way that will work; or accept the fact that they are coming here, \nnot to conquer America--that is not going to happen--but to hit us hard \nand break our will so they can have that part of the world for which \nthey have been longing for over 1,000 years.\n  Here is what I would say to America. Every time we have chosen to sit \non the sidelines and watch other people suffer and did nothing about \nit, it wound up hurting us too. If you think we can live in a world \nwhere Christians over there are being raped, tortured, and crucified, \nand it won't affect Christians here, you are kidding yourself. If you \nthink you can allow a force this evil to go unchecked because it is \nover there and it won't affect us here, you are making the mistake of a \nlifetime.\n  My biggest fear is that radical Islam--which is exactly what it is--\nwill get a weapon of mass destruction one day and do a lot of harm to \nus here. Every day that goes by over there, that they get stronger, the \nmore exposed we are here.\n  Finally, on 9/11, 3,000 Americans died only because they didn't have \nthe ability to kill more. If they could have killed 3 million of us, \nthey would have. Every day we let this problem grow unchecked they are \ncloser to having the technology to kill millions of people here and \nelsewhere. So the sooner we deal with this, the safer we will be.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article \ntitled ``Credibility Gap'' from the Washington Post and also the \nInternational New York Times article ``Scores of Syrian Christians \nKidnapped by Islamic State'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the International New York Times, Feb. 24, 2015]\n\n         Scores of Syrian Christians Kidnapped by Islamic State\n\n                           (By Anne Barnard)\n\n       Istanbul.--Islamic State militants swept into several \n     Assyrian Christian villages in northeastern Syria in recent \n     days, taking scores of hostages, including both civilians and \n     fighters, according to numerous interviews with residents and \n     representatives of the many factions fighting in the area.\n       The attacks have displaced hundreds of families and \n     sharpened Middle Eastern Christians' fears of the Islamic \n     State, which considers non-Muslims, along with many Muslims \n     who disagree with its tenets, infidels.\n       The extremist group displaced entire Christian communities \n     from northern Iraq when it swept through Mosul and the \n     surrounding area last year.\n       The new attacks came as some Christians in northeastern \n     Syria, seeking to avoid the fate of northern Iraq's \n     Christians and other minority sects like the Yazidis that \n     were singled out by the Islamic State, had taken a more \n     assertive role, fighting alongside Kurdish and other \n     militias.\n       The latest fighting took place in a string of villages \n     along the Khabur River, a tributary of the Euphrates. The \n     central village, Tel Tamer, is a strategic crossroads, with a \n     bridge over the river that connects northeastern Syria with \n     the country's northern hub, Aleppo; residents reported that \n     Islamic State militants bombed the bridge on Tuesday.\n       The area has long been controlled by Kurdish militias but \n     has lately come under attack from the Islamic State, also \n     known as ISIS or ISIL.\n       In recent weeks, villages have changed hands several times \n     as the Kurdish groups, some Arab Muslim factions and a \n     Christian group called the Syriac Military Council have \n     joined forces against the Islamic State.\n       In the chaos Tuesday, the exact number of hostages seized \n     remained unclear, with estimates ranging from several dozen \n     to more than 100. Nuri Kino, an Assyrian-Swedish activist \n     with family ties to northeastern Syria, said that Islamic \n     State fighters were holding about 60 women and children in \n     the village of Tel Shamiran, and that they had taken 90 men \n     up into a mountainous area they control, perhaps seeking to \n     exchange them for Islamic State prisoners.\n       Mr. Kino, who founded A Demand for Action, a group that \n     advocates for religious minorities in Iraq and Syria, said he \n     had gleaned the information by talking to residents over \n     Skype from Los Angeles.\n       Dawoud Dawoud, the deputy president of the Assyrian \n     Democratic Party in the area, reached in Hasaka, said that \n     the villages had long been largely left alone, but that in \n     early February, Islamic State fighters had demanded that \n     crosses be removed from churches.\n       The jihadists raided the village of Tel Hermez, driving \n     away a local group, the Guardians of Khabur, that had \n     protected churches there, said Omar Abd al-Aziz, a local \n     antigovernment activist who uses a nom de guerre for his \n     safety. Called to help, Kurdish militias entered the town \n     with fighters from the Syriac Military Council, who filmed \n     themselves retaking the area and leading away bound men they \n     said were Islamic State members.\n       Now, the Islamic State appears to be retaliating with even \n     greater numbers and heavy weapons.\n       ``It's the new Kobani,'' said Mr. Kino, referring to the \n     Kurdish enclave bordering Turkey whose encirclement by the \n     Islamic State prompted American-led airstrikes that helped \n     drive the group back. He called for United States \n     intervention to prevent massacres and displacements.\n       The threats to minority enclaves, as in Kobani and the \n     attacks on Yazidis in Iraq's Sinjar mountains last summer, \n     have galvanized international action when other fighting did \n     not.\n       Another activist in the area, who gave only his first name, \n     Siraj, because of concern for his safety, accused the Kurds \n     of leaving the Assyrians vulnerable in order to provoke a \n     Kobani-like international reaction.\n       But Nawaf al-Khalil, a spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic \n     Union, a political party, tried to find a bright side, saying \n     the events were ``a good sign of stronger ties between the \n     Kurds, the Arabs and the Christians'' against the Islamic \n     State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 2015]\n\n                           A Credibility Gap\n\n                            (By Fred Hiatt)\n\n       If his negotiators strike an agreement next month, we \n     already know that it will be far from ideal: Rather than \n     eradicating Iran's nuclear-weapons potential, as once was \n     hoped, a pact would seek to control Iran's activities for \n     some limited number of years.\n       Such a deal might be defensible on the grounds that it is \n     better than any alternative, given that most experts believe \n     a military ``solution'' would be at best temporary and \n     possibly counterproductive.\n       But making that kind of lesser-evil defense would be \n     challenging in any circumstances. Three conditions will make \n     it particularly hard for Obama to persuade Congress and the \n     nation to accept his assurances in this case: the suspicious, \n     poisonous partisanship of the moment here, with Israeli \n     politics mixed in; worries that he wants a deal too much; and \n     the record of his past assurances.\n       The partisanship needs no explanation, but the record of \n     foreign-policy assurances is worth recalling:\n       In 2011, when he decided to pull all U.S. troops out of \n     Iraq, Obama belittled worries that instability might result. \n     Iraq and the United States would maintain ``a strong and \n     enduring partnership,'' Obama said. Iraq would be ``stable, \n     secure and self-reliant,'' and Iraqis would build a future \n     ``worthy of their history as a cradle of civilization.''\n       Today Iraq is in deep trouble, with a murderous \n     ``caliphate'' occupying much of its territory and predatory \n     Shiite militia roaming through much of the rest.\n       That same year, Obama touted his bombing campaign in Libya \n     as a model of U.S. intervention and promised, ``That's not to \n     say that our work is complete. In addition to our NATO \n     responsibilities, we will work with the international \n     community to provide assistance to the people of Libya.''\n       The United States and its NATO allies promptly abandoned \n     Libya, which today is in the grip of civil war, with rival \n     governments in the east and west and Islamist terrorists in \n     between.\n       Obama also said then, ``Some nations may be able to turn a \n     blind eye to atrocities in other countries. The United States \n     of America is different. And as president, I refused to wait \n     for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking \n     action.''\n       That was before Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's barrel \n     bombs, systematic and well-documented prison torture and \n     other depredations of civil war killed 200,000 of his \n     compatriots, and drove millions more from their homes.\n       In August 2011, Obama declared that Assad must ``step \n     aside.'' In a background briefing a senior White House \n     official added, ``We are certain Assad is on the way out.'' \n     In August 2013 came Obama's statement that ``the worst \n     chemical attack of the 21st century . . . must be confronted. \n     . . . I have decided that the United States should take \n     military action against Syrian regime targets.''\n       No military action was taken, and Assad remains in power.\n       In September, the president said his strategy for defeating \n     the Islamic State ``is one that we have successfully pursued \n     in Yemen and Somalia for years.'' Shortly thereafter, an \n     Iran-backed rebellion deposed Yemen's pro-U.S. government, \n     forcing the United States to abandon its embassy and much of \n     its anti-terror operation.\n       Just last month, in the State of the Union address, Obama \n     presented his Ukraine policy\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\n     as a triumph of ``American strength and diplomacy.\n       ``We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't \n     bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting \n     Ukraine's democracy,'' he said.\n       Since then Russian forces have extended their incursion \n     into Ukraine, now controlling nearly one-fifth of its \n     territory. Russia's economy is hurting, but Ukraine's is in \n     far worse shape.\n       This litany of unfulfilled assurances is less a case of \n     Nixonian deception than a product of wishful thinking and \n     stubborn adherence to policies after they have failed. But \n     inevitably it will affect how people hear Obama's promises on \n     Iran, as will his overall foreign policy record.\n       That record includes successes, such as the killing of \n     Osama bin Laden, warming ties with India and a potentially \n     groundbreaking agreement with China on climate change. By \n     most measures, though, the world has not become safer during \n     Obama's tenure. Islamist extremists are stronger than ever; \n     democracy is in retreat around the globe; relations with \n     Russia and North Korea have worsened; allies are questioning \n     U.S. steadfastness.\n       Openings as well as problems can appear unexpectedly in \n     foreign affairs, but the coming two years offer only two \n     obvious opportunities for Obama to burnish this legacy: trade \n     deals with Europe and with Pacific nations, and a nuclear \n     agreement with Iran. That limited field fuels worries that \n     administration negotiators will accept the kind of deal that \n     results from wanting it too badly.\n       Whatever its contours, Obama would be making a big mistake \n     to try to implement such a momentous pact, as administration \n     officials have suggested he might, without congressional buy-\n     in. But it's not surprising that he would be tempted to try.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the patience of my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Texas.\n  It is with a heavy heart that we see the events transpiring according \nto this chart.\n  It is with a heavy heart that we see our friends in Ukraine, who only \nwant to be like us, being slaughtered, and we are refusing to assist \nthem. I have assured them that I will never give up--ever--until we see \na free, prosperous, democratic Ukraine which is part of the community \nof nations, which we would admire, and in which we include them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, when given the opportunity four times over \nthe last few weeks to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security, \nwhile at the same time rolling back the President's unconstitutional \nExecutive action on immigration, four times our Senate Democratic \nfriends have filibustered this funding. At the same time, they have \nbeen pointing to this side of the aisle and saying: If there is a \nshutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, you are at fault. It \nis hypocrisy, to say the least.\n  But of all the Democrats who voted to filibuster the funding of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--which, again, expires at midnight on \nthis Friday night--there are 11 of our Senate Democratic colleagues who \ncome from States which are parties to a lawsuit in Brownsville, TX, \nwhere the Federal judge issued a temporary injunction just last week \nsaying that what the President did in his Executive action was \nillegal--illegal.\n  So how our colleagues on the other side of the aisle can filibuster \nthe Department of Homeland Security funding because they say it \nincludes a disapproval of the President's action at the same time the \nStates they represent are parties to a lawsuit complaining about the \nillegality of the President's actions--how they can reconcile that is \nbeyond me. Perhaps they can come to the floor and talk about that. But \nI think they should be asked that question, and I would be very \ninterested in their answer.\n  Of course, as we all know, now the Obama administration--after the \nFederal judge agreed with what the President said 22 different times, \nthat he didn't have the authority to do what he did--and, obviously, he \nchanged his mind. But after the Federal judge agreed with what he said \nthe first 22 times, that he didn't have the authority, now they have \nasked for a stay of that temporary injunction.\n  If the reports in the press are correct, Judge Hanen in Brownsville, \nin the Southern District of Texas, has given the States, the plaintiffs \nin the lawsuit, until March 2 to respond to this request for emergency \nstay.\n  One by one, the folks who criticized what the President was doing in \none fashion or another came to the floor and have voted in effect to \naffirm what he did. As I said yesterday, in justifying these votes we \nheard a common refrain from several of our Democratic colleagues, \nincluding some of those 11 whose States have joined the lawsuit against \nthe President's Executive action. They have said to us: We don't \nnecessarily agree with the President's action, but you shouldn't attach \nthat to an appropriations bill to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Similarly, from Senate Democratic leadership came the demands for a \n``clean bill''--a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity--without these provisions addressing the Executive action \nattached.\n  Just 2 days ago here on the floor, the Democratic leader himself \ncalled for the Senate to vote on such a bill. A press release issued \nfrom Senator Reid's office was unequivocal: ``Reid Remarks Calling On \nSenate GOP To Avoid A Shutdown By Passing A Clean DHS Funding Bill.''\n  Monday wasn't the first time we heard this from Democratic \nleadership. We heard it over and over and over, as the Democrats, in \nlockstep, filibustered the Department of Homeland Security funding \nbill.\n  So imagine my surprise when Senator McConnell, the Senate majority \nleader, offered to consider two bills, one that would address the \nPresident's Executive action from last November--the Collins bill--and \na separate one that would fully fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  You would, I guess, if logic prevailed in this place, expect that the \nDemocratic leader would embrace that wholeheartedly, instantaneously, \nsaying: That is exactly what we have been demanding, and now we have \nbeen offered it. We will take it.\n  Well, that didn't happen. This place can be very confusing sometimes, \nand you would be wrong if you thought the Democratic leader embraced \nwhat he had been demanding for the last few weeks. So after spending \nweeks demanding a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, including as recently as Monday, 24 hours have passed and the \nDemocratic leader has still refused to agree to hold a vote on a so-\ncalled clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill.\n  Let me just repeat that so I am absolutely clear. The Democratic \nleader has so far refused to agree to vote on a clean funding bill for \nthe Department, even after he called on Senate Republicans to pass \nexactly that as recently as Monday.\n  So I don't know how to sugar coat it. Call it a flip-flop, call it \ndisingenuous. I don't know what to call it. But when you are offered \nexactly what you have been demanding and you don't accept it, it tells \nme you are not particularly serious about wanting to solve the problem. \nIt is this kind of doubletalk which I think causes the Senate to be \nheld in low regard by the American people, where they think that what \nyou say doesn't necessarily translate into action. It is becoming \nabundantly clear that our friends across the aisle do not seem to have \ngotten the message from the last election on November 4.\n  I mentioned this yesterday, and I will repeat it, with reference to \nsome of the gamesmanship that appears to be going on here, at the time \nwhen the clock is ticking and the Department of Homeland Security \nfunding runs out at midnight on Friday. Recently, the senior Senator \nfrom New York told the Huffington Post that ``it's really fun to be in \nthe Senate Minority,'' as if creating obstacles, slowing things down, \nand impeding progress toward a goal that we all hold in common--funding \nthe Department of Homeland Security--is somehow having fun. But \nfilibustering critical funding for the men and women that protect us \nevery day and protect the homeland is not what I call fun.\n  At the end of the day, the Senate will make sure that those who \nprotect our borders, our ports, and our skies get paid. That is what \nthe American people voted for last November. They were sick and tired. \nIf I heard it once, I heard it 100 times: We are sick and tired of the \ndysfunction in Washington, DC, and that is why we are voting for a \nchange.\n\n  That is why we have nine new colleagues in the Senate--to break that \nlogjam of dysfunction.\n  So I would implore the Democratic leader to heed his own call for a \nclean Department of Homeland Security funding bill and to quit playing \ngames. Quit playing games with the lives of\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\nthe people who work at the Department of Homeland Security. Quit \nplaying games with the American people, whose security is on the line \nif for some reason the ability of the Department to perform its \nimportant functions is disrupted because of the lack of funding. Quit \nplaying games with the funding that pays the salaries of the men and \nwomen who protect our ports, who protect our airports, and who protect \nour border from transnational drug cartels.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, everyone agrees that our immigration \nsystem is broken. The immigration system we have now hurts our economy, \nand it hurts our national security. The Senate passed a bipartisan \nimmigration bill; the House of Representatives chose not to act. Again, \nthe Senate passed a comprehensive immigration bill. That is why I \nsupported the Executive action by President Obama to address our \nimmediate immigration crisis. We cannot wait for the House of \nRepresentatives' Republicans to act, and that is because immigration is \none of our country's greatest strengths. Immigrants are a vital part of \nthe fabric of Massachusetts and of our country. They start businesses, \nthey create jobs, and they contribute to our communities.\n  The President's Executive order recognizes the value of immigrants to \nour country. President Obama's Executive order will bring millions of \nlaw-abiding immigrants out of the shadows and help to keep those \nfamilies together. The order allows law enforcement to focus its \nresources where they belong: reinforcing security at our borders and \nprosecuting and deporting dangerous criminals who pose threats to \npublic safety. This Executive action cannot and should not be viewed as \nthe final word on the matter of immigration reform. It is the beginning \nof an effort to permanently fix our broken immigration system.\n  What unites us in Massachusetts and all across America is the \nunshakable belief that no matter where you come from, no matter what \nyour circumstances, you can achieve the American dream. The immigration \nsystem we have now doesn't reflect those values.\n  Unfortunately, instead of working to fix the problems with our \nimmigration system, the majority of the Senate has been manufacturing a \ngovernment shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, even as our \nNation faces real threats to our safety and to our national security if \nwe don't fully fund the Department of Homeland Security. The majority \nseems more interested in undermining President Obama's border policy \nthan funding actual border protection in our country.\n  Let's look at what could happen if Homeland Security funding lapses.\n  No. 1, FEMA efforts. FEMA is a part of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. FEMA efforts in Massachusetts to develop a preliminary damage \nassessment for disaster relief funding may be interrupted.\n  The people in my home State of Massachusetts are suffering from the \nsecond snowiest winter in our history. We have endured more than 8 feet \nof snow. Those snow piles are climbing even higher. Seawalls that \nprotect our shores are crumbling. Roofs are collapsing. Homes are being \ndestroyed. Small businesses are shuttered while owners struggle to make \nends meet. Cities and towns across the Commonwealth have overspent \ntheir budgets by tens of millions of dollars responding to one \nsnowstorm after another.\n  But instead of the relief that should come with the assurance that \nFEMA assistance is on the way, the people of Massachusetts have to \nworry that this Republican-manufactured government shutdown threat is \njeopardizing this critical assistance. The last thing the people of \nMassachusetts should have to worry about is whether their disaster \nassistance will be delayed by the politics of immigration reform. This \nis absolutely outrageous. Massachusetts needs the disaster relief \ntoday.\n  No. 2, an estimated 30,000 Homeland Security employees would have to \nbe furloughed, including those who process Federal grants for local \npolice, fire, and other first responders. Firefighters might not get \nthe best oxygen masks. Bomb squads might not get the right equipment \nthey need. These are hard-working people who help protect our Nation \nand help our first responders do their jobs.\n  No. 3, a Department of Homeland Security shutdown would compromise \nour national security by stopping command and control activities at \nDepartment of Homeland Security headquarters, disrupting important \nprograms such as detecting weapons of mass destruction. Homeland \nSecurity employees remaining on the job will not get paid, and those \nwho are furloughed will be left to wonder whether they will ever be \npaid for the work they missed. This uncertainty hurts morale and puts \nfamilies in financial jeopardy.\n  It is time for Republicans to end this brinkmanship and help pass a \nclean Homeland Security budget free of unrelated policy riders. Then we \nshould get to work on comprehensive immigration reform. The immigration \nsystem we have now doesn't reflect our time-honored values as a melting \npot of diversity and innovation. It hurts our economy and national \nsecurity. In short, our immigration system is broken.\n  But for millions of immigrants who are living in the shadows, who are \nworking every day to support their families, who have been brought up \nhere from a young age, who are serving our country in the military or \npursuing the dream of higher education--these people deserve a path \nthat allows them to earn citizenship. That is why we need to work \ntogether on comprehensive immigration reform. It will give more \nfamilies and individuals a real shot at the American dream. It will \nencourage immigrants who are educated here to innovate here.\n  This is an important debate, and we should have it, and we should not \nhave it at the expense of the safety and the security of our Nation.\n  I call on my Republican colleagues to bring forward a clean \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding bill, free of unrelated policy \nriders dealing with immigration. Let's give the people of our country \nthe confidence that the Department of Homeland Security is going to \nprotect against al-Shabaab launching a successful attack against the \nMall of America, that a terrorist group cannot now be put together, \nthinking, perhaps erroneously, that the Department of Homeland Security \nhas taken its eye off the ball while worrying about the funding levels \nthat are necessary in order to secure our country.\n  I lived through this in Boston. Mohamed Atta and the other nine who \nhijacked the two planes on September 11, 2001, thought they could find \nan opening--and they did--in our airline security. In 2013 the Tsarnaev \nbrothers thought they could find a hole in our security, and they \nattacked again in Boston.\n  We should not have any question raised about the Department of \nHomeland Security being on the job protecting our citizens and \nproviding the security our country needs. That is where we are right \nnow, and the Republicans are holding up the funding of this vital \nagency under the misguided notion that they are going to be able to \nwrite the entire comprehensive immigration bill inside a Department of \nHomeland Security budget. It is not going to happen. Everyone in this \ncountry knows it is not going to happen. The Republicans are playing a \ndangerous game with the security of our country.\n  I ask all who make the decisions in the Republican Party to please \ntell their most radical Members that the Department of Homeland \nSecurity must be funded. It must be funded this week. We must not only \npay those who work for us, but we should thank them every day for the \nsecurity they provide to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I would say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Amen. Amen. We can't play around with our national \nsecurity by holding somebody's legislative ideal as\n\n[[Page S1096]]\n\na means of holding up the national security and holding the national \nsecurity of this country hostage.\n\n\n                 electronic devices and privacy rights\n\n  Mr. President, I came to talk about another issue. In the first part \nof the week, the Washington Post had an article that followed a series \nof articles in other newspapers, such as the Wall Street Journal and \nthe New York Times, about a device that was given certification by the \nFederal Communications Commission called a stingray.\n  This device, when used properly by law enforcement--specifically, the \nFBI--not only can locate and absorb the content of communications over \ncell phones but can also locate the specific location of that cell \nphone. It does so by making the cell phone think that it, the device, \nis the cell phone tower. So instead of the cell phone radio waves going \nto the normal cell phone tower, they would come to this device called a \nstingray. If used properly, it can be used to go after the bad guys--\nterrorists and criminals. Of course, that is one of the reasons this \ndevice was created and certified by the Federal Communications \nCommission.\n  Part of the protections, as used by the FBI and local law \nenforcement, to get content is to treat it as if they were going to \nbreak into somebody's home to get evidence. Our constitutional \nprotections regarding the right of privacy require that the law \nenforcement agency go to a judge--an impartial part of the judicial \nbranch--in order to get a court order to show probable cause that a \ncrime has been committed and therefore the constitutional right of \nprivacy is trumped, and with this court order, law enforcement can go \nin and get the evidence.\n  Well, as technology continues to evolve and explode, of course, \nquestions about our constitutional right of privacy get a lot more \ndifficult, and so now law enforcement wants to pinpoint the location of \na cellphone so they can go in and grab that person. Again, it would \nseem that the constitutional right of privacy needs to have the \nprotection of a judge's order, and it is this Senator's belief that the \nFBI, when employing this type of device, would, in fact, use those \nconstitutional protections.\n  Different news articles have raised questions about how this device \nis handled once it is turned over to local law enforcement and whether \nthey are being adequately trained on judicial protections, and indeed, \nare they employing those protections. The news articles, as evidenced \nby the Washington Post this past Monday, would indicate that those \njudicial protections are not being employed.\n  So this Senator, as one of the co-leaders of the commerce committee, \nalong with the chairman of the committee, John Thune, has written to \nthe FCC and asked them what information they have about the rationale \nbehind the restrictions placed on the certification of the stingray--\nthe device that was certified by the FCC--and whether those similar \nrestrictions have been put in place for other devices. As technology \ncontinues to improve, we are going to see a lot more of these types of \ndevices.\n  We need to know whether the FCC has inquired about the oversight that \nmay be in place in order to ensure that the use of the devices complies \nwith the manufacturer's representations to the FCC at the time of the \ncertification. We are asking for a status report of the task force that \nwas previously formed so we can look at these questions surrounding the \nuse of the stingray.\n  This is not the last time we are going to be asking these questions--\nnot necessarily about this device, the stingray. There is a \nmultiplicity of devices that are coming out on the market, and the \nquestion is: What about our privacy? Of course we are reminded about \nthis issue every day because every day we read about another data \nbreach in the newspaper.\n  I have filed legislation with regard to data breaches to ensure that \nat least the company has the obligation to notify the poor customers \nthat their data is suddenly out there in the Internet ether because of \nthat data breach. A lot of these questions are going to continue to be \nasked.\n  What about the device called the Pineapple? I had no idea this device \nexisted. Here is what it does: If I go into a Starbucks and use their \nwireless Internet, someone could be sitting outside of that Starbucks \nin their car, or at one of the outside tables, with this device called \na Pineapple, and instead of my wireless device using Starbucks' \nInternet system, it is on that Pineapple device and all of my \ncommunications are going directly to that person, and that person is \nable to steal all of my private information. That is a major theft. \nThis is scary. Yet that device has been around for several years.\n  We have major privacy questions. The Presiding Officer, who is a \nmember of the commerce committee, knows that we are going to be \ngrappling with these issues, along with other committees, such as \njudiciary, on the right to privacy.\n  In the meantime, we have raised these issues with the FCC on this \nmost recent detailed expose about this device called the stingray. If \nit is employed for our national security and our personal safety, which \nis the job of the government, then it is a good thing; however, if it \nis employed for other reasons, such as invading our constitutional \nright of privacy, that is another thing.\n  It is time for us to stand up for the individual citizens in this \ncountry and their right to privacy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                      President's Executive Order\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, last week I was glad to see that a \nFederal judge in Texas issued a preliminary injunction against the \nPresident's Executive order on immigration. This ruling, if upheld--and \nI believe it will be--reaffirms that President Obama was right when he \nsaid at least 22 times that he didn't have the authority to take the \naction he now has taken on immigration.\n  In December of last year I joined in an amicus brief with Senator \nCruz and Senator Cornyn and, I believe, the attorneys general from 26 \nStates--not the State of Missouri but 26 States. I was glad that my \njoining allowed Missouri to be represented in support of this lawsuit \nbrought by the State of Texas against President Obama's illegal \ndecision to allow amnesty to be established. The brief states the Obama \nadministration exceeded its constitutional authority and disrupted the \ndelicate balance of power between the Congress, whose job it is to pass \nthe law, and the President, whose job it is to carry out the law.\n  Executive means just that. The job of the Executive is to execute the \nlaw. It is not to pass the law. There is no constitutional provision \nanyone has been able to show me or that I have ever been able to find \nthat says if the Congress doesn't do something, the President can \ndecide it needs to be done and the President just does it on his own. \nThere is certainly no law that suggests the President can just \nwillfully ignore the law.\n  The brief we joined asserts that the Obama administration exceeded \nthe bounds of its so-called prosecutorial discretion. The idea that \nthey can have some discretion about how vigorously they enforce certain \nlaws is, both in this case and in the court ruling, held up to the \nstandard it really should be allowed to meet. The idea that the \nPresident can say that there is too much law here to enforce and we \ncan't afford to enforce the law--but then by not enforcing the law, it \ncreates substantially more economic burden on the States and the \nFederal Government than enforcing the law would have created--by any \nstandard makes no sense. This is not a determination that at some level \nthere are just too many violations of some law that is not very \nsignificant that you could have some prosecutorial discretion. This is \nthe law that impacts whether people can come into the country or not \nand whether they can stay in the country not being legally here.\n  The bill that Leader McConnell introduced this week will put every \nSenator on record on this topic. I look forward to a chance to vote on \nthat bill\n\n[[Page S1097]]\n\nand to see my colleagues vote on this bill. Who will stand with the \nPresident's clear power grab on immigration, and who will stand by the \nrule of law? At least half a dozen Democrats and perhaps more have said \nthey disagree with what the President did with this November action. A \nvote on Senator McConnell's bill will give them a chance to show \nwhether they really disagree or not. It is specific to the November \naction. It is specific to the action the Federal judge in Texas said \nputs undue burdens on the State and exceeded the President's authority.\n  As I have said a number of times, I would like to see our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle be willing to debate this issue. I have \nalso admitted a number of times that if I were them and if the \nPresident of the United States had said 22 times he couldn't do \nsomething, I would have some reluctance--I suppose as they clearly do--\nto come to the floor and defend why now those 22 statements don't \nmatter.\n  If the Democrats would simply allow the Senate to begin debating the \nbill, Members on both side of the aisle could offer amendments, and we \ncould actually be doing the job we are expected to do as legislators. \nUnfortunately, they decided to repeatedly say: No, we don't want to \ndebate this bill. No, we are not going to go forward. No, we are not \ngoing to let the normal process work. No, we are not going to deal with \nthe bill sent over by the co-equal branch of the Congress, the House of \nRepresentatives. Hopefully, we will see what happens as this debate \nmoves forward and the President's activities are held not only now to a \nstandard of law but also to his own standard.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a list of the 22 times the President has said he didn't have the \nauthority to do what he has now done.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  22 Times President Obama Said He Couldn't Ignore or Create His Own \n                            Immigration Law\n\n       1. The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to \n     do with [the president] trying to bring more and more power \n     into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all. \n     And that's what I intend to reverse when I'm President of the \n     United States of America.'' (3/31/08)\n       2. ``We've got a government designed by the Founders so \n     that there'd be checks and balances. You don't want a \n     president who's too powerful or a Congress that's too \n     powerful or a court that's too powerful. Everybody's got \n     their own role. Congress's job is to pass legislation. The \n     president can veto it or he can sign it. . . . I believe in \n     the Constitution and I will obey the Constitution of the \n     United States. We're not going to use signing statements as a \n     way of doing an end-run around Congress.'' (5/19/08)\n       3. ``Comprehensive reform, that's how we're going to solve \n     this problem. . . . Anybody who tells you it's going to be \n     easy or that I can wave a magic wand and make it happen \n     hasn't been paying attention to how this town works.'' (5/5/\n     10)\n       4. ``[T]here are those in the immigrants' rights community \n     who have argued passionately that we should simply provide \n     those who are [here] illegally with legal status, or at least \n     ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation \n     until we have better laws. . . . I believe such an \n     indiscriminate approach would be both unwise and unfair. It \n     would suggest to those thinking about coming here illegally \n     that there will be no repercussions for such a decision. And \n     this could lead to a surge in more illegal immigration. And \n     it would also ignore the millions of people around the world \n     who are waiting in line to come here legally. Ultimately, our \n     nation, like all nations, has the right and obligation to \n     control its borders and set laws for residency and \n     citizenship. And no matter how decent they are, no matter \n     their reasons, the 11 million who broke these laws should be \n     held accountable.'' (7/1/10)\n       5. ``I do have an obligation to make sure that I am \n     following some of the rules. I can't simply ignore laws that \n     are out there. I've got to work to make sure that they are \n     changed.''\n       6. ``I am president, I can't do these things just by \n     myself. We have a system of government that requires the \n     Congress to work with the Executive Branch to make it happen. \n     I'm committed to making it happen, but I've got to have some \n     partners to do it. . . . The main thing we have to do to stop \n     deportations is to change the laws. . . . [T]he most \n     important thing that we can do is to change the law because \n     the way the system works--again, I just want to repeat, I'm \n     president, I'm not king. If Congress has laws on the books \n     that says that people who are here who are not documented \n     have to be deported, then I can exercise some flexibility in \n     terms of where we deploy our resources, to focus on people \n     who are really causing problems as a opposed to families who \n     are just trying to work and support themselves. But there's a \n     limit to the discretion that I can show because I am obliged \n     to execute the law. That's what the Executive Branch means. I \n     can't just make the laws up by myself. So the most important \n     thing that we can do is focus on changing the underlying \n     laws.'' (10/25/10)\n       7. ``America is a nation of laws, which means I, as the \n     President, am obligated to enforce the law. I don't have a \n     choice about that. That's part of my job. But I can advocate \n     for changes in the law so that we have a country that is both \n     respectful of the law but also continues to be a great nation \n     of immigrants. . . . With respect to the notion that I can \n     just suspend deportations through executive order, that's \n     just not the case, because there are laws on the books that \n     Congress has passed. . . . [W]e've got three branches of \n     government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch's \n     job is to enforce and implement those laws. And then the \n     judiciary has to interpret the laws. There are enough laws on \n     the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we \n     have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply \n     through executive order ignore those congressional mandates \n     would not conform with my appropriate role as President.'' \n     (3/28/11)\n       8. ``I can't solve this problem by myself. . . . [W]e're \n     going to have to have bipartisan support in order to make it \n     happen. . . . I can't do it by myself. We're going to have to \n     change the laws in Congress, but I'm confident we can make it \n     happen.'' (4/20/11)\n       9. ``I know some here wish that I could just bypass \n     Congress and change the law myself. But that's not how \n     democracy works. See, democracy is hard. But it's right. \n     Changing our laws means doing the hard work of changing minds \n     and changing votes, one by one.'' (4/29/11)\n       10. ``Sometimes when I talk to immigration advocates, they \n     wish I could just bypass Congress and change the law myself. \n     But that's not how a democracy works. What we really need to \n     do is to keep up the fight to pass genuine, comprehensive \n     reform. That is the ultimate solution to this problem. That's \n     what I'm committed to doing.'' (5/10/11)\n       11. ``I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books. . . \n     . Now, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and \n     change the laws on my own. Believe me, the idea of doing \n     things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on \n     immigration reform. But that's not how our system works. \n     That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our \n     Constitution is written.'' (7/25/11)\n       12. ``So what we've tried to do is within the constraints \n     of the laws on the books, we've tried to be as fair, humane, \n     just as we can, recognizing, though, that the laws themselves \n     need to be changed. . . . The most important thing for your \n     viewers and listeners and readers to understand is that in \n     order to change our laws, we've got to get it through the \n     House of Representatives, which is currently controlled by \n     Republicans, and we've got to get 60 votes in the Senate. . . \n     . Administratively, we can't ignore the law. . . . I just \n     have to continue to say this notion that somehow I can just \n     change the laws unilaterally is just not true. We are doing \n     everything we can administratively. But the fact of the \n     matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. \n     And I think there's been a great disservice done to the cause \n     of getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive \n     immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, \n     by myself, I can go and do these things. It's just not true. \n     . . . We live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through \n     the legislature, and then I can sign it. And if all the \n     attention is focused away from the legislative process, \n     then that is going to lead to a constant dead-end. We have \n     to recognize how the system works, and then apply pressure \n     to those places where votes can be gotten and, ultimately, \n     we can get this thing solved.'' (9/28/11)\n       In June 2012, President Obama unilaterally granted deferred \n     action for childhood arrivals (DACA), allowing ``eligible \n     individuals who do not present a risk to national security or \n     public safety . . . to request temporary relief from \n     deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.'' \n     He then argued that he had already done everything he could \n     legally do on his own:\n       13. ``Now, what I've always said is, as the head of the \n     executive branch, there's a limit to what I can do. Part of \n     the reason that deportations went up was Congress put a whole \n     lot of money into it, and when you have a lot of resources \n     and a lot more agents involved, then there are going to be \n     higher numbers. What we've said is, let's make sure that \n     you're not misdirecting those resources. But we're still \n     going to, ultimately, have to change the laws in order to \n     avoid some of the heartbreaking stories that you see coming \n     up occasionally. And that's why this continues to be a top \n     priority of mine. . . . And we will continue to make sure \n     that how we enforce is done as fairly and justly as possible. \n     But until we have a law in place that provides a pathway for \n     legalization and/or citizenship for the folks in question, \n     we're going to continue to be bound by the law. . . . And so \n     part of the challenge as President is constantly saying, \n     `what authorities do I have?' '' (9/20/12)\n       14. ``We are a nation of immigrants. . . . But we're also a \n     nation of laws. So what I've said is, we need to fix a broken \n     immigration system.

(1/30/13)\n       16. ``I'm not a king. You know, my job as the head of the \n     executive branch ultimately is to carry out the law. And, you \n     know, when it comes to enforcement of our immigration laws, \n     we've got some discretion. We can prioritize what we do. But \n     we can't simply ignore the law. When it comes to the \n     dreamers, we were able to identify that group and say, `These \n     folks are generally not a risk. They're not involved in \n     crime. . . . And so let's prioritize our enforcement \n     resources.' But to sort through all the possible cases of \n     everybody who might have a sympathetic story to tell is very \n     difficult to do. This is why we need comprehensive \n     immigration reform. To make sure that once and for all, in a \n     way that is, you know, ratified by Congress, we can say that \n     there is a pathway to citizenship for people who are staying \n     out of trouble, who are trying to do the right thing, who've \n     put down roots here. . . . My job is to carry out the law. \n     And so Congress gives us a whole bunch of resources. They \n     give us an order that we've got to go out there and enforce \n     the laws that are on the books. . . . If this was an issue \n     that I could do unilaterally I would have done it a long time \n     ago. . . . The way our system works is Congress has to pass \n     legislation. I then get an opportunity to sign it and \n     implement it.'' (1/30/13)\n       17. ``This is something I've struggled with throughout my \n     presidency. The problem is that I'm the president of the \n     United States, I'm not the emperor of the United States. My \n     job is to execute laws that are passed. And Congress right \n     now has not changed what I consider to be a broken \n     immigration system. And what that means is that we have \n     certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place \n     even if we think that in many cases the results may be \n     tragic. . . . [W]e've kind of stretched our administrative \n     flexibility as much as we can[.]'' (2/14/13)\n       18. ``I think that it is very important for us to recognize \n     that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative. I \n     can do some things and have done some things that make a \n     difference in the lives of people by determining how our \n     enforcement should focus. . . . And we've been able to \n     provide help through deferred action for young people. . . . \n     But this is a problem that needs to be fixed legislatively.'' \n     (7/16/13)\n       19. ``My job in the executive branch is supposed to be to \n     carry out the laws that are passed. Congress has said `here \n     is the law' when it comes to those who are undocumented, and \n     they've allocated a whole bunch of money for enforcement. \n     And, what I have been able to do is to make a legal argument \n     that I think is absolutely right, which is that given the \n     resources that we have, we can't do everything that Congress \n     has asked us to do. What we can do is then carve out the \n     DREAM Act folks, saying young people who have basically grown \n     up here are Americans that we should welcome. . . . But if we \n     start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring \n     the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to \n     defend legally. So that's not an option. . . . What I've said \n     is there is a there's a path to get this done, and that's \n     through Congress.'' (9/17/13)\n       20. ``[I]f, in fact, I could solve all these problems \n     without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But \n     we're also a nation of laws. That's part of our tradition. \n     And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I \n     can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm \n     proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic \n     processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. \n     . . . It is not simply a matter of us just saying we're going \n     to violate the law. That's not our tradition. The great thing \n     about this country is we have this wonderful process of \n     democracy, and sometimes it is messy, and sometimes it is \n     hard, but ultimately, justice and truth win out.'' (11/25/13)\n       21. ``I am the Champion-in-Chief of comprehensive \n     immigration reform. But what I've said in the past remains \n     true, which is until Congress passes a new law, then I am \n     constrained in terms of what I am able to do. What I've done \n     is to use my prosecutorial discretion, because you can't \n     enforce the laws across the board for 11 or 12 million \n     people, there aren't the resources there. What we've said is \n     focus on folks who are engaged in criminal activity, focus on \n     people who are engaged in gang activity. Do not focus on \n     young people, who we're calling DREAMers. . . . That already \n     stretched my administrative capacity very far. But I was \n     confident that that was the right thing to do. But at a \n     certain point the reason that these deportations are taking \n     place is, Congress said, `you have to enforce these laws.' \n     They fund the hiring of officials at the department that's \n     charged with enforcing. And I cannot ignore those laws any \n     more than I could ignore, you know, any of the other laws \n     that are on the books. That's why it's so important for us to \n     get comprehensive immigration reform done this year.'' (3/6/\n     14)\n       22. ``I think that I never have a green light [to push the \n     limits of executive power]. I'm bound by the Constitution; \n     I'm bound by separation of powers. There are some things we \n     can't do. Congress has the power of the purse, for example. . \n     . . Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So \n     I don't have a green light. . . . My preference in all these \n     instances is to work with Congress, because not only can \n     Congress do more, but it's going to be longer-lasting.'' (8/\n     6/14)\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Let me mention a few of those, but I will submit all 22 \nfor the Record. As early as March of 2008, the President said: I take \nthe Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we are \nfacing right now are things that don't go through Congress at all.\n  In November of 2010 the President said: I am the President, not a \nking. I can't do these things just by myself. I have to have partners \nto do it.\n  In January of 2013, the President, again, still believes he is not a \nking, because he says: I am not a king. He says that at two different \nevents on that day. He says: We can't simply ignore the law.\n  The truth is, in November of 2014 the President does decide we can \nsimply ignore the law. The 22 times the President said we couldn't \nignore the law I agree with him. For those who believe I don't find \nenough opportunities to agree with the President, here are 22 times I \nagree with the President's view that he cannot do these kinds of things \non his own and by himself.\n  On February 14, 2013--2 years ago--the President said: The problem is \nthat I am the President of the United States.\n  I could actually quit right there and maybe that would say all I need \nto say, but of course he said:\n\n       The problem is that you know I'm the president of the \n     United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States . . . \n     we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in \n     place.\n\n  It goes on. I get to that point, and I don't know quite how to \nexplain--as I am sure the President doesn't know how to explain--what \nhe has said and what he has now done.\n  On September 2013: ``My job in the executive branch is supposed to be \nto carry out the laws that are passed,'' still in full agreement with \nwhat the President said his job is.\n  As late as August of this last year, the President said: There are \nsome things we can't do. Congress has the power of the purse, for \nexample. Congress has to pass a budget and authorize spending. So I \ndon't have a green light.\n  He goes on to suggest to do whatever the President might like to do. \nThat is basically what this debate is about right now. It is not about \nwhether the Department of Homeland Security would continue to function. \nIn fact, what I wish to see is the President engaged as the principal \nofficer responsible for the administration of the government.\n  I think something like that is what President Kennedy said after the \nBay of Pigs, when he said: I am responsible here because I am the \nprincipal officer responsible for the administration of the government.\n  The President created this problem. He created this funding problem \nfor States, he created this funding problem for the Federal Government, \nand he created this problem of exceeding his authority as President of \nthe United States. But the President, once again, is missing from the \ndiscussion of how to solve the problem.\n  That could very well be, as is often the case, the person who would \nknow how to solve the problem is the person who created it. But we are \nnot hearing anything from that person because clearly people at the \nWhite House believe it is to their temporary political advantage to act \nas though the people in the Congress don't want the government to \nfunction, rather than to act as though people in the Congress believe \nthe President was right the 22 times he said he couldn't do what he has \nnow done.\n  I have heard several of my colleagues in the last few days--in fact, \neven one or two this morning on early news shows--say: We need a way \nfor Congress to settle these kinds of disputes outside of the \nappropriations process.\n  One way to do that would be to pass a law I filed in the last \nCongress that the House of Representatives passed in a bipartisan way--\nthe Senate was not allowed to vote on it and I would like to see us \nvote on it in this Congress--which is the ENFORCE the Law Act, which \nsimply does allow the Congress, if a majority of the Members of the \nHouse or Senate believes the President is not enforcing the law as \nwritten, to go to a judge and seek an early determination, rather than \nwait for some aggrieved citizen who disagrees with a rule or regulation \nto have to hire their own lawyer after the rule is in effect,\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\nand in the 2 years or so it might take to get that case to the Supreme \nCourt, other individuals impacted by the rule or regulation are trying \nto comply with it, only to find out later, as the Court ruled a handful \nof times during the recent years of this Presidency that, no, the \nPresident doesn't have the authority to do that.\n  They said: No, you don't have the authority to appoint people to the \nNational Labor Relations Board when the Senate is in session just \nbecause you have decided somehow the Senate is not in session. You \ndon't get to decide whether the Senate is in session, Mr. President, if \nthey have met all the requirements to be in session. You particularly \ndon't get to decide whether the Senate is in session if that same \nsession of the Senate approves some things that you thought needed to \nbe done and that was good enough for you.\n  Then they said: Mr. President, by the way, when you appoint these \npeople illegally, whatever rules and regulations they put forward \naren't legal either.\n  So the couple of years of businesses trying to comply with the \nNational Labor Relations Act rules and regulations, all of that is to \nthe wayside. Those rules are all gone, but that doesn't restore the \ntime, effort, money, and needless compliance that happens when the \nPresident exceeds his authority or when the President's agencies, such \nas the Environmental Protection Agency, decide they could do something \nthey would like to do without ever arguing before the Congress that we \nwould like the authority to do this.\n  So passing the ENFORCE the Law Act would be a way to seek an earlier \nor quicker remedy. It does appear to me that the Federal judges are \nlikely to decide pretty quickly--Federal judges, the court of appeals \nlevel and then the circuit level--that, no, Mr. President; you have \ngone beyond where you were in fact. You were right the first 22 times, \nnot the November 2014 time that you decided if you don't like the law, \nyou don't have to enforce the law.\n  I think we should move forward with that ability that the Congress \ncurrently doesn't have, but also I think we should continue to express \nour desire for this process to work the way it is supposed to work.\n  The House of Representatives, which is supposed to initiate spending \nbills, has done that. It is the job of the Senate to debate those \nspending bills. It is the job of Senators to offer amendments if they \ndon't like them, and so far our friends on the other side have insisted \nthey don't want to do that part of this job. Maybe we all should \nunderstand why they don't want to defend what the President has done \nbecause of all the times he said he couldn't do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1099-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to commend both of our leaders, \nLeader McConnell and Leader Reid, for coming to the floor and agreeing \nto a path forward to fully fund Homeland Security, and I want to speak \nfor a moment about how critical this is and how really--if we cannot \nget the House of Representatives to agree, if they are not willing to \nmove forward and support this path--we have actually not one shutdown \nbut the possibility of two different kinds of shutdowns that will \nhappen within 3 days.\n  I am talking about the fact there are 3 days left before the funding \nfor the Department of Homeland Security expires--on February 27, at the \nend of the day on Friday. We are in a situation where those who protect \nus from terror threats all around us will be in a situation where they \neither aren't at work or are working without pay. We will be working \nwith pay but they won't be working with pay, which of course is an \noutrageous situation for us to put them in.\n  Every week we know there is a new terrorist threat. That is literally \ntrue now, and it is shocking, as we turn on the television and we read \nthe papers and listen to the radio. The most recent threat we know is \nfrom al-Shabaab, a Somali terrorist group with ties to Al Qaeda. A \nvideo appeared this last week where we know they called for an attack \nat the Mall of America near Minneapolis, as well as at other shopping \ncenters in the United States and Canada and Great Britain.\n  We also know that an attack on that mall would endanger as many as \n100,000 people--men, women, and children. That is how many people come \nto that mall, that big mall, every single day. Al-Shabaab terrorists \nhave attacked a mall before so we know this is not an idle threat. In \n2013, they attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, where 63 \ninnocent people were killed.\n  On February 14, a shooter at a synagogue in Copenhagen killed three \npeople. In late January, an American was 1 of 10 people killed in a \nterrorist attack in Libya. Earlier in January, in Paris, an attack by a \nterrorist claimed 16 lives. I could go on and on. In October alone, \ngunmen attacked the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa, killing a Canadian \nsoldier.\n  Michigan has the busiest northern border crossing in the country \nbetween Detroit and Windsor. Every day over $1 billion in goods and \npeople are crossing that border--every single day. We actually have \nthree crossings--two of the busiest in the country--and we count on \nborder and Customs security. We count on our Homeland Security people \nto be on the job doing their job every single day.\n  We also count on the people at the airports--all of us. Most of us \nare on planes one or two times a week. We all understand the critical \nimportance of the airport. And for those of us who are surrounded by \nwater, the Coast Guard is absolutely critical.\n  I could go on and on with all of the ways in which the men and women \nof Homeland Security, border security, Customs, the Coast Guard, as \nwell as police and firefighters, our first responders, are keeping us \nsafe every single day.\n  If the House does not agree to what we are doing here, in 3 days we \nwill see the Department of Homeland Security shut down--an entire \ninfrastructure put together after 9/11, which we all worked together on \nin a bipartisan way because we saw and we felt what had happened in \nterms of the threats to our country and the loss of lives.\n  It is critical this not be just a game. This can't be just a trick, \nwhere we are somehow voting straight up on Homeland Security funding \nwithout other riders on immigration or other things where there are \ndifferences with the President. If it is straight-up funding, then we \nvote, and then it goes to the House and it gets completely changed \nagain, that is not going to work. We are going to stand with the men \nand women who stand with us, put their lives on the line, and work hard \nevery single day to keep us safe. It is critical the House decide to \njoin us if in fact the Senate acts today to fully fund Homeland \nSecurity, which I hope we will.\n  There is another thing I am deeply concerned about, and that is the \nfact we have heard a lot of people talk about we will just do a \ncontinuing resolution from last year. That is effectively a shutdown of \nthe first responders, because when we look at the list--immigration, \nCustoms enforcement, detention, antitrafficking, smuggling--of those \nthings that are funded under a continuing resolution, which is a fancy \nword for last year's funding, those things don't continue.\n  The new grants that keep firefighters in Michigan and across the \ncountry going--in Detroit alone we have 150 firefighters--were supposed \nto start in October. Because we haven't fully funded Homeland Security, \nthey have been waiting. We have people who will be laid off--police \nofficers, firefighters in Michigan and across the country under a CR--\nunder a continuing resolution. It is effectively a first responders \nshutdown.\n  So that is the second shutdown I am concerned about. We could see \nCustoms and Border Protection unable to award new contracts for new \nvideo surveillance. How many times do we talk about the need to protect \nthe borders? But if we don't fully fund Homeland\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\nSecurity, if we do what it sounds like may happen from the House, some \nshort-term funding from last year, we will stop first responders, we \nwill stop surveillance equipment, we will stop the ability to upgrade \nour Coast Guard, and we prevent and delay contracts for police and \nfire.\n  Also without a fully funded Homeland Security, nuclear detection \nequipment can't be replaced. That deals with our enemies trying to \nsmuggle nuclear devices or dirty bombs into this country.\n  And what about emergency communications? Think about the malls or \nthink about things such as FEMA and the unprecedented storms and snow \nthat we have seen in parts of our country, the cold.\n  The idea we would somehow not fund upgrades to emergency equipment \nand effectively have a first responder shutdown is outrageous. I can't \nimagine the public, and rightly so, will understand this. I certainly \ndon't understand it. We have all heard concerns about the Secret \nService and the ability to upgrade those operations. I could go on and \non as it relates to first responder funding.\n  So I am, on the one hand, pleased that it appears we may in fact have \na path forward to separate the debate on fully funding our Homeland \nSecurity, our protections at the borders and airports, and so on, as \nwell as police and fire and first responders across the country from a \ndebate on immigration. I appreciate the differences, and we can have \nthat debate. I appreciate that has been proposed to be separated. But \nwe have to make sure there are no tricks and no doublecrosses when it \ncomes to the House of Representatives, because we are not going to \nsupport an effort to go back again and hold Homeland Security funding \nhostage to other policies and disagreements with the President.\n  Finally, let me stress if the House does less than what the Senate is \ngoing to do on fully funding Homeland Security, they are shutting down \nfirst responders in this country. That is what they are doing. If we \nsee a funding bill that has last year's numbers, they are putting in \nplace a shutdown of our first responders in this country with threats \nall around us and new threats every day.\n  People in this country deserve a lot better. We can do better than \nthat. So I hope we will come together today to do the right thing: Fund \nHomeland Security fully so our police and firefighters are available \nand on the streets, and we are securing our borders and our homeland \noperations. I dearly hope the House of Representatives will step up and \njoin us in getting this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nhas made an eloquent speech about the importance of fully funding the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. What is astonishing to me is that she \ndidn't listen to her own speech the first time the Republican majority \nleader brought up the House-passed bill to fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Democrats blocked it; and why she didn't \nlisten to that speech the second time the Republican majority leader \nbrought up the House-passed bill to fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Democrats blocked it; and why she didn't \nlisten to that speech the third time the Republican majority leader \nbrought up the House-passed proposal to fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Democrats blocked it; and why not the fourth \ntime the Republican leader brought up a bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives to fully fund the Department of Homeland Security and \nthe Democrats blocked it.\n  This is the fifth vote to fully fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, which we want to do, and which we voted to do four times. So \nlet us not confuse the issue here. I am amazed that Senate Democrats \ncome up with this stuff on the other side. One would think they were \nliving in a different world than we are.\n  The House has passed legislation to fully fund the Department of \nHomeland Security. Senate Republicans have brought up a bill to fully \nfund the Department of Homeland Security four times. The Presiding \nOfficer knows that. Four times we voted yes and four times they voted \nno. This is the fifth opportunity they will have to fully fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and I hope we can do that.\n  But let us not recreate events that never happened. Let us recognize \nthe fact that for 2 weeks Senate Republicans have been prepared to \nfully fund the Department of Homeland Security and the Democrats \nthemselves have blocked it not once, not twice, not three times, but \nfour times.\n\n\n                            Higher Education\n\n  Now, Mr. President, if I may switch gears, I came to the floor to \ntalk on another subject which fortunately has bipartisan support. I am \nglad to speak about something like that because I think the people of \nthis country gave us and the Republican majority an opportunity this \nyear to come to Washington and shake things up, but also get things \ndone.\n  In the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we are \nworking hard to do just that with Senator Murray, the ranking Democrat \non the committee, and just as I worked with Senator Harkin in the last \nCongress when our committee reported out 25 different pieces of \nlegislation which became law. So we got things done in the last \nCongress, and I am fully confident that Senator Murray and I and the \nother members of our committee can do that in this Congress.\n  That doesn't mean we agree on everything. We don't agree on a lot of \nthings. If you had to pick a group of liberals and a group of \nconservatives and line them up, our committee would probably have as \nmuch difference as any committee in the Congress. But we also have \nabout 30 percent of the jurisdiction in the Congress. That is what \nSenator Ted Kennedy used to say when he was in the Senate. And we know \nit is our responsibility to get things done.\n  We are working hard on fixing No Child Left Behind. We are working \nwith Secretary Burwell and the President on finding ways to move \ndiscoveries and devices through the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Food and Drug Administration into the medicine cabinets.\n  I see the Senator from Maryland on the floor. Yesterday we worked \ntogether to receive a report that Senator Mikulski from Maryland and I, \nSenator Bennet from Colorado, and Senator Burr from North Carolina, \nasked for 2 years ago to take a look at all the Federal regulations \ngoverning our 6,000 colleges and universities and give us an assessment \nof how much they cost, and how much confusion and duplication there is \nsince the eight different times we have reauthorized the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965. We asked how often we failed to weed the garden, \nhow often we instead just dumped new laws and regulations on top of old \nones, and to tell us exactly what to do.\n  Chancellor Zeppos of Vanderbilt University and Chancellor Kirwan of \nthe University System of Maryland gave us this report. Senator Mikulski \nwas there, I was there, and Senator Murray, Senator Burr, and Senator \nBennet were there. It was a very impressive report. I won't speak for \nlong about it because I see the Senator from Maryland would like to \nspeak, but I wish to take 5 minutes and say these things. It is \nsometimes best to tell a story to underscore a point, and here is the \nfirst story. Vanderbilt University hired the Boston Consulting Group to \ntell the university how much it spent complying with Federal rules and \nregulations for higher education in a single year.\n  According to the Boston Consulting Group, Vanderbilt University spent \n$150 million complying with Federal rules and regulations last year. \nThat is 11 percent of Vanderbilt's non-hospital expenditures. That adds \nup to about $11,000 of the tuition for each one of the 12,000 students \nat the university. It is absolutely absurd that somehow or another that \ncould happen.\n  A second example is the student aid form 20 million families fill out \nevery year. It is 108 questions long. Our committee has been told that \ntwo questions would provide all the necessary information for 95 \npercent of families: What is your income from two years ago and what is \nyour family size? A bipartisan group of Senators have introduced a bill \nto do just that. This would save millions of hours and dollars across \nthe country.\n  Here is a third example. Surveys conducted by the National Academy of\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\nSciences found that 42 percent of a principal investigator's time on a \nresearch project is spent on administrative tasks instead of research.\n  I asked the head of the National Academy of Sciences what would be a \nreasonable time?\n  He said about 10 percent.\n  We spend 30 billion in taxpayer dollars a year on research and \ndevelopment at colleges and universities. If we could save $1 billion \nof that $30 billion by reducing that 42 percent to closer to 10 \npercent, then we could fund a 1,000 more multiyear grants to \ninvestigate cancer research, Ebola research, and vaccines, and we \nshould do that.\n  This is an enormously promising report.\n  Ten years ago the Senator from Maryland and I worked on a report \ncalled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' We asked a group of \ndistinguished Americans to tell us the 20 things that we might do in \nCongress to help make our country more competitive in the world. They \ngave us the 20 things, which formed a blueprint, and we passed most of \nthem and eventually funded most of them.\n  So I think this report we received yesterday has the opportunity to \nbe as important as ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which later \nhelped establish the America COMPETES Act. It is a blueprint for how we \ncan reduce overregulation, simplify rules, save money, make consumer \nprotection clear, keep tuition down, find more money for research, and \nlet colleges and universities spend their time and money educating \nstudents instead of filling out forms.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski from Maryland, Senator Bennet from Colorado, \nSenator Burr from North Carolina, and my partner Senator Murray on the \nHELP Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my opening statement from \nyesterday's hearing, followed by pages 1 through 6 of the report \npresented to us yesterday, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Task Force on Government Regulation of Higher Education\n\n       Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     a copy of my remarks at the Senate Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions Committee hearing earlier this week be printed \n     in the Record.\n\n\n        Task Force on Government Regulation of Higher Education\n\n       This morning we are holding our first hearing this Congress \n     on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act which will \n     focus on the final report from the Task Force on Government \n     Regulation of Higher Education.\n       Over a year ago, Vanderbilt University hired the Boston \n     Consulting Group to determine how much it costs the \n     university to comply with federal rules and regulations.\n       The answer: $150 million, or 11 percent of the university's \n     total non-hospital expenditures last year.\n       Vanderbilt Chancellor Nick Zeppos says that this adds about \n     $11,000 in additional tuition per year for each of the \n     university's 12,757 students.\n       Each year, 20 million American families fill out a \n     complicated, 108-question form called the FAFSA (Free \n     Application for Federal Student Aid) to obtain a grant or \n     loan to help pay for college. Several experts testified \n     before our committee that just two questions would tell the \n     Department of Education 95 percent of what it needs to know \n     to determine a student's eligibility for a grant or loan: \n     One, what is your family size? And, two, what is your family \n     income?\n       So, in January a bipartisan group of six Senators \n     introduced legislation to simplify the student aid \n     application and repayment process, including reducing the \n     108-question FAFSA form to just two questions. If our \n     legislation becomes law, then families, guidance counselors, \n     and admissions officers would save millions of hours.\n       Most important, according to financial aid expert Mark \n     Kantrowitz, the complicated, 108-question form discourages up \n     to 2 million Americans each year from applying for aid. Last \n     fall, the president of Southwest Tennessee Community College \n     in Memphis told me that the complex form turns away from his \n     campus 1,500 students each semester.\n       Tennessee has become the first state to make community \n     college tuition-free for qualifying students. But first, each \n     student must fill out the FAFSA. Now that tuition is free, \n     the principal obstacle for a qualified Tennessee student to \n     obtain two more years of education after high school is not \n     money: it is this unnecessarily complicated federal form. Ten \n     years ago, then again three years ago, surveys by the \n     National Academy of Sciences found that principal \n     investigators spend 42 percent of their time associated with \n     federal research projects on administrative tasks instead of \n     research.\n       I asked the head of the National Academies what a \n     reasonable percent of time would be for a researcher to spend \n     on administrative tasks. He replied: perhaps 10 percent or \n     even less.\n       How many billions could we save if we reduced the \n     administrative burden?\n       Taxpayers spend more than $30 billion a year on research \n     and development at colleges and universities.\n       This year, the average annual cost of an NIH research \n     project grant is $480,000. If we reduce spending on \n     unnecessary red tape by $1 billion, the an NIH could \n     potentially fund more than a thousand multi-year grants.\n       These should not be excused as normal, run-of-the-mill \n     problems of government. These examples, and others like them, \n     represent sloppy, inefficient governing that wastes money, \n     hurts students, discourages productivity, and impedes \n     research.\n       Such waste should be an embarrassment to all of us in the \n     federal government.\n       And let me make clear: let's not just blame President Obama \n     and Education Secretary Arne Duncan. They have contributed to \n     the problem, but so has every President and every education \n     secretary--and that includes me--since 1965 when the first \n     Higher Education Act was enacted.\n       And the list of those embarrassed should also include the \n     Congress of the United States for year after year adding to \n     and tolerating a pile of conflicting, confusing regulations.\n       The Higher Education Act totals nearly 1,000 pages; there \n     are over 1,000 pages in the official Code of Federal \n     Regulations devoted to higher education; and on average every \n     workday the Department of Education issues one new sub-\n     regulatory guidance directive or clarification.\n       No one has taken the time to ``weed the garden.''\n       The result of this piling up of regulations is that one of \n     the greatest obstacles to innovation and cost consciousness \n     in higher education has become--us, the federal government.\n       So if all of us created this mess, then it is up to all of \n     us to fix it.\n       That is why more than a year ago, four members of this \n     committee--two Democrats and two Republicans--asked a group \n     of distinguished educators to examine the current state of \n     federal rules and regulations for colleges and universities. \n     We asked them not just to tell us the problem, but to give us \n     specific solutions.\n       They have done so in a remarkable document entitled \n     ``Recalibrating Regulation of Colleges and Universities,'' in \n     which they outline 59 specific regulations, requirements and \n     areas for Congress and the Department of Education to \n     consider--listing 10 especially problematic regulations.\n       I thank Vanderbilt University Chancellor Nick Zeppos and \n     University System of Maryland Chancellor Brit Kirwan for \n     leading the effort.\n       In their own words, America's 6,000 colleges and \n     universities live in a ``jungle of red tape'' that is \n     expensive and confusing and unnecessary.\n       The report makes clear that colleges and taxpayers expect \n     appropriate regulation. But neither taxpayers nor colleges \n     are well-served by the jungle that exists today. Consumer \n     information that is too complicated to understand is \n     worthless.\n       Colleges must report the amount of foreign gifts they \n     receive; disclose the number of fires drills that occurred on \n     campus. ``Gainful employment'' disclosures require 30 \n     different pieces of information for each academic program \n     subject to the regulation.\n       When a student withdraws from college before a certain time \n     period, a student's federal money must be returned to the \n     government. This is a simple concept.\n       Yet the regulations and guidance implementing this are \n     ridiculously complex--200 paragraphs of regulatory text \n     accompanied by 200 pages in the Federal Student Aid handbook.\n       The University of Colorado reports that they have two full-\n     time staff devoted to this issue. One to do the calculation \n     and the other one to recheck the other's work. Ohio State \n     University estimates that it spends around $200,000 annually \n     on compliance for this regulation.\n       Institutions offering distance education are subject to an \n     additional set of bureaucracy that can result in additional \n     costs of $500,000 to a million dollars for compliance.\n       All of these are examples of colleges and universities \n     spending time and money on compliance with federal rules and \n     not on students.\n       Senator Murray and I will discuss how to develop a \n     bipartisan process to take full advantage of the \n     recommendations in this report and to include many of them in \n     reauthorization of the High Education Act, which we plan to \n     do this year.\n       We will schedule additional hearings to gather comment on \n     the report from institutions not directly involved with the \n     report and consumers of higher education, including parents, \n     students, and taxpayers.\n       Some of the recommendations require a change in the law. \n     Many can be fixed by the Department itself.\n       I have talked with Secretary Duncan more than once about \n     this effort and he is eager to do his part to solve the \n     problem. I look forward to working with him and with \n     President Obama on eliminating unnecessary red tape, saving \n     students money, and removing unnecessary regulatory obstacles \n     to innovation in the best system of higher education in the \n     world.\n       This is not a new subject for me. One of the first things I \n     did as a Senator was try to simplify student aid and the Free \n     Application\n\n[[Page S1102]]\n\n     for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). And I'm told the net result \n     was the reduction of approximately 7 questions. Those have \n     been replaced by many more now.\n       Although I voted against the final reauthorization of the \n     Higher Education Act of 2008, I authored a provision in the \n     bill that required the Secretary of Education to publish a \n     ``compliance calendar'' so schools can see all of their \n     deadlines.\n       Unfortunately, 7 years later, the Department of Education \n     has yet to implement this provision.\n       With bipartisan support and this groundbreaking report we \n     have today, I'm counting on this effort to get farther than \n     that one.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       The federal government's substantial fiscal investment in \n     higher education recognizes that postsecondary education is a \n     linchpin in the nation's social and economic strength. \n     Through that support, the government helps ensure that \n     colleges and universities continue to contribute broadly to \n     the fabric of American society. To ensure prudent stewardship \n     of federal support for higher education, the Department of \n     Education is charged with developing procedures to carry out \n     laws passed by Congress in regard to higher education and \n     with overseeing institutional compliance. Institutions of \n     higher learning recognize the important role regulations play \n     in the oversight of federal investments.\n       Over time, oversight of higher education by the Department \n     of Education has expanded and evolved in ways that undermine \n     the ability of colleges and universities to serve students \n     and accomplish their missions. The compliance problem is \n     exacerbated by the sheer volume of mandates--approximately \n     2,000 pages of text--and the reality that the Department of \n     Education issues official guidance to amend or clarify its \n     rules at a rate of more than one document per work day. As a \n     result, colleges and universities find themselves enmeshed in \n     a jungle of red tape, facing rules that are often confusing \n     and difficult to comply with. They must allocate resources to \n     compliance that would be better applied to student education, \n     safety, and innovation in instructional delivery. Clearly, a \n     better approach is needed.\n       In 2013, a bipartisan group of U.S. Senators recognized \n     that the pending reauthorization of the Higher Education Act \n     (HEA) creates an opportunity to consider these issues in \n     depth. They established a task force of college and \n     university presidents and chancellors to study federal \n     regulation of higher education broadly and identify potential \n     improvements.\n       Looking at the landscape of regulation of colleges and \n     universities writ large, the Task Force on Federal Regulation \n     of Higher Education identified a number of challenges that \n     are particularly problematic. As described in Section II of \n     this report, we concluded that many rules are unnecessarily \n     voluminous and too often ambiguous, and that the cost of \n     compliance has become unreasonable. Moreover, many \n     regulations are unrelated to education, student safety, or \n     stewardship of federal funds--and others can be a barrier to \n     college access and innovation in education.\n       Based on extensive discussions, consultations with experts, \n     and site visits to campuses, the Task Force identified \n     specific regulations that are of major concern to higher \n     education institutions. Section III details those concerns, \n     which include problematic financial responsibility standards, \n     confusion and inconsistency in reporting requirements for \n     campus crime, overreach in authorization of distance \n     education programs, inefficient rules concerning verification \n     of financial aid eligibility, counterproductive \n     micromanagement of the accreditation process, and policies \n     that result in consumers being inundated with information of \n     questionable value.\n       The Task Force also reviewed the processes by which higher \n     education regulations are developed and implemented, and \n     offers several specific ideas for improvement. Section IV \n     outlines recommendations that include asking the Government \n     Accountability Office to review the Department of Education's \n     methodology for estimating institutional costs of compliance \n     with regulations; the creation of clear ``safe harbors'' for \n     institutional compliance; the recognition of ``good faith'' \n     efforts to comply; and several proposals for better practices \n     by the Department.\n       To help policy makers think about the most effective and \n     efficient way to regulate higher education, the Task Force \n     developed the following Guiding Principles to govern the \n     development, implementation, and enforcement of regulations \n     by the Department:\n       Regulations should be related to education, student safety, \n     and stewardship of federal funds.\n       Regulations should be clear and comprehensible.\n       Regulations should not stray from clearly stated \n     legislative intent.\n       Costs and burdens of regulations should be accurately \n     estimated.\n       Clear safe harbors should be created.\n       The Department should recognize good faith efforts by \n     institutions.\n       The Department should complete program reviews and \n     investigations in a timely manner.\n       Penalties should be imposed at a level appropriate to the \n     violation.\n       Disclosure requirements should focus on issues of \n     widespread interest.\n       All substantive policies should be subject to the ``notice-\n     and-comment'' requirements of the Administrative Procedure \n     Act.\n       Regulations that consistently create compliance challenges \n     should be revised.\n       The Department should take all necessary steps to \n     facilitate compliance by institutions.\n       The Task Force believes that adherence to these principles \n     would help improve regulation of higher education, and urges \n     their adoption.\n       Again, to be clear: Regulations serve an important role in \n     ensuring institutional accountability. But requirements that \n     have an excessive reach, or that are unnecessarily costly and \n     difficult to implement--or worse still, that hinder student \n     access to college and drive costs up--are counterproductive. \n     Smarter rules are needed. In the context of the forthcoming \n     reauthorization of the HEA, this report from the Task Force \n     on Federal Regulation of Higher Education proposes many \n     specific avenues to improve the regulation of higher \n     education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        The Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education\n\n       The pending reauthorization of the Higher Education Act \n     (HEA) provides an opportunity for Congress to examine how \n     institutions of higher education are regulated and to \n     identify ways to streamline and simplify regulatory policies \n     and practices. With that goal in mind, a bipartisan group of \n     U.S. Senators--Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Barbara Mikulski (D-\n     MD), Richard Burr (R-NC), and Michael Bennet (D-CO) created \n     the Task Force on Federal Regulation of Higher Education in \n     the fall of 2013 and directed it to consider these issues in \n     depth.\n       The Senators articulated a three-part charge for the group:\n       1) Provide specific recommendations to consolidate, \n     streamline, and eliminate burdensome, costly, and confusing \n     regulations, laws, and reporting requirements;\n       2) Review and quantify the extent of all federal \n     requirements with which institutions must comply, including \n     estimates of the time and costs associated with specific \n     regulations; and,\n       3) Provide recommendations for reform to ensure future \n     regulations are promulgated in a manner that appropriately \n     considers existing law and accurately examines the costs and \n     benefits to taxpayers, institutions, and students.\n       The Senators appointed Task Force members representing \n     institutions from across all sectors of higher education, and \n     named Chancellors William E. Kirwan of the University System \n     of Maryland and Nicholas S. Zeppos of Vanderbilt University \n     (TN) as co-chairs. In addition to Chancellors Kirwan and \n     Zeppos, the Task Force includes these members:\n       William L. Armstrong, President, Colorado Christian \n     University\n       Bruce D. Benson, President, University of Colorado\n       Molly Corbett Broad, President, American Council on \n     Education (DC)\n       Thomas V. Chema, President Emeritus, Hiram College (OH)\n       Margaret L. Drugovich, President, Hartwick College (NY)\n       Dana G. Hoyt, President, Sam Houston State University (TX)\n       Brice W. Harris, Chancellor, California Community College \n     System\n       Jonathan A. Kaplan, Chief Executive Officer, Laureate \n     Online Education (MD)\n       Cornelius M. Kerwin, President, American University (DC)\n       J. Michael Locke, Former CEO, Rasmussen College (IL)\n       Harold L. Martin Sr., Chancellor, North Carolina \n     Agricultural and Technical State University\n       Claude O. Pressnell Jr., President, Tennessee Independent \n     Colleges and Universities Association\n       Thomas W. Ross, President, University of North Carolina\n       Robert G. Templin Jr., President, Northern Virginia \n     Community College\n       In addition, the Senators asked the American Council on \n     Education (ACE) to support the work of the Task Force.\n\n\n                Scope of Work and Task Force Activities\n\n       The word ``regulation'' can be viewed broadly or narrowly. \n     Narrowly defined, federal regulation means only a requirement \n     imposed on institutions through the Code of Federal \n     Regulations, the codification of all the regulations \n     promulgated by federal agencies. Considered more broadly, it \n     means any requirement placed on colleges and universities in \n     order to participate in the federal student aid program. For \n     the purposes of this Task Force and our report, we use \n     ``regulation'' in this broader sense.\n       The Task Force engaged in extensive consultations for this \n     project and solicited insights from higher education \n     associations, campus officials, and other organizations and \n     stakeholders. To gather input from individuals on campuses \n     who are responsible for implementing regulations, ACE staff \n     conducted extensive site visits and met with representatives \n     from more than 60 institutions around the country.\n       Our aim was not simply to reduce the number of regulations \n     imposed by the Department of Education, but rather to foster \n     more effective and efficient rules that still meet federal \n     objectives. To that end, we sought to accomplish these goals:\n       Summarize the increasing burden of federal regulation on \n     higher education.\n\n[[Page S1103]]\n\n       Identify regulations of particular concern to institutions \n     of higher education, explain why they are problematic, and \n     recommend changes to ameliorate them.\n       Offer longer-term process improvements that would minimize \n     similar concerns about regulations in the future.\n       Section I of this report frames the current regulatory \n     landscape for higher education. Section II describes specific \n     current challenges. Section III details 10 regulations that \n     colleges and universities find especially problematic, and \n     recommends solutions. Finally, Section IV proposes ways to \n     improve the regulatory process.\n       Effective oversight can help colleges and universities keep \n     costs down, keep students safe, focus on educating students, \n     and be good stewards of federal funds. In that spirit, the \n     Task Force developed the following Guiding Principles to help \n     govern the development, implementation, and enforcement of \n     regulations by the Department:\n       Regulations should be related to education, student safety, \n     and stewardship of federal funds.\n       Regulations should be clear and comprehensible.\n       Regulations should not stray from clearly stated \n     legislative intent.\n       Costs and burdens of regulations should be accurately \n     estimated.\n       Clear safe harbors should be created.\n       The Department should recognize good faith efforts by \n     institutions.\n       The Department should complete program reviews and \n     investigations in a timely manner.\n       Penalties should be imposed at a level appropriate to the \n     violation.\n       Disclosure requirements should focus on issues of \n     widespread interest.\n       All substantive policies should be subject to the ``notice-\n     and-comment'' requirements of the Administrative Procedure \n     Act.\n       Regulations that consistently create compliance challenges \n     should be revised.\n       The Department should take all necessary steps to \n     facilitate compliance by institutions.\n       We believe that these principles would help improve the \n     regulation of higher education, and we urge their adoption.\n       While the primary focus of this report is on requirements \n     imposed by the Department of Education, institutions of \n     higher education are also regulated by every Cabinet-level \n     agency, as well as many sub-Cabinet-level agencies. In that \n     regard, we acknowledge the important work by other groups and \n     organizations, including the National Research Council of the \n     National Academy of Sciences and the National Science Board, \n     to examine regulations stemming from other agencies, \n     particularly in connection with federally funded research.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nissue of funding for Homeland Security. However, I wish to note and \nacknowledge the comments just made by my colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Alexander, the chair of the HELP Committee. I couldn't agree \nwith him more.\n  Hello, America. Two Senators, different parts of the country, \ndifferent political parties, different political views on some social \nissues or whatever, but I couldn't agree more with this outstanding \nreport whose original idea came from the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  When we worked on the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act \nabout 5 years ago now, we agreed upon goals to make college more \naccessible, to make college more affordable, to always insist that that \ncollege offer a quality education and that students on the campus be \nsafe and secure so they could be in a true learning environment.\n  I am a student loan/student grant person, so I was focusing on the \nstudents. I taught at Loyola University in Baltimore, in the community \ncollege, but my colleague, who was the president of a university, said: \nWe ought to look at regs. Regulation could have a tremendous impact.\n  So we put our heads together. Our cochairs came from Tennessee. The \nMaryland cochair was Dr. Kirwan, a retiring but very able chancellor. \nAnd it is a terrific report. It is exactly what we wanted.\n  Where are the regs that, No. 1, are duplicative--the same darned \nreport after report, and then you do a report on the reports so that \nthen they can ask you questions and ask for a followup addendum. Then \nthere are also instances where the requirements are contradictory. So \nthere they are, the administrators of both the colleges and \nuniversities themselves or of an individual grant program. So we want \nto clarify that.\n  Not only under Senator Alexander's leadership did we go for what were \nthe top 10 concerns that were really burdensome, duplicative, or \ncontradictory, they gave us a checklist on what would constitute \ncriteria for a good reg. I think they gave us a great roadmap, and now \nit is our part to use the report. So we are not like everybody else \nwhere we got them to do a report and we don't do anything with it.\n  When we did ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm,'' which I was so \nexcited to be part of, it was truly a bipartisan effort. It led to \nlegislation, and it led to other executive branch input.\n  So I thank my colleague from Tennessee. I think this is the way we \nshould be working together--put our heads together, get the best advice \nfrom what is out there in the real world, and then let's put our \nshoulders to the wheel and get it done.\n  Does the Senator have a sense of when he would like to move or the \ntimetable to implement this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher comments and her leadership.\n  I would say to the Senator from Maryland that I will need to sit down \nand talk to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, which we plan to \ndo in March. My hope would be that in April we could begin five or six \nhearings aligned with the recommendations in the report, and on other \nmatters such as accreditation, form working groups within our \ncommittee, and then by the fall move ahead with the reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act and complete it by the end of the year.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator from Tennessee and look forward to \nworking with him.\n  Mr. President, this is the way it ought to be, where Senators come \ntogether and bring our best ideas. We also bring our concerns and we \nput them all on the table. But we began with civility, we began with \nrespect, and we established what were agreed-upon goals and how each \none of us thought we could get to the roadmap to do that. This is the \nway I would hope we would work.\n  Now, as we come to almost a crisis with the funding for Homeland \nSecurity running out on Friday, this is the time for us to put our \nparty differences aside, put our pet projects aside, and focus not on \nwhat is good for our politics but what is good for America.\n  I understand that our leadership on both sides of the aisle--Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Reid--have arrived now at a framework where we \nwill go through a set of parliamentary procedures, which is our way, to \nthen arrive at a point where we could be voting on a full year's \nfunding for Homeland Security without any additional riders that could \nderail the bill placed on it. I wish to compliment the leadership for \nbeginning a communication and establishing a parliamentary choreography \nwhere we could actually get the job done. The leaders have been working \non this. We know they will be coming here on the floor in a few minutes \nto share with us that idea and begin the procedures where every Senator \ncan exercise their will and their judgment.\n  But I just want to say this as the ranking member or the vice chair \nof the Appropriations Committee: We have to fund the Department of \nHomeland Security. We just have to do it. We have to do it, and we have \nto do it now. I hope we can do it in the Senate this afternoon and that \nthe House really follows what we are doing here.\n  This is so crucial because of the very nature of what the bill is--\nhomeland security. This isn't about a new agency that might be \nduplicative of another. This isn't about new programs. It is not even \nabout great big new sums of money. This Appropriations Committee \narrived at its recommendations when we were working on the omnibus.\n  The Presiding Officer is the chair of the Subcommittee on Homeland \nSecurity. I know that in the way he does his due diligence, he has \nreviewed this bill. So the money part I don't think is controversial \nand it actually does the job. And the job is to do the full funding to \nprotect the homeland.\n  I really worry about our country. Here we are, and we have ISIL \nmaking additional threats to the United States about the security of \nour malls. While\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\nwe were all pondering what our strategy would be and parsing what the \npolitics would be, our great Federal agents were on the scene making \nsure that four Americans didn't go to join ISIL to fight against us and \nperhaps organize predatory attacks against us. Our people are on the \njob, and now it is time that we do our job and fully fund this agency.\n  America is at risk. We face terrorism. We face the consequences of \nnatural disasters, which FEMA and the Coast Guard are really helping us \nwith right now. We face cyber threats. We need the Department of \nHomeland Security funded in a way to prevent and respond to these \nsituations.\n  When I look at this, it is really standing sentry in terms of all we \nneed to do in terms of port security, airport security, guarding our \nborders through our Border Patrol agents, 23,000 Border Patrol agents. \nBut I also look at the first responders. If anything happens in our \ncountry, it is local law enforcement and local firefighters who are the \nfirst to respond. We have helped them with this response by providing \nthem with Federal funds. I am really proud of what we have done on \nthis.\n\n  I want to speak particularly about the Fire Grant Program. Now think \nabout what they do. Every day when they report to duty, our first \nresponders don't know what they will face. In my own home State of \nMaryland, will they face a train derailment? We have had those. Will \nthey face a Metro fire? We have had that. Will we have a multiple-\nvehicle accident on 95 that could involve a horrific accident that \nrequires rescue from hazardous and toxic waste? Because of who we are, \nwith our airports and our seaports, we also are a big threat for a \nterrorist attack. Our first responders are asking us to give them the \nmoney they need to pay the bills and also help them with these \nnecessities.\n  Over 10 years ago I joined with one of my Republican counterparts, \nSenator Kit Bond of Missouri. We were both concerned with what was \nhappening to our volunteer fire departments. As he crisscrossed \nMissouri and I crisscrossed Maryland, we were shocked to find out that \na new firetruck could cost as much as $1 million, that wonderful SCBA \nprotective gear that would be fire retardant or fire resistant could \ncost $2,000, that the special breathing apparatus that is being \ndeveloped can cost over $5,000. When we put our heads together and \nlistened to our firefighters, we realized you could not fund that on \ntip jars, pancake breakfasts, crabcake dinners, or oyster fries in my \nown State. We wanted to help them. We wanted to make sure we helped \nthem so they could protect us.\n  So we looked at the Fire Grant Program. It has been a tremendous \nsuccess in my own State in the decades since we passed it. Over 600 \nfire departments have been helped with the new equipment they need. \nWhen I travel my State, I have people who defend and protect me in my \ncommunity shake my hand. The Presiding Officer knows what the volunteer \nfirefighters do. I am sure it is the same situation in North Dakota as \nit is western Maryland. They say: You have helped me be able to do the \njob. Volunteer fire departments do all of this on their own time and on \ntheir own dime.\n  So what happens if we don't fund Homeland Security? It means that \nthose $2 billion grants for emergency firefighters, port security, for \nlocal efforts and so on will not be funded. Make no mistake. For those \npeople perhaps in the Senate or in the House that say that we just do a \ncontinuing resolution, a continuing resolution means that grants cannot \nbe funded.\n  Under current law, for any program with an agency that is on a CR, it \ncannot issue grant money at all. So that means right now they are \ngetting ready to take the Fire Grant Program proposals. Secretary Jeh \nJohnson can't put out communication to say it is now the annual time \nfor fire chiefs to come in with their requests.\n  So we are placing America at risk--not only with the really big \npicture stuff. Often the big picture comes back home. On that terrible, \nterrible day of 9/11, who ran up into those burning buildings? Who ran \nup those steps of the World Trade Center? It was our firefighters.\n  I am flinching, flagging, abashed at their heroism and their desire \nto rescue. And every day--right this minute--one of them somewhere is \ndoing something. Certainly we can fund the grant program so they can \nhave the truck they need, so they have the breathing apparatus they \nneed, so they have the protective gear they need, so we can protect \nthem while they are protecting us--rather than protecting our political \nbutts. We have got to get off our butts and fund this bill.\n  I look forward to the leadership on both sides of the aisle coming \nforward with a program to do it. I hope we have a sense of urgency. \nThere is a saying from Tip O'Neill that ``all politics is local,'' but \nultimately, all homeland security is local.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate our Democrat colleagues \njoining us and proceeding to the House-passed bill. I have spoken to \nthe Democratic leader and my colleagues on the Republican side and \ncommit to offering an amendment to the House bill to fully fund the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, while addressing the President's \nExecutive actions on a separate adjacent track through consideration of \nthe Collins bill.\n  When the Senate proceeds to H.R. 240, I will offer a clean substitute \nand work to expedite consideration of the bill, as amended, to get it \nback over to the House this week. I would welcome bipartisan \ncooperation to pass the DHS funding bill as well as the commonsense \nCollins bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have had very good \ndiscussions in the last 24 hours or so. We have agreed that, in order \nto pass a clean Homeland Security appropriations bill for the remainder \nof this fiscal year, the Democrats will support getting on the House \nHomeland Security funding bill. In exchange, the majority leader will \nprovide that the only amendment will be a clean Homeland Security \nfunding substitute, which he just outlined. The substance of this \namendment is the same as the bill that was introduced by Senators \nMikulski and Shaheen about a month ago.\n  The Senate will adopt that amendment and send the amended bill to the \nHouse in an expedited fashion. The Senate will then vote on cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to the Collins bill.\n  Personally, I don't believe the Collins bill is a compromise. It \nwould undermine law enforcement and tear families apart. So until full-\nyear funding for the Homeland Security Department is enacted, I will \nvote against going to the Collins bill.\n  After a clean bill is signed into law, I will be happy to have a \nvigorous debate on immigration and the best way to fix our broken \nsystem.\n  I want to be very clear that Democrats would be willing to expedite \nthe plan we have before us by consent.\n  In conclusion, I thank the majority leader for working with Democrats \nto come to a solution of this impasse that we have been faced with for \nthe last 4 weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider vote No. 53, the vote by which cloture was not invoked on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 240.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the\n\n[[Page S1105]]\n\n     Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a \n     close debate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 240, making \n     appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015.\n         Mitch McConnell, Thad Cochran, Tom Cotton, Roger F. \n           Wicker, David Vitter, Jerry Moran, Daniel Coats, \n           Michael B.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 240, an act making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2015, and for other purposes, shall be brought to a close, upon \nreconsideration?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 98, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 58 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Alexander\n     Ayotte\n     Baldwin\n     Barrasso\n     Bennet\n     Blumenthal\n     Blunt\n     Booker\n     Boozman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Capito\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cassidy\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coons\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Cotton\n     Crapo\n     Cruz\n     Daines\n     Donnelly\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Ernst\n     Feinstein\n     Fischer\n     Flake\n     Franken\n     Gardner\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Heinrich\n     Heitkamp\n     Heller\n     Hirono\n     Hoeven\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kaine\n     King\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Lankford\n     Leahy\n     Lee\n     Manchin\n     Markey\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Moran\n     Murkowski\n     Murphy\n     Murray\n     Nelson\n     Paul\n     Perdue\n     Peters\n     Portman\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rounds\n     Rubio\n     Sanders\n     Sasse\n     Schatz\n     Schumer\n     Scott\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Stabenow\n     Sullivan\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Tillis\n     Toomey\n     Udall\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Warren\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Inhofe\n     Sessions\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). On this vote, the yeas are 98, \nthe nays are 2.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion, upon reconsideration, is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I just want to applaud the vote we just \nhad. A 98-to-2 vote shows very clearly that our colleagues in the \nSenate want to see funding for Homeland Security. Everybody understands \nthat the risks to this country are too great for us not to provide the \nresources the Department needs so they can continue to do their jobs.\n  We just heard that the Department of Homeland Security was involved \nwith the FBI in the case of three people in Brooklyn who were \nthreatening this country because they wanted to go to the Middle East \nand join ISIS. We need to make sure DHS has the funding they need. This \nis real progress. I applaud Senators McConnell and Reid for their \nefforts to get to this point.\n  I hope we can continue down this road to get funding for the \nDepartment, and that when we send the bill over to the House, the House \nwill also work together in a bipartisan way to get a clean funding bill \nbefore the resources run out, before the money runs out for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security this Friday. We have a little bit of \ntime. We need to get this done. The Senate took a giant step forward \ntoday to do that. I applaud my colleagues. I hope we can keep this \ngoing and that we can get this done very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Income Inequality\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I do not agree with Speaker of the House \nJohn Boehner on very much, but I do agree that it is an excellent idea \nfor there to be a joint session of Congress in the fall to hear from \nPope Francis. To my mind, in the last few years the Pope has played an \nextraordinary role in speaking out on issues of enormous consequence \nthat impact every man, woman, and child, not just in our country but on \nthe planet. He has shown great courage in raising issues that we very \nrarely discuss here in the Congress or in parliaments around the \ncountry.\n  What I want to do briefly this afternoon is quote and discuss some of \nthe statements that the Pope has made that I think we need to listen \nto. I think it is a wonderful idea that Speaker Boehner has invited the \nPope, but I think it is important we also listen to what he has said. \nThis is from Pope Francis.\n\n       We have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf \n     of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of \n     money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless \n     and lacking any truly humane goal.\n\n  On another occasion what he says is: ``Man is not in charge today, \nmoney is in charge, money rules.''\n  Then he says in another quote:\n\n       Today everything comes under the laws of competition and \n     the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the \n     powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves \n     excluded and marginalized: without work, without \n     possibilities, without any means of escape.\n\n  Then he says this on an issue that is, I think, very relevant to this \nbody:\n\n       In this context, some people continue to defend trickle-\n     down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged \n     by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about \n     greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, \n     which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a \n     crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding \n     economic power and in the sacralized workings of the \n     prevailing economic system.\n\n  Then he says:\n\n     . . . these things become the norm: that some homeless people \n     die of cold on the streets is not news. In contrast, a ten \n     point drop on the stock markets of some cities, is a tragedy.\n\n  In other words, when people die because they are poor and hungry and \ncold, that is not news. But a 10-point drop in the stock market becomes \na tragedy.\n  Then he says:\n\n       We must say ``we want a just system! A system that enables \n     everyone to get on''. We must say: ``we don't want this \n     globalized economic system which does us so much harm!''\n\n  Here we have the leader of the Catholic Church raising profound \nissues about the state of the economy--certainly not just to the United \nStates but all over the world. I don't want to paraphrase him, but my \ninterpretation of what he is saying is that money cannot be an end in \nitself. The function of an economic system is not just to let the \nmarketplace reign and end up in a situation where a small number of \npeople have incredible wealth while so many people have virtually \nnothing.\n  That is true not just of the United States, but it is even more true \naround the world. We have a situation right now--incredible as it may \nsound--where the wealthiest 85 people in the world own more wealth than \nthe bottom half of the world's population. So 85 phenomenally wealthy \nbillionaires are here, and half of the world's population are over \nhere--over 3 billion people. Does anybody in the wildest stretch of \ntheir imagination think this is anything close to a just world economic \nsystem?\n  Oxfam recently told us that within the global economy within a year \nor two, the top 1 percent of the world's wealthiest people will own \nmore wealth than the bottom 99 percent. What religion condones this \ntype of economic disparity? What political party should condone this \ntype of economic disparity?\n  What the Pope is essentially saying is we need to pay attention to \nthose people who are hurting--not just the homeless, not just the \nhungry, but those people who are working longer hours for low wages and \nat exactly the same time when in this country we have seen a \nproliferation of millionaires and billionaires. Is that what our \neconomy is supposed to be about?\n  Let me just amplify what the Pope was saying by giving you some cold \nstatistics in terms of what is going on in the United States of \nAmerica. I am not talking about the global economy. I am not talking \nabout Greece, where unemployment is 25 percent and where their economy \nhas contracted by a quarter in the last 6 years. I am talking about the \nAmerican economy.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n  Since 1999 the median middle-class family--that family right in the \nmiddle of the American economy--has seen its income go down by almost \n$5,000 after adjusting for inflation. Incredibly, that family earned \nless income last year than it did 26 years ago, back in 1989.\n  Do you want to know why people in America are angry? Whether they are \nin the Occupy Wall Street movement and consider themselves progressive, \nwhether they are in the tea party movement and consider themselves \nconservative, the median male worker--that man right in the middle of \nthe American economy--earned $783 less last year than he did 42 years \nago. In other words, you have seen an explosion of technological \nproductivity, but the male worker in the middle of the economy--\ninflation adjusted for dollars--made $783 less last year than he did 42 \nyears ago, while the median female worker--the woman in the middle of \nthe American economy--earned $1,300 less last year than she did in \n2007.\n  All over this country we are seeing men and women working longer \nhours for lower wages. We are seeing people working not one job but two \njobs or three jobs in order to cobble together the income they need and \nmaybe some health care as well. But while the middle class continues to \ndisappear on a 40-year trajectory, the wealthiest people and the \nlargest corporations are doing phenomenally well. The gap between the \nvery, very rich and everybody else is growing wider.\n  This is what the Pope means, I think, when he says this:\n\n       While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, \n     that of the majority is crumbling. This imbalance results \n     from ideologies which uphold the absolute autonomy of markets \n     and financial speculation, and thus deny the right of control \n     to States, which are themselves charged with providing for \n     the common good.\n\n  This is from Pope Francis. So what does he mean when he talks about \nthe income of a minority increasing exponentially while the majority is \ncrumbling? Let me give you some examples. I talked about male wages, \nfemale wages, and median family income. Let me talk about what is going \non in the top 1 percent.\n  Today the top 1 percent in America now own about 41 percent of the \nentire wealth of our country while the bottom 60 percent own less than \n2 percent. Let me repeat that. The top 1 percent own over 40 percent of \nthe wealth. The bottom 60 percent own less than 2 percent. Today, \nincredibly, the top one-tenth of 1 percent now own almost as much \nwealth as the bottom 90 percent--one-tenth of 1 percent. So 16,000 \nfamilies own almost as much wealth as the bottom 300 million people in \nour country. Today the Walton family--the owners of Walmart and the \nwealthiest family in America--is now worth $153 billion. That is more \nwealth in one family than the bottom 40 percent of Americans. Over the \npast decade, the net worth of the top 400 billionaires in this country \nhas doubled, up to an astronomical $1 trillion in just 10 years.\n  In terms of income as opposed to wealth, almost all of the new income \ngenerated in recent years, since the Wall Street crash, has gone to the \ntop 1 percent. In fact, the last information that we have indicates \nthat over 99 percent of all new income generated in this country goes \nto the top 1 percent.\n  The top 25 hedge fund managers on Wall Street made more than $24 \nbillion in 2013, equivalent to the full salaries of more than 425,000 \npublic school teachers. What we are seeing in this country is growing \nincome and wealth inequality. What we are seeing around the world is \nthe same.\n\n  What troubles me very much is that in the midst of a disappearing \nmiddle class, at a time when we have more people living in poverty \ntoday than at almost any time in recent history, I believe my \nRepublican colleagues on the Budget Committee will bring forth a budget \nin the next few years which will move us in exactly the wrong \ndirection. When the rich get richer, their proposal will be let's give \nmore tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires.\n  When large corporations are enjoying huge profits, and major \ncorporation after major corporation is paying nothing in Federal income \ntax, their proposal will be let's give more tax breaks to large \nmultinational corporations.\n  Then after giving tax breaks to the rich and large corporations, they \nsay: Well, we want a balanced budget, and the way we are going to \nbalance the budget is on the backs of a disappearing middle class, on \nthe backs of millions of working families, and on the backs of the \npoorest and most vulnerable people in this country.\n  This is the Robin Hood principle in reverse. This is taking from the \npoor and working people and giving it to the millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  I would hope the American people say: Enough is enough. We don't need \nmore tax breaks for the rich and large corporations. We don't need to \ncut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, nutrition programs \nfor hungry people, and Pell grants so the kids can go to college. That \nis not what we should be doing. In fact, we should be moving in exactly \nthe other direction.\n  From 1983 to a few years ago, what we have seen in this country is an \nincredible transfer of wealth from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 \npercent. We are talking about trillions of dollars in wealth going from \nthe bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent. Most Americans are saying: \nEnough is enough. We don't need more austerity for the middle class. We \ndon't need to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Maybe it is \ntime for some austerity for the top 1 percent.\n  I hope when we come together to discuss the budget, Members of the \nSenate will listen to what Pope Francis has been talking about and give \nus a budget which works for the most vulnerable people in this country, \nwhich works for tens of millions of working families, and does not \nsimply work for large campaign donors.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, somebody asked me a little while ago, \nshouldn't we be voting on the mishmash on Homeland Security that the \nHouse of Representatives sent over because of the immigration matters \nin it.\n  I reminded them that the Senate in the last Congress voted by a 2-to-\n1 margin, on a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill which we sent \nto the House of Representatives and the Speaker refused to bring the \nbill up. It probably would have passed.\n  Had it passed, it would have been signed into law and President Obama \nwould not have issued any Executive orders. There would be no need to. \nWe had everything from border security, which Republicans and Democrats \nvoted for, to minors and the DREAMers, which Republicans and Democrats \nvoted for.\n  In fact, we had hundreds of hours of hearings and markups. We had \naround 140 amendments that were brought up, and I would call for one \nRepublican amendment and one Democratic amendment. We went back and \nforth day after day, night after night. We did 140 or 141 amendments.\n  All but one of them passed by a bipartisan vote. We then had dozens \nof amendments on the floor, all of which passed with bipartisan votes. \nThe final bill got 68 votes.\n  We have done the work on immigration. Let's not play games and \nendanger the needed funding for the Department of Homeland Security at \na time when we face all kinds of dangers in this country. Let's not \nclose down Department of Homeland Security on a made-up mission of \ndoing something for immigration.\n  We passed an immigration bill. They could take out the draft of that \nold bill, vote it up, and vote it down. Sixty-eight Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, voted for it. Let's bring up something \nsimilar. Let's have a real debate. Let's have amendments. Let's go to \nimmigration. Then in the meantime, let's pass the Department of \nHomeland Security bill.\n  Millions upon millions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted even \ntoday as they prepare for a shutdown, not knowing whether these tactics \nare going to close down the Department, that major part of our \ngovernment, or not. They have to spend the money. That is money wasted, \nto say nothing about the job that's not being done.\n  I refer to my speech about Groundhog Day because we have seen this \none.\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\nOur friends across the way in the Capitol closed down the government \nbefore.\n  In just 2 days, unless Congress acts, the doors at the Department of \nHomeland Security, one of the country's primary national security \nagencies, will shutter. Unless we act, 30,000 workers will be \nfurloughed without pay. Another 130,000 will be asked to work in \ndefense of our nation's security, without pay.\n  This is another needless, made-in-Washington crisis. We find \nourselves here today because of the House's initial failure to act for \nmore than a year and a half on bipartisan legislation that the Senate \npassed to help fix our broken immigration system. The House's inaction \nforced the President to do what he could through the executive \nauthorities available to him. Those actions are welcomed. But they are \nnot permanent, legislative fixes. Now, because Republicans in the House \nare angry that the President acted where they would not, they are \nthreatening the functions of the very agency that helps protect our \nborders, our airspace, our waterways, and our communities.\n  Every State in this country will be affected by a shutdown of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. In the midst of a fiercely cold \nwinter, when the Northeast has been devastated by life-threatening \nstorms, we put at risk important recovery resources available through \nFEMA. We put at risk counterterrorism efforts and analysis of critical \nintelligence, as we continue to mount and improve our national security \nin the face of unprecedented violent threats from enemies overseas. It \nis appalling that in the face of reports that terrorists want to target \nsuch domestic sites as the Mall of America, some in Congress are \nplaying petty politics with the vital operations of the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  A short-term continuing resolution will not solve this problem. A \ncontinuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security \nrecognizes neither the evolving threats to our Nation's security, nor \nthe continuing stresses on our immigration system. A continuing \nresolution for the Department will tear immigrant families apart, \nrather than support keeping them together. A continuing resolution will \nnot support an increase of $400 million for the Department. It will \nfreeze FEMA resources at their current levels.\n  And let's remember one key fact that I do not hear these reckless \nvoices in Congress acknowledging: The funding bill we should be \nconsidering--the Shaheen-Mikulski bill--already is a compromise bill. \nIt is far from perfect. For example, I strongly oppose the new funding \nfor family detention. Incarcerating women and children fleeing violence \nruns contrary to our long history as a nation that offers refuge to \nthose most in need. Nonetheless I am prepared to support the bill, \nbecause it will help State and local communities with disaster \nrecovery, with law enforcement activities, and will support our \nnational security and counterterrorism efforts.\n  The Shaheen-Mikulski bill is the product of bipartisan negotiations \nbetween Republicans and Democrats in both the Senate and the House. But \nfor the President's executive actions in November, it would have been \nincluded in the omnibus spending bill that was signed into law last \nyear. Now we are on the brink of a potential shutdown of the Department \nof Homeland Security. This is a fabricated crisis. The solution is \nsimple. The Senate should approve the Shaheen-Mikulski bill, send it to \nthe House, and end this stalemate. The House should promptly consider \nthe bipartisan, comprehensive immigration legislation approved \noverwhelmingly by the Senate in 2013.\n  If there is another debate to be had about fixing our immigration \nsystem, let's have that debate. But let's stop holding the operations \nof one of the Nation's key national security agency captive, while \nasking tens of thousands of hardworking Americans--including more than \n2,500 Vermonters--to either work without pay or take an unpaid leave of \nabsence. This is not the way to run a country. Unlike in so many other \nquestions facing our country, the solution to this contrived disaster \nis easy. Members of Congress just need to have the courage to act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                Ukraine\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise once again in support of the \npeople of Ukraine in their struggle against Russian aggression. The \nmost recent diplomatic efforts seem to have only emboldened President \nPutin.\n  Since Minsk II, which is the last time they came to an agreement with \nreference to a ceasefire, there have been hundreds of ceasefire \nviolations and the city of Debaltseve has fallen under rebel control. \nPutin's forces now threaten Mariupol, which would provide a key land \nbridge to Crimea, and his intentions are clear.\n  In my view, we need to urgently increase the cost to Putin with \ntougher sanctions and by providing more security assistance to the \nUkrainian military.\n  At a press conference on February 9 with Chancellor Merkel, the \nPresident said that his team was considering options including the \nprovision of defensive military equipment if the diplomatic effort with \nrespect to Russia has failed.\n  As recent events have shown, Minsk II is clearly dead, and we need to \ntake a different approach.\n  At so many points in history, there have been opportunities for the \ninternational community to deter rogue actors from violating the \nsovereignty of other countries. Unless bullies such as Putin are \nconfronted, they will always bully, they will always force a response, \nand they will always be an even greater problem for their neighbors and \nthe broader international community.\n  Putin took Crimea, then he took Donetsk, then he took Luhansk, and \nlast week he took Debaltseve. While he has paid a price because of the \nsanctions regime, that price has not changed his behavior. So now is \nthe time to increase the cost to Putin. Now is the time to increase \nsanctions on Russia and work with Europe to consider additional \nsanctions in other sectors of the economy. Now is the time for the \nPresident to abide by his words on February 9--to provide badly needed \ndefensive weapons to the Ukrainian Government and to rethink our \nstrategic response to Russia's encroachment in Ukraine and across the \nformer Soviet territories.\n  The international community simply cannot remain passive in the face \nof such unbridled aggression that will only invite further aggression. \nSo I call upon the administration to fully implement measures this body \nauthorized when it passed the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, which the \nPresident signed into law on December 18.\n  Last month I wrote to Secretary Kerry in the wake of the bloodiest \nperiod since the start of this crisis. I urged the administration to \nfully implement the authorities provided in the law and to comply with \nthe clear reporting deadlines.\n  The legislation passed with unanimous consent in both Houses of \nCongress. It authorizes the President to provide much needed military \nand humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and it imposes additional sanctions \nagainst Russia in this time of crisis. The legislation was necessary in \nDecember, and it is even more necessary today.\n  We know the sanctions implemented by the United States and the \nEuropean Union have had a tangible effect on the Russian economy. \nCombined with the decrease in global energy markets, they have put \nunprecedented pressure on President Putin. But he is undeterred. He \ncontinues to provide illegitimate and illegal support to separatists in \neastern Ukraine, evidenced by OSCE and NATO reports cataloging the \ngrowing number of Russian troops and artillery that remain in the \nregion and as evidenced by the spiking violence by so-called Russian-\nbacked separatists against both military troops and civilians. Russian \ntroops and these so-called Russian-backed rebels have carried out \ndeadly attacks on civilians in eastern Ukraine. They have killed \nscores--they have killed women, they have killed children. They have \nignored Minsk I. They have ignored\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nMinsk II. And now they have gained control of Debaltseve and have made \nmoves towards Mariupol. This must end. The violence must end and the \nkilling must stop.\n\n  We must renew our commitment to the people of Ukraine and stand \nagainst Putin's blatant aggression. I appreciate the administration's \ncomprehensive efforts to counter Russian aggression, but I also believe \nit is not enough. We must act immediately to influence the course of \nevents on the ground and urge the President to fully implement the \nUkraine Freedom Support Act. The violence threatening Ukraine's \nterritorial integrity is threatening the region. The international \ncommunity has an obligation to respond to Putin's clear signals that \nhis intention is to escalate tensions in Ukraine and across the region.\n  Since Senator Corker and I, along with other committee members, \nintroduced the Ukraine Freedom Support Act, Putin has escalated his \nbelligerent and aggressive tactics. NATO has deployed more than 400 \ntimes last year to intercept Russian military flights near members' \nEuropean airspace.\n  In July of 2014, Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko was captured by \nRussian forces and is being illegally detained in Russia despite \nRussia's commitment to Minsk to free her.\n  In September of last year, Russians abducted the Estonian security \nservice officer Eston Kohver from Estonian territory. He was taken from \nEstonian territory to Moscow where he has been languishing in prison \nwithout due process.\n  In October, Sweden's military discovered what it believed was a \nRussian submarine outside of Stockholm. In December, about a dozen \nRussian aircraft, including bombers, flew into the Baltic Sea region. \nIn January, attacks on civilian buses took the lives of 20 Ukrainians. \nIt is time for the international community to say enough is enough.\n  Fully implementing the sanctions and assistance in the Ukraine \nFreedom Support Act will help restore its sovereignty, it will help \nrestore its territorial integrity, and it will help deter Russia from \nfurther destabilizing the region.\n  I urge the President to implement these measures immediately, without \ndelay. That said, I understand there are individuals on the European \nUnion and Canadian targeted sanctions list who do not appear on the \nAmerican list of sanctions. Now why is this the case?\n  Perhaps the most egregious example is Alexander Bortnikov, the head \nof the Russian FSB. Mr. Bortnikov is not on the U.S. lists in relation \nto either Ukraine or the Magnitsky act, but he is on the European Union \nand Canadian lists. To make matters worse, Mr. Bortnikov was here in \nthe United States last week for President Obama's CVE conference. To \nsay that I am puzzled would be an understatement.\n  The fact is there are almost 150 individuals and entities on the \nCanadian and EU sanctions lists that are not on the U.S. lists. If \nthere is no justifiable reason for excluding these individuals, then \nthey should be added.\n  Yesterday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary \nKerry indicated that these lists will be synced, harmonized, in the \ncoming days, and I will keep a close eye on this process. Clearly, for \nthe international effort to be effective, we need to be in lockstep \nwith our Canadian and European allies. When we passed this legislation \nlast December, it coincided with a Wall Street Journal report about the \nfortune that Russians were spending to lobby Washington against passing \nthat very bill. They claimed the sanctions would affect the West's \nwillingness to invest in Russia, and I say that is exactly what these \nsanctions should do.\n  Putin is using his military power to impose his will in Ukraine, but \nhe is also using every economic tool at his disposal, and we must do \nthe same. We must make it clear to Mr. Putin that there will be \nconsequences for his actions.\n  This is not only obviously important in the context of Ukraine, which \nit certainly is in the first instance, but it is also about sending a \nvery clear global message that if you violate and upend the \ninternational order, there will be consequences for doing so. Because \nin the absence of real consequences to doing so, there are other actors \nin the world who are looking at what is happening in Ukraine who will \nsay, well, what did the United States, what did the West do to stop the \naggression of Russia? And if the answer is not very much, at the end of \nthe day--certainly not enough to stop that aggression--then other \nactors in the world who may be more powerful than their neighbors, who \nmay have nuclear weapons in their possession, such as North Korea, will \nthink about what they want to do. And whether that is China in the \nSouth China Sea which has had territorial disputes with our allies \nSouth Korea and Japan, or whether it is the challenge we have in North \nKorea of a nuclear armed North Korea, whether it is Maduro in Venezuela \noppressing his people--I can go through a list of global actors who \nwill wonder that if, at the end of the day, there isn't much \nconsequence for violating the international order, then I will do what \nI wish to do because I have the power to do it without consequences. \nThat is an incredibly risky world to live in.\n  So I urge the President to implement our bill now. The military \nsituation on the ground is clear. The Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, NATO, the Ukrainian National Security Defense \nCouncil, have all reported on the presence of Russian military convoys \nand troops in eastern Ukraine.\n  As a matter of fact, I was there last year in the midst of the \ninvasion--and I call it an invasion, because last time I checked, where \nI come from, if you have Russian troops crossing from Russia into \nanother sovereign country, if you have surface-to-surface missiles, if \nyou have armored vehicles and tanks and all of them are crossing \nwithout provocation, then you clearly have an invasion--and that has \nonly mounted. You can take a soldier and take his Russian insignia off \nand put something else on, but they are still Russian soldiers coming \ninto Ukraine from Russia.\n  Fear is mounting in Mariupol that pro-Russian rebels with Russian \nsupport will conduct further attacks to ease land access to Crimea from \nRussia. If Russia gets its land access to Crimea, despite all of our \ntalk that we will not forget that Crimea was taken by force illegally \nin violation of international law, Crimea is gone. If Russia continues \ndown this path, its illegal occupation will be solidified and Putin \nclearly intends to continue to play his game.\n  Prior to Minsk II, Oleksandr Zakharchenko, the head of the \nseparatists in Donetsk, said ``there will be no ceasefires'' and that \nthe separatists will not stop their attacks until they have ``reached \nthe borders of the former Donetsk region.''\n  He has stayed true to his word. There are no more ceasefires. He \nissued an order to ``take no prisoners,'' claiming that the separatists \nwere no longer interested in prisoner swaps.\n  So I say to my colleagues, the situation is dire and it is becoming \nincreasingly clear we are not doing enough to change it. We must raise \nthe costs to Putin and his cronies by providing Ukraine with the \nassistance it needs to defend itself. The world is watching and waiting \nand the time is now. The Ukraine Freedom Support Act explicitly \nauthorizes the provision of defensive military assistance. Let's \nprovide it.\n  We have sent over night vision goggles, and I guess those are great \nto see the enemy, but if they can't stop the enemy, what good is that? \nWhat good is that?\n  Let's provide anti-tank and anti-armor weapons, crew weapons, and \nammunition. Let's provide counterartillery radar to identify and target \nartillery batteries, fire control, range finder, and optical and \nguidance control equipment. Let's provide tactical troop-operated \nsurveillance drones and secure command and communications equipment.\n  The administration was required to report to Congress on February 15 \nregarding its plan for increasing military assistance to the Government \nof Ukraine. Ten days later, we are still waiting on this report. I urge \nthe President to impose the more stringent sanctions on Russia's \ndefense and energy sectors that we outlined in the law. I urge him to \nenact further sanctions on Rosoboronexport and other Russian defense \nfirms that we know contribute to the instability in Ukraine, Moldova, \nGeorgia, and Syria. These firms outfit pro-Russian rebels and Russian \ntroops who have invaded\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\neastern Ukraine and established illegitimate republics recognized by no \none but President Putin. It is time to enact those sanctions. It is \ntime that we put an end to the chaos and violence these firms spread \naround the world. It is time to impose additional targeted sanctions on \nthe Russian energy sector to add to existing sanctions that are already \ncosting the Russian economy about $140 billion a year, or about 7 \npercent of its economy.\n  By imposing the energy sanctions called for in the act, the \nadministration will tighten restrictions on shale deposits, arctic \ndrilling, and offshore drilling.\n  The Ukraine Freedom Support Act calls for the administration to \nimpose sanctions on other defense industry targets as well as on \nspecial Russian crude oil projects by January 31. We are still waiting \nto see the administration's response.\n  On September 18, Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, \naddressed a joint session of Congress. We applauded his message of \nsolidarity. Now it is time to move past the applause. Now is the time \nto stand together in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. President \nPoroshenko asked for defensive arms, he asked us for aid, and he asked \nus for tougher sanctions on Russia. We all want a diplomatic solution \nto this problem, but I believe this can only come about when Putin \nbelieves the cost of continuing to ravage Ukraine is simply too high. \nWe have a responsibility to increase that cost.\n  I ask the President to heed our call and to fully exercise the \nauthority granted by the Ukraine Freedom Support Act and to do it now.\n  If we do that, not only do we save a key country that is presently \nbleeding--the eastern part of Ukraine is one of the most productive \nparts of the country. It is tough to keep providing financial support \nto it when it cannot openly stabilize itself because of the violence \nand the economic bleeding that goes on by virtue of the war in the \nEast. This is about a country that is looking westward toward \ndemocracy, toward the European Union. We should be helping countries \nthat want to make that decision and have made that decision by \nthemselves be able to achieve their sovereign right to do so. We should \nbe sending a clear international message about not violating the \ninternational order, and we should be sending a clear and powerful \nmessage that when you do, there are repercussions.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1109-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMORNING BUSINESS\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1109-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

No confirmation hearing shall be held sooner than \n     seven days after receipt of the background and financial \n     disclosure statement unless the time limit is waived by a \n     majority vote of the Committee.\n       5.5. The Committee vote on the confirmation shall not be \n     sooner than 48 hours after the Committee has received \n     transcripts of the confirmation hearing unless the time limit \n     is waived by unanimous consent of the Committee.\n       5.6. No nomination shall be reported to the Senate unless \n     the nominee has filed a background and financial disclosure \n     statement with the Committee.\n\n                         Rule 6. Investigations\n\n       No investigation shall be initiated by the Committee unless \n     at least five members of the Committee have specifically \n     requested the Chairman or the Vice Chairman to authorize such \n     an investigation. Authorized investigations may be conducted \n     by members of the Committee and/or designated Committee staff \n     members.\n\n                           Rule 7. Subpoenas\n\n       Subpoenas authorized by the Committee for the attendance of \n     witnesses or the production of memoranda, documents, records, \n     or any other material may be issued by the Chairman, the Vice \n     Chairman, or any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman, and may be served by any person designated by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman or member issuing the subpoenas. Each \n     subpoena shall have attached thereto a copy of S. Res. 400 of \n     the 94th Congress, and a copy of these rules.\n\n         Rule 8. Procedures Related to the Taking of Testimony\n\n       8.1. Notice.--Witnesses required to appear before the \n     Committee shall be given reasonable notice and all witnesses \n     shall be furnished a copy of these Rules.\n       8.2. Oath or Affirmation.--At the direction of the Chairman \n     or Vice Chairman, testimony of witnesses shall be given under \n     oath or affirmation which may be administered by any member \n     of the Committee.\n       8.3. Interrogation.--Committee interrogation shall be \n     conducted by members of the Committee and such Committee \n     staff as are authorized by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or \n     the presiding member.\n       8.4. Counsel for the Witness.--(a) Any witness may be \n     accompanied by counsel. A witness who is unable to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee of such fact. If the witness \n     informs the Committee of this fact at least 24 hours prior to \n     his or her appearance before the Committee, the Committee \n     shall then endeavor to obtain voluntary counsel for the \n     witness. Failure to obtain such counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       (b) Counsel shall conduct themselves in an ethical and \n     professional manner. Failure to do so shall, upon a finding \n     to that effect by a majority of the members present, subject \n     such counsel to disciplinary action which may include \n     warning, censure, removal, or a recommendation of contempt \n     proceedings.\n       (c) There shall be no direct or cross-examination by \n     counsel. However, counsel may submit any question in writing \n     to the Committee and request the Committee to propound such \n     question to the counsel's client or to any other witness. The \n     counsel also may suggest the presentation of other evidence \n     or the calling of other witnesses. The Committee may use or \n     dispose of such questions or suggestions as it deems \n     appropriate.\n       8.5. Statements by Witnesses.--Witnesses may make brief and \n     relevant statements at the beginning and conclusion of their \n     testimony. Such statements shall not exceed a reasonable \n     period of time as determined by the Chairman, or other \n     presiding members. Any witness required or desiring to make a \n     prepared or written statement for the record of the \n     proceedings shall file a paper and electronic copy with the \n     Clerk of the Committee, and insofar as practicable and \n     consistent with the notice given, shall do so at least 48 \n     hours in advance of his or her appearance before the \n     Committee.\n       8.6. Objections and Rulings.--Any objection raised by a \n     witness or counsel shall be ruled upon by the Chairman or \n     other presiding member, and such ruling shall be the ruling \n     of the Committee unless a majority of the Committee present \n     overrules the ruling of the chair.\n       8.7. Inspection and Correction.--All witnesses testifying \n     before the Committee shall be given a reasonable opportunity \n     to inspect, in the office of the Committee, the transcript of \n     their testimony to determine whether such testimony was \n     correctly transcribed. The witness may be accompanied by \n     counsel. Any corrections the witness desires to make in the \n     transcript shall be submitted in writing to the Committee \n     within five days from the date when the transcript was made \n     available to the witness. Corrections shall be limited to \n     grammar and minor editing, and may not be made to change the \n     substance of the testimony. Any questions arising with \n     respect to such corrections shall be decided by the Chairman. \n     Upon request, the Committee may provide to a witness those \n     parts of testimony given by that witness in executive session \n     which are subsequently quoted or made part of a public \n     record, at the expense of the witness.\n       8.8. Requests to Testify.--The Committee will consider \n     requests to testify on any matter or measure pending before \n     the Committee. A person who believes that testimony or other \n     evidence presented at a public hearing, or any comment made \n     by a Committee member or a member of the Committee staff, may \n     tend to affect adversely that person's reputation, may \n     request to appear personally before the Committee to testify \n     or may file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony, evidence, or comment, or may submit to the \n     Chairman proposed questions in writing for the cross-\n     examination of other witnesses. The Committee shall take such \n     action as it deems appropriate.\n       8.9. Contempt Procedures.--No recommendation that a person \n     be cited for contempt of Congress or that a subpoena be \n     otherwise enforced shall be forwarded to the Senate unless \n     and until the Committee has, upon notice to all its members, \n     met and considered the recommendation, afforded the person an \n     opportunity to oppose such contempt or subpoena enforcement \n     proceeding either in writing or in person, and agreed by \n     majority vote of the Committee to forward such recommendation \n     to the Senate.\n       8.10. Release of Name of Witness.--Unless authorized by the \n     Chairman, the name of any witness scheduled to be heard by \n     the Committee shall not be released prior to, or after, \n     appearing before the Committee. Upon authorization by the \n     Chairman to release the name of a witness under this \n     paragraph, the Vice Chairman shall be notified of such \n     authorization as soon as practicable thereafter. No name of \n     any witness shall be released if such release would disclose \n     classified information, unless authorized under Section 8 of \n     S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress or Rule 9.7.\n\n   Rule 9. Procedures for Handling Classified or Committee Sensitive \n                                Material\n\n       9.1. Committee staff offices shall operate under strict \n     precautions. At least one United States Capitol Police \n     Officer shall be on duty at all times at the entrance of the \n     Committee to control entry. Before entering the\n\n[[Page S1111]]\n\n     Committee office space all persons shall identify themselves \n     and provide identification as requested.\n       9.2. Classified documents and material shall be stored in \n     authorized security containers located within the Committee's \n     Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Copying, \n     duplicating, or removing from the Committee offices of such \n     documents and other materials is prohibited except as is \n     necessary for the conduct of Committee business, and in \n     conformity with Rule 10.3 hereof. All classified documents or \n     materials removed from the Committee offices for such \n     authorized purposes must be returned to the Committee's SCIF \n     for overnight storage.\n       9.3. ``Committee sensitive'' means information or material \n     that pertains to the confidential business or proceedings of \n     the Select Committee on Intelligence, within the meaning of \n     paragraph 5 of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     and is: (1) in the possession or under the control of the \n     Committee; (2) discussed or presented in an executive session \n     of the Committee; (3) the work product of a Committee member \n     or staff member; (4) properly identified or marked by a \n     Committee member or staff member who authored the document; \n     or (5) designated as such by the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     (or by the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting \n     on their behalf). Committee sensitive documents and materials \n     that are classified shall be handled in the same manner as \n     classified documents and material in Rule 9.2. Unclassified \n     committee sensitive documents and materials shall be stored \n     in a manner to protect against unauthorized disclosure.\n       9.4. Each member of the Committee shall at all times have \n     access to all papers and other material received from any \n     source. The Staff Director shall be responsible for the \n     maintenance, under appropriate security procedures, of a \n     document control and accountability registry which will \n     number and identify all classified papers and other \n     classified materials in the possession of the Committee, and \n     such registry shall be available to any member of the \n     Committee.\n       9.5. Whenever the Select Committee on Intelligence makes \n     classified material available to any other committee of the \n     Senate or to any member of the Senate not a member of the \n     Committee, such material shall be accompanied by a verbal or \n     written notice to the recipients advising of their \n     responsibility to protect such materials pursuant to section \n     8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. The Security Director \n     of the Committee shall ensure that such notice is provided \n     and shall maintain a written record identifying the \n     particular information transmitted and the committee or \n     members of the Senate receiving such information.\n       9.6. Access to classified information supplied to the \n     Committee shall be limited to those Committee staff members \n     with appropriate security clearance and a need-to-know, as \n     determined by the Committee, and, under the Committee's \n     direction, the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director.\n       9.7. No member of the Committee or of the Committee staff \n     shall disclose, in whole or in part or by way of summary, the \n     contents of any classified or committee sensitive papers, \n     materials, briefings, testimony, or other information in the \n     possession of the Committee to any other person, except as \n     specified in this rule. Committee members and staff do not \n     need prior approval to disclose classified or committee \n     sensitive information to persons in the Executive branch, the \n     members and staff of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, and the members and staff of the Senate, \n     provided that the following conditions are met: (1) for \n     classified information, the recipients of the information \n     must possess appropriate security clearances (or have access \n     to the information by virtue of their office); (2) for all \n     information, the recipients of the information must have a \n     need-to-know such information for an official governmental \n     purpose; and (3) for all information, the Committee members \n     and staff who provide the information must be engaged in the \n     routine performance of Committee legislative or oversight \n     duties. Otherwise, classified and committee sensitive \n     information may only be disclosed to persons outside the \n     Committee (to include any congressional committee, Member of \n     Congress, congressional staff, or specified non-governmental \n     persons who support intelligence activities) with the prior \n     approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, \n     or the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director acting on \n     their behalf, consistent with the requirements that \n     classified information may only be disclosed to persons with \n     appropriate security clearances and a need-to-know such \n     information for an official governmental purpose. Public \n     disclosure of classified information in the possession of the \n     Committee may only be authorized in accordance with Section 8 \n     of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       9.8. Failure to abide by Rule 9.7 shall constitute grounds \n     for referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress. Prior to a \n     referral to the Select Committee on Ethics pursuant to \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400, the Chairman and Vice Chairman \n     shall notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader.\n       9.9. Before the Committee makes any decision regarding the \n     disposition of any testimony, papers, or other materials \n     presented to it, the Committee members shall have a \n     reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony, \n     papers, and other materials that have been obtained by the \n     members of the Committee or the Committee staff.\n       9.10. Attendance of persons outside the Committee at closed \n     meetings of the Committee shall be kept at a minimum and \n     shall be limited to persons with appropriate security \n     clearance and a need-to-know the information under \n     consideration for the execution of their official duties. The \n     Security Director of the Committee may require that notes \n     taken at such meetings by any person in attendance shall be \n     returned to the secure storage area in the Committee's \n     offices at the conclusion of such meetings, and may be made \n     available to the department, agency, office, committee, or \n     entity concerned only in accordance with the security \n     procedures of the Committee.\n\n                             Rule 10. Staff\n\n       10.1. For purposes of these rules, Committee staff includes \n     employees of the Committee, consultants to the Committee, or \n     any other person engaged by contract or otherwise to perform \n     services for or at the request of the Committee. To the \n     maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall rely on its \n     full-time employees to perform all staff functions. No \n     individual may be retained as staff of the Committee or to \n     perform services for the Committee unless that individual \n     holds appropriate security clearances.\n       10.2. The appointment of Committee staff shall be approved \n     by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or, at the \n     initiative of both or either be confirmed by a majority vote \n     of the Committee. After approval or confirmation, the \n     Chairman shall certify Committee staff appointments to the \n     Financial Clerk of the Senate in writing. No Committee staff \n     shall be given access to any classified information or \n     regular access to the Committee offices until such Committee \n     staff has received an appropriate security clearance as \n     described in Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress.\n       10.3. The Committee staff works for the Committee as a \n     whole, under the supervision of the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee. The duties of the Committee staff \n     shall be performed, and Committee staff personnel affairs and \n     day-to-day operations, including security and control of \n     classified documents and material, shall be administered \n     under the direct supervision and control of the Staff \n     Director. All Committee staff shall work exclusively on \n     intelligence oversight issues for the Committee. The Minority \n     Staff Director and the Minority Counsel shall be kept fully \n     informed regarding all matters and shall have access to all \n     material in the files of the Committee.\n       10.4. The Committee staff shall assist the minority as \n     fully as the majority in the expression of minority views, \n     including assistance in the preparation and filing of \n     additional, separate, and minority views, to the end that all \n     points of view may be fully considered by the Committee and \n     the Senate.\n       10.5. The members of the Committee staff shall not discuss \n     either the substance or procedure of the work of the \n     Committee with any person not a member of the Committee or \n     the Committee staff for any purpose or in connection with any \n     proceeding, judicial or otherwise, either during their tenure \n     as a member of the Committee staff or at any time thereafter, \n     except as directed by the Committee in accordance with \n     Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules, or in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such a manner as may be determined by \n     the Senate. The Chairman may authorize the Staff Director and \n     the Staff Director's designee, and the Vice Chairman may \n     authorize the Minority Staff Director and the Minority Staff \n     Director's designee, to communicate with the media in a \n     manner that does not divulge classified or committee \n     sensitive information.\n       10.6. No member of the Committee staff shall be employed by \n     the Committee unless and until such a member of the Committee \n     staff agrees in writing, as a condition of employment, to \n     abide by the conditions of the nondisclosure agreement \n     promulgated by the Select Committee on Intelligence, pursuant \n     to Section 6 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress, and to \n     abide by the Committee's code of conduct.\n       10.7. As a precondition for employment on the Committee \n     staff, each member of the Committee staff must agree in \n     writing to notify the Committee of any request for testimony, \n     either during service as a member of the Committee staff or \n     at any time thereafter with respect to information obtained \n     by virtue of employment as a member of the Committee staff. \n     Such information shall not be disclosed in response to such \n     requests except as directed by the Committee in accordance \n     with Section 8 of S. Res. 400 of the 94th Congress and the \n     provisions of these rules or, in the event of the termination \n     of the Committee, in such manner as may be determined by the \n     Senate.\n       10.8. The Committee shall immediately consider action to be \n     taken in the case of any member of the Committee staff who \n     fails to conform to any of these Rules. Such disciplinary \n     action may include, but shall not be limited to, immediate \n     dismissal from the Committee staff.\n       10.9. Within the Committee staff shall be an element with \n     the capability to perform audits of programs and activities \n     undertaken by departments and agencies with intelligence \n     functions. The audit element shall conduct audits and \n     oversight projects that have been specifically authorized by \n     the\n\n[[Page S1112]]\n\n     Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly \n     through the Staff Director and Minority Staff Director. Staff \n     shall be assigned to such element jointly by the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, and staff with the principal responsibility \n     for the conduct of an audit shall be qualified by training or \n     experience in accordance with accepted auditing standards.\n       10.10. The workplace of the Committee shall be free from \n     illegal use, possession, sale, or distribution of controlled \n     substances by its employees. Any violation of such policy by \n     any member of the Committee staff shall be grounds for \n     termination of employment. Further, any illegal use of \n     controlled substances by a member of the Committee staff, \n     within the workplace or otherwise, shall result in \n     reconsideration of the security clearance of any such staff \n     member and may constitute grounds for termination of \n     employment with the Committee.\n       10.11. All personnel actions affecting the staff of the \n     Committee shall be made free from any discrimination based on \n     race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, handicap, \n     or disability.\n\n              Rule 11. Preparation for Committee Meetings\n\n       11.1. Under direction of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman \n     designated Committee staff members shall brief members of the \n     Committee at a time sufficiently prior to any Committee \n     meeting to assist the Committee members in preparation for \n     such meeting and to determine any matter which the Committee \n     member might wish considered during the meeting. Such \n     briefing shall, at the request of a member, include a list of \n     all pertinent papers and other materials that have been \n     obtained by the Committee that bear on matters to be \n     considered at the meeting.\n       11.2. The Staff Director and/or Minority Staff Director \n     shall recommend to the Chairman and the Vice Chairman the \n     testimony, papers, and other materials to be presented to the \n     Committee at any meeting. The determination whether such \n     testimony, papers, and other materials shall be presented in \n     open or executive session shall be made pursuant to the Rules \n     of the Senate and Rules of the Committee.\n       11.3. The Staff Director shall ensure that covert action \n     programs of the U.S. Government receive appropriate \n     consideration by the Committee no less frequently than once a \n     quarter.\n\n                     Rule 12. Legislative Calendar\n\n       12.1. The Clerk of the Committee shall maintain a printed \n     calendar for the information of each Committee member showing \n     the measures introduced and referred to the Committee and the \n     status of such measures; nominations referred to the \n     Committee and their status; and such other matters as the \n     Committee determines shall be included. The Calendar shall be \n     revised from time to time to show pertinent changes. A copy \n     of each such revision shall be furnished to each member of \n     the Committee.\n       12.2. Measures referred to the Committee may be referred by \n     the Chairman and/or Vice Chairman to the appropriate \n     department or agency of the Government for reports thereon.\n\n                       Rule 13.

No member of the Committee staff shall travel within \n     this country on Committee business unless specifically \n     authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n\n                       Rule 14. Changes in Rules\n\n       These Rules may be modified, amended, or repealed by the \n     Committee, provided that a notice in writing of the proposed \n     change has been given to each member at least 48 hours prior \n     to the meeting at which action thereon is to be taken.\n\n                               APPENDIX A\n\n              S.

An unclassified version of \n     each report may be made available to the public at the \n     discretion of the select committee. Nothing herein shall be \n     construed as requiring the public disclosure in such reports \n     of the names of individuals engaged in intelligence \n     activities for the United States or the divulging of \n     intelligence methods employed or the sources of information \n     on which such reports are based or the amount of funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for intelligence activities.\n       (c) On or before March 15 of each year, the select \n     committee shall submit to the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate the views and estimates described in section 301(c) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 regarding matters \n     within the jurisdiction of the select committee.\n       Sec. 5.

No employee of the select committee or any person \n     engaged by contract or otherwise to perform services for or \n     at the request of such committee shall be given access to any \n     classified information by such committee unless such employee \n     or person has (1) agreed in writing and under oath to be \n     bound by the rules of the Senate (including the jurisdiction \n     of the Select Committee on Ethics) and of such committee as \n     to the security of such information during and after the \n     period of his employment or contractual agreement with such \n     committee; and (2) received an appropriate security clearance \n     as determined by such committee in consultation with the \n     Director of National Intelligence. The type of security \n     clearance to be required in the case of any such employee or \n     person shall, within the determination of such committee in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, be \n     commensurate with the sensitivity of the classified \n     information to which such employee or person will be given \n     access by such committee.\n       Sec. 7. The select committee shall formulate and carry out \n     such rules and procedures as it deems necessary to prevent \n     the disclosure, without the consent of the person or persons \n     concerned, of information in the possession of such committee \n     which unduly infringes upon the privacy or which violates the \n     constitutional rights of such person or persons. Nothing \n     herein shall be construed to prevent such committee from \n     publicly disclosing any such information in any case in which \n     such committee determines the national interest in the \n     disclosure of such information clearly outweighs any \n     infringement on the privacy of any person or persons.\n       Sec. 8. (a) The select committee may, subject to the \n     provisions of this section, disclose publicly any information \n     in the possession of such committee after a determination by \n     such committee that the public interest would be served by \n     such disclosure. Whenever committee action is required to \n     disclose any information under this section, the committee \n     shall meet to vote on the matter within five days after any \n     member of the committee requests such a vote. No member of \n     the select committee shall disclose any information, the \n     disclosure of which requires a committee vote, prior to a \n     vote by the committee on the question of the disclosure of \n     such information or after such vote except in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (b)(1) In any case in which the select committee votes to \n     disclose publicly any information which has been classified \n     under established security procedures, which has been \n     submitted to it by the Executive branch, and which the \n     Executive branch requests be kept secret, such committee \n     shall--\n       (A) first, notify the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the Senate of such vote; and\n       (B) second, consult with the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader before notifying the President of such vote.\n       (2) The select committee may disclose publicly such \n     information after the expiration of a five-day period \n     following the day on which notice of such vote is transmitted \n     to the Majority Leader and the Minority Leader and the \n     President, unless, prior to the expiration of such five-day \n     period, the President, personally in writing, notifies the \n     committee that he objects to the disclosure of such \n     information, provides his reasons therefore, and certifies \n     that the threat to the national interest of the United States \n     posed by such disclosure is of such gravity that it outweighs \n     any public interest in the disclosure.\n       (3) If the President, personally, in writing, notifies the \n     Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the Senate and the \n     select Committee of his objections to the disclosure of such \n     information as provided in paragraph (2), the Majority Leader \n     and Minority Leader jointly or the select Committee, by \n     majority vote, may refer the question of the disclosure of \n     such information to the Senate for consideration.\n       (4) Whenever the select committee votes to refer the \n     question of disclosure of any information to the Senate under \n     paragraph (3), the Chairman shall not later than the first \n     day on which the Senate is in session following the day on \n     which the vote occurs, report the matter to the Senate for \n     its consideration.\n       (5) One hour after the Senate convenes on the fourth day on \n     which the Senate is in session following the day on which any \n     such matter is reported to the Senate, or at such earlier \n     time as the majority leader and the minority leader of the \n     Senate jointly agree upon in accordance with paragraph 5 of \n     rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the Senate \n     shall go into closed session and the matter shall be the \n     pending business. In considering the matter in closed session \n     the Senate may--\n       (A) approve the public disclosure of all or any portion of \n     the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall publicly disclose the information ordered to be \n     disclosed,\n       (B) disapprove the public disclosure of all or any portion \n     of the information in question, in which case the committee \n     shall not publicly disclose the information ordered not to be \n     disclosed, or\n       (C) refer all or any portion of the matter back to the \n     committee, in which case the committee shall make the final \n     determination with respect to the public disclosure of the \n     information in question.\n       Upon conclusion of the consideration of such matter in \n     closed session, which may not extend beyond the close of the \n     ninth day on which the Senate is in session following the day \n     on which such matter was reported to the Senate, or the close \n     of the fifth day following the day agreed upon jointly by the \n     majority and minority leaders in accordance with paragraph 5 \n     of rule XVII of the Standing Rules of the Senate (whichever \n     the case\n\n[[Page S1114]]\n\n     may be), the Senate shall immediately vote on the disposition \n     of such matter in open session, without debate, and without \n     divulging the information with respect to which the vote is \n     being taken. The Senate shall vote to dispose of such matter \n     by one or more of the means specified in clauses (A), (B), \n     and (C) of the second sentence of this paragraph. Any vote of \n     the Senate to disclose any information pursuant to this \n     paragraph shall be subject to the right of a Member of the \n     Senate to move for reconsideration of the vote within the \n     time and pursuant to the procedures specified in rule XIII of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, and the disclosure of such \n     information shall be made consistent with that right.\n       (c)(1) No information in the possession of the select \n     committee relating to the lawful intelligence activities of \n     any department or agency of the United States which has been \n     classified under established security procedures and which \n     the select committee, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of \n     this section, has determined should not be disclosed shall be \n     made available to any person by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate except in a closed session of the \n     Senate or as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (2) The select committee may, under such regulations as the \n     committee shall prescribe to protect the confidentiality of \n     such information, make any information described in paragraph \n     (1) available to any other committee or any other Member of \n     the Senate. Whenever the select committee makes such \n     information available, the committee shall keep a written \n     record showing, in the case of any particular information, \n     which committee or which Members of the Senate received such \n     information. No Member of the Senate who, and no committee \n     which, receives any information under this subsection, shall \n     disclose such information except in a closed session of the \n     Senate.\n       (d) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee on Ethics \n     to investigate any unauthorized disclosure of intelligence \n     information by a Member, officer or employee of the Senate in \n     violation of subsection (c) and to report to the Senate \n     concerning any allegation which it finds to be substantiated.\n       (e) Upon the request of any person who is subject to any \n     such investigation, the Select Committee on Ethics shall \n     release to such individual at the conclusion of its \n     investigation a summary of its investigation together with \n     its findings. If, at the conclusion of its investigation, the \n     Select Committee on Ethics determines that there has been a \n     significant breach of confidentiality or unauthorized \n     disclosure by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, \n     it shall report its findings to the Senate and recommend \n     appropriate action such as censure, removal from committee \n     membership, or expulsion from the Senate, in the case of a \n     Member, or removal from office or employment or punishment \n     for contempt, in the case of an officer or employee.\n       Sec. 9. The select committee is authorized to permit any \n     personal representative of the President, designated by the \n     President to serve as a liaison to such committee, to attend \n     any closed meeting of such committee.\n       Sec. 10.

Mr. President, I wish to honor the oldest \nVeterans of Foreign War post in Arkansas. VFW Post No. 1322 in Van \nBuren, AR is celebrating its 90th anniversary.\n  Founded February 13, 1925, the post was named in honor of Robert W. \nJack--the first casualty of World War I from Crawford County. Robert \nJack was 23-years-old when he was killed by shrapnel on September 22, \n1918, in the fourth day of the famous allied drive of St. Mihiel.\n\n[[Page S1116]]\n\n  As a member on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I understand the \nimportance of acknowledging the bravery and valor of the young men and \nwomen who fought in defense of our country. Men like Robert Jack, and \nmembers of VFW Post 1322, set their personal lives aside to fight for \nour country. This post recognizes their service, sacrifice and courage.\n  Members are dedicated to improving the community and the lives of its \nmembers; offering scholarships to students, teaching flag etiquette to \nclasses, providing local transportation for veterans and hosting \ncommunity events.\n  As the Robert Jack VFW Post 1322 proudly celebrates its 90th \nanniversary, the building is also celebrating the 65th anniversary of \nits groundbreaking. In recent years, the building was in desperate need \nof maintenance. Members banded together and worked with local \norganizations and businesses to provide funds for extensive repairs. \nThis is a true testament to the importance of Post 1322 in the \ncommunity.\n  I congratulate VFW Post 1322 on its 90th anniversary. I wish members \nthe best of luck and many more years of camaraderie, service and \ninvestment in the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1116-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JAMES KOLLER\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to remember Mr. James Koller, \na devoted father, husband and Pennsylvania leader. Jim passed away on \nFebruary 3, 2015, after a 6-year battle with ALS.\n  Jim's life was defined by his many passions. A successful lawyer and \nbusinessman, he was also deeply engaged with his community. A graduate \nof Marquette University and the Dickinson School of Law, he practiced \nreal estate law in Philadelphia before cofounding Vesterra Corporation, \na commercial real estate development company through which Jim built \nmany strong community relationships. Alongside his professional \nsuccess, Jim maintained an active role in his church and enjoyed an \nactive lifestyle.\n  Jim's diagnosis with ALS 6 years ago did not slow him down; rather, \nit pushed him to do even more to combat the disease. Along with his \nfamily and friends, he started Team Koller, a fundraising group that \nparticipated in local ALS awareness events and raised tens of thousands \nof dollars for research and treatment. Even at the most difficult \ntimes, Jim stayed focused on solutions, seeking answers and help for \nthose afflicted by ALS.\n  Although we mourn Jim's passing, his selfless and passionate efforts \ngive me hope that we may soon find a cure for this menacing disease. \nMay we continue to live and fight as James Koller did, with courage and \nfortitude. My thoughts and prayers are with Jim's wife Marianne, his \nsons, James and Kevin, and the rest of his family in this difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1116-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1116-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1116-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n CUBA AND OF THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY RELATING TO THE REGULATION OF THE \n          ANCHORAGE AND MOVEMENT OF VESSELS, AS AMENDED--PM 7\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date.

A bill to reauthorize the farm to school program, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 5 years ago, the President signed into law \nthe Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act. This law has made improvements to \nour school lunch program by making healthy food choices a reality for \nstudents nationwide. One of the best ways to help students make healthy \nchoices is to teach them about their food and how it is grown. That is \nwhy I championed the inclusion of funding for a farm-to-school grant \nprogram, which was included in the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act. \nThe program has had tremendous success and interest nationwide, and has \nawarded grants in 42 States--showing the reach and diversity of farm-\nto-school. In order to improve upon this successful program and expand \nits reach, I am glad to be joined today by Senator Cochran, and \nRepresentatives Fudge and Fortenberry in the House, to introduce the \nFarm to School Act of 2015.\n  We all know that hungry children cannot learn. Studies have shown \nthat healthy nutrition in a young person's diet is crucial to cognitive \nability and better health in the long run. With food insecurity on the \nrise, more than 30 percent of all children in the United States \nstruggle with obesity, resulting in poor health, and learning and \nbehavioral difficulties at school. The school meal program has made \ntremendous strides in recent years to ensure not only that children \nhave access to meals throughout the school day, but that those meals \nare nutritious. The Farm to School program has given children and \nschools across the country the tools to craft farm-fresh, healthy, and \ndelicious meals that students enjoy.\n  The Farm to School grant program offers support to farmers and local \neconomies, while teaching kids about nutritious foods and where they \ncome\n\n[[Page S1121]]\n\nfrom. The program has helped schools across the country meet the new \nnutrition standards by offering children local, fresh produce that \ntastes great. Just as importantly, the program has a strong educational \ncomponent, making our school cafeterias an extension of the classroom, \ngiving students an opportunity to learn about nutrition, well-balanced \nmeals, and even how to grow the food themselves.\n  In Vermont, I have seen first-hand how farm to school efforts have \nbetter connected children with the food in their cafeteria. Students \nparticipate in school gardens, sustainability projects, and taste tests \nfor new school menu items. The Burlington School Food Project created a \nhalf-acre Healthy City Youth Farm, connecting schools to the farm by \nengaging individuals in local agricultural production. Organizations in \nVermont such as Vermont Food Education Every Day, now the Northeast \nregional leader of the National Farm to School Network; Shelburne \nFarms; and the Northeast Organic Farming Association have been able to \nexpand their programs to link more farms to the classroom throughout \nVermont.\n  Farm to school is equally crucial to farmers and ranchers, who \ncurrently receive only 16 cents out of every dollar spent on food. The \nprogram opens another market to them to sell their locally grown and \nlocally harvested goods. By incorporating farm fresh products in school \nmeals, children learn the importance of where their food comes from. \nThe program links the classroom with the farm to engage students in the \nimportance of farming and contributing to the local economy.\n  The Farm to School Act of 2015 would build upon these successes and \nexpand the program's scope by increasing the funding for the program to \n$15 million per year. The bill also recognizes the importance of \ngrowing the program to include preschools, summer food service program \nsites, and after school programs.\n  Improving childhood nutrition is a goal we all share. Small changes \nin eating habits by children will result in lifelong health benefits \nfor generations to come. The Farm to School program empowers children \nand their families to make healthy choices now and in the future. As \nthe Senate begins considering reauthorizing the child nutrition bill \nthis year, I look forward to including these improvements in the Farm \nto School program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 569\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 86\n\n       Whereas the roots of patriotic Americans serving in \n     maritime service trace back to even before the existence of \n     the Continental Navy, when residents from seaside towns \n     engaged in combat with British warships in defense of their \n     homes;\n       Whereas the tradition of maritime service to the country \n     continued through the robust United States merchant marine, \n     and later the formation of State naval militias in the late \n     19th century to meet the need for additional naval support;\n       Whereas during the Spanish-American War, the Navy augmented \n     its force with 4,000 sailors from the State naval militias;\n       Whereas the emergence of the United States as a world power \n     in the early 20th century required a more robust and multi-\n     layered naval force;\n       Whereas the Act of March 3, 1915 (38 Stat. 928, chapter \n     83), established the Naval Reserve, which became the ``Navy \n     Reserve'' in 2006;\n       Whereas by the end of World War I, there were 290,0000 \n     members of the Naval Reserve, more than half of the total \n     manpower of the Navy, who fought valiantly during the war;\n       Whereas 84 percent of the sailors serving in World War II \n     were members of the Naval Reserve, a group that included \n     100,000 women;\n       Whereas the more than 2,600,000 enlisted personnel and \n     269,000 officers in the Naval Reserve in 1945 served in every \n     theater of World War II and on every type of vessel and \n     aircraft;\n       Whereas 5 Presidents, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, \n     Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, and George H. W. Bush, \n     served honorably in the Naval Reserve;\n       Whereas in United States conflicts and national \n     emergencies, including the Berlin Crisis, the Korean War, the \n     Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, Operation Desert \n     Storm, and hurricanes and other natural disasters, the Navy \n     Reserve has responded to calls promptly and effectively;\n       Whereas following the attack on the Navy destroyer, USS \n     Cole, on October 12, 2000, the Naval Reserve immediately \n     responded with coastal warfare security;\n       Whereas since the attacks on our homeland of September 11, \n     2001, the Navy Reserve has mobilized more than 72,000 members \n     of the Navy Reserve worldwide to counter threats to national \n     security;\n       Whereas the Navy benefits from the military experience, \n     civilian skills, and diverse backgrounds of the members of \n     the Navy Reserve;\n       Whereas as the Senate recognizes the distinguished service \n     of the members of the Navy Reserve, who are proud individuals \n     of the United States, there are more than 2,000 members of \n     the Navy Reserve deployed around the world; and\n       Whereas March 3, 2015, marks 100 years since the Act of \n     March 3, 1915 (38 Stat. 928, chapter 83), establishing the \n     Naval Reserve: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes March 3, 2015, as the centennial of the Navy \n     Reserve;\n       (2) recognizes the indispensable and valuable contributions \n     and sacrifices that individual members of the Navy Reserve \n     have made throughout the history of the United States and \n     continue to make in 2015;\n       (3) celebrates the commitment and service of members of the \n     Navy Reserve, their families, and their employers; and\n       (4) encourages communities to seize the opportunity to \n     honor and support these patriots in 2015, the centennial of \n     the Navy Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1122-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1122-S1123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 87--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n RISE OF ANTI-SEMITISM IN EUROPE AND TO ENCOURAGE GREATER COOPERATION \nWITH THE EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS, THE EUROPEAN UNION, AND THE ORGANIZATION \nFOR SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE IN PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO \n                             ANTI-SEMITISM;\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Wicker, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Rounds, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Toomey, Mr. \nCoons, Ms. Ayotte, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Coats, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Blunt, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Boozman, Mr. King, Mr. \nHeller, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Gardner, Ms. Warren, Mr. Cotton, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Markey, Mr. \nCruz, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Moran, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. McCaskill, \nMs. Murkowski, Mr. Franken, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \nBooker, Mr. Peters, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Brown, \nMr. Nelson, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bennet, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Casey, Mr. Murphy, \nMr. Portman, and Mr. Scott) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 87\n\n       Whereas an alarming increase in anti-Semitic attacks and \n     incidents targeting Jewish institutions, places of worship, \n     and individuals continue to take place in Europe and remain a \n     challenge to stability and security;\n       Whereas on January 9, 2015, 4 members of France's Jewish \n     community were murdered in an attack on a kosher supermarket \n     following the deadly terrorist attack on the Paris offices of \n     newspaper Charlie Hebdo;\n       Whereas, in a 2014 Anti-Defamation League survey of \n     attitudes towards Jews in more than 100 countries around the \n     world--\n       (1) 24 percent of those surveyed in Western Europe \n     expressed anti-Semitic views;\n       (2) 34 percent of those surveyed in Eastern Europe \n     expressed anti-Semitic views; and\n       (3) a majority of those surveyed worldwide either--\n       (A) had not heard of the Holocaust; or\n       (B) do not believe that the factual accounts and recorded \n     history of the Holocaust are accurate;\n       Whereas the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights \n     issued a report in 2013 on anti-Semitism in the 8 countries \n     in which 90 percent of Europe's Jews reside, namely France, \n     Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Belgium, Sweden, and the \n     United Kingdom, in which 76 percent of respondents believed \n     that anti-Semitism had worsened where they lived during the \n     previous 5-year period;\n       Whereas France, which is home to Europe's largest Jewish \n     population, reported that--\n       (1) twice as many French Jews immigrated to Israel during \n     2014 than had immigrated during 2013; and\n       (2) for the first time ever, more Jews moved to Israel from \n     France than from any other country in the world;\n       Whereas anti-Semitic acts committed and recorded in \n     European countries in 2014 included--\n       (1) murders and death threats against Jews; and\n       (2) arson, graffiti, and property desecration at Jewish \n     sites, including Jewish cemeteries,\n\n[[Page S1123]]\n\n     places of worship, schools, and community centers;\n       Whereas such acts led many Jewish individuals to conceal \n     their religious affiliation;\n       Whereas on May 24, 2014, a gunman killed 4 people when he \n     opened fire at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in Brussels, \n     Belgium;\n       Whereas on July 29, 2014, Molotov cocktails were thrown at \n     the synagogue in Wuppertal, Germany, which had been burned to \n     the ground by the Nazis during the 1938 Kristallnacht, and \n     was rebuilt as recently as 2002;\n       Whereas the foreign ministers of France, Germany, and Italy \n     issued a joint statement in July 2014, proclaiming: ``Anti-\n     Semitic rhetoric and hostility against Jews, attacks on \n     people of Jewish belief and synagogues have no place in our \n     societies'';\n       Whereas in September 2014, British Prime Minister David \n     Cameron declared: ``There can never be any excuse for anti-\n     Semitism, and no disagreements on politics or policy should \n     ever be allowed to justify racism, prejudice or extremism in \n     any form'';\n       Whereas on January 13, 2015, French Prime Minister Manuel \n     Valls spoke before the French National Assembly and declared \n     that anti-Semitism must be dealt with ``powerfully'' and that \n     ``there has been an intolerable rise in acts of anti-Semitism \n     in France [that] have not aroused the outrage expected by our \n     Jewish compatriots'';\n       Whereas at the Tenth Anniversary of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Berlin Conference \n     on Anti-Semitism in November 2014, Samantha Power, the United \n     States Ambassador to the United Nations, noted, ``Rising \n     anti-Semitism is rarely the lone or the last manifestation of \n     intolerance in society. . . . When the human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms of Jews are repressed, the rights and \n     freedoms of other minorities and other sectors are often not \n     far behind'';\n       Whereas the OSCE's December 2014 Basel Declaration on \n     Enhancing Efforts to Combat Anti-Semitism condemned \n     ``manifestations of anti-Semitism, intolerance and \n     discrimination against Jews'', and protected the commitment \n     to ``declare unambiguously that international developments or \n     political issues, including those with regard to the \n     situation in the Middle East, never justify anti-Semitism'';\n       Whereas the Government of the United States has \n     consistently supported efforts to address the rise of anti-\n     Semitism through diplomatic efforts including engagement in \n     international organizations such as the OSCE;\n       Whereas the Office to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism in \n     the Department of State, which is headed by the Special Envoy \n     to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, has consistently \n     supported European efforts to combat Anti-Semitism; and\n       Whereas, at the urging of the United States and 36 other \n     countries, including all European Union States, the United \n     Nations General Assembly convened the first ever meeting on \n     anti-Semitism on January 22, 2015, to consider ways to \n     confront the long-standing and growing problem of anti-\n     Semitism worldwide.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges the Secretary of State, the \n     Attorney General, and other relevant United States Government \n     agencies and officials to work closely with the European \n     Union and European governments to encourage further efforts \n     to address anti-Semitism by--\n       (1) undertaking prompt, impartial, and effective \n     investigations of any acts of violence motivated by anti-\n     Semitism and fully prosecuting those responsible for such \n     violence within the extent of the law;\n       (2) encouraging European countries and the European Union \n     to designate senior-level special envoys to monitor, prevent, \n     and combat anti-Semitism regionally and domestically;\n       (3) cooperating with European counterparts on developing \n     programs to counter violent extremists engaged in anti-\n     Semitic activity;\n       (4) encouraging the European Union and its Member States to \n     integrate measures to combat anti-Semitism into relevant \n     national strategies and action plans by including measures to \n     protect human rights, religious tolerance, and equality, and \n     to ensure hate crime and violence prevention;\n       (5) increasing cooperation on training initiatives related \n     to hate crimes, particularly crimes motivated by anti-\n     Semitism, for law enforcement personnel, and improving \n     monitoring and reporting efforts;\n       (6) empowering civil society, including diverse religious \n     and ethnic groups, civil and human rights organizations, and \n     the business community, to fight anti-Semitism and \n     discrimination;\n       (7) convening regular consultations with Jewish community \n     organizations and non-Jewish civil and human rights \n     organizations to demonstrate visible support, listen to \n     concerns, and solicit recommendations on improving security \n     and supporting victims; and\n       (8) reaffirming and implementing the recommendations in the \n     OSCE's December 2014 Basel Declaration on Enhancing Efforts \n     to Combat Anti-Semitism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1123-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on commerce, science, and transportation\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I am here for the 90th time to urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to take action on climate change. The science \nis clearly worthy of our trust, and it is indeed time to wake up.\n  The human contribution to climate change is no longer up for \nlegitimate debate. We know that carbon pollution accumulates in the \natmosphere. We know that carbon dioxide traps the sun's heat. We have \nactually known that since Abraham Lincoln was President. We know that \nthe atmosphere and the oceans are heating up. We can measure that.\n  Ocean acidification and sea level rise are also measurable, and they \nare caused by carbon pollution. These risks to our environment, to our \nhealth, to our economy, and to our national security are every week \nmore apparent.\n  News this week from New York City was that an advisory panel of \nscientists, engineers, and risk management experts just reported that \nthe sea level rise along that city's shoreline--approximately 12 inches \nsince 1900--may have expanded Superstorm Sandy's flood area by as much \nas 25 square miles, flooding the homes of some 80,000 people. That is \npretty real.\n  The report's prognosis for the future puts the city in pretty deep \nwater. New York City expects its local sea levels to rise by 11 to 21 \ninches more by 2050 and as much as 6 feet by 2100.\n  When he was mayor, Michael Bloomberg began in the wake of Hurricane \nSandy an ambitious plan to shore up New York with levees, with storm \nbarriers, and with other coastal defenses to make that great city more \nresilient in the face of rising seas. That plan is estimated to cost \nnearly $20 billion to fortify just one city, albeit a great one--New \nYork City--against rising seas.\n  Let's look south to another major American metropolitan area, Miami-\nFort Lauderdale, which also faces daunting projections of rising sea \nlevels.\n  This map I have in the Chamber shows 3 feet of sea level rise in \nMiami-Dade County. This is before. This is after. As we can see, they \nhave lost acres. All of this back to the coast is gone, acre upon acre \nof that city. This nuclear power station right here, Turkey Point, and \nthis sewage treatment plant which serves that municipal area have both \nbecome islands.\n  I visited Florida last year to hear firsthand about the threats that \nclimate change poses to the Sunshine State. I met Glenn Landers, a \nsenior engineer at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Everglades \nDivision. He has worked on water resources and restoration projects in \nFlorida for nearly 20 years. This is the map he used to show me what \njust 2 feet of sea level rise would mean for South Florida. There is a \nlot less of it.\n  Like New York, they have measured almost 1 foot of sea level rise in \nSouth Florida in the last 100 years. And like New York, the Southeast \nFlorida Regional Climate Compact--which is a bipartisan coalition of \nfour South Florida counties--once we get away from this building, it \nturns out this can actually be a bipartisan issue; that cloud of \nspecial interest money that wraps the Congress isn't as apparent when \nyou get to Florida counties. That bipartisan coalition predicts, like \nNew York, again, continued sea level rise. Indeed, the waters around \nsoutheast Florida could surge up to another 2 feet in less than 50 \nyears. As we can see, most of the iconic Everglades--which is the \nlargest tract of wilderness east of the Rocky Mountains and home to \nsome of the most rare and endangered species in America--will be under \nseawater.\n  Now, there is some resemblance between New York and Florida in the \nthreat of sea level rise. But the resemblance to New York diverges when \nwe look at some of the unique features of the Florida peninsula.\n  First is its low elevation. Miami is just 6 feet above sea level. Six \nfeet of sea level rise goes a long way.\n  Second, southern Florida, as the Army Corps of Engineers constantly \nattests, rests on porous limestone. In New York, levees and dams can be \nbuilt that will hold the ocean back. They can fortify New York City and \nwall it in like Holland. In Miami, they would be building those \nstructures on a geological sponge. The rising water will just seep \nright under. And even in the higher areas that might still stay dry, \nsaltwater will infiltrate the underground drinking water.\n  Of all the people and all the homes in the Nation at risk from rising \nseas, an estimated 40 percent are in the State of Florida. The Risky \nBusiness Project estimates that between $127 billion and $150 billion \nworth of property in Florida will be under the mean high tide by 2050. \nYou might want to be careful where you buy in Florida these days if you \nplan to be around a while.\n  If we take into account damage from coastal storms, Florida could \nface an additional $4 billion in damage per year.\n  Luckily, Florida is home to a number of the country's leading \nresearch institutions. Scientific experts at Florida universities are \nactively researching and trying to plan for the State's changing \nclimate.\n  Professor Harold Wanless of the University of Miami puts it pretty \nbluntly:\n\n       Everyone wants a nice happy ending. But that's not reality. \n     We're in for it. We have really done a job warming our ocean, \n     and it's going to pay us back.\n\n  The Florida Climate Institute is a network of universities and public \norganizations that provides Florida policymakers and businesses with \nreliable, region-specific, factual information. The group includes the \nUniversity of Florida, Florida State, the University of Miami, Florida \nA, the University of Central Florida, Florida Atlantic University, \nthe University of South Florida, and Florida International University.\n\n[[Page S1125]]\n\n  Let me focus on Florida International University in Miami. FIU leads \nthe Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Program to \nstudy the effect of climate change and human activity on freshwater \navailability in the Everglades. FIU hosts the International Hurricane \nResearch Center on its campus and recently established the Extreme \nEvents Institute, devoted to making communities more resilient to \nextreme weather.\n  Institute director Richard Olsen, who is an international expert on \ndisaster response and resiliency, has called sea level rise ``a slow \nonset disaster'' for South Florida.\n  Four professors of FIU's School of Journalism and Mass Communication \nset up a media outreach initiative called Eyes on the Rise. Students in \nthis program have produced documentaries to air on local television \nabout the effect of sea level rise on local communities, on real estate \nprices, and on economic growth in southern Florida.\n  FIU is a member of the American College and University Presidents' \nClimate Commitment, a network of schools taking action to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and promote climate research. FIU has adopted \na plan to bring emissions 25 percent below 2007 levels before 2030.\n  On my Florida visit, Dr. Mike Heithaus, a marine scientist and dean \nof the College of Arts and Sciences at FIU, said:\n\n       We're really standing here at ground zero. There's just \n     about nowhere else on the planet where there is more at risk \n     from sea level rise so fast.\n\n  He gets it. They get it. That is why Florida International University \nis at the fore of climate research and education, particularly as it \naffects the State of Florida.\n  But there is another member of that faculty who doesn't seem to get \nit, one of our Senate colleagues, the junior Senator from Florida. He \nteaches political science part time at FIU. Last month, however, that \njunior Senator from Florida voted against amendments to the Keystone XL \nbill stating that climate change is real and that humans contribute to \nit. Apparently the message from experts across Florida and frankly from \nexperts across campus that manmade climate change, especially sea level \nrise, is a big problem for southern Florida--well, apparently that \nmessage hasn't gotten through.\n  What are Florida's other elected officials doing? Fort Lauderdale \nmayor Jack Seiler is working with NOAA, State and Broward County \nofficials, and the South Florida Regional Planning Council to protect \nhis city from flooding and climate change. Miami Beach mayor Philip \nLevine showed me the huge pumps his city has installed to pump out the \nflooding that comes in on high tides and from storms. Republican mayor \nSylvia Murphy of Monroe County, which covers all of the Florida Keys \nand some of the Everglades, is a remarkable lady, and she has put \nclimate and energy policy at the heart of her 20-year growth plan for \nthe county. She is going to lose a lot of her county if we don't get \nahead of this. And the senior Senator from Florida, my friend Bill \nNelson, is an outspoken advocate for preserving the Florida coast and \nthe Florida economy in the face of climate change.\n  The Miami Herald recently wrote:\n\n       South Florida owes Senator Nelson its thanks for shining a \n     bright light on this issue. Everyone from local residents to \n     elected officials should follow his lead, turning awareness \n     of this major environmental issue into action. It is critical \n     to saving our region.\n\n  So said the Miami Herald.\n  Unfortunately, the junior Senator does not seem to have followed his \nsenior colleague's lead either in shining a bright light on this issue \nor in turning awareness into action.\n  It is a little bit surprising that, according to a recent New York \nTimes poll, an overwhelming majority of Americans support us taking \naction on climate change, including half of Republicans. Again, this is \nnot that partisan of an issue once you get away from the polluter money \nthat surrounds this building. Two-thirds of respondents said they would \nbe more likely to vote for a candidate for President or for the Senate \nwho explicitly campaigned on a platform of climate action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to continue for an additional \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That includes 48 percent of Republicans as opposed to \nonly 24 percent of Republicans who said they would be less likely to \nvote for such a candidate. So even among Republican voters, the balance \ntips in favor of climate action. If you look at young Republican \nvoters--as I have said over and over on this floor--under the age of \n35, they think climate denial is ignorant, out of touch, or crazy. \nThose are the words they selected in the poll, not my words.\n  Let's move west to Arizona. The folks at NASA--a pretty reputable \norganization--have a rover driving around on Mars right now that they \ncontrol. These are people who know something about what they are doing, \nand the folks at NASA have made understanding our planet and its \nsystems their life's work. This month their researchers released a \nstudy showing an 80-percent chance of a decades-long what they call \n``megadrought'' in the American Southwest, a multi-decade drought \nbetween 2050 and 2099 unless we act aggressively to mitigate the \neffects of climate change. Arizona could see half as much precipitation \nin the second half of the century as it did in the second half of the \nlast century. It is a call to arms to protect the State of Arizona.\n  Finally, here is this morning's newspaper headline: ``As ice melts, \nthe future fades. Climate change may force Alaska natives to abandon \ntheir village.'' Lisa Murkowski, the Senator from Alaska, is quoted \nhere. Senator Murkowski acknowledges the impacts of climate change on \nAlaska's coastal community.\n  So maybe we are beginning to make some progress, but all around the \ncountry these effects are ones we have to begin to take more seriously. \nIt is indeed time to wake up.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/25/senate-section/article/S1125-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
