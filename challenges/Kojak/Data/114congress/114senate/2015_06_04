Mr. President, on another matter, we have heard a lot \nabout the Supreme Court's imminent decision on ObamaCare and its latest \nproblems. No one can say for sure how the Court will rule, but one \nthing we do know is this: ObamaCare is a mess. It is a law filled with \nbroken promises, one that has been plagued by failure and one that has \ncaused costs to skyrocket for millions after the supporters of this law \npromised the costs would actually fall.\n  I speak to you in the wake of a bombshell revelation from the \nadministration that many insurers are now requesting to raise premiums \nby double digits all across the country. For instance, numbers for \nKentucky just came out yesterday, and most of the insurers on the \nCommonwealth's ObamaCare exchange are looking to raise premiums. Some \nof the proposed increases are as high as 25 percent, and some \nKentuckians may now face double-digit premium increases for the second \nor even the third year in a row. This is more bad ObamaCare news for \nthe people I represent.\n  In some States, the proposed increases are even more alarming, if you \ncan believe it. Kentuckians can look next door for proof of that, where \nsome Hoosiers could be hit with a 46-percent jump in their premiums, or \nif they look south to Tennessee, they will see that premium hikes of 36 \npercent have been proposed.\n  These are huge numbers, and they affect real people. We have seen the \ntruth of that statement in the stories we hear from constituents about \nhow ObamaCare's massive cost burdens affect all of them. Take the \nKentucky small business owner who wrote to say that his plan is now \nbeing canceled thanks to ObamaCare. Here is what he had to say: ``My \nmonthly premium will increase from $610 to [approximately] $1,200,'' he \nsaid, ``and this is with very high deductibles.'' Or take the \nconstituent of mine from Floyd County who recently wrote to say she can \nno longer afford her silver ObamaCare plan after the monthly premium \nspiked by more than 75 percent. ``I was forced to take the Bronze \nPlan,'' she said, ``which isn't worth the paper or ink to print it \non.''\n  These are the kinds of stories that have become all too familiar in \nthe age of ObamaCare. They are compounded by a continual drip, drip of \nbad news about this law, such as the recent report that showed how \nObamaCare's multibillion-dollar attack on hospitals in Kentucky is \nexpected to result in a net loss of $1 billion over the next few \nyears--a net loss of $1 billion to Kentucky hospitals.\n  This is after ObamaCare already compelled taxpayers to shell out \nbillions for Web sites that never worked, along with some pretty sad \nand desperate but expensive taxpayer-financed marketing campaigns that \noften just directed users to some technological nightmare, not \naffordable health care. Take Oregon, for instance. Taxpayers spent over \n$300 million on that State's exchange, only to have it taken over by \nthe Federal Government and then, along with the ObamaCare exchange in \nMassachusetts, placed under Federal criminal investigation. Look at \nHawaii, which received more than $205 million to establish its \nexchange. We learned just last month that the Hawaii exchange is \nplanning to shut down operations by September 30 since lawmakers \ncouldn't decide on a path forward to pay for it. And then there is \nVermont. This morning, the New York Times reported on the spectacular\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\ncrash of Vermont's even more ambitious version of ObamaCare. Many on \nthe left thought Vermont's experiment would light the way forward on \nhealth care. In the end, it turned out to be a remarkable failure and, \nas one Vermonter put it, ``an unending money pit.'' The State's top \nhealth official now says that ObamaCare's exchanges ``just [weren't] \nset up for success.'' That is in Vermont.\n  ObamaCare is hitting small and midsized businesses, too. These are \nthe engines of job growth in our economy, but too many of them are now \nfacing premium hikes of nearly 20 percent because of ObamaCare. One 54-\nperson company in Connecticut is facing up to $100,000 in new costs. \nIts owner says that ObamaCare ``punishes companies for hiring new, \nyounger workers,'' and, indeed, the uncertainty is causing her company \nto hire temporary workers rather than create permanent jobs.\n  So while it is possible that ObamaCare will survive its latest \ncrisis, that is not going to change the grim reality of this law. It \nwon't change the broken promises, it won't change the repeated \nfailures, and it won't change the fact that ObamaCare has led to \nskyrocketing costs for taxpayers, the small businesses that drive the \nAmerican dream, and, most importantly, for middle-class Americans who \nwork hard every single day and play by the rules.\n  It is about time the President and his party worked constructively \nwith us to start over on real health reform that can lower costs and \nincrease choice instead of hurting the middle class the way ObamaCare \ndoes. That is what the American people deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3732-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 BURMA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on one final matter, several weeks ago, \nI had the pleasure of meeting with Shwe Mann, speaker of the Burmese \nParliament, on his visit to Washington. It was the third time we met. \nWe had a cordial but frank discussion about the challenges and \nopportunities facing his country in 2015. There are obviously many \nissues that fall into both categories.\n  When it comes to challenges, there is the need for the government to \ndo all it can to protect and assume responsibility for members of a \nlong-suffering religious minority group, the Rohingya, thousands of \nwhom have been forced to take to the high seas on dangerous makeshift \nvessels to escape persecution. There is the longstanding need for the \ngovernment to continue its work with other ethnic minorities toward a \npermanent peace agreement that calls for political settlements in order \nto end a conflict as old as the modern Burmese State itself. Then there \nis the need for a constitutional reform to enhance civilian control of \nthe military, along with more progress on efforts to protect liberties, \nsuch as freedom of the press, freedom of expression, freedom of \nconscience, and freedom of assembly.\n  Those are just a few of the challenges facing Burma in 2015. But it \nis also true that Burma has come a long way from where it was just a \nfew years ago. Reform has been offered, change has occurred, and \nconsidering the conditions within Burma when reform began, this is no \nsmall achievement. That is why there are opportunities as well.\n  The parliamentary election that will be held later this year \nrepresents a clear opportunity to demonstrate how far Burma has \nprogressed. There are some encouraging signs that the election will be \nmore credible, more inclusive, and more transparent than what we have \nseen in the past in that country. Unlike recent Burmese elections, \ninternational election monitors have been permitted to observe. By and \nlarge, the work of the Union Election Commission has been encouraging \nthus far, especially as it relates to serious efforts to modernize the \nvoter roles and to make it easier to run for office. And our Embassy, \nunder the capable leadership of Ambassador Derek Mitchell, has been \nengaged in the process as well.\n  These are all positive signs, but it is going to take a sustained \ncommitment by President Thein Sein's government to ensure that as free \nand fair an election as possible takes place this fall because for all \nof the positive change we have seen in recent years, it is obvious that \nBurma still has much further to go. There are signs that its political \nreform effort has begun to falter, which is worrying for all of us who \ncare about the Burmese people.\n  It doesn't mean Burmese officials can't turn things around. I believe \nthey can, which is what I indicated to the speaker when I met with him. \nI believe there is still time before the next critical test of Burma's \nslow democratic development this autumn.\n  There may still be time to amend the Constitution, for instance, to \nensure that it promotes rather than inhibits Burma's democratic \ndevelopment. It is hard to claim democratic legitimacy with a \nConstitution that unreasonably limits who can run for President or that \neffectively locks in a parliamentary veto for the military.\n  At the very least, the six-party talks we have seen between President \nThein Sein, Shwe Mann, opposition leader Daw Aung Sang Suu Kyi, the \nmilitary, ethnic groups, and others certainly represent progress. They \nshould continue in a sustained fashion.\n  I also hope to see further progress on the draft national ceasefire \nreached between the Burmese Government and representatives from 16 \nethnic groups in March.\n  Those of us who follow Burma want the country to succeed. We want it \nto succeed in carrying out a transparent, inclusive, and credible \nelection on a broad scale. We know this standard goes far beyond simply \nholding an election without mass casualties or violence. It needs to be \nmore than just holding an election without mass casualties or violence. \nIt means the lead-up to the election must be transparent, inclusive, \nand credible, too. It means there should not be political favoritism \nshown by the state or its media organs. It means freedom of expression \nof the press and a peaceful assembly must be ensured. It means citizens \nmust be allowed to register and to vote without harassment, and it \nmeans they must be granted equal opportunities to organize, to \ncampaign, and to participate fully in the electoral process without \nfear and violence.\n  These basic standards of fairness are minimum goals Burmese officials \nmust strive toward. If the Burmese Government gets this right, if it \nensures a transparent, inclusive, and credible election, with results \naccepted by competing parties, that would go a long way toward \nreassuring Burma's friends around the globe that it remains committed \nto political reform. But if we end up with an election not accepted by \nthe Burmese people as reflecting their will, it will make further \nnormalization of relations--at least as it concerns the legislative \nbranch of our government--much more difficult.\n\n  For example, such an outcome would likely hinder further enhancement \nof U.S.-Burma economic ties and military-to-military relations. \nFurther, an erosion of congressional confidence in Burma's reform \nefforts would also make it more difficult for the executive branch to \ninclude Burma in the Generalized System of Preferences program or to \nenhance political military relations.\n  So these are some of the most pressing challenges and opportunities \nawaiting Burma in 2015. I noted many of them in my discussion with \nBurma's parliamentary speaker.\n  I would close by making it clear that we in the United States will be \nwatching intently to see what happens in Burma in the coming months, \nand we are prepared to continue doing what we can to encourage more \npositive change in that country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3732-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my friend the Republican leader can't see \nthe forest for the trees when it comes to health care. I understand \nthat. He has given many speeches denigrating ObamaCare.\n  The facts are that more people are getting access to health care \ntoday under the Affordable Care Act than ever before. The share without \ninsurance is now at an alltime low.\n  The cost growth in health care has never been lower than it has been \nsince ObamaCare kicked in. I was telling one of my Senator friends \nyesterday that when I went home during the Memorial Day recess, I had \ntwo people come to me. I know that is not a great sampling, but it \nshows how impactful the legislation has been. Both of them had children \nwith significant challenges, physical and mental. These young men and \nwomen now have the ability to get health care. They cannot be denied \ninsurance because of their preexisting disability. This law that was \npassed not only applies to people with disabilities about which I have \njust spoken, but it applies to people with disabilities such as \ndiabetes. Prior to ObamaCare, women could be charged more for their \nhealth care. So people are extremely satisfied with health care.\n  The Supreme Court should understand that about 7 million people who \nare happy with their health care and who are receiving subsidies for \ntheir insurance to take care of themselves would lose that. They would \nlose those subsidies. It would be a devastating blow to 7 million \npeople, as well as to the economy. Also, those people who don't need \nsubsidies benefit significantly. The people who have had increased \npremiums--my friend was very selective in whom he chose, because the \npeople having increases are very minimal. I will have more to say about \nthat at some subsequent time in the near future.\n  ObamaCare is working. Reports out this week show that all the targets \nhave been met as to people who have purchased insurance and they are \npaying their premiums. So I think we should try to improve the law \nrather than my Republican friends continually trying to talk about the \nfailures that don't exist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3733-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3733-S3734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEQUESTRATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every Senator wants to keep America safe, \nand that is why every Senator should be concerned about a particular \nthreat to our national security. This threat to our national security \nis called sequestration. Sequestration puts in place drastic cuts to \nall funding, defense and nondefense.\n  The Defense authorization bill that is before us today doesn't fix \nthat--and that is a gross understatement. We should not start spending \nuntil we develop a bipartisan budget that does. That is the only \nresponsible way to protect both our national security and America's \nmiddle class.\n  Sequestration results from what happened 4 years ago with another \nthreat of a government shutdown because the Republicans couldn't get \ntheir financial house in order.\n  The Budget Control Act of 2011 passed. That act included a number of \nsignificant spending cuts and established a supercommittee led by \nSenator Murray and Congressman Hensarling from Texas to produce a \nbalanced, bipartisan agreement for additional deficit reduction. \nUnfortunately, Republicans could never agree. There was a lot of this: \nYes, we are almost there, we are almost there. But they could never \npull the trigger and agree. There was a refusal to close a single tax \nloophole to reduce the deficit; not a single one could they agree on.\n  So the supercommittee failed to reach an agreement, and the Budget \nControl Act triggered deep, automatic cuts.\n  Sequestration was never intended to happen. The point was to threaten \ncuts so deep and so stupid that Congress would never let them happen. \nBut never put that beyond this Republican group over the last 10 years \nand who are still here in Congress. They allowed this stupid thing to \nhappen. The cuts affected both defense and nondefense programs so \neveryone would feel compelled to move it, because the cuts were equal.\n  Unfortunately, what was stupid in 2011 is now official Republican \npolicy. Congressional Republicans incorporated sequestration into their \nrecent budget resolution. That resolution leaves sequestration cuts in \nplace in parts of the budget that affect the middle class, and it also \ndirectly threatens national security. There are many examples of this.\n  How does it affect the middle class? The list is really endless. It \ncuts investments in roads, bridges, rail, and transit. That costs \njobs--lots and lots of jobs, hundreds of thousands of jobs. It puts \ntravelers at risk, and it weakens our economy.\n  Sequestration cuts education. That means fewer children with a shot \nat going to school. If they can't do that, they don't have a shot at \nsuccess. It means fewer Americans who can afford college. That is the \nway it is. It means less economic opportunity for millions of \nAmericans.\n  Sequestration cuts research. That means fewer chances to beat cancer, \nheart disease, and Alzheimer's. As a result of sequestration, the \nNational Institutes of Health, the premier medical research institution \nin the world, was whacked by sequestration to the tune of $1.6 billion. \nThey have never, ever gotten that money back. It stopped the \nfinalization work done on the universal flu vaccine. The list is \nendless as to what they can't do because of that money being lost.\n  While sequestration is a dagger pointed at the middle class, it also \nrepresents a threat to our society in many different ways. It means \nfewer opportunities for American businesses and consumers to benefit \nfrom cutting edge innovations.\n  Sequestration threatens cuts to the FBI, the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. It means fewer FBI resources devoted to terrorists and \nhunting them down.\n  Sequestration threatens cuts for the Transportation Security \nAdministration, which helps protect us from another 9/11.\n  Sequestration threatens cuts for fusion centers, which have worked so \nwell--these centers help law enforcement officials work together--and \nfor the Coast Guard and border security officials who protect Americans \nfrom dangers from abroad.\n  These are cuts that are in place right now.\n  The bill before us is designed to provide an end run around \nsequestration for the Department of Defense by exploiting a provision \nthat exempts from spending caps what is called the overseas contingency \noperations, or OCO. We all know that OCO was put in the budget many \nyears ago, and it was set there so we would have the money to fight \nwars. It is always very hard to determine how much wars are going to \ncost. We know that because we had to borrow almost $2 trillion for wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in Iraq.\n  But the OCO gimmick does not solve the problem of sequestration, and \nthat is true. I am disappointed that even Senators who long have had a \nreputation for fiscal honesty, such as the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, my friend, are turning a blind eye to the OCO \ngimmick. There has not been a word from people who have had a \nreputation for fiscal honesty--not a word--about this gimmick.\n  The Department of Defense says it won't work. It is just a 1-year \ngimmick, and that will make it impossible for military leaders to \nprepare for threats we face in the future.\n  The OCO gimmick does nothing for agencies that protect us here at \nhome, such as, as I have indicated, the FBI and even the Department of \nHomeland Security. That leaves all Americans vulnerable to attacks if \nthey don't get the resources they need.\n  So until we reach a balanced, bipartisan agreement on the budget--an \nagreement that protects both national security and the middle class--\nnot a single spending bill will become law. If any bill reaches the \nPresident, he will veto it. He has said so publicly many times. He \nshould. It is critical for the middle class, and it is the only way to \nbe fiscally responsible. We ought to budget before we spend.\n  Days after letting critical national security tools expire on their \nwatch,\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\nRepublicans are showing yet another way they can't govern. Now we are \nwasting time on a bill that has no chance of becoming law--no chance. \nNo troops will be helped by a bill that can't be signed into law by the \nPresident. Our military needs all the help they can get. They deserve \nit.\n  If Republicans want to join us in supporting our troops, they should \nstart taking their responsibility to govern seriously and work with us \non a Defense bill that can actually become law to help those in our \nArmed Forces.\n  Let's be straight. At the moment, we don't have a budget.\n  Without the vote of a single Democrat, Republicans approved a \nnonbinding resolution with their own wish list. It means nothing. The \nbudget means nothing. There was a lot of back-slapping here: Oh, it is \na great budget; we are going to balance the budget. But everyone knows \nthat is just a farce.\n  Until both parties join together, the government does not have a \nbudget to actually guide decisionmaking. We need one.\n  This is not rocket science. After all, budgeting for the Federal \nGovernment is not all that different than budgeting for a family. If \ntwo spouses are trying to resolve differences over their own budget, \nwould it be responsible for one spouse to go out and buy a new car on \ncredit? We all know the answer to that--no. It is the same here in \nWashington. Shouldn't we agree on a budget first and spend later? That \nis not asking too much, I don't believe.\n  We don't need political theater and meaningless votes on bills that \nare going nowhere. We don't need another manufactured crisis. We just \nneed to sit down, get real, and fix sequestration in a way that \nprotects both national security and the middle class.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that there will be \na vote at 10:15 a.m.; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 30 minutes of debate prior to \nthe vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I just listened to the words of the Senate minority \nleader concerning his views on an authorization bill--not an \nappropriations bill, not a funding bill but an authorization bill. I \nwould hope the minority leader and, frankly, my colleague and friend, \nSenator Reid, would pay attention to what is going on in the world \ntoday.\n  I refer to the Washington Post this morning and an article entitled \n``Deadly fighting tests truce in Ukraine.''\n  As many of us predicted, Vladmir Putin will continue his aggression \nand dismemberment of the European nation for the first time in 70 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled \n``Deadly fighting tests truce in Ukraine'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2015]\n\n                 Deadly Fighting Tests Truce in Ukraine\n\n                         (By Karoun Demirjian)\n\n       Moscow.--Continued skirmishes between pro-Russian rebels \n     and government forces in eastern Ukraine escalated Wednesday \n     into the first major battle in months, leaving at least 18 \n     dead and further threatening a tenuous cease-fire agreement \n     signed in February.\n       Both sides traded accusations about who had started the \n     fighting in Marinka, a suburb of Donetsk on the government-\n     held side of the cease-fire line. Separatists reported 15 \n     dead, and three Ukrainian soldiers were killed, according to \n     a Facebook post by Yuriy Biryukov, an adviser to Ukrainian \n     President Petro Poroshenko.\n       ``They tried to move forward. The Ukrainian military are \n     repelling all attacks, and the situation is under control,'' \n     Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National \n     Security and Defense Council, said at a news conference \n     Wednesday in Kiev. ``Marinka and Krasnohorivka are under our \n     control.''\n       But the head of the separatists' militia said they were \n     only defending themselves against an assault by the pro-Kiev \n     forces.\n       ``Trying to announce that we are storming Marinka--this is \n     a provocation by Kiev,'' said Vladimir Kononov, the militias' \n     top defense official. ``We already are in Marinka.''\n       Since February, top diplomats from the United States and \n     Europe have participated in several rounds of shuttle \n     diplomacy aimed at settling the conflict and persuading the \n     rebels and the government to fully implement the peace \n     agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus.\n       Last month, U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry and \n     Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland made back-to-\n     back trips to Russia, urging that country's leaders to use \n     their influence over the separatists in eastern Ukraine to \n     push them to parley with Kiev. Groups from both sides were \n     supposed to conclude an opening round of talks in Ukraine \n     this week to address various points of contention.\n       Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Russia \n     on Wednesday of intentionally undermining the peace process \n     and ordering pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine ``to start a \n     military operation.''\n       The surge in violence also comes as Western nations are \n     gearing up for this weekend's Group of Seven summit in \n     Germany--an assembly of nations from which Russia was ousted \n     when it annexed Crimea last year.\n       That annexation happened after the upper house of the \n     Russian parliament met in an emergency session to give \n     President Vladimir Putin the authority to send troops abroad.\n       On Wednesday, the speaker of the upper house told lawmakers \n     that there may be cause to hold a similar emergency session \n     soon but did not give a specific reason for the warning.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Perhaps the minority leader and others have missed this \narticle: ``Syria likely used chlorine gas in recent bombing raids, \nrights group says.''\n\n       A prominent human rights group accused the Syrian \n     government Wednesday of using toxic chemicals during a recent \n     surge in attacks involving barrel bombs on rebel-held areas \n     in northern Syria.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2015]\n\n Syria Likely Used Chlorine Gas in Recent Bombing Raids, Rights Group \n                                  Says\n\n                            (By Hugh Naylor)\n\n       Beirut.--A prominent human rights group accused the Syrian \n     government Wednesday of using toxic chemicals during a recent\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\n     surge in attacks involving barrel bombs on rebel-held areas \n     in northern Syria.\n       Human Rights Watch said chlorine gas was probably used in \n     at least three bombing raids that targeted Idlib province in \n     April and last month, after the area fell to a powerful new \n     rebel coalition. That coalition and other insurgent groups \n     have recently inflicted heavy losses on the regime of \n     President Bashar al-Assad in the north and east of Syria.\n       Assad's government has been accused by Western countries of \n     using chemical weapons over the course of the four-year \n     conflict, including an attack involving sarin gas in 2013 \n     that killed hundreds of people in a suburb of the capital.\n       Regime opponents and activists allege that Assad's forces \n     have punished residents in rebel-controlled areas with \n     barrages of the crude bombs, which are built from oil barrels \n     or gas cylinders and can be filled with toxic chemicals such \n     as chlorine gas. Barrel bombs have been dropped by regime \n     helicopters and airplanes on residential areas, hospitals and \n     markets, killing thousands of civilians, according to human \n     rights groups.\n       Another group said two barrel bombings on Wednesday killed \n     at least 24 people, including children, in Idlib and rebel-\n     held areas of Aleppo province. The British-based Syrian \n     Observatory for Human Rights said that it expected the death \n     toll to climb from those attacks.\n       In its Wednesday report, Human Right Watch said evidence \n     indicates that three attacks in April and May on towns in \n     Idlib involved barrel bombs containing toxic chemicals. The \n     group was unable to confirm the exact toxin used in the \n     attacks, which it said killed two people and affected 127. \n     But it cited chlorine as the likely culprit based on \n     interviews with first responders and doctors, as well as an \n     examination of photographs and videos.\n       The total number of attacks involving chlorine gas during \n     that time is probably much higher, according to the report, \n     which was released to coincide with the U.N. Security \n     Council's regular monthly meeting on chemical weapons in \n     Syria. Citing evidence provided by doctors in Idlib, the \n     group said 24 suspected chlorine gas attacks were carried out \n     between May 16 and May 19, killing at least nine people and \n     affecting over 500.\n       ``While Security Council members deliberate over next steps \n     at a snail's pace, toxic chemicals are raining down on \n     civilians in Syria,'' Philippe Bolopion, Human Rights Watch's \n     U.N. and crisis advocacy director, said in a statement.\n       He said the Security Council should impose sanctions for \n     the attacks.\n       In 2013, the Syrian government agreed to a deal brokered by \n     the United States and Russia to eliminate its chemical \n     weapons arsenal, forestalling potential U.S. airstrikes. The \n     Syrian government, which denies using chemical weapons, \n     agreed to join the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons (OPCW) as part of the agreement.\n       Last month, reports emerged that OPCW inspectors found \n     traces of sarin and VX nerve agent at a military research \n     site in Syria, raising suspicion that the government had not \n     eliminated its chemical weapons stockpiles.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. On the front page of the New York Times this morning: \n``ISIS Making Political Gains, Group Stakes Claim As Protector of \nSunnis.''\n\n       Ideologically unified, the Islamic State is emerging as a \n     social and political movement in many Sunni areas, filling a \n     void in the absence of solid national identity and security. \n     At the same time, it responds brutally to any other Sunni \n     group, militant or civilian, that poses a challenge to its \n     supremacy.\n       That dual strategy, purporting to represent Sunni interests \n     and attacking any group that vies to play the same role, has \n     allowed it to grow in the face of withering airstrikes.\n\n  In the news yesterday:\n\n       ISIS has closed off a dam to the north of Ramadi, cutting \n     water supplies to pro-government towns downstream and making \n     it easier for its fighters to attack government forces. ISIS \n     militants are opening only two or three of the dam's 26 gates \n     on the Euphrates River, denying water to numerous cities and \n     using water as a critical weapon to gain more influence and \n     territory.\n\n  ``Iraq: ISIS fighters close Ramadi dam gates, cut off water to \nloyalist towns,'' that was on CNN.\n  ``President Hassan Rouhani stated on Tuesday that,'' according to \nReuters, `` `The Iranian nation and government will remain at the side \nof the Syrian nation and government until the end of the road.' He also \npledged to send reinforcements in backing Bashar al-Assad.''\n  ``U.S.: Shiite Fighters in Iraq Are a Necessary, if Unlikely, Ally''\n\n       Retired Marine Gen. John Allen, said the militias have an \n     important role to play in liberating Anbar, so long as they \n     ``take command from the central authority.''\n\n  ``Embedding U.S. forces can help inject energy into leadership \ndevelopment of new and weaker Iraqi commanders. . . . ''\n  AFP Beirut: ``Iraq, Iran fighters deployed to defend Damascus.''\n\n       Thousands of Iranian and Iraqi forces have been deployed in \n     Syria in past weeks to bolster the defences of Damascus and \n     its surroundings, a Syrian security force told AFP on \n     Wednesday.\n       Iran's official news agency IRNA quoted elite Revolutionary \n     Guards General Qassem Soleimani as saying ``in the coming \n     days the world will be surprised by what we are preparing, in \n     cooperation with Syrian military leaders.''\n\n  I point out to my colleagues, Qassem Soleimani is the guy who sent \nthe copper-tipped IEDs into Iraq that killed hundreds of marines and \nsoldiers and also was seen prominently in Baghdad and other parts of \nIraq leading the Shiite militias.\n  Some of that is complicated. Some of it is impossible to make up.\n  Finally, the New York Times article on June 2: ``Assad's Forces May \nBe Aiding New ISIS Surge.''\n\n       Building on recent gains in Iraq and Syria, Islamic State \n     militants are marching across northern Syria toward Aleppo, \n     Syria's largest city, helped along, their opponents say, by \n     the forces of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n  Finally, ``Exclusive: Syrian Rebels Backing Out of U.S. Fight Vs. \nISIS.''\n  Syrian rebels are backing out because they are not being protected by \nthe United States of America and being barrel-bombed.\n  So I will not even go into the crisis in the Far East, where China is \nnow militarizing islands in international waters.\n  So here we are arguing about the way the authorization for America's \ndefense is funded, and the minority leader just announced they would \ntake a stand because they don't like the way it is funded. I don't like \nthe way it is funded. But don't those who are in opposition to this \nhave some sense of reality as to what is going on in the world; that if \nwe don't authorize the ability to defend this Nation and its national \nsecurity interests--which in the words of Henry Kissinger before the \nArmed Services Committee, ``The world has not seen more crises since \nthe end of World War II.''\n  I say, with respect to my good friend Senator Reid, haven't you got \nyour priorities skewed? Don't you understand this is an authorization \nbill? Don't you understand that if you want to fight, fight it on \nappropriations? Don't you understand--I am sure you do--that this is \nabout the welfare and benefit of the men and women who are serving?\n  I am as opposed to sequestration as anybody. I have watched the \nhearings on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where the military \nleaders have said sequestration is putting the lives of the men and \nwomen serving in uniform in greater danger. That should be enough \nalone, but we are playing the hand we are dealt. That fight should not \ntake place on an authorization bill.\n  This authorizes reforms of the Pentagon. This authorizes reforms of \nthe retirement system, which is long overdue. It authorizes our ability \nto acquire the weapons and training which are necessary to defend this \nNation. It doesn't fund them. It doesn't fund them; it authorizes them.\n  After intense hearings, months and months of hearings, debate, work \nin the Senate Armed Services Committee, we have come up with a product \nthat I am extremely proud of.\n  I understand my friend from Rhode Island will be proposing an \namendment later on to nullify the funding of OCO, which would then, by \nthe way, have the effect of reducing the funding and authorization \nrather dramatically and cancel many vitally needed programs, equipment, \nand training for the men and women who are serving in the military. \nThat is fine, but that will be defeated.\n  Once it is defeated, I hope and pray we will then move forward with \nthe amendment process, which has been absent for the last 2 years--\ntotally absent for the last 2 years--and not--for the first time in 53 \nyears--not pass a Defense authorization bill through the Congress of \nthe United States. For 53 years, through Democratic and Republican \nmajorities, through liberal and conservative, we have authorized. We \nhave authorized because our highest responsibility is the security of \nthis Nation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, if we want to have this fight, have it \non the appropriations bill, the money bill. This is authorization. For \nyou to distort it in some way and to equate it with a funding \nmechanism, in my view, is intellectual sophistry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rounds). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is correct, every \nuniformed Chief of service came before us and said the greatest crisis \nfacing the military process was sequestration, the Budget Control Act, \nand they asked us to change it, and we didn't change it.\n  If we are going to change it, then we have to make every effort and \ntake every step to make those changes, and that is the point I have \ntried to raise in this committee--not by eliminating the funds \navailable to the military but by making these funds subject to \nresponsible action with following the request of the defense officials \nto eliminate sequestration. I think we should do it as soon as \npossible. If we don't take every opportunity to make that case and \nevery action possible to make that case, then we will be essentially \nrejecting the advice of our senior military leaders.\n  Suggesting that this bill is somehow so totally disconnected to the \nappropriations process is belied by the title of the bill. This is an \nact to authorize appropriations for the fiscal year 2016 for the \nmilitary activities for the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, the defense activities in the Department of Energy. We \nare directly linked to the appropriations process. In the ideal world, \nthe one that we authorize and would like to see, nothing can be \nappropriated, no dime can be spent, unless we have authorized it.\n  What we have done, effectively, in the bill--and I think it is not \nbecause it is the chairman's first choice but because it was the only \navailable option given the budget resolution--is that we have taken the \noverseas contingency account, bolstered it up dramatically, and set a \nnew sort of pathway, which next year, unless we resolve this issue of \nthe Budget Control Act, we will come back again with more money--and \nthe following year.\n  Also, as has been pointed out, we will have situations where we will \nfind some very strange things happening in our OCO account, because we \ncan't fund legitimate concerns of the government in other areas because \nof caps. That is essentially what happened in the eighties. That is why \nwe have a significant amount of medical research money in the \nDepartment of Defense--not because the Department of Defense does it \nbut because that was the only available option in the eighties and \nnineties to get money to where we thought we would need it.\n  I think the other issue here, too, is very implicit in our activity, \nwhich is that this bill is aimed at the Department of Defense and the \nmilitary activities of the Department of Energy. Our national security \nis much more than that. The chairman read quite accurately reports \nabout activity in the world, but up my way, in Roslindale, MA, there \nwas an alleged terrorist who was confronted by an FBI agent and a \nMassachusetts police officer. That is the kind of terrorism a lot of \npeople are concerned about, and if we sequester and cut off funding for \nthe Department of Justice and the FBI and the Customs Service, et \ncetera, we will see this threat growing. So this is about a broader \nview, a wider view, and the overall mass security of the United States.\n  I know we have some votes pending, and I would like to go ahead and \nallow for my colleague to speak.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional \nminutes--the vote was scheduled at a quarter after--an additional 5 \nminutes in order to allow 3 minutes for the Senator from Colorado and 3 \nminutes for the other Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Arizona for that additional time \nand for his commitment and the ranking member's commitment to our \nnational security. I deeply appreciate it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1540\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk briefly about amendment 1540, \nwhich the Senate will consider shortly. I am here with my colleague \nSenator Gardner from Colorado. We are here on this bipartisan amendment \nto require the Government Accounting Office to audit the way the \nVeterans' Administration constructs major medical facilities and help \nidentify exactly where the money went on some of these projects.\n  The Veterans' Administration is building several major medical \nfacilities across the country, including one in Aurora, CO.\n  The project in Colorado has been grossly mismanaged leading to \nexcessive cost overruns. Other projects across the country have had \nsimilar problems for years. For years, our delegation and practically \nanyone who has been involved with the Aurora project--almost anybody \nwho has driven by the Aurora project has pushed the VA to acknowledge \nthat there is actually a problem and to come up with a plan to fix it. \nUnfortunately, the VA has so far failed to do this, and veterans across \nthe Rocky Mountain region have continued to wait for this new medical \ncenter.\n  We should ensure and must ensure that the mistakes on the Aurora \nproject never happen again, but we all concluded that with greater \naccountability and transparency the right thing to do is to move \nforward and complete this critical facility.\n  As many of us have experienced up here, imposing accountability and \ntransparency on an enormous Federal bureaucracy is elusive and \ncomplicated. The GAO has the necessary expertise to identify realistic, \nhard reforms and to make them stick.\n  We have to hold the VA accountable to our taxpayers so we can move \nforward to give the Rocky Mountain region's veterans the care they \nneed. The VA and Congress are going to have to work together to get \nthis project back on track. Finding the money to do this will be \npainful. It will be difficult, which is why we need to ensure that we \naccount for every dollar that has been spent. But failing to complete \nthis hospital is not an option. It would be a broken promise. Having a \nhalf-finished hospital in Colorado would be a national disgrace, and on \nbehalf of our veterans, we cannot allow it to happen. It would be a \ndisservice--worse than a disservice--a broken promise of the worst kind \nto the hundreds of thousands of veterans across the Rocky Mountain \nregion and throughout the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I wish to express my \ngratitude to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Gardner, for joining \nme on this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I, too, echo the thanks to my colleague \nfrom Colorado, Senator Bennet, for his leadership on this effort. It is \ntime that we take the VA hospital from the thorn of the VA system to \nthe crown of the VA system, which we know it will be once it is \ncompleted. But in the meantime, there is a tremendous amount of work we \nhave to do. I would like to thank the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for allowing this time today on the floor.\n  I would note that there are four Members of this body who have \nactually visited the facility in Denver in recent months. The Presiding \nOfficer has witnessed this hole in the ground right now that has \nalready spent hundreds of millions of dollars, projected to be $1.73 \nbillion at this point.\n  We have talked about the need to complete it and have committed to \nthat need to finish this project, along with the chairman of the \nVeterans' Committee, who has joined us on the floor today, Senator \nIsakson, who is here today with us, who is in support of this amendment \nto bring more accountability to the VA system so that we can understand \nwhat went wrong when they were building not only the Aurora facility \nbut what went wrong around the country as project after project has \nseen cost overruns and delays.\n  Veterans gathered this past week in Colorado to rally to finish the \ndarn thing. We have a Veterans' Administration that time and time again \nhas failed to take into account the necessary measures and policies to \nfix it and to prevent it from ever happening again. With this \namendment, we can start to find out where they went wrong and to hold \nthem accountable. When the only person who has been fired is the person \nwho said we were going to have a problem, there is something wrong with \nthat.\n  I commend Senator Bennet for his leadership on fixing this problem,\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\nbuilding the hospital, and giving our veterans what they were promised.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his time today. I thank the \nchairman of the committee for enduring this conversation this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                            Floor Privileges\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a list of staff members of the \nCommittee on Armed Services and I ask unanimous consent that those \nstaffers on the list be granted the privilege of the floor at all times \nduring the Senate's consideration of and votes relating to H.R. 1735, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n       Barker, Adam; --Barney, Steven; --Bennett, Jody; -Borawski, \n     June; --Brewer, Leah; ---Brose, Christian; --Chuhta, Carolyn; \n     --Clark, Jon; ---Clark, Samantha; --Davis, Lauren; --Donovan, \n     Matt; --Edelman, Kathryn; --Edwards, Allen; --Epstein, \n     Jonathan; --Everett, Elizabeth; --Goel, Anish; ---Goffus, \n     Tom; ---Greene, Creighton; --Greenwalt, Bill; --Guzelsu, \n     Ozge; --Hayes, Jeremy; --Hickey, James; --Howard, Gary; ---\n     Kerber, Jackie; -- King, Elizabeth; --Kuiken, Mike.\n       Leeling, Gary; Lehman, John; Lerner, Daniel; Lilly, Greg; \n     McConnell, Kirk; McNamara, Maggie; Monahan, Bill; Nicolas, \n     Natalie; Noblet, Mike; Patout, Brad; Potter, Jason; Quirk, \n     John; Salmon, Diem; Sawyer, Brendan; Sayers, Eric; \n     Scheunemann, Leah; Seraphin, Arun; Soofer, Rob; Sterling, \n     Cord; Waisanen, Robert; Walker, Barry; Walker, Dustin; \n     Wheelbarger, Katie; White, Jennifer.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment pending before us now is the \nPortman amendment proposed by the Senator from Ohio. We spoke about it \nyesterday.\n  First, let me recognize that he is trying to assist the Army in \nmodernizing the Stryker, which is a very critical piece of equipment. \nBut I want to reiterate some of the concerns I have about the \namendment. I know Senator Portman will be here shortly to make a final \ncomment on the amendment. The amendment would add $371 million of \nfunding for procurement, research, and development of the lethality \nupgrade to the Stryker program.\n  I do not have to tell anyone around here that we are in a very tough \nbudget situation. We have to look very closely at every request. The \ntraditional way it is done is that there will be in the President's \nbudget the request by the service department, including the Department \nof Army, and then the Army will submit an unfunded requirements list--\nthose priority elements that have not made the cut, if you will, in the \nPresident's budget. That was done in March. I understand that this \nwhole requirement for the Stryker lethality upgrade came in in April. \nThere is an issue of unfortunate timing. But, nevertheless, because we \ndid not have the opportunity to look at this as part of the overall \nunfunded requirements list--nor the Army, for that matter--we really do \nnot have a sense of the priority. Is this the most important program \nthat we can invest $371 million in at this moment for the benefit of \nthe Army? Therefore, I am very concerned that we are sort of moving \nforward without full and careful analysis both by the Department of the \nArmy and by the committee, and we need, at this particular moment, this \ndifficult time, to have that type of analysis.\n  The other issue here, too, is that this is the first step in a \nmultiyear process. We are not quite sure how much additional funding \nwill be needed over the next several years. It is clear from the Army \nthat additional funding will be needed.\n  So we are at this time, without the usual review by the Army and by \nthe committee, committing ourselves, perhaps, to significant funding \ngoing forward. The present estimate is that it will cost $3.8 million \nper vehicle. The plan is to upgrade about 81 vehicles. But it is \nsomething that, again, could be more expensive and will commit us over \nseveral years.\n  The funding--the vast majority of it--is going to be dedicated to one \nplant in a single State. Indeed, I think, generally and appropriately, \nit is a concern of the Senator from Ohio because most of the work will \nbe done in Ohio. I think, again, he should be commended for being \ninterested in what is happening in his home State.\n  So I appreciate the demand, but I just do not think this has gone \nthrough the process sufficiently enough for us to make that type of \ncommitment today on the floor, and I will be opposing it right now.\n  I would also point out two other factors. First, the Army has the \ncapability going forward, if this program becomes so critical and they \nraise it to the highest priority, to request a reprograming of funds, \nto move money from one less significant priority to this program. That \nis an option they have, and that is an option they may well choose to \nuse, but it will only be after their careful consideration of the other \npriorities that are facing the Army. I think that is a better way to do \nit.\n  The other factor I would point out is that the pay-for for this \nprogram is the foreign currency account. Basically, that is a hedge \nwithin the Department of Defense for their international transactions \nand the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currency. Well, the \ndollar is strong, and so there appears to be additional excess funds in \nthat account, but currency over the next year could change \ndramatically. We have already put significant pressure on this supposed \nexcess funding. We have reduced by about $550 million the request that \nthe Department of Defense has made for this hedge fund, if you will, \nagainst currency changes in the world going forward in their \nacquisition process. I know the House has used more. But I think we \nhave been careful not to try to put too much weight on this account.\n  So for all of these reasons, I would urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment. Later, there will be an opportunity for the Department of \nthe Army to reprogram funds if it is necessary.\n  I think this should have been done in the context of a careful review \nof all their priorities so we know exactly where it stands. Again, I \nthink we are putting too much pressure on this currency account. It \nmight turn out to evaporate these supposed savings.\n  I yield the floor since I see the Senator from Ohio has arrived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, yesterday I talked about an amendment \nthat is absolutely crucial that we include in this legislation. Again, \nI commend the chairman, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator \nReed, for their work on this underlying bill. But there is something \nmissing, and it is very clear to everybody who is looking at this issue \nobjectively, particularly what is going on right now on the eastern \nborder of Ukraine. We do not have the ability in Europe, because we \nhave pulled our armored units out, to say with credibility that we have \nthe capacity to address the very real challenge now, unfortunately, \nthat is emerging in Europe.\n  Last night, as some of you know, Russian and separatist forces \nlaunched an offensive again. I am told it is the largest attack since \nthe February Minsk agreement. So this is just what so many people \npredicted, including President Poroshenko and others in Ukraine, which \nis that things are heating up again on the eastern border of Ukraine. \nThe NATO forces--the United States of American in particular--need to \nbe sure they have in Europe the ability to at least have some \ncredibility to say they can respond to this.\n  We have moved our armored units out, meaning there are not Abrams \ntanks there, except for a few units that were up in the Baltics on a \ntemporary basis this spring. I visited them a couple of months ago. \nThey are doing a terrific job, but they are leaving.\n  What the Army has said is, we want to allow our troops who are there \nto be able to up-armor, particularly with a weapon--a 30-millimeter \ncannon rather than a .50-caliber machine gun--on our Stryker vehicles \nto be able to have some credibility there, to be able to say that we \nhave armored units in Europe that can respond to these new challenges. \nThe Army has asked for this. The Army wants this. They are pleading for \nit because the soldiers who are there know they will not be able to \nperform their mission without this enhanced capability.\n  We had this debate yesterday on the floor. I do not think Senator \nReed and other Democrats necessarily disagree with the substance of \nthis amendment. What they have said is they are concerned about the \npay-for. Well, let's talk about the pay-for. The pay-for is\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\ntaking this out of an account that is already being used for other \npurposes. It is already being used by the House Armed Services \nCommittee. In fact, the House Armed Services Committee has already \ntaken more funds out of this account than all of the funds in the SASC \ncommittee, the Senate committee, plus this amount that I believe ought \nto be taken out of this account. This is called the foreign currency \nfluctuation account at the Department of Defense.\n  GAO, which is the body that looks at these issues from our \nperspective, from a legislative branch perspective--they are the \nauditors--GAO has estimated that the Pentagon will have $1.86 billion \nin surplus from these fluctuations by the end of fiscal year 2016.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. So GAO has looked at this. They have said there will be \n$1.86 billion in surplus in these fluctuation accounts at the end of \nfiscal year 2016. They have actually updated their figures now with \neven more recent data, and they have just adjusted the 2016 surplus \neven higher to $2.02 billion. No one has produced a currency projection \nto counter this GAO estimate. So we are talking about over $2 billion \nin this account that is available.\n  By the way, the money we are talking about here is not going to be \ntaken and used for other readiness priorities because the SASC bill has \nalready swept up that money for readiness. This money will be sitting \nin a reserve fund. The Pentagon does not need to be sitting on this \nsize of a reserve fund--essentially a slush fund--when we do have these \nneeds that have been identified. The Army has made a formal request for \nthese. They have asked for assistance here. These deployed units need \nthis assistance. They said they need it. We ought to put this to good \nuse--namely, for an urgent requirement like this one.\n  Again, if you look at the House bill versus the Senate bill, the \nHouse has used more of this funding in this reserve fund, this slush \nfund, than we have used even when you include this additional \nrequirement I am talking about today.\n  So this notion that somehow we cannot do this because the offset is \nnot good--it just does not make any sense. It does not fit with what \nGAO has said, and it does not fit with what the House has done. So I do \nnot know what the objection is, but I tell you what--if you vote \nagainst this, then you are saying that our troops in Europe ought not \nto have the capability that they have asked for, that they need.\n  Admittedly, this came late. I am sorry about that. It should have \ncome with it sooner. This was a requirement they had identified, but \nthey had identified needing it later by 2020. Now, they need it now, \nand they need it now because the situation has changed in Europe.\n\n  We have to be flexible to be able to respond to that change. If we \nwait another 12 months, another year to do this, who knows what is \ngoing to happen. But I know one thing, having been in Eastern Europe \nrecently, I know those countries of Eastern Europe and, in fact, those \ncountries on the European Continent--our NATO partners, in particular, \nbut also Ukraine--are looking to the United States of America to show \nthat the commitment we have made on paper, to ensure we have that \ncommitment in terms of our capability on the ground in Europe.\n  Again, this is an issue where I think we should come together as \nDemocrats and Republicans. It is a bipartisan amendment. I commend \nSenator Peters for identifying this need with the Army.\n  I understand Senator Reed's concern that this came late in the \nprocess, but it is here. The request has been made. I would sure hope \nwe would be able to come together today, given what is happening right \nnow on the eastern border of Ukraine, to ensure that we send a strong \nmessage that, at a minimum, we are going to meet these requirements \nthat the Army has insisted they need to be able to give our troops what \nthey need to be able to keep the peace in this important part of the \nworld.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, again, I recognize the way that the Senator \nfrom Ohio is articulating a need of the military. The question is how \nhigh the priority is.\n  Just one point I wish to make is that we do understand acutely the \ncrisis in the Crimea, et cetera. The availability of this equipment \nwould not be instantaneous. It would take many months to do the \nupgrade, to do the evaluations, et cetera.\n  Again, I think the best approach would be to allow the Department of \nthe Army to make a judgment, to reprogram, if necessary, and to get \nthis moving.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to amendment No. 1522, offered by the Senator from Ohio, \nMr. Portman.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 1540, offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed, for Mr. Bennet.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1473 to Amendment No. 1463\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment in order to call up amendment No. 1473.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S3739]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: To limit the retirement of Army combat units)\n\n       On page 38, line 12, insert after ``fighter aircraft'' the \n     following: ``and army combat units''.\n       On page 43, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (e) Minimum Number of Army Brigade Combat Teams.--Section \n     3062 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e)(1) Effective October 1, 2015, the Secretary of the \n     Army shall maintain a total number of brigade combat teams \n     for the regular and reserve components of the Army of not \n     fewer than 32 brigade combat teams.\n       ``(2) In this subsection, the term ` brigade combat team' \n     means any unit that consists of--\n       ``(A) an arms branch maneuver brigade;\n       ``(B) its assigned support units; and\n       ``(C) its assigned fire teams''.\n       (f) Limitation on Elimination of Army Brigade Combat \n     Teams.--\n       (1) Limitation.--The Secretary of the Army may not proceed \n     with any decision to reduce the number of brigade combat \n     teams for the regular Army to fewer than 32 brigade combat \n     teams.\n       (2) Additional limitation on retirement.--The Secretary may \n     not eliminate any brigade combat team from the brigade combat \n     teams of the regular Army as of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act until the later of the following:\n       (A) The date that is 30 days after the date on which the \n     Secretary submits the report required under paragraph (3).\n       (B) The date that is 30 days after the date on which the \n     Secretary certifies to the congressional defense committees \n     that--\n       (i) the elimination of Army brigade combat teams will not \n     increase the operational risk of meeting the National Defense \n     Strategy; and\n       (ii) the reduction of such combat teams does not reduce the \n     total number of brigade combat teams of the Army to fewer \n     than 32 brigade combat teams.\n       (3) Report on elimination of brigade combat teams.--The \n     Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees a report setting forth the following:\n       (A) The rationale for any proposed reduction of the total \n     strength of the Army, including the National Guard and \n     Reserves, below the strength provided in subsection (e) of \n     section 3062 of title 10, United States Code (as amended by \n     subsection (e) of this section), and an operational analysis \n     of the total strength of the Army that demonstrates \n     performance of the designated mission at an equal or greater \n     level of effectiveness as the personnel of the Army so \n     reduced.\n       (B) An assessment of the implications for the Army, the \n     Army National Guard of the United States, and the Army \n     Reserve of the force mix ratio of Army troop strengths and \n     combat units after such reduction.\n       (C) Such other matters relating to the reduction of the \n     total strength of the Army as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       (g) Additional Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--At least 90 days before the date on which \n     the total strength of the Army, including the National Guard \n     and Reserves, is reduced below the strength provided in \n     subsection (e) of section 3062 of title 10, United States \n     Code (as amended by subsection (e) of this section), the \n     Secretary of the Army, in consultation with (where \n     applicable) the Director of the Army National Guard or Chief \n     of the Army Reserve, shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report on the reduction.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) A list of each major combat unit of the Army that will \n     remain after the reduction, organized by division and \n     enumerated down to the brigade combat team-level or its \n     equivalent, including for each such brigade combat team--\n       (i) the mission it is assigned to; and\n       (ii) the assigned unit and military installation where it \n     is based.\n       (B) A list of each brigade combat team proposed for \n     disestablishment, including for each such unit--\n       (i) the mission it is assigned to; and\n       (ii) the assigned unit and military installation where it \n     is based.\n       (C) A list of each unit affected by a proposed \n     disestablishment listed under subparagraph (B) and a \n     description of how such unit is affected.\n       (D) For each military installation and unit listed under \n     subparagraph (B)(ii), a description of changes, if any, to \n     the designed operational capability (DOC) statement of the \n     unit as a result of a proposed disestablishment.\n       (E) A description of any anticipated changes in manpower \n     authorizations as a result of a proposed disestablishment \n     listed under subparagraph (B).\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will return to the floor soon to lay \nout more fully what this amendment does. Fundamentally, it tries to \nprotect our force structure, our personnel and, in particular, the core \ncomponent of brigade combat teams as the Pentagon--the Defense \nDepartment--deals with curtailed resources.\n  I am very concerned, as are so many of us, that as defense budgets \nare cut, personnel and core resources in terms of end strength, \nincluding brigade combat teams, will suffer cuts that go well beyond \nfat and into meat and bone. We need to limit that. We need to avoid \nthat. This amendment would do that with regard to brigade combat teams.\n  It does not increase spending. It retains as much flexibility as \npossible for the Department of Defense. I think it meets an important \ngoal in a balanced and reasonable way. I look forward to continuing \nthis discussion toward a vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, for the benefit of Members, and in \nagreement with Senator Reed, we will be having the Shaheen amendment, \nfollowed by side-by-side Markey and Cornyn amendments. And those votes, \nwe are planning on, but haven't confirmed, will probably be at around \n1:45 p.m., and that would complete our activities. That is not totally \nagreed to, but that is the plan.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, also I believe we anticipate taking up by \nvoice vote the Tillis amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We will voice vote the Tillis amendment, and we will be \nlooking, hopefully, at a manager's package, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1494\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 1494, \nwhich I believe would move our Nation one step closer toward finally \nsecuring equal protection under the law for veterans in the United \nStates. I thank the other cosponsors of this amendment, Senators Leahy, \nDurbin, Brown, Hirono, Blumenthal, Baldwin, Schatz, Peters, Gillibrand, \nMarkey, Whitehouse, Coons, Wyden, Franken, Murphy, Murray, and Boxer.\n  This amendment would end the current prohibition on benefits for gay \nand lesbian veterans and their families who live in States that do not \nrecognize same-sex marriage. My amendment is based on the Charlie \nMorgan Military Spouses Equal Treatment Act, which I was proud to \nreintroduce earlier this year.\n  The bill is named for Charlie Morgan, a former soldier and chief \nwarrant officer in the New Hampshire National Guard and the Kentucky \nNational Guard. Charlie was a military veteran with a career spanning \nmore than 30 years. I first met Charlie in 2011. She was on her way \nhome from deployment in Kuwait, and she had just been diagnosed for a \nsecond time with breast cancer. Concerned for her wife Karen and their \nyoung daughter's well-being, Charlie became an outspoken critic of the \nDefense of Marriage Act, which at the time prohibited her spouse and \nchild from receiving the benefits that she had earned during her \nservice.\n  Sadly, Charlie did not live to see the Supreme Court overturn the \nDefense of Marriage Act in 2013. However, because of her example, her \nleadership, and her courageous advocacy, our Nation took another \nhistoric step toward ensuring equal treatment and civil rights for all.\n  Despite the Supreme Court's overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, \nthere are still provisions remaining in the U.S. Code that deny equal \ntreatment to LGBT families. One of those provisions is in title 38, \nwhich deals with veterans benefits.\n  Today, if you are a gay veteran living in a State such as New \nHampshire that recognizes same-sex marriage, your family is entitled to \nall the benefits you have earned through your military service. \nHowever, a veteran with the exact same status, the same service record, \nthe same injuries, the same family obligations, but living in a State \nthat does not recognize same-sex marriage will receive less.\n  The impact of this discrimination is very real. Monthly benefits are \nless, spouses and children are not eligible for medical care at the VA, \nand families are not eligible for the same death benefits.\n  There are even reports that the VA has required gay veterans to pay \nback benefits because their State will not recognize their marriage. In \none case, a young woman--a 50-percent disabled combat veteran--was \ninitially approved for benefits for her wife and child but later told \nby the VA that because of where she lived and whom she\n\n[[Page S3740]]\n\nloved, she was not only going to lose a portion of her benefits but the \nVA was also going to withhold her future payments until she paid the VA \nback. This is just disgraceful--to cut the benefits earned by a combat \nveteran and then also require that she pay back the VA, all because of \nwhom she married and where she lives. Perhaps the most frustrating part \nof this story is knowing that if this woman moved across the border to \nanother State, she would have no problems with the VA.\n  My amendment would fix this issue for these men and women who have \nvolunteered to serve in our Armed Forces. They have volunteered to put \nthemselves in harm's way, to leave their families and their homes, and \nto travel around the world to protect America and our way of life. Yet \nthey are being deprived of the very rights they have risked their lives \nto protect.\n  So again, let's be clear what we are talking about. The Supreme Court \nhas ruled it is unconstitutional to deny Federal benefits to legally \nmarried, same-sex couples and their children. Yet, due to unrelated \nprovisions of the Federal Code, State legislatures have the ability to \nindirectly deny Federal benefits to certain disabled veterans and their \nfamilies solely because they are in a same-sex marriage. It is unjust \nand, according to the Supreme Court, it is unconstitutional.\n  Now, my amendment is not new to the Senate. Last Congress the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee approved it by a voice vote, and earlier \nthis year, 57 Senators voted in favor of a budget resolution amendment \non this issue. Now, when we vote--hopefully very soon on this \namendment--Senators will have the opportunity to end an unjust and \nunconstitutional provision of law that discriminates against veterans.\n  Many of us talk about the need to honor the service of our veterans \nand to make sure they have access to the care they deserve, and we \nshould all do that. But if you believe that all veterans, regardless of \ntheir sexual orientation, deserve equal access to the benefits they \nhave risked their lives for, regardless of where they live, then you \nwill vote in favor of this amendment.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support passage of this amendment \nwhen it comes up for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to commend the Senator from New \nHampshire. I think one of the best indications of the appropriate \ndirection of this policy is that the Department of Defense extends \nbenefits regardless of State law to all military personnel. Consistent \nwith the Department of Defense, this should be done by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  So I commend the Senator. I think it is the right thing to do and the \nconsistent thing to do and the logical thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I thank Senator Reed, the ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, who has a distinguished \nmilitary career of his own, for his support of this effort and his \nunderstanding of how important this is to so many veterans who have \nserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1645 to Amendment No. 1463\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up the following amendment: Markey No. 1645.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Markey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1645 to amendment No. 1463.\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that exports of crude oil to \n   United States allies and partners should not be determined to be \n consistent with the national interest if those exports would increase \nenergy prices in the United States for American consumers or businesses \n     or increase the reliance of the United States on imported oil)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING EXPORTS OF CRUDE OIL.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that exports of crude oil to \n     allies and partners of the United States should not be \n     determined to be consistent with the national interest and \n     the purposes of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 6201 et seq.) if those exports would increase energy \n     prices in the United States for American consumers or \n     businesses or increase the reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil.\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, what we are about to do is have a \ndiscussion about whether the United States of America should start \nexporting our oil--exporting our oil.\n  The United States right now, along with China, is the largest \nimporter of oil in the world. We are not exactly at but very near to \nthe level of imports of oil in our country that we were back in 1975 \nwhen we put a ban on the exportation of oil in our country.\n  Why is that important? It is important for a lot of reasons. No. 1, \nif we begin to export our oil in the United States, a new Barclays \nreport found that the U.S. consumer last year saved $11.4 billion at \nthe pump because of the lowest U.S. crude prices in a long time, and we \nwould potentially save upwards of $10 billion in prices for consumers \nat the pump in the United States of America.\n  We understand the oil industry. Here is what happens. The world price \nis set. It is called the Brent price. The Brent price is the world \nprice of oil. That price is traditionally higher, much higher than the \nprice of crude oil in the United States that is produced in the United \nStates. That is West Texas intermediate. That is a price set in \nCushing, OK.\n  If you are an oil company, you want to get our U.S. crude out on the \nworld market because they will then be able to sell it for a much \nhigher price. What is wrong with that? What is wrong with that is that \nthe American consumers will not get that oil at the lower price, and we \nwill still have to import oil into our country because we are still \nshort by millions of barrels of oil per day.\n  The consumer in America is the one who will be paying this tax on \ntheir price at the pump. That is the essence of what this whole \nstrategy is about. It is to get the oil companies the highest price for \nthe oil which is on the world market. But who is going to pay? Who is \ngoing to have their pockets tipped upside down at the pump and have \nmoney shaken out of them so they have to pay a higher price? It will be \nthe consumers.\n  If we want to give more money to the defense budget, let's just do \nit. Let's have a big debate about increasing the defense budget. Let's \nhave that debate. But let's not have the American consumer at the pump \nbe a special tax that is imposed in order to help our allies overseas. \nUltimately, of course, there is a beautiful access there where the oil \nindustry is saying: Yes, sir, we are willing to put our crude oil on \nships and send it overseas.\n  It is just a bad, bad economic policy for our country. We are already \npaying a high price at home. This exportation of our oil would also \ndefy what our own Department of Energy is saying. Our Department of \nEnergy is saying that in 2020, our oil production in America is going \nto peak, and then we are going to begin to go down once again in our \noil production.\n  Who is saying this? Our Government. Who is saying this? The Energy \nInformation Administration of the United States of America. What we are \nengaging in here is a premature attempt to export oil with the \nlikelihood that by 2019 and 2020 our oil production is going to start \nto go down again.\n  It also hurts our domestic oil refining industry. The Energy \nInformation Administration has found that lifting this ban on the \nexportation of our own domestic crude could lead to a fundamental \nreduction in the amount of investment made by the American refining \nindustry here on our own soil. Some $9 billion less would be invested \nbecause the oil would be sent overseas. The crude oil would get refined \noverseas. It would not be refined here in our own country with American \nworkers and American companies doing it here on our own soil, helping \nour economy here.\n  This decision, by the way, that Members are going to be asked to make\n\n[[Page S3741]]\n\ntoday is opposed by the AFL-CIO, it is opposed by the steel workers, it \nis opposed by the League of Conservation Voters, by the Sierra Club, by \nPublic Citizen, and by an entire group of American refiners.\n  This is no radical coalition that has been put together. It is a \nbroad base of interest in our own country that wants to make America \nstronger. How in the world can we be strong if we are exporting oil \nwhile we are still importing oil? We will have to import the same \namount that we are now exporting under this amendment that is being \nmade by the Senator from Texas, and we will wind up with, ultimately, \nthe price being paid by the American consumer at the pump.\n  From my perspective, this is about as desperate an attempt as the oil \nindustry can have to get out from underneath the 1975 law. They have \nbeen looking for an opportunity. But, obviously, the instability in the \nMiddle East should make us very cautious at this time. The oil fields \nof Saudi Arabia are now very vulnerable. They are right on the border. \nThe Houthis being supported by Iran, right at the bottom of the Red \nSea, makes that juncture very vulnerable to a cutoff of oil coming into \nthe world economy. This Shiite-Sunni war is something that we have to \nbe very conscious of because ISIS is targeting those areas in Syria, in \nIraq, and in Yemen that have oil resources.\n  We need a big debate in our country about oil and war in the Middle \nEast. We are at a pivotal point here where the Ottoman Empire and all \nof the lines that were drawn 100 years ago are being erased and with \nthat the protection of oil resources in the Middle East.\n  We should not just have a debate on the Senate floor about cavalierly \nlifting the ban on the exportation of oil. We should have a debate \nabout what this war in country after country and oil area after oil \narea means for our country.\n  I would say to you that we should err in a way that is going to \nprotect our own economy. That is what makes us strong. That is what \nmakes it possible for us to project the power around the world. It is \nthat we are the strongest economy in the world, and the indispensable \nlife's blood of economic growth is low-energy cost for every single \nindustry and every single consumer. It puts more money in their \npockets.\n  This decision that the amendment of the Senator from Texas asks us to \nmake will send us in the wrong direction. This is a disaster for \nconsumers in our country. It is a disaster for the refiners in our \ncountry, and it is a disaster for the national security of our country. \nWe should keep our resources here at home for American families, \nAmerican businesses, to enhance our national security using America and \nour economy as the basis for how we project power around the world. For \nevery barrel of oil that we export, we are going to have to import \nanother barrel of oil from some other place.\n  We should have the debate here on the Senate floor about where that \noil will be coming back into our country because we still need 3 \nmillion, 4 million extra barrels of oil a day. That is a national \nsecurity consideration that we have to deal with. Which country are we \ngoing to call up? Which country are we going to ask to send us their \noil? What are the implications for our national security of having \nphone calls go to country after country--probably not just the oil \ncompanies but our government beginning new negotiations to get even \nmore oil to come here as we export the oil that we should be keeping \nhere.\n  The Saudis have been our friends, historically. We have no guarantee \nthat the Saudis are going to even be running that country. Let's be \nhonest about it. Let's talk about that. Let's debate it. ISIS has taken \nover oil fields in Syria. ISIS has taken over areas of oil production \nin Iraq. Let's have a debate about that. That is what we should be \ndebating. How is that oil now funding ISIS? How is that oil now being \nused by Iran, potentially, in Yemen and in other parts of the world to \nundermine American interests?\n  In one part of the world, Yemen, we want to back the Sunnis against \nthe Shiites. In Iran, we are backing moderate Sunnis against Shiites. \nIn Iraq we are backing the Shiites against radical Sunnis, trying to \nget moderate Sunnis to help us. All of it, by the way, is with oil as--\nif not the central issue, then one of--the central issues in each one \nof these countries. To have a resolution here today and to be saying \nthat we should be exporting oil--no, ladies and gentlemen, that is not \nhow we should be discussing this issue.\n  How did we get into the Middle East? We got into the Middle East, \nyes, protecting Israel, but we got in because of our addiction to oil--\nnot my words, President Bush's words. We have to break our dependence \nupon imported oil. Increasing fuel economy standards is a big part of \nit. Having this fracking revolution continue to produce more oil here \ndomestically is a big part of it. Investing in renewables and energy \nefficiency is a big part of it. But we are still at the earliest stages \nof this strategy. When we have completed it, when we know we are \nsuccessful, then let's talk about the generosity that we are going to \nexpect from American consumers at the pump to pay higher prices for \ngasoline.\n  Again, this is an issue that the American people overwhelmingly want \nto see resolved in a way that keeps American oil in America. If we are \ngoing to continue to export young men and women from America over to \nthe Middle East, then we should not be exporting our oil at the same \ntime. That makes no sense--no sense. It is disrespectful to the \nsacrifice young men and women are making in the Middle East in order to \nprotect our interests to start an economic policy of exporting imported \noil while we still need to import it.\n  This issue, to me, is central to our overall long-term national \nsecurity and economic interests, and I urge an aye vote on the \namendment.\n  I ask for a rollcall on the amendment, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               ObamaCare\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, this morning, Majority Leader \nMcConnell spoke about the skyrocketing costs, the broken promises, and \nthe repeated failures of the President's health care law. He pointed \nout specifically how so many Americans are facing double-digit premium \nincreases because of ObamaCare. In his home State of Kentucky, some \npeople face proposed increases as high as 25 percent. He noted that \nsome people in Indiana could be hit with a 46-percent jump in their \npremiums.\n  So how did Democratic Leader Reid respond to the news of double-digit \npremium increases? He said people are extremely satisfied with health \ncare. He said the people Majority Leader McConnell spoke about are \nhaving increases that are ``very, very minimal.'' I wish to repeat \nthat. The Democratic leader, on the floor of the Senate today, called \npremium increases of 25 and 46 percent very, very minimal. What world \nis he living in? How on Earth can Senate Democrats believe Americans \nare satisfied with their health care when they are facing double-digit \npremium increases? How on Earth can the Senate Democratic leader \nbelieve these increases are very, very minimal? They are shocking.\n  The Democrats have their head in the sand about the health care law. \nWe can pick up Investor's Business Daily, Monday, June 1: ``ObamaCare \nDeductibles Soaring to $6,500 for Silver-Level Plan.''\n  Pick up the Wall Street Journal, Friday, May 22: ``Health Insurers \nSeek Big Increases.''\n  Investor's Business Daily today: ``ObamaCare Enrollment Mystery: 2 \nMillion Young Adults Missing.'' They are not signing up, and there are \nplenty of good reasons why. It is not because it is a good deal for \nthem.\n  No matter how bad it gets, no matter how unaffordable it is, \nPresident Obama and the Democrats in Congress absolutely refuse to face \nthe reality. They refuse to help Americans who continue to be hurt by \nthis law.\n\n[[Page S3742]]\n\n  I wish to speak a little bit about the reality of the law and why \nRepublicans are committed to helping all Americans finally have access \nto affordable care.\n  We all remember when President Obama promised that his health care \nlaw would cause insurance premiums to go down--down--by an average of \n$2,500 per year, per family. So where do we stand now? A couple of \nweeks ago was the deadline for insurance companies to say what they \nintended to charge people for health care next year. This is the first \ntime companies have been able to set their prices based on a full year \nof information about how much ObamaCare actually costs. From what we \nhave seen so far, the cost is enormous. A lot of Americans are going to \nbe shocked by how much more their health insurance will be.\n  These higher premiums are just the latest evidence that ObamaCare is \nan expensive failure. We have seen reports about the largest insurance \ncompany in New Mexico saying it wants to raise rates by almost 52 \npercent next year. The biggest insurer in Tennessee wants to raise its \nrates 36 percent. In Maryland, the largest insurer is planning to \nincrease premiums by more than 30 percent. Yet, we hear Senator Reid on \nthe floor of the Senate this morning saying these things don't matter.\n  People who are in the President's home State of Illinois right now \nare facing an average premium increase of 30 percent. It seems as \nthough there is another headline every day about how expensive health \ncare insurance is becoming.\n  The Wall Street Journal Tuesday: ``Insurers Seek Big Premium \nIncreases.''\n  I know there are some supporters of the law who like to say lots of \npeople have insurance under ObamaCare. How many of them are actually \ngoing to be paying these double-digit rate increases next year because \nof ObamaCare? That is what Americans want to know.\n  On Monday, the Obama administration released information on rate \nhikes for people living in about 41 States. It turns out that 676 \ndifferent insurance plans--different ObamaCare insurance plans--offered \nfor sale in these 41 States plan to raise their rates by double \ndigits--by at least double digits. The average increase is 21 percent. \nAbout 6 million people getting their insurance from these plans will \nface double-digit rate increases next year. Do Democrats who voted for \nObamaCare think a 21-percent rate increase is affordable? Do they think \na double-digit premium increase will help these 6 million hard-working \nAmericans?\n  These numbers are so large, it is hard to even understand what they \nmean for a typical person. What does it mean that health insurance \npolicies in Maryland might have an average rate increase of 30 percent? \nHow does that impact someone's life, their quality of life?\n  Let's say there is a 40-year-old nonsmoker living in Annapolis, MD. \nHe buys a silver plan from CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, which is the \nbiggest insurer in Maryland and the most popular kind of plan. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal study, those rates would go from \nabout $2,900 for the year to nearly $3,700 next year. That is an $800-\na-year increase. The President promised it would go down $2,500, and \nnow it has gone up $800. That is how expensive ObamaCare has become. It \nis far more costly than people thought it was going to be, than the \ninsurers thought it was going to cost, and far more costly than the \nAmerican people were told it was going to be.\n  I have heard some Democrats who support this law say these are just \nthe requested rates. They say we shouldn't worry because State \ninsurance agencies won't allow these huge rate increases to take \neffect. Well, CareFirst, the company in Maryland that wants a 30-\npercent rate increase next year, raised its rates 16 percent last year. \nHard-working people across the country are going to have to pay these \nenormous premiums because the President mandates they buy it. And many \nof them still won't be able to actually use their insurance because the \ndeductibles and the copays are so high. This year, the average \ndeductible for an ObamaCare silver plan is almost $3,000 per person and \nmore than $6,000 per family.\n  One has to ask, why are costs going up so much so fast? That is what \na radio station in Kansas City, MO, KCUR-FM, asked. They reported last \nweek, on May 27, that premiums for some plans in Kansas are going to go \nup 38 percent. According to the radio station, the increases ``appear \nto be driven by requirements in the Affordable Care Act, also known as \nObamacare.'' That is what they report.\n\n  The Kansas State Insurance Department said it was because of things \nlike all of the coverage mandates in the law. Families are now paying \nfor coverage that is more than they need, more than they want, and more \nthan they can afford. A spokesman for the State insurance agency in the \nState of Kansas told the radio station, ``These things cost money.''\n  What do people think about these enormous increases in their \npremiums? Are people happy because of all the extra money they have to \npay because of Obamacare?\n  Let's look at Connecticut. In Connecticut, they have been writing to \nthe State insurance department, and they are angry and frustrated about \nthe Obamacare price hikes.\n  One person wrote, ``I find it outrageous that the rates for 2016 are \ngoing to increase by 6.7 percent,'' which was the request in \nConnecticut. The person goes on:\n\n       Where do you think that I am going to get that money? I do \n     not get a raise every year based on your ``every year'' rate \n     increases.\n\n  So this is somebody who is having a hard time with a rate increase of \nonly 6.7 percent. Imagine how tough it is going to be for families all \naround the country who will have to pay 20 or 30 or 40 percent more \nnext year for their Obamacare-mandated insurance. Thousands of families \nacross the country are facing these shocking rate increases, and it \nmight be just the beginning.\n  Sometime this month, the Supreme Court is expected to decide an \nimportant case called King v. Burwell. This case is about the subsidies \nsome people get to pay Obamacare's alarmingly high costs. The health \ncare law said that Washington could subsidize the premiums of people \nwho buy insurance through its exchanges established by the States. \nPresident Obama knew that wouldn't be enough because he knew his law \nwas going to make insurance premiums skyrocket, so he told his \nadministration to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize insurance in the \nFederal exchange as well. Democrats in Congress wrote the law to allow \nsubsidies for one group, and then the President then decided to pay \nthem out for another group. So if the Supreme Court decides that the \nPresident overstepped his authority, there are going to be a lot of \npeople who could be facing paying the full cost of their Obamacare \nplans without the subsidy. They are going to see just how expensive \nthis Obamacare insurance is and just how destructive the Democrats' \nhealth care law has been.\n  Let's face it. In spite of what the minority leader says on the floor \nof the Senate, Obamacare has been a disaster. It is bad for patients. \nIt is bad for providers. It has been terrible for the American \ntaxpayers, hard-working Americans who work every day to try to put food \non the table and pay their taxes.\n  Republicans are offering better solutions, real solutions that will \nend these outrageous and expensive Obamacare side effects. That means \ngiving Americans freedom, choice, and control over their health care \ndecisions. Republicans understand that hard-working American families \ncan't afford Obamacare any longer.\n  Democrats need to admit that their health care law has been and \ncontinues to be an expensive failure. If they are ready to do that, \nthen Republicans will work with them to help give people the care they \nneed from a doctor they choose at lower cost.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam President, I rise today to speak on my \namendment No. 1578, the Military Justice Improvement Act, to ensure \nthat survivors of military sexual assault have access to an unbiased \nand professionalized military justice system.\n  Last year, despite earning the support of 55 Senators--a coalition \nspanning the entire ideological spectrum,\n\n[[Page S3743]]\n\nincluding both the majority and minority leader--our bill to create an \nindependent military justice system, free of the inherent bias and \nconflicts of interest within the chain of command, fell short of \novercoming the 60-vote filibuster threshold. But, as we said then, we \nwill not walk away. We will continue to fight to strengthen our \nmilitary because that is our duty.\n  It is our oversight role in Congress to act as if the brave survivors \nare our sons and daughters, our spouses who are being betrayed by the \ngreatest military on Earth. We owe them at least that.\n  Over the last few years, Congress has forced the military to make \nmany incremental changes to address this crisis. After two decades of \ncomplete failure and lipservice to ``zero tolerance,'' the military now \nsays essentially: Trust us. We have got this.\n  They spin the data, hoping nobody will dig below the top line because \nwhen you do, the clear conclusion is that survivors still have little \nfaith in the system and that the military has not actually made a dent \nin the problem. Even after much-lauded reforms, the estimate for 2014 \nis 20,000 cases of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact--the same \nlevel as 2010--an average of 52 a day. A much-touted reform made \nretaliation a crime. That made a lot of sense, but a sky-high 62-\npercent retaliation rate remains unchanged from 2 years ago.\n  The system remains plagued with distrust and does not provide the \nfair and just process the survivors deserve. Simply put, the military \nhas not held up to the standards posed by General Dempsey 1 year ago \nwhen he said, ``We are on the clock if you will . . . the President \nsaid to us in December, you've got about a year to review this thing . \n. . and if we haven't been able to demonstrate we are making a \ndifference, you know, then we deserve to be held to the scrutiny and \nstandard.''\n  So I am urging my colleagues to hold the military to that standard. \nEnough is enough with the spin, the excuses, and the promises, because \nthroughout the last year, we have continued to see new evidence of how \nmuch further we actually have to go to solve this problem.\n  We have a very simple choice. We can keep waiting, hoping that the \nreforms we put in place--that we actually forced the military to put in \nplace--will somehow restore trust in the system, while an average of 52 \nnew lives are shattered every day, three-quarters of whom will never \ncome forward because they see what happens around them and they don't \ntrust the system and don't see how justice is possible because \ncommanders hold all the cards, or we can do the right thing and act.\n  We can accept a system where, according to the DOD themselves, three \nout of four servicewomen and nearly half of servicemen say sexual \nharassment is common or very common or we can do the right thing and \nact.\n  We can accept a system where women who were sexually harassed were \n1,400 percent more likely to be sexually assaulted that same year or we \ncan act.\n  We can accept a climate where supervisors and unit leaders were \nresponsible for sexual harassment and gender discrimination in nearly \n60 percent of all cases or we can act.\n  My friends, I believe it is time that we provide our servicemembers \nwith an unbiased justice system, one that is professionalized, where \nthe decisionmaker is trained in military justice. It is time to finally \nlisten to the survivors who have told us over and over again that this \nreform is required to instill long-lost confidence in the system.\n  It is very much time to do the right thing and act because every time \nwe look at this problem, it seems to get worse. My office just reviewed \n107 sexual assault case files from the largest base in each of the \nservices. We requested these files, and that was for 1 year of sexual \nassaults. We requested the data to understand what actually happens \nonce the reports are filed, how they are investigated, and how they \nmove forward within the military justice system to see if there is any \nother challenges we have to address. It took the Pentagon a year to \nrespond to my document request. These 107 files are just a snapshot of \nthe thousands of estimated cases that occur annually.\n  What we found, which was unexpected, was an alarming rate of assaults \namong two survivor groups who are not represented in the DOD survey. \nThe DOD survey is all servicemembers. But what we found is that \ncivilian women and military spouses are not counted in that survey, and \nof these 107 cases, in 53 percent of them, the survivor was either a \nmilitary spouse or a civilian. These two categories of survivors are \nhidden in the shadows.\n  According to the DOD themselves, the real scope of this problem, \nunfortunately, is much larger than the 20,000 that were estimated for \nlast year alone. These obviously aren't just numbers; these are real \nlives being broken, and they deserve a fair shot at justice.\n  It should disturb everyone in this Chamber that instead of hope for \njustice at these four military bases, nearly half of the survivors who \ninitially filed a complaint--some of them going through the medical \nexam, going through testimony, going through evidence--nearly half who \nfiled withdrew their complaint during the process before trial. What \ndoes that tell us? Is there a form of retaliation taking place? Is it \njust a lack of faith in the system? To have about half of these cases \nnot move forward is very troubling.\n  Even when a case did move forward, just over 20 percent of them went \nto trial, and only 10 percent of these cases resulted in sexual assault \nconvictions with penalties of confinement and dishonorable discharge. \nTen percent. Only 10 percent ended in conviction. The cases that did \nproceed to trial but failed to obtain a sexual assault conviction \ntypically resulted in a more lenient penalty, such as reduction in rank \nor docked pay.\n  There was a new report published by the Human Rights Watch. They \nissued a report which told us that servicemembers who reported a sexual \nassault were 12 times more likely to suffer retaliation than to see \ntheir offender get convicted of the sexual offense. Let me repeat that. \nA survivor who reports a sexual assault is 12 times more likely to see \nretaliation than to see justice. How can anyone say this is a system \nour survivors can actually have faith in?\n  Despite the DOD's reported 62 percent retaliation rate--and this is \nso troubling--there was not evidence of a single serious disciplinary \naction against anyone for retaliation. Not one. There was not one \ndisciplinary action for 62 percent of survivors who were retaliated \nagainst. That borders on the impossible. But the reality is, without \nindependent review, we are actually relying on commanders to charge \nthemselves with retaliation. It doesn't make any sense.\n  According to the DOD's own SAPRO report, retaliation remains at 62 \npercent for women. Over one-third experienced administrative action, \nand 40 percent faced other forms of professional retaliation. That \nmeans your job changes in some meaningful way.\n  DOD admits they have made zero progress since 2012.\n  The carefully crafted and widely bipartisan Military Justice \nImprovement Act is designed to reduce the systemic failure that \nsurvivors of military sexual assault describe, in deciding whether to \nreport the crimes committed against them, due to the bias and inherent \nconflicts of interest posed by the military chain of command's current \nsole decisionmaking power over whether a case moves forward. This \nreform actually protects both the victim and the accused. We do not \nwant to see an innocent person convicted any more than we want to see a \nguilty person go free.\n  Due process, professionalism, training, equal opportunity to justice \nis how we restore a broken system. It is time to move the sole \ndecisionmaking power over whether serious crimes akin to a felony go to \ntrial from the chain of command into the hands of nonbiased, \nprofessionally trained military prosecutors, where it belongs. And we \ndo this while leaving military crime in the chain of command. So we \ncompletely carve-out anything that is military-related, such as missing \nin action or not honoring a command. In fact, the decision whether to \nprosecute the vast majority of crimes, including 37 serious crimes \nuniquely military in nature, plus all punishable crimes that have less \nthan a year of confinement as a penalty, remain in the chain of \ncommand.\n  The brave men and women we sent to war to keep us safe deserve \nnothing\n\n[[Page S3744]]\n\nless than a justice system that is actually equal to their sacrifice. \nWe owe that at least to them.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1521\n\n  Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise in support of the NDAA that is on \nthe floor now but also in strong support of an amendment that has been \noffered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island to the NDAA. Actually, I have a \ndeja vu feeling in the speech, because the speech is largely about what \nI gave as my maiden speech in February of 2013; that is, the BCA budget \ncaps and sequester.\n  To begin, before I focus on the amendment from my colleague from \nRhode Island, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, I do \nthink there is a lot of good policy in the NDAA. We worked on it \ntogether. That committee process is a productive one. I think we always \nfind a great degree of bipartisanship as we are trying to tackle the \nprogrammatic description of our Nation's military budget and support. \nThere is much good policy, acquisition reform, and other key reforms \nthat are part of this budget. There are some items that I feel very \nstrongly about dealing with shipbuilding and ship repair.\n  I think it is great that we are having the debate on the floor. We \nhave had NDAAs passed, but we have not had a lot of floor time on them \nin 2013 and 2014. So the fact that we have are having this debate about \nthe critical nature of our Nation's defense and the authorizing bill on \nthe floor is very positive.\n  There are some aspects of the NDAA that I do not like. There are some \nitems that I wish were in there but that are not. That is part of the \nprocess. I think we could all say that, but I am glad we are having the \ndebate on the floor. However, the item that is in the NDAA that I have \nthe greatest concern about is the use of what I consider a flagrant \nbudget gimmick to sneak by defense spending caps that were imposed by \nthe 2011 Budget Control Act.\n  I think the gimmick is a serious one and a challenging one. The \ngimmick is dishonest. It is bad for the Nation's defense. It is also \nbad for America's nondefense priorities.\n  The good news is that the budget can be fixed. My colleague from \nRhode Island, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, has a \nproposal to fix it. The proposal was offered in committee and rejected, \nand it has been offered again on the floor. I want to describe it and \nexplain why I strongly support it.\n  First, there is the gimmick itself. Just for the public on this, in \nAugust of 2011, before either I or the Presiding officer were in the \nbody, Congress passed the Budget Control Act that imposed a set of \ndraconian budget caps on defense and nondefense spending as a \npunishment, in case Congress did not find a grand budget deal. So the \nwisdom of this body at the time was that we will sort of punish \nourselves unless we can find a budget deal. I describe that \ncolloquially as if we don't do something smart, we will do something \nstupid.\n  Well, Congress did not do something smart. There wasn't the grand \nbudget deal that many hoped there would be. So on March 1, 2013, budget \ncaps went into effect that put a significant crimp in both the defense \nand nondefense items in the Nation's budget. The first speech I gave on \nthe floor was in February 2013. After my first State recess week, I \ntraveled around and I heard my constituents talk about how bad these \ncaps would be, especially for the Nation's defense. I stood up and just \nshared what my constituents had described to me. But, nevertheless, the \ncaps went into effect and we agreed, through the early 2020s, to limit \nin a very significant and tough way both defense and nondefense \nspending.\n  So what is the gimmick that is in this NDAA that is on the floor \ntoday?\n  A decision was made that the world has changed since August 2011. \nISIL has grown up and is gobbling up acres and square miles of \nterritory. We are battling against Ebola, as we were earlier in the \nyear. North Korea is cyber-attacking major American corporations. \nVladimir Putin has moved into Ukraine and is threatening other nations.\n  There are a lot of challenges. So it was the wisdom first of the \nPresident, in submitting the fiscal year 2016 budget, and then of the \nArmed Services Committee that living under the sequester defense caps \nwas a bad idea. It would be a bad idea for the Nation. But instead of \njust saying: OK, the caps are a bad idea; let's adjust the cap--which \nwe can do with 60 votes in this body and the concurrence of the House--\na decision was made: Let's not adjust the cap, let's end-run the cap.\n  So we want to exceed the cap. We want to exceed it by $38 billion in \nfiscal year 2016. But rather than adjust the cap, let's do this: Let's \njust take $38 billion that the Nation needs to be safe, and we will put \nit in what is called the OCO account, Overseas Contingency Operations. \nIt is something that is not subject to the cap. It is supposed to be \nused for core warfighting activity. But the $38 billion does not \nrepresent core warfighting.\n  We spent $2 billion in the last year, for example, in the war on \nISIL. We are not going to spend $38 billion in the next year. No, \ninstead, we are going to fund all kinds of nonemergency, \nnoncontingency, nonwarfighting expenditures that would require an \nadjustment of the cap, and we are just going to put them into the OCO \naccount, kind of a slush fund. By doing that, we end-run the law of \nCongress, the Budget Control Act.\n  I asserted, and I strongly believe, that this is dishonest, it is bad \nfor defense, and it is bad for the nondefense accounts. It is \ndishonest. It is dishonest because, if we need this money for defense, \nwe should fix the budget control caps. That is what we should do. We \nshould not call expenditures for daily operations that are not core \nwarfighting part of the OCO account. That violates the way the OCO \naccount has been treated.\n  Once we go down that path, we are going to see everything going into \nthe OCO account, and we will really end-run. So we are not being honest \nwith ourselves, but especially, since we all know what the game is, we \nare not being honest with the public.\n  Second, putting this money, the $38 billion, in the OCO account is \nbad for defense. Defense needs the ability to plan. If we put the money \nin the OCO account, is it going to be here next year? Is it not going \nto be here? There is sort of a wink and a nod that it will probably be \nhere. We ought to be acknowledging that these funds are needed in the \nbase defense budget so that our DOD personnel can plan that it will be \nthere in the future, because that is probably our intent. It is bad for \ndefense to put this in this OCO account.\n  Third, it is bad for the nondefense accounts. If we are going to say \nthat the BCA caps are bad, we should adjust them. Instead of using an \nend run, let's adjust them. Let's adjust them not just for the defense \naccounts but also for the nondefense accounts, because, as the \nPresiding Officer and my colleagues here know, the nondefense accounts \nare critical to the Nation's defense.\n  The FBI is nondefense. It is critical to the Nation's defense. \nHomeland Security is critical to the Nation's defense. In the \nDepartment of Energy, much of the research we do is for the reactors on \nnuclear carriers and nuclear subs. Those get cut by budget cups. They \nare critical to defense. We ought to be lifting the caps on the \nnondefense accounts, as well.\n  So the gimmick that is used is a gimmick. It is dishonest. It hurts \ndefense. It hurts nondefense accounts that are important to the Nation. \nGood news--there is a solution. We are doing this because we do not \nlike the budget caps. That is why we are doing this. That is why we are \nusing the OCO gimmick. If we don't like the budget caps, we should fix \nthem. We should find the 2015 version of the Murray-Ryan budget deal \nthat was reached in December of 2013, where we agreed to adjust the \nbudget caps. That deal accepted part of sequester. It absorbed \nsequester cuts. But it also found targeted ways to provide relief, both \nto defense and nondefense accounts. That is what we should be doing. We \nshould be showing the same leadership that was shown in 2013.\n\n[[Page S3745]]\n\n  I rise to say that the amendment that my colleague from Rhode Island, \nour ranking member, proposes does exactly that. It does exactly that. \nIt takes the $38 billion that is in our budget, which I believe should \nbe spent on defense, and it says that this money should be spent on \ndefense, but it should be spent the right way, as part of a base \nbudget, not as part of OCO.\n  It puts a fence around those dollars and says that the money is \nthere, and it is there for defense because the Nation needs it. But the \nfence will keep the money from being utilized until we fix the BCA caps \non both the defense and nondefense accounts.\n  If we do fix the BCA caps, that money will be available. Because of \nlanguage included by the chair of the committee in the markup, fixing \nthe budget caps would move the money from the OCO account into the \ndefense base budget where it should be. I think we all know what the \nright answer is here, which is for this $38 billion to be used to \nprotect the Nation but to be part of the base budget, not the OCO \naccount. To get there we need to fix the BCA caps across the board for \ndefense and nondefense. The Reed amendment would accomplish that. That \nis the reason that I am on the floor today, to praise the debate on the \nNDAA but to say this is the right way to keep our Nation safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 \np.m. today, the Senate vote in relation to the following amendments: \nShaheen No. 1494, spouse definition; Tillis No. 1506, C-130 aircraft; \nfurther, that there be no second-degree amendments in order to any of \nthose amendments prior to the votes, and that the Shaheen amendment be \nsubject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold for adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Paul of Kentucky, I \nask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment in order to \ncall up amendment No. 1543.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise with my friend from Arizona, \nSenator Flake, to speak about an amendment that he and I and Senator \nBlumenthal from Connecticut have as part of this pending legislation.\n  Along with sports fans across America, I was appalled to learn last \nmonth that many of the ceremonies honoring members of our armed \nservices at NFL games are not actually being conducted out of a sense \nof patriotism but for profit in the form of millions of dollars in \ntaxpayers' money going from the Department of Defense to wealthy NFL \nfranchises.\n  In fact, NFL teams have received nearly $7 million in taxpayer \ndollars over the last 3 years from contracts with the Army National \nGuard, which include public tributes to American soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines. Our amendment would put an end to this shameful \npractice and ask the NFL to return those profits to charities \nsupporting our troops, veterans, and their families.\n  All Americans can agree that sports unite us, especially football. \nFor generations, football has brought together people from every walk \nof life--from the first organized American football game between \nRutgers and Princeton in 1869 to Super Bowl XLIX played in the great \nState of Arizona this February, which attracted more than 100 million \ntelevision viewers, the most watched TV program in history.\n  Football has been a uniting force for our Nation. Every weekend, from \npeewee to high school, college, and the NFL, for good seasons and bad, \nin common cause and bitter rivalry, millions of passionate fans have \nbonded together. For many Americans, football is deeply patriotic and \nwoven into the very fabric of our country's unique history and \nheritage. For several weeks every fall, this patriotic spirit grows \nwhen the NFL takes time to honor the service and sacrifice of the brave \nyoung Americans serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Teams wear special camouflage uniforms, hold special game-day \nprogramming under the theme ``Salute to Service.'' We have all been \nheartened by these patriotic displays, from the giant oversized flags \nand color guard pregame performances to half time tributes to our \nhometown heroes. Every fan, whether united by team or divided by \nrivalry, comes together to thank those who have served and sacrificed \non our Nation's behalf.\n  That is why I and so many other Americans were shocked and \ndisappointed to learn that several NFL teams were not sponsoring these \nactivities out of the goodness of their own hearts but were doing so to \nmake an extra buck, taking money from American taxpayers in exchange \nfor honoring American troops. That means many of the color guard \nperformances and troop recognition ceremonies were actually funded with \nAmerican tax dollars and pocketed by wealthy NFL teams.\n  For example, the Army National Guard spent $675,000 under contracts \nwith the New England Patriots--hardly a deprived franchise--that \nincluded a program called ``True Patriot,'' in which the team honored \nGuard soldiers at half-time shows during home games.\n  Other contracts funded color guard performances, flag ceremonies, and \nappearance fees to players for honoring local high school coaches and \nvisiting students.\n  According to the information my office has received from the Army \nNational Guard, the NFL received nearly $7 million in taxpayer dollars \nover the last 3 years from Guard contracts for activities including: \npregame color guard ceremonies, pregame reenlistment ceremonies, \npregame onfield American flag rollouts, ingame flag runners, half-time \nsoldier recognition ceremonies, Guard-sponsored high school Player of \nthe Week and Coach of the Week awards, and Guard-sponsored player \nappearances at local high schools.\n  The following teams had contracts in the past 3 years, according to \nthe Army National Guard: Atlanta Falcons, $579,500; Baltimore Ravens, \n$350,000; Buffalo Bills, $550,000; Chicago Bears, $443,000; Cincinnati \nBengals, $117,000; Dallas Cowboys, $262,500; Denver Broncos, $460,000; \nDetroit Lions, $193,000; Green Bay Packers, $300,000; Indianapolis \nColts, $400,000; Miami Dolphins, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Jacksonville \nJaguars, $160,000; Minnesota Vikings, $410,000; New Orleans Saints, \n$307,000; New York Jets, $212,500; Oakland Raiders, $275,000; \nPittsburgh Steelers, $217,000; St. Louis Rams and Kansas City Chiefs, \n$60,000; San Diego Chargers, $453,500; San Francisco 49ers, $125,000; \nand Seattle Seahawks, $393,500.\n  What makes these expenditures all the more troubling is at the same \ntime the Guard was spending millions on pro-sports advertising, it was \nalso running out of money for critical training for our troops. In \nfact, at the end of fiscal year 2014, the National Guard Bureau and \nArmy National Guard announced they were facing a $101 million shortfall \nin the account used to pay National Guardsmen and could face a delay in \ncritical training and drills because they couldn't afford to pay \nsoldiers. Despite the fact that the Guard was facing serious threats to \nmeeting its primary mission and paying its current soldiers, it was \nspending millions of taxpayer dollars on speakership and advertising \ndeals with professional sports leagues, such as the NFL.\n  This is obviously unacceptable. Providing for our common defense is \nthe highest duty of the Federal Government. At a time of crippling \nbudget cuts under sequestration, the Defense Department cannot afford \nto waste its limited resources for the benefit of sports leagues that \nrake in billions of dollars a year. Each of the four service Chiefs \nhave warned before the Senate Armed Services Committee this year that \nsequestration is damaging our military readiness and putting American \nlives in danger. We must conserve every precious defense dollar we have \nat our disposal--which the NDAA does through important reforms to \nacquisition, military retirement, personnel, headquarters and \nmanagement, and which our amendment would support by ending taxpayer-\nfunded soldier tributes at professional sporting events.\n\n[[Page S3746]]\n\n  In addition to ending this shameful practice, this amendment calls \nupon professional sports leagues like the NFL to donate--to donate--\nthese ill-gotten profits to charities supporting American troops, \nveterans, and their families.\n  The NFL raked in revenues totaling some $9.5 billion. The absolute \nleast they can do to begin to make up for this terrible misjudgment is \nto return those taxpayer dollars to charities supporting our troops, \nveterans, and military families.\n  I thank my fellow Senator from the State of Arizona, Jeff Flake, who \nhas done terrific oversight of this issue. He was the first to expose \nit and similar cases of wasteful and excessive government spending.\n  I also commend Senator Blumenthal for his longstanding commitment to \nour troops and veterans, as well as the other Members of this body who \nhave supported our amendment.\n  Again, I thank Jeff Flake, who was first to blow the whistle on this \negregious use of American tax dollars, and also Senator Blumenthal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. FLAKE. Madam President, I also thank the senior Senator from \nArizona for helping me bring this amendment forward. I am proud to \ncosponsor it with him and Senator Blumenthal.\n  I wish to make a couple of points. We have asked the Pentagon for a \nfull accounting, not just NFL teams but other teams that have received \nsuch money. We want to make sure this practice stops.\n  Part of the reason it needs to stop is these teams that were \nmentioned before by the senior Senator from Arizona and other teams \nthat have received this kind of money do a lot for the military out of \nthe goodness of their heart. They do a lot for the military and for \nveterans who return, and we shouldn't discount that and don't want to \ndiscount that.\n  The problem is, when some teams are accepting money to do what has \nbeen termed ``paid-for patriotism,'' then it cheapens all the other \ngood work that has been done by these sports teams and others. So it is \nimportant we stop this practice and make sure that when fans are there \nand they see this outpouring of support for the military, they know it \nis genuine--because there is a great deal of patriotism by those who \nattend these games. We want to make sure people recognize it is done \nfor the right reason, and that is the reason for bringing this \namendment forward.\n  I, again, thank the senior Senator from Arizona for his work on this \namendment and other efforts to fight wasteful spending, making sure \nthat the funding that goes to our military and that we appropriate for \nthe Department of Defense--authorize for the Department of Defense--is \nused for military purposes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I withdraw my request with respect to \namendment No. 1543. It is my understanding we will call up this \namendment after the votes this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's request is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1506\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I wish to comment briefly on the amendment \nproposed by my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Tillis, with \nrespect to the stationing of the C-130 aircraft at Pope Army Airfield \nin North Carolina.\n  The amendment states that these aircraft shall be positioned in Pope \nArmy Airfield. They are C-130 Avionics Modernization Program aircraft, \nthe AMP program. Basically, they are C-130H models that were upgraded. \nIn addition, the Air Force has C-130J models, the newest model. In the \ngive-and-take of the budget deliberations over the last few years, this \nAMP modernization program is essentially curtailed dramatically because \nthe choice was buying new J models or fixing the old H models.\n  So, in effect, what we have is a group of C-130 modified aircraft \nthat are at Little Rock Air Force Base. They are only being minimally \nmaintained because these AMP-modified aircraft are not standard. They \nare different from the traditional hotel model, and they are not as new \nor as modern as the J model, and they are not being supported with AMP-\ntrained crews or AMP-unique logistics. Logistically, they are at Little \nRock Air Force Base and sort of caught up in this funding and \nprogrammatic dilemma.\n  They are not fully deployable because of these conditions. They are \njust sort of additive to the force structure of the C-130J. There are \nonly three that are modified, with five more to be modified. That would \nbe at $8 million per aircraft for about an additional multimillion \ndollar pricetag. Therefore, they are not as functional as a unit since \nthere are only three aircraft and not a full complement. To operate \nthese aircraft would require additional resources.\n  The thrust of the gentleman's amendment is that these aircraft be \ntransferred to Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina, but they would \nnot really be effectively utilized by the forces there and would not, \nin my view at least, contribute to the training and the real-time \noperations of the 82nd Airborne Division, the XVIII Airborne Corps, and \nthe special operations forces that are there.\n  So rather than doing that, what we did in the underlying legislation \nat section 136 is to go through and quite clearly have a careful review \nof the adequacy of aircraft to support operations of the paratroop \nforces at Fort Bragg so that the Air Force is fully supportive of this \nvery important issue. The 82nd is America's most ready Army force, and \nof course we know special forces operators are all across the globe \nconstantly.\n  So my comments are that this amendment would not essentially help \nwhat I think is the underlying goal, which is to ensure that our \nairborne forces have the platforms necessary. It would, in fact, \nrestrict the flexibility of the Air Force in terms of using C-130 \naircraft. It would practically have the effect of simply taking \naircraft that because of their modification and their \nnonstandardization are being parked at Little Rock and moving them \nwithout effect, I think, on the operational capacity and capabilities \nof our airborne forces.\n  So as a result, I believe our best approach is to stay with the \nlanguage in the underlying bill, section 136, which--to the credit of \nSenator Tillis, he was very adamant about including--would have a \ncareful review of the operational capacity of the Air Force to support \nthe airborne operations.\n  It would include the ability of commanders from the corps level, \nXVIII Airborne Corps, 82nd, Special Operations Command, to comment \neffectively on whether the Air Force was doing this. After such a \nreview and analysis, we could make better decisions about the \nallocation of the Air Force aircraft.\n  Again, ironically--and again it strikes me that simply moving these \naircraft--which are sort of one-of-a-kind aircraft--to Pope would not \nhelp the airborne operations of our military forces. They would simply \ninvolve additional cost, and they would not be part of the ability of \nour Air Force and our mobility command to support a wide range of \nmissions. They would complicate, rather than simplify, our ability to \nrespond.\n  So for that, when this vote, which is scheduled later today, comes up \nfor a vote, I will oppose it, and I will do so because I believe--in \nthe underlying legislation, through the work of Senator Tillis \nparticularly--we have an appropriate response to the issue of \nflexibility, mobility, and operational capacity of our airborne forces \nat Fort Bragg.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Grieving for the Biden Family\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, when a child predeceases the parent, it is \na grievous occasion, and we have been grieving for the President of the \nSenate, the Vice President of the United States, for what he has been \ngoing through--his whole family.\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\n  It is my belief Joe Biden has known for some period of time the \nprogression of his son, Beau's, cancer and, as a result, he has \ncontinued to carry on his public duties while at the same time carrying \nthis huge burden.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe speech Joe Biden made to the Yale graduating class about 2 weeks \nago on Class Day.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks by the Vice President at Yale University Class Day, Yale \n                   University, New Haven, Connecticut\n\n       THE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Yale! (Applause.) Great to see \n     you all. (Applause.) Thank you very, very much.\n       Jeremy and Kiki, the entire Class of 2015, congratulations \n     and thank you for inviting me to be part of this special day. \n     You're talented. You've worked hard, and you've earned this \n     day.\n       Mr. President, faculty, staff, it's an honor to be here \n     with all of you.\n       My wife teaches full-time. I want you to know that--at a \n     community college, and has attended 8,640 commencements and/\n     or the similar versions of Class Day, and I know they can \n     hardly wait for the speaker to finish. (Laughter.) But I'll \n     do my best as quickly as I can.\n       To the parents, grandparents, siblings, family members, the \n     Class of 2015--congratulations. I know how proud you must be. \n     But, the Class of 2015, before I speak to you--please stand \n     and applaud the ones who loved you no matter what you're \n     wearing on your head and who really made this day happen. \n     (Laughter and applause.) I promise you all this is a bigger \n     day for them than it is for you. (Laughter.)\n       When President Obama asked me to be his Vice President, I \n     said I only had two conditions: One, I wouldn't wear any \n     funny hats, even on Class Day. (Laughter.) And two, I \n     wouldn't change my brand. (Applause.)\n       Now, look, I realize no one ever doubts I mean what I say, \n     the problem occasionally is I say all that I mean. \n     (Laughter.) I have a bad reputation for being straight. \n     Sometimes an inappropriate times. (Laughter.) So here it \n     goes. Let's get a couple things straight right off the bat: \n     Corvettes are better than Porsches; they're quicker and they \n     corner as well. (Laughter and applause.) And sorry, guys, a \n     cappella is not better than rock and roll. (Laughter and \n     applause.) And your pundits are better than Washington \n     pundits, although I've noticed neither has any shame at all. \n     (Laughter and applause.) And all roads lead to Toads? Give me \n     a break. (Laughter and applause.) You ever tried it on Monday \n     night? (Laughter.) Look, it's tough to end a great men's \n     basketball and football season. One touchdown away from \n     beating Harvard this year for the first time since 2006--so \n     close to something you've wanted for eight years. I can only \n     imagine how you feel. (Laughter.) I can only imagine. \n     (Applause.) So close. So close.\n       But I got to be honest with you, when the invitation came, \n     I was flattered, but it caused a little bit of a problem in \n     my extended family. It forced me to face some hard truths. My \n     son, Beau, the attorney general of Delaware, my daughter, \n     Ashley Biden, runs a nonprofit for criminal justice in the \n     state, they both went to Penn. My two nieces graduated from \n     Harvard, one an all-American. All of them think my being here \n     was a very bad idea. (Laughter.)\n       On the other hand, my other son, Hunter, who heads the \n     World Food Program USA, graduated from Yale Law School. \n     (Applause.) Now, he thought it's a great idea. But then \n     again, law graduates always think all of their ideas are \n     great ideas. (Laughter.)\n       By the way, I've had a lot of law graduates from Yale work \n     for me. That's not too far from the truth. But anyway, look, \n     the truth of the matter is that I have a lot of staff that \n     are Yale graduates, several are with me today. They thought \n     it was a great idea that I speak here.\n       As a matter of fact, my former national security advisor, \n     Jake Sullivan, who is teaching here at Yale Law School, \n     trained in international relations at Yale College, edited \n     the Yale Daily News, and graduated from Harvard--excuse me, \n     Freudian slip--Yale Law School. (Laughter.) You're lucky to \n     have him. He's a brilliant and decent and honorable man. And \n     I miss him. And we miss him as my national security advisor.\n       But he's not the only one. My deputy national security \n     advisor, Jeff Prescott, started and ran the China Law Center \n     at Yale Law School. My Middle East policy advisor and foreign \n     policy speechwriter, Dan Benaim, who is with me, took Daily \n     Themes--got a B. (Laughter.) Now you know why I go off script \n     so much. (Laughter and applause.)\n       Look, at a Gridiron Dinner not long ago, the President \n     said, I--the President--``I am learning to speak without a \n     teleprompter, Joe is learning to speak with one.'' \n     (Laughter.) But if you looked at my speechwriters, you know \n     why.\n       And the granddaughter of one of my dearest friends in \n     life--a former Holocaust survivor, a former foreign policy \n     advisor, a former Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs, Congressman Tom Lantos--is graduating today. \n     Mercina, congratulations, kiddo. (Applause.) Where are you? \n     You are the sixth--she's the sixth sibling in her immediate \n     family to graduate from Yale. Six out of 11, that's not a bad \n     batting average. (Laughter.) I believe it's a modern day \n     record for the number of kids who went to Yale from a single \n     family.\n       And, Mercina, I know that your mom, Little Annette is here. \n     I don't know where you are, Annette. But Annette was part of \n     the first class of freshman women admitted to Yale \n     University. (Applause.)\n       And her grandmother, Annette, is also a Holocaust survivor, \n     an amazing woman; and both I'm sure wherever they are, \n     beaming today. And I know one more thing, Mercina, your \n     father and grandfather are looking down, cheering you on.\n       I'm so happy to be here on your day and all of your day. \n     It's good to know there's one Yalie who is happy I'm being \n     here--be here, at least one. (Laughter.) On ``Overheard at \n     Yale,'' on the Facebook page, one student reported another \n     student saying: I had a dream that I was Vice President and \n     was with the President, and we did the disco funk dance to \n     convince the Congress to restart the government. (Laughter.)\n       Another student commented, Y'all know Biden would be \n     hilarious, get funky. (Laughter.)\n       Well, my granddaughter, Finnegan Biden, whose dad went \n     here, is with me today. When she saw that on the speech, I \n     was on the plane, Air Force Two coming up, she said, Pop, it \n     would take a lot more than you and the President doing the \n     disco funk dance. The Tea Party doesn't even know what it is. \n     (Laughter.)\n       Look, I don't know about that. But I'm just glad there's \n     someone--just someone--who dreams of being Vice President. \n     (Laughter and applause.) Just somebody. I never had that \n     dream. (Laughter.) For the press out there, that's a joke.\n       Actually, being Vice President to Barack Obama has been \n     truly a great honor. We both enjoy getting out of the White \n     House to talk to folks in the real America--the kind who know \n     what it means to struggle, to work hard, to shop at Kiko \n     Milano. (Laughter and applause.) Great choice. (Laughter.)\n       I just hope to hell the same people responsible for Kiko's \n     aren't in charge of naming the two new residential colleges. \n     (Laughter and applause.)\n       Now, look, folks, I spent a lot of time thinking about what \n     I should day to you today, but the more I thought about it, I \n     thought that any Class Day speech is likely to be redundant. \n     You already heard from Jessie J at Spring Fling. (Laughter.) \n     So what in the hell could I possibly say. (Laughter.)\n       Look, I'm deeply honored that Jeremy and Kiki selected me. \n     I don't know how the hell you trusted them to do that. \n     (Laughter.) I hope you agree with their choice. Actually I \n     hope by the end of this speech, they agree with their choice. \n     (Laughter.)\n       In their flattering invitation letter, they asked me to \n     bring along a sense of humor, speak about my commitment to \n     public service and family, talk about resiliency, compassion, \n     and leadership in a changing world. Petty tall order. \n     (Laughter.) I probably already flunked the first part of the \n     test.\n       But with the rest let me say upfront, and I mean this \n     sincerely, there's nothing particularly unique about me. With \n     regard to resilience and compassion, there are countless \n     thousands of people, maybe some in the audience, who've \n     suffered through personal losses similar to mine or much \n     worse with much less support to help them get through it and \n     much less reason to want to get through it.\n       It's not that all that difficult, folks, to be \n     compassionate when you've been the beneficiary of compassion \n     in your lowest moments not only from your family, but from \n     your friends and total strangers. Because when you know how \n     much it meant to you, you know how much it mattered. It's not \n     hard to be compassionate.\n       I was raised by a tough, compassionate Irish lady named \n     Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden. And she taught all of her \n     children that, but for the grace of God, there go you--but \n     for the grace of God, there go you.\n       And a father who lived his motto that, family was the \n     beginning, the middle, and the end. And like many of you and \n     your parents, I was fortunate. I learned early on what I \n     wanted to do, what fulfilled me the most, what made me \n     happy--my family, my faith, and being engaged in the public \n     affairs that gripped my generation and being inspired by a \n     young President named Kennedy--civil rights, the environment, \n     trying to end an incredibly useless and divisive war, \n     Vietnam.\n       The truth is, though, that neither I, nor anyone else, can \n     tell you what will make you happy, help you find success.\n       You each have different comfort levels. Everyone has \n     different goals and aspirations. But one thing I've observed, \n     one thing I know, an expression my dad would use often, is \n     real. He used to say, it's a lucky man or woman gets up in \n     the morning--and I mean this sincerely. It was one of his \n     expressions. It's a lucky man or woman gets up in the \n     morning, puts both feet on the floor, knows what they're \n     about to do, and thinks it still matters.\n       I've been lucky. And my wish for all of you is that not \n     only tomorrow, but 20 and 40 and 50 years from now, you've \n     found that sweet spot, that thing that allows you to get up \n     in the morning, put both feet on the floor, go out and pursue \n     what you love, and think it still matters.\n       Some of you will go to Silicon Valley and make great \n     contributions to empower individuals and societies and maybe \n     even design\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\n     a life-changing app, like how to unsubscribe to Obama for \n     America email list--(laughter)--the biggest ``pan-list'' of \n     all times.\n       Some of you will go to Wall Street and big Wall Street law \n     firms, government and activism, Peace Corps, Teach for \n     America. You'll become doctors, researchers, journalists, \n     artists, actors, musicians. Two of you--one of whom was one \n     of my former interns in the White House, Sam Cohen, and \n     Andrew Heymann--will be commissioned in the United States \n     Navy. Congratulations, gentlemen. We're proud of you. \n     (Applause.)\n       But all of you have one thing in common you will all seek \n     to find that sweet spot that satisfies your ambition and \n     success and happiness.\n       I've met an awful lot of people in my career. And I've \n     noticed one thing, those who are the most successful and the \n     happiest--whether they're working on Wall Street or Main \n     Street, as a doctor or nurse, or as a lawyer, or a social \n     worker, I've made certain basic observation about the ones \n     who from my observation wherever they were in the world were \n     able to find that sweet spot between success and happiness. \n     Those who balance life and career, who find purpose and \n     fulfillment, and where ambition leads them.\n       There's no silver bullet, no single formula, no reductive \n     list. But they all seem to understand that happiness and \n     success result from an accumulation of thousands of little \n     things built on character, all of which have certain common \n     features in my observation.\n       First, the most successful and happiest people I've known \n     understand that a good life at its core is about being \n     personal. It's about being engaged. It's about being there \n     for a friend or a colleague when they're injured or in an \n     accident, remembering the birthdays, congratulating them on \n     their marriage, celebrating the birth of their child. It's \n     about being available to them when they're going through \n     personal loss. It's about loving someone more than yourself, \n     as one of your speakers have already mentioned. It all seems \n     to get down to being personal.\n       That's the stuff that fosters relationships. It's the only \n     way to breed trust in everything you do in your life.\n       Let me give you an example. After only four months in the \n     United States Senate, as a 30-year-old kid, I was walking \n     through the Senate floor to go to a meeting with Majority \n     Leader Mike Mansfield. And I witnessed another newly elected \n     senator, the extremely conservative Jesse Helms, excoriating \n     Ted Kennedy and Bob Dole for promoting the precursor of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act. But I had to see the Leader, \n     so I kept walking.\n       When I walked into Mansfield's office, I must have looked \n     as angry as I was. He was in his late '70s, lived to be 100. \n     And he looked at me, he said, what's bothering you, Joe?\n       I said, that guy, Helms, he has no social redeeming value. \n     He doesn't care--I really mean it--I was angry. He doesn't \n     care about people in need. He has a disregard for the \n     disabled.\n       Majority Leader Mansfield then proceeded to tell me that \n     three years earlier, Jesse and Dot Helms, sitting in their \n     living room in early December before Christmas, reading an ad \n     in the Raleigh Observer, the picture of a young man, 14-\n     years-old with braces on his legs up to both hips, saying, \n     all I want is someone to love me and adopt me. He looked at \n     me and he said, and they adopted him, Joe.\n       I felt like a fool. He then went on to say, Joe, it's \n     always appropriate to question another man's judgment, but \n     never appropriate to question his motives because you simply \n     don't know his motives.\n       It happened early in my career fortunately. From that \n     moment on, I tried to look past the caricatures of my \n     colleagues and try to see the whole person. Never once have I \n     questioned another man's or woman's motive. And something \n     started to change. If you notice, every time there's a crisis \n     in the Congress the last eight years, I get sent to the Hill \n     to deal with it. It's because every one of those men and \n     women up there--whether they like me or not--know that I \n     don't judge them for what I think they're thinking.\n       Because when you question a man's motive, when you say \n     they're acting out of greed, they're in the pocket of an \n     interest group, et cetera, it's awful hard to reach \n     consensus. It's awful hard having to reach across the table \n     and shake hands. No matter how bitterly you disagree, though, \n     it is always possible if you question judgment and not \n     motive.\n       Senator Helms and I continued to have profound political \n     differences, but early on we both became the most powerful \n     members of the Senate running the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, as Chairmen and Ranking Members. But something \n     happened, the mutual defensiveness began to dissipate. And as \n     a result, we began to be able to work together in the \n     interests of the country. And as Chairman and Ranking Member, \n     we passed some of the most significant legislation passed in \n     the last 40 years.\n       All of which he opposed--from paying tens of millions of \n     dollars in arrearages to an institution, he despised, the \n     United Nations--he was part of the so-called ``black \n     helicopter'' crowd; to passing the chemical weapons treaty, \n     constantly referring to, ``we've never lost a war, and we've \n     never won a treaty,'' which he vehemently opposed. But we \n     were able to do these things not because he changed his mind, \n     but because in this new relationship to maintain it is \n     required to play fair, to be straight. The cheap shots ended. \n     And the chicanery to keep from having to being able to vote \n     ended--even though he knew I had the votes.\n       After that, we went on as he began to look at the other \n     side of things and do some great things together that he \n     supported like PEPFAR--which by the way, George W. Bush \n     deserves an overwhelming amount of credit for, by the way, \n     which provided treatment and prevention HIV/AIDS in Africa \n     and around the world, literally saving millions of lives.\n       So one piece of advice is try to look beyond the caricature \n     of the person with whom you have to work. Resist the \n     temptation to ascribe motive, because you really don't know--\n     and it gets in the way of being able to reach a consensus on \n     things that matter to you and to many other people.\n       Resist the temptation of your generation to let ``network'' \n     become a verb that saps the personal away, that blinds you to \n     the person right in front of you, blinds you to their hopes, \n     their fears, and their burdens.\n       Build real relationships--even with people with whom you \n     vehemently disagree. You'll not only be happier. You will be \n     more successful.\n       The second thing I've noticed is that although you know no \n     one is better than you, every other persons is equal to you \n     and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.\n       I've worked with eight Presidents, hundreds of Senators. \n     I've met every major world leader literally in the last 40 \n     years. And I've had scores of talented people work for me. \n     And here's what I've observed: Regardless of their academic \n     or social backgrounds, those who had the most success and who \n     were most respected and therefore able to get the most done \n     were the ones who never confused academic credentials and \n     societal sophistication with gravitas and judgment.\n       Don't forget about what doesn't come from this prestigious \n     diploma--the heart to know what's meaningful and what's \n     ephemeral; and the head to know the difference between \n     knowledge and judgment.\n       But even if you get these things right, I've observed that \n     most people who are successful and happy remembered a third \n     thing: Reality has a way of intruding.\n       I got elected in a very improbable year. Richard Nixon won \n     my state overwhelmingly. George McGovern was at the top of \n     the ticket. I got elected as the second-youngest man in the \n     history of the United States to be elected, the stuff that \n     provides and fuels raw ambition. And if you're not careful, \n     it fuels a sense of inevitability that seeps in. But be \n     careful. Things can change in a heartbeat. I know. And so do \n     many of your parents.\n       Six weeks after my election, my whole world was altered \n     forever. While I was in Washington hiring staff, I got a \n     phone call. My wife and three children were Christmas \n     shopping, a tractor trailer broadsided them and killed my \n     wife and killed my daughter. And they weren't sure that my \n     sons would live.\n       Many people have gone through things like that. But because \n     I had the incredible good fortune of an extended family, \n     grounded in love and loyalty, imbued with a sense of \n     obligation imparted to each of us, I not only got help. But \n     by focusing on my sons, I found my redemption.\n       I can remember my mother--a sweet lady--looking at me, \n     after we left the hospital, and saying, Joey, out of \n     everything terrible that happens to you, something good will \n     come if you look hard enough for it. She was right.\n       The incredible bond I have with my children is the gift I'm \n     not sure I would have had, had I not been through what I went \n     through. Who knows whether I would have been able to \n     appreciate at that moment in my life, the heady moment in my \n     life, what my first obligation was.\n       So I began to commute--never intending to stay in \n     Washington. And that's the God's truth. I was supposed to be \n     sworn in with everyone else that year in '73, but I wouldn't \n     go down. So Mansfield thought I'd change my mind and not \n     come, and he sent up the secretary of the Senate to swear me \n     in, in the hospital room with my children.\n       And I began to commute thinking I was only going to stay a \n     little while--four hours a day, every day--from Washington to \n     Wilmington, which I've done for over 37 years. I did it \n     because I wanted to be able to kiss them goodnight and kiss \n     them in the morning the next day. No, ``Ozzie and Harriet'' \n     breakfast or great familial thing, just climb in bed with \n     them. Because I came to realize that a child can hold an \n     important thought, something they want to say to their mom \n     and dad, maybe for 12 or 24 hours, and then it's gone. And \n     when it's gone, it's gone. And it all adds up.\n       But looking back on it, the truth be told, the real reason \n     I went home every night was that I needed my children more \n     than they needed me. Some at the time wrote and suggested \n     that Biden can't be a serious national figure. If he was, \n     he'd stay in Washington more, attend to more important \n     events. It's obvious he's not serious. He goes home after the \n     last vote.\n       But I realized I didn't miss a thing. Ambition is really \n     important. You need it. And I certainly have never lacked in \n     having ambition. But ambition without perspective can be a \n     killer. I know a lot of you already understand this. Some of \n     you really had to struggle to get here. And some of you have \n     had to struggle to stay here. And some of your families made \n     enormous sacrifices for this great privilege. And many of you \n     faced your own crises, some unimaginable.\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\n       But the truth is all of you will go through something like \n     this. You'll wrestle with these kinds of choices every day. \n     But I'm here to tell you, you can find the balance between \n     ambition and happiness, what will make you really feel \n     fulfilled. And along the way, it helps a great deal if you \n     can resist the temptation to rationalize.\n       My chief of staff for over 25 years, one of the finest men \n     I've ever known, even though he graduated from Penn, and \n     subsequently became a senator from the state of Delaware, \n     Senator Ted Kaufman, every new hire, that we'd hire, the last \n     thing he'd tell them was, and remember never underestimate \n     the ability of the human mind to rationalize. Never \n     underestimate the ability of the human mind to rationalize--\n     her birthday really doesn't matter that much to her, and this \n     business trip is just a great opportunity; this won't be his \n     last game, and besides, I'd have to take the redeye to get \n     back. We can always take this family vacation another time. \n     There's plenty of time.\n       For your generation, there's an incredible amount of \n     pressure on all of you to succeed, particularly now that you \n     have accomplished so much. Your whole generation faces this \n     pressure. I see it in my grandchildren who are honors \n     students at other Ivy universities right now. You race to do \n     what others think is right in high school. You raced through \n     the bloodsport of college admissions. You raced through Yale \n     for the next big thing. And all along, some of you compare \n     yourself to the success of your peers on Facebook, Instagram, \n     Linked-In, Twitter.\n       Today, some of you may have found that you slipped into the \n     self-referential bubble that validates certain choices. And \n     the bubble expands once you leave this campus, the pressures \n     and anxiousness, as well--take this job, make that much \n     money, live in this place, hang out with people like you, \n     take no real risks and have no real impact, while getting \n     paid for the false sense of both.\n       But resist that temptation to rationalize what others view \n     is the right choice for you--instead of what you feel in your \n     gut is the right choice--that's your North Star. Trust it. \n     Follow it. You're an incredible group of young women and men. \n     And that's not hyperbole. You're an incredible group.\n       Let me conclude with this. I'm not going to moralize about \n     to whom much is given, much is expected, because most of you \n     have made of yourself much more than what you've been given. \n     But now you are in a privileged position. You're part of an \n     exceptional generation and doors will open to you that will \n     not open to others. My Yale Law School grad son graduated \n     very well from Yale Law School. My other son out of loyalty \n     to his deceased mother decided to go to Syracuse Law School \n     from Penn. They're a year and a day apart in their age. The \n     one who graduated from Yale had doors open to him, the lowest \n     salary offered back in the early `90s was $50,000 more than a \n     federal judge made. My other son, it was a struggle--equally \n     as bright, went on to be elected one of the youngest attorney \n     generals in the history of the state of Delaware, the most \n     popular public official in my state. Big headline after the \n     2012 election, ``Biden Most Popular Man in Delaware--Beau.'' \n     (Laughter.)\n       And as your parents will understand, my dad's definition of \n     success is when you look at your son and daughter and realize \n     they turned out better than you, and they did. But you'll \n     have opportunities. Make the most of them and follow your \n     heart. You have the intellectual horsepower to make things \n     better in the world around you.\n       You're also part of the most tolerant generation in \n     history. I got roundly criticized because I could not remain \n     quiet anymore about gay marriage. The one thing I was certain \n     of is all of your generation was way beyond that point. \n     (Applause.)\n       Here's something else I observed--intellectual horsepower \n     and tolerance alone does not make a generation great: unless \n     you can break out of the bubble of your own making--\n     technologically, geographically, racially, and \n     socioeconomically--to truly connect with the world around \n     you. Because it matters.\n       No matter what your material success or personal \n     circumstance, it matters. You can't breathe fresh air or \n     protect your children from a changing climate no matter what \n     you make. If your sister is the victim of domestic violence, \n     you are violated. If your brother can't marry the man he \n     loves, you are lessened. And if your best friend has to worry \n     about being racially profiled, you live in a circumstance not \n     worthy of us. (Applause.) It matters.\n       So be successful. I sincerely hope some of you become \n     millionaires and billionaires. I mean that. But engage the \n     world around you because you will be more successful and \n     happier. And you can absolutely succeed in life without \n     sacrificing your ideals or your commitments to others and \n     family. I'm confident that you can do that, and I'm confident \n     that this generation will do it more than any other.\n       Look to your left, as they say, and look to your right. And \n     remember how foolish the people next to you look--\n     (laughter)--in those ridiculous hats. (Laughter.) That's what \n     I want you to remember. I mean this. Because it means you've \n     learned something from a great tradition.\n       It means you're willing to look foolish, you're willing to \n     run the risk of looking foolish in the service of what \n     matters to you. And if you remember that, because some of the \n     things your heart will tell you to do, will make you among \n     your peers look foolish, or not smart, or not sophisticated. \n     But we'll all be better for people of your consequence to do \n     it.\n       That's what I want you to most remember. Not who spoke at \n     the day you all assembled on this mall. You're a remarkable \n     class. I sure don't remember who the hell was my commencement \n     speaker. (Laughter.) I know this is not officially \n     commencement. But ask your parents when you leave here, who \n     spoke at your commencement? It's a commencement speaker \n     aversion of a commencement speaker's fate to be forgotten. \n     The question is only how quickly. But you're the best in your \n     generation. And that is not hyperbole. And you're part of a \n     remarkable generation.\n       And, you--you're on the cusp of some of the most \n     astonishing breakthroughs in the history of mankind--\n     scientific, technological, socially--that's going to change \n     the way you live and the whole world works. But it will be up \n     to you in this changing world to translate those \n     unprecedented capabilities into a greater measure of \n     happiness and meaning--not just for yourself, but for the \n     world around you.\n       And I feel more confident for my children and grandchildren \n     knowing that the men and women who graduate here today, here \n     and across the country, will be in their midst. That's the \n     honest truth. That's the God's truth. That's my word as a \n     Biden.\n       Congratulations, Class of 2015. And may God bless you and \n     may God protect our troops. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, it is noteworthy that the Vice President \ndiscussed very frankly the tragedy he has had in his life, all while \nknowing of this impending tragedy that was unfolding with his son, \nBeau. The speech was vintage Biden, with a lot of humor and Irish \ntales, but the essence of the speech came down to this, as he was \ntalking to the graduates:\n\n       Build real relationships--even with people with whom you \n     vehemently disagree. You'll not only be happier. You will be \n     more successful.\n\n  And he continued:\n\n       The second thing I've noticed is that although you know no \n     one is better than you, every other person is equal to you \n     and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.\n\n  That is the essence of how in a democracy we have to get along. It is \nknown as the Golden Rule. Joe Biden talked about the Golden Rule \nwithout saying it was the Golden Rule--treat others as you want to be \ntreated. Put into old English: Do unto others as you would have them do \nunto you.\n  The Vice President talks in his speech about his time as a young \nSenator, when he heard Senator Jesse Helms talking about an issue that \nSenator Biden was opposed to. He felt it was violative of his basic \nconcept in the treatment of other people. In this case, I think it was \na question of disability. As he walked in to see the majority leader--\nprobably in that same office, in this case, Mike Mansfield--Senator \nMansfield, the leader, noticed that Joe was visibly upset and he said: \nWhat is wrong? And Joe told him about this encounter with Senator \nHelms.\n  Senator Mansfield then went on to say to Senator Biden: Don't ever \njudge until you really know the person, because Senator Helms and his \nwife had run into a situation where they found a severely disabled \nchild and, as a result, they adopted that child.\n  As a result, Senator Biden and Senator Helms became the best of \nfriends. Even though their politics were different, when they served as \nthe leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--sometimes Helms \nas chairman and sometimes Biden as chairman--they could disagree on the \nissues, but they could get a lot done because they could work together. \nThat is because they built a relationship.\n  How different is that today, where each of us are racing out of here \non Thursday afternoons and evenings to go back to our States and we \nhardly ever have time for each other, to understand the core of us as \nhumans and what makes us, drives us as we are. If we knew that about \neach other, maybe we would find more common ground.\n  What I have found is that every one of these Senators is an \nextraordinary person, extremely accomplished, and well motivated. They \ntry, we all try to do the right thing, but then we let the politics and \nthe ideology get in the way and it drives us apart. As a result, is it \nany wonder that we have a dysfunctional Senate that has difficulty \ngetting along, particularly when you consider the arcane rules of the \nSenate, which were designed to slow down the process.\n  When you don't have the relationship that can be built, when the two \nleaders can't get along, when the Senate cannot be run by unanimous \nconsent, is\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nthere any wonder that it is dysfunctional? Yet, we have the capacity, \njust as Senator Biden and Senator Helms did, to overcome significant \ndifferences and get things done.\n  At this time of grieving for the Biden family, as I read his Yale \nspeech, I was reminded that there is a lot about what was expressed \nthere in a grieving father who could not show his grief because it was \nstill very private. There is a lot of wisdom there. That is why I \nentered it into the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise today to discuss two important \nissues--first, the Export-Import Bank.\n  There is a lot about this place that puzzles me, but one of the \nthings that this year has puzzled me the most is the movement to \nsomehow defund or end the Export-Import Bank. I just don't get it. This \nis an agency of the Federal Government that has been extraordinarily \neffective. It creates jobs in the United States. It supports jobs. It \nsupports American businesses. It supports small American businesses. It \nreturns money to the Treasury. It fills a market niche that the private \nsector has been unwilling or unable to fill. This isn't competition \nwith the private sector. This isn't the government doing something the \nprivate sector should do. This is the government filling a niche that \nhas been identified for over 80 years. And it makes a difference.\n  I have visited several small companies in Maine--I think there may be \neight or so--that benefit directly from this program, which supports 2 \npercent of the financing of U.S. exports.\n  We are engaged in intense global competition for the export of goods \nand services, and to unilaterally disarm by taking away one of the \ntools our businesses use just doesn't make any sense. I don't \nunderstand what the impetus is for this move to undermine this very \nvaluable program that is important to our companies.\n  I toured a little company in Maine that resells computer and \nnetworking equipment all over the world, particularly to third-world \ncountries that need this equipment desperately for various needs but \nparticularly for coping with emergencies. It is a small business in \nMaine, has 35 employees, and is owned by a woman, Connie Justice. I \nvisited with her, and she told me this story. I don't like to read, but \nI think this quote is so powerful from a real live business owner in \nMaine as to how important this program is.\n\n       Ex-Im's Working Capital Loan Guarantee program helped us \n     expand our export sales during a period of rapid growth, when \n     private banks were unwilling to lend to us without a \n     guarantee.\n\n  This is important to understand, that one of the most important \nprograms the Export-Import Bank sponsors is a guarantee of receivables \nfrom foreign countries, which American banks--quite logically in many \ncases because they don't have the history, they can't collect--are very \nreluctant to factor or to finance.\n  She said:\n\n       After 2 years of solid exports, our financial position \n     strengthened so that the Ex-Im guarantee was no longer \n     needed. Private banks now meet all our credit needs. Our \n     expansion and increased sales would have been impossible \n     without Ex-Im's involvement. We continue to use Ex-Im Bank to \n     insure our receivables to Ex-Im approved customers in \n     developing countries. We pay reasonable premiums for this \n     insurance.\n\n  This program makes money for the Federal government. This isn't a \nhandout. This isn't corporate welfare. They are paying insurance \npremiums, which, over the past 20 years or so, have returned $7 billion \nto the U.S. Treasury. This makes money. She pays her premiums, and that \nis a positive for U.S. taxpayers.\n\n       Being able to offer open payment terms for U.S.-made goods \n     opens previously inaccessible markets for us. Our major \n     manufacturers--including HP, Dell and Lenovo--have committed \n     to making more systems domestically to comply with Ex-Im's \n     ``Made in USA'' requirement for eligibility. This has a huge \n     multiplier effect on US employment. . . . Since 2004, \n     Planson's annual export sales have grown from $5 million to \n     $35 million. Our staff has grown from 5 to 35, and our \n     payroll has increased to almost $2 million. We use local \n     suppliers for a broad range of goods and services.\n\n  She goes on to conclude:\n\n       We achieve all this entirely through export sales. The U.S. \n     Export-Import Bank is a key partner in our success.\n\n  Why would we want to let this very valuable program expire for some \ntheoretical reason that, frankly, I just find inexplicable? It makes \nmoney for the American taxpayers. It is projected to continue to make \nmoney. But my passion here is about its support for small businesses in \nMaine that otherwise could not make these sales into the international \nmarket.\n  As I mentioned, allowing the Export-Import Bank charter to expire is \na kind of unilateral disarmament in an era of intense global \ncompetition. It makes no sense. Sixty other countries have similar \nkinds of programs, and if we take ours away, what we are doing is \nhandcuffing our businesses while the rest of the world is moving \nforward with their programs to support exports.\n  I used to start speeches in Maine by saying, simply, ``Five \npercent.'' People would look at me and say: What is he talking about, 5 \npercent? Well, 5 percent is the percentage of the world's population \nthat lives in North America. That means that if our businesses are \ngoing to ultimately be successful, we have to sell into the rest of the \nworld. We have to be able to export, and the Export-Import Bank is a \nvery valuable tool in order to facilitate the export of goods from the \nUnited States.\n\n  There is bipartisan support. I believe the votes are there in the \nHouse. Senator McConnell has committed to a vote here in the Senate. I \ncommend Senator Cantwell and Senator Graham for their work on behalf of \nthis.\n  I hope we can bring this matter to a vote promptly and avoid the \ndeadline of June 30. I do not know why we cannot do things around here \nbefore the night before. Let's get this done and move on to more \nimportant topics. We should not even be having this debate. This ought \nto be automatic, as, indeed, it has effectively been for some 80 years.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this program. We \nshould not be playing games with this important agency at a time of \nsuch intense global competition.\n  Madam President, I also wish to talk about the national defense \nauthorization bill, which is also coming to the floor today and is on \nthe floor today.\n  Sixty-five years ago this week a freshman Senator from Maine rose on \nthis floor, in this place, and made one of the most important speeches \nin American history. It certainly was one of the most important \nspeeches of the 20th century. It was June 1, 1950. That freshman \nSenator was Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. I got to know Margaret Chase \nSmith after she left the Senate, in the 1980s and 1990s in Maine, \nbefore we lost her in 1995.\n  She told me about that speech. The speech was about the dangers to \nthe country and, particularly, to this institution of the practices of \nJoseph McCarthy, of the smear campaigns, of the innuendo, of the \nthreats. Her speech took enormous courage. She told me two stories \nabout the speech that I think are interesting that I want to note \nbefore I go on to the implications of that speech for what we are \nconsidering today.\n  One was that, as she had the speech in her hand and got on the little \ntrolley to come from the Russell Building over here--at that time the \nRussell Building was the only Senate office building--who should be \nsitting in the trolley in the seat next to her but Joe McCarthy. \nSenator Smith sat down and McCarthy turned to her and said: What are \nyou up to today, Margaret?\n  She told me that she responded: I am about to make a speech, Joe, and \nyou are not going to like it.\n  She went on to the Senate floor. She had written that speech with her \nclose aide Bill Lewis at her kitchen table in Skowhegan, ME, over \nMemorial Day weekend of 1950. She had the speech in her hand, and Bill \nLewis was in the press gallery right up here. But she told him not to \nhand out a copy of the speech until she was well into giving it on the \nSenate floor because she was afraid that she would lose her nerve and \nnot deliver the speech.\n\n[[Page S3751]]\n\n  That speech took enormous courage. It took enormous courage because \nshe was telling her colleagues an uncomfortable truth--an uncomfortable \ntruth. I believe that today it is also important that we face \nuncomfortable truths.\n  I am a strong supporter of the National Defense Authorization Act \nthat is on the floor. I am a strong supporter of the need and the \nimportance and how crucial that bill is to the defense and the security \nof this country. The most solid responsibility we have in this place is \nset forth in the preamble to the Constitution itself: to ``provide for \nthe common defense'' and ``insure domestic Tranquility.'' That is what \ngovernments are established to do. That is the basic fundamental \nresponsibility--to ``provide for the common defense'' and ``insure \ndomestic Tranquility.''\n  That is national security. That is what this bill that is on the \nfloor today is all about. I worked in subcommittee on it. I have been \nto numerous, repeated hearings, as the Presiding Officer has, all \nthrough the winter and early spring, where we learned about the \nstrategic challenges facing this country. I commend the chair of the \ncommittee for putting this in a strategic context. We talked about big \nissues with people such as Henry Kissinger and Brzezinski and Madeleine \nAlbright before we started talking about the specifics that are in this \nbill. And then we had lengthy subcommittee meetings and subcommittee \nmarkups.\n  For me, one of the most satisfying parts of my legislative experience \nhere has been the markup of this bill, where we met as a committee, \nwhere we argued and debated and voted and had a lot of amendments and \ntried to deal with it for 2 solid days and came to a conclusion, where, \nas I recall, the vote out of the committee was something like 22 to 4. \nIt was a very powerful vote.\n\n  I am in total support of this piece of legislation. However, my \nproblem with the legislation is that it attempts to avoid the impact of \nthe sequester through the use of the overseas contingency account \nmoney, which is not paid for.\n  We have had hearings. Every hearing we have had this year has been \ntalking about the danger of the sequester to national security. Indeed, \nI have been working with a number of my colleagues to try to find a \nsolution for the sequester, but the solution for the sequester is not \nsimply to borrow the money from our grandchildren. What bothers me \nabout this legislation is that it is part of a pattern. When the chips \nare down around here, we borrow the money from our grandchildren. If 5-\nyear-olds could vote and knew what we were doing to them, we would all \nbe dead ducks because we are passing the bill on to them. I think we \nshould fully fund the Department of Defense and the request at the \nlevel that is in this bill. I just do not think we should borrow the \nmoney to do it.\n  Make no mistake, that is what we are doing. We are saying it is very \nimportant, these are important expenditures, and it is critical for \nnational defense that we make these expenditures but not critical \nenough to pay for them. That is the pattern.\n  Earlier this year we passed the so-called tax extenders. They ought \nto be called tax-cut extenders because that is what they are. Everybody \nsaid they were important to economic development and they were \nimportant for the country and important for certainty for businesses. \nAll that was true, but it was not enough to pay for them. We borrowed \nthe money.\n  Last year we passed a major rewrite of the Veterans' Administration \nprogram, where everybody talked about how important this was, how \nimportant the Veterans Affairs Department was to our veterans, how much \nwe owed our veterans, and how we had to take care of this. But then we \nturned around and borrowed the money from our grandchildren in order to \nfund it. We did not fund it.\n  Recently, just in the last month or so, we fixed the so-called doc \nfix, which has been plaguing this place for a dozen years. But we did \nnot really fix it. We fixed it as far as the docs are concerned, but we \nfixed it by borrowing the money. We did not pay for it.\n  Many of my colleagues talk a lot around here about the deficit and \nthe danger to the country. I think they are right. I think the deficit \nis a serious danger to this country. But it seems that the deficit is \nonly a problem when we think it is a problem, and then the next day, it \nis not a problem anymore because we are going to borrow $38 billion \nmore to put into this bill.\n  I think we need to stand up and pay for things. I am no angel. I \nvoted for all those things that I listed. But I think it is time to \nstart saying: Wait a minute; we cannot do this. By the way, by fixing \nthe sequester in the Department of Defense, of course, we are not \nfixing it anywhere else in the Federal Government. Some people say: \nWell, that is OK because defense is important, and we are not so \nworried about these other programs. Well, I am sorry, but some of those \nother programs are little items such as the FBI. There has never been a \ntime in the history of this country when the FBI was more important.\n  We are facing serious, dangerous imminent threats. To not fund the \nFBI or the Border Patrol or the TSA and to have the sequester affect \nthose agencies and kid ourselves that we are dealing with our national \nsecurity responsibilities is just not responsible. It is just not \nright. And to borrow the money to fix some of these things is not \nresponsible or fair to our grandchildren.\n  We are saying: We are just going to fix defense with this funny-money \ndeal, a gimmick wrapped up in a trick, but we are not going to fix \nanything else. I talked about the FBI, the TSA, Border Patrol, and \nnational security issues, but what about NIH and what about scientific \nresearch that can save lives? And we are having the sequester and \nsaying: It is OK; we can do that. What about education? What about, \nyes, Head Start, which gives young people a chance to make a serious \ncontribution to this country?\n  I think the OCO trick that is in this bill is wrong on two counts. It \nis wrong on three counts, actually. No. 1, it is not paid for. No. 2 it \nis not really what the Defense Department needs. They need base budget \nauthority so they can plan, so they can look to the future, and so they \ncan make decisions on an ongoing basis that are necessary to commit to \nprograms, plans, and projects that will defend this country. The short-\nterm OCO solution does not do that. That is No. 2.\n  No. 3, by ignoring the needs of the rest of the Federal Government, \nby ignoring the needs of other parts of the national security \napparatus, we are not serving the public we were sent here to look \nafter.\n  I support this bill, but I think we really ought to be thinking about \nalternative ways to fund the needs we have identified. It is too easy \nto say this is an important national priority but not important enough \nto pay for it. We are continually--even today, after all of the talk \nabout deficits and budget control and everything else--finding ways to \nshift the burden to our kids and to our grandchildren. I do not think \nthat is right.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island has an amendment to this bill that I \nthink is an important one. All it simply says is that we are not going \nto spend that OCO money in defense until we solve the problem more \ngenerally throughout the rest of the Federal Government.\n  I realize it is not the responsibility of the Defense Department or \nof the Armed Services Committee to solve the overall budget problem \nwithin the Defense bill. But I think we have a responsibility to look \nat the larger problem, and we can contribute to its solution by saying \nto our colleagues throughout this body and in the House that there has \nto be a comprehensive solution before we say we are going to fix only \ndefense and we are only going to fix defense with borrowed money.\n  There are three ways to solve this budget problem--three ways. One is \nby cuts, and there have already been substantial cuts. From the \nprojected budgets back in 2010, there is something like three-quarters \nof a trillion dollars that has already been cut from defense and other \nareas of the Federal budget. We have to continue to look at that, and \nwe have to look at all aspects of the Federal budget.\n  The second way is revenues. Nobody is supposed to talk about revenues \naround here, but the reality is that we are not paying our bills. To \npat ourselves on the back for tax cuts when in\n\n[[Page S3752]]\n\nreality we are passing the expenses on to our children is just not \nhonest.\n  When we pass tax cuts here in a deficit situation and borrow the \nmoney to fill the hole, we are not cutting taxes. We are shifting the \ntax to our children. I do not think that is honest. I do not think that \nis responsible. I do not think that is what we were sent here to do.\n  The third way, of course, to solve this budget problem is by economic \ngrowth. Some people say that the only way to grow the economy is to cut \ntaxes. I have seen no economic study that says that works. Maybe it \nworks if you are reducing taxes, as they did in 1960, from a 90-percent \ntop marginal rate to now about 35 percent. Ok, I think that is \nsignificant. But to reduce that marginal rate by two or three points \nand say that it will stimulate a huge amount of economic activity--\nthere is no economic justification for that.\n  The two single biggest economic development projects in the recent \nhistory of the United States were the GI bill after World War II and \nthe interstate highway system. Both of them were investments, both of \nthem cost money, and, by the way, our predecessors paid for them. They \ndidn't pass the bill on to us. They paid for them.\n  So, yes, we need to control taxes. Yes, we need to think about \nstrategic tax reductions in ways and areas that will actually help \nstimulate the economy. I don't understand how having some guy who is \nmanaging money in New York pay half the tax rate that his secretary \nmakes is a stimulus to the economy. Yet that is what we are doing.\n  We have to look at this problem in a comprehensive way. We have to \nlook at health care costs, we have to look at the effects of \ndemographics on Federal expenditures over the next 20 to 30 years, and \nwe have to look at investments that will help our economy grow.\n  The Presiding Officer and I work hard on this bill. I think it is an \nimportant bill for the future of this country. I think it is an \nimportant bill to protect the national security and to provide for the \ncommon defense, but I think we need to do it in an honest and open way \nand not try to fill a short-term budget gap with money our children and \nour grandchildren are going to have to repay. I believe we can do this. \nI believe we can face this responsibility because that is why we are \nhere.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, someone already asked unanimous consent \nthat U.S. Army MAJ Justin Gorkowski, who is a fellow in my Senate \noffice, be granted floor privileges for this debate.\n  I just wanted to explain how pleased and lucky we have been to have \nthe major with us to help with these issues. He is a graduate of West \nPoint. He currently serves as an information operations officer. He \nserved as an adviser to the Iraq Army during the surge in 2006 and 2007 \nand returned from Afghanistan in January of last year, where he had \nbeen responsible for psychological operations, electronic warfare and \nmilitary deception for Kandahar Province. He has been a great addition \nto our office during this debate, and in my view this debate is the \nmost important debate we have.\n  The No. 1 priority for the Federal Government is to defend the \ncountry. We can spend all the time we want talking about all the other \npriorities and all the things we should be doing and whether there is \nsome sudden mystical balance between all of those priorities and \ndefending the country, but in most of our States, and certainly in the \nState of Missouri, the one thing you can get the least argument on as \nto what the Federal Government should do that we can't do for ourselves \nis defend the country. That is why for 54 years straight the Senate has \npassed a defense authorizing bill every year. There are very few things \nthat get authorized every year, very few things that get debated every \nyear, very few things that get looked at every year, but our national \ndefense is one of those, and it is one of those for a reason.\n  We hear all kinds of reasons not to move forward with this bill, and \nthen you hear: But I am for the bill. Well, that is because people \nunderstand that this is one of the things the Federal Government is \nsupposed to do and in my view the top thing we can't in any way do for \nourselves. Local government can't do this, State governments can't do \nthis, individually we cannot do this, and that is why this debate is \nalways so important and why the Armed Services Committee voted this out \n22 to 4 after all kinds of discussions, such as, well, maybe the \nminority would not vote for this for the reasons we just heard. But at \nthe end of the day, the vote was 22 to 4 out of the committee.\n  Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed have done a good job of \nbringing this bill to the floor with bipartisan support and looking for \nways to reform defense so we really focus our defense where the \ndefenders are rather than where the defenders are not.\n  This bill is focused on eliminating wasteful spending. It focuses on \nfinding ways to reduce bureaucracy and streamline the critical military \nfunctions we have. It puts a focus on the fighting forces, not the \nbureaucratic forces in the defense structure.\n  The bill identifies $10 billion in excessive and unnecessary spending \nand reallocates those funds to our true military capabilities. It also \nmodernizes the military retirement system so that many more who served \nhave a retirement benefit from serving. The current retirement system \nbenefits less than 20 percent of those who served in the Armed Forces \nbecause the people who benefit from the retirement program are people \nwho serve 20 years and retire at that point. This bill would create a \nsystem where servicemembers and taxpayers join together to create a \nretirement benefit which estimates that 75 percent of the people who \nserved in the military would leave with a retirement benefit rather \nthan only 17, 18, 20 percent of the people who leave the military. It \nis a reform that really honors all of those who served in a good way \nand doesn't penalize anyone who served. It still allows people who have \nbeen serving under the old system to stay under the old system. \nObviously, the longer you stay in that system, the better you are going \nto do. But the options now are basically no retirement benefit or a \nretirement benefit that comes with substantial service and only with \nthat kind of service.\n  This bill creates retention bonuses to keep people in the military \nlonger than 20 years. We have men and women retiring at the height of \ntheir capacity with technical skills that are not easily replaced. This \nbill recognizes that and looks for ways to encourage them to continue \nto serve.\n  Our State, the State of Missouri, has a real commitment to the \nmilitary. More than 17,000 Active-Duty servicemembers serve in \nMissouri. We have important bases in our State. We have 8,000 civilian \nDepartment of Defense employees and more than 20,000 members of the \nReserve and the National Guard.\n  This bill authorizes funding to build a Consolidated Stealth \nOperations and Nuclear Alert Facility at Whiteman Air Force Base. It \npreserves and prevents the retirement of the A-10 plane that has wide \nsupport in the Congress, but more importantly the A-10 has wide support \nfrom the ground forces it supports from the air. When you talk to \npeople who serve on the ground, General Odierno and others, will say \nthat in their view there is no plane that does what this plane does. Of \ncourse, those who fly it and support it are very important. Whiteman \nAir Force Base, again, has the 442nd Fighter Wing. It is an A-10 \nfighter wing which just returned from a deployment.\n  This bill also authorizes upgrades in our cargo aircraft, such as the \nC-130 aircraft, which will help the main force as well as the National \nGuard and Reserves.\n  In fact, Rosecrans Air National Guard Base in St. Joseph is a great \ntraining facility not only for our forces, but that base also serves as \na training facility for our allies. At least 16 of our allies trained \nat this facility last year so they could figure out how to get \nsupplies, how to get troops, and how to move things with those cargo \nplanes in ways that they would not otherwise be able to do.\n  This bill also takes an important step in moving forward with the new \nbomber. There is money here that would continue to fund the new plan\n\n[[Page S3753]]\n\nfor the idea out there for a long-range bomber. We have to have that. \nWe have to have a precision bombing capability that is better than \nanybody else's. The planes we are using now have been the best planes \nin the world for a long time, but they will not be the best planes in \nthe world forever, and it is time to begin to move forward, as we have \nbeen, toward that new plane. Those are all important projects. There \nare key initiatives here, such as promoting accountability and \npromoting the standards we need to have for performance in the military \nand how we reward those standards.\n  This bill maintains critical quality-of-life programs for men and \nwomen who serve and their families. This bill addresses the needs of \nour wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers.\n  This bill continues to provide critical assistance to our allies, \nparticularly our ally Israel, where we have significant common research \nefforts. As we have all seen in recent years, the David's Sling and \nIron Dome weapon systems are critical not only for Israel's security, \nbut they have been a critical proving ground for the kind of response \nthat was once looked at as some kind of unachievable ``Star Wars'' \ncapacity. Both David's Sling and the Iron Dome have proved that \ncapacity is, in fact, truly achievable, and we continue to move forward \nwith that kind of defense system in this bill.\n  This also goes a long way toward combating threats of cyber space and \ncyber security by evaluating what those vulnerabilities are and dealing \nwith those vulnerabilities.\n  I want to mention a few amendments I filed and intend to offer before \nwe move on with this bill. I believe my amendments will strengthen the \nbill. First, I believe the military's mental health screening process \ncan be improved. We learned a lot about mental health and behavioral \nhealth over the past 15 years. I believe we can continue to adapt and, \nfrankly, last year's Defense authorization bill had important steps in \nthis direction. I was able to get on the bill when I was a member of \nthe committee last year--not just the defense appropriating committee I \nserve on now but the defense authorizing committee I served on then.\n  The amendments I will offer will improve the predeployment health \nassessment and postdeployment health reassessment by requiring that all \nservicemembers be screened and that they don't have to meet some \ncriteria that every member of the service may not meet. While people \nare serving, it is important to establish the things that have happened \nto them, so if they need help years later, perhaps, and come back and \nask for assistance in what truly was a post-traumatic event which was \ncaused by their service but didn't show up for a number of years, \nhaving the incidents and things that might have affected their mental \nhealth is important.\n  The National Institutes of Health says that one in four adult \nAmericans has a diagnosable and almost always treatable behavioral \nhealth issue.\n  I asked the Surgeon Generals of the Armed Forces if that number \napplies to the Armed Forces, and without hesitation they said yes. They \nsaid: We recruit from the general population and there is no reason \nthat number wouldn't apply to people serving us in uniform.\n  The key is diagnosable and treatable--diagnosable and treatable in a \nway that people aren't held back by their behavior health issues any \nmore than they are held back by their physical health issues. They just \nneed to be dealt with.\n  We will look at mild traumatic stress injury potential, post-\ntraumatic stress injury potential, and look at the things that might \naffect somebody as they move forward from their time in the service. \nWhat happens in the service and what can happen years after really \nmatters.\n  I think those amendments on mental health meet the evolving needs of \nservicemembers and hopefully the evolving needs of how we understand \nbehavioral health as it relates to all other health.\n  I have another amendment that would not allow the Army to go below \nthe currently authorized end strength level of 475,000 soldiers. There \nare threats around the world, and we need to increase our national \nsecurity.\n  We heard General Odierno, Chief of Staff of the Army, testify earlier \nthis year before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee about the risk \nassociated with going below 490,000 soldiers. This amendment would say \nyou can't go below the 475,000 soldiers until the Secretary of Defense \ntells the Congress how he plans to reduce excess headquarters elements \nand excess administrative overhead.\n  Just this morning, I read an article from military.com discussing \nNavy Secretary Ray Mabus's recent comments about excessive bloat--his \nterm--in the DOD headquarters functions.\n  The article states:\n\n       Secretary Mabus said Pentagon and Congressional budget \n     cutters should look at eliminating extra bureaucracy before \n     slashing funds for sailors and ships.\n       Mabus said 20 percent of the Pentagon budget is spent on \n     what he called ``pure overhead''--items not directory linked \n     to readiness or ongoing operations.\n       He [Mabus] referred to this ``overhead'' as the fourth \n     estate, specifying entities such as the office of the \n     Secretary of Defense, defense agencies and organizations \n     funded by the Under Secretaries of Defense.\n\n  Here is a direct quote from Secretary Mabus:\n\n       There are other places to look rather than taking tools \n     from the warfighter. To the extent you can, protect the stuff \n     that actually gets to the warfighter.\n\n  I think my amendment would ensure that the Secretary of Defense has \nto take that quote to heart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate has an order for a vote at this \nhour.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I wish to make one other comment on one other amendment I \nhave that I will speak more about later in this debate. It involves a \nconcern I have for Iran's growing influence in Iraq and the failure we \nhave had in maintaining the commitment we made to those Camp Liberty \nresidents whom we promised to protect. More than 100 residents have \nbeen killed at Camp Liberty.\n  I recognize the State Department's ongoing efforts, but they are not \ngood enough. I believe the Secretary of Defense needs to certify to the \ndefense committees that the central government of Iraq is taking \nappropriate and sufficient steps to ensure the safety and security of \nIranian dissidents housed in Camp Liberty in Iraq.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1494\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes on the pending amendment No. 1494.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, the Supreme Court has ruled it is \nunconstitutional to deny Federal benefits to legally married, same-sex \ncouples and their children. Yet due to unrelated provisions of the \nFederal Code, State legislatures have the ability to indirectly deny \nFederal benefits to certain disabled veterans and their families solely \nbecause they are in a same-sex marriage. This is unjust and, according \nto the Supreme Court, it is unconstitutional.\n  This amendment we are about to vote on would end the current \nprohibition on benefits for gay and lesbian veterans and their families \nliving in States that do not recognize same-sex marriage.\n  I wish to quote from testimony we heard from the VFW at a Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee hearing last month. The VFW said this, and \nI hope all of my colleagues will keep this in mind as we vote. ``Simply \nput, if a veteran is legally married in a State that recognizes same-\nsex marriage, we''--the VFW--``believe the VA should provide benefits \nto his or her spouse or surviving spouse the same way it does for every \nother legally married veteran.''\n  Many of us speak all the time about the need to honor the service of \nour veterans and to make sure they have access to the care they \ndeserve. This amendment will right a wrong that so many of our veterans \nwho have fought and volunteered deserve to have.\n  I hope our colleagues will support this amendment so we can ensure \nthat those veterans are treated equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on\n\n[[Page S3754]]\n\nagreeing to amendment No. 1494, offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mrs. Shaheen.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Under the previous order \nrequiring 60 votes for the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is \nrejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1506\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question now \noccurs on amendment No. 1506, offered by the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Tillis.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I want to thank Matt Donovan and Stephen \nBarney of Senator McCain's staff for their patience and assistance in \ndrafting this amendment.\n  I also want to thank COL Anthony Lazarski of Senator Inhofe's staff \nand, of course my senior colleague from Oklahoma.\n  I say to the chairman and Senator Reed, I have the privilege of \nrepresenting America's Global Response Force, the XVIII ABN Corps and \nthe 82nd ABN Division.\n  As Senator Reed knows from his long service in the division, the 82nd \nis the most decorated combat unit in the Armed Forces--it is America's \nGuard of Honor.\n  GEN Colin Powell famously said, ``There is nothing that gets a bad \nguy's attention quicker than knowing the 82nd ABN is flying straight \nfor his nose.''\n  But to put it bluntly, the Air Force wants to take the ``air'' out of \n``airborne''.\n  In 2012 the Air Force decided to deactivate the Reserve Air Wing at \nPope Army Airfield at Fort Bragg and eliminate onsite daily support for \ntraining for XVIII ABN Corps, 82nd ABN and USASOC.\n  The wing consists of 8-12 C-130Hs.\n  Last year this committee required the Air Force to produce a report \non the C-130 fleet during which time the Air Force was required to \nmaintain its wings at Pope and Little Rock for 1 year--the report came \nout in April, the committee expected it last December. The Congress was \nto be given time to respond.\n  Unfortunately, the Air Force began dismantling the Wing at Pope long \nbefore the report was produced and in direct opposition to this \ncommittee's instructions. When asked about this, the Air Force said, \n``Congress said nothing about us taking away pilots and maintainers, we \nare leaving the Aircraft''.\n  The chairman's mark is full of behaviors like this: including Air \nForce refusal to heed the recommendations of the National Commission on \nthe Air Force and the SECAF's refusal to cut the size of AF \nheadquarters.\n  In my brief time in this body I have repeatedly asked the Air Force \nfor documentation as to the impact on Airborne and Special Operations \ntraining the departure of dedicated Air Force Wings will have. I have \nbeen rebuffed by Pentagon leadership.\n  The Deputy Commander of the USAF Reserve said that planes at Pope \nwere a ``luxury''. The Chief of Staff of the Air Force said that the \nAir Force needed to maintain C-130s at Minneapolis, Youngstown, and \nPittsburgh for important missions. With all due respect is there any \nmission at Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and Minneapolis that is as important \nas supporting Airborne and Special Operations units.\n  In the last 3 months, the commanders of the XVIII ABN Corps and 82nd \nABN have taken the extraordinary step of delivering public speeches \nnoting that Airborne and Special Operations leadership were not \nconsulted about the Air Force decision and that the loss of onsite \nplanes will severely hamper their ability to train and meet \nrequirements of emergency contingencies.\n  The Pope planes provide between 25 to 40 percent of all Airborne and \nSOF daily training missions. Last year they dropped 50 percent of the \n82nd ABN's chutes; 440 AW provides 100 percent of 18 ASOG, Air Force, \ntraining--Air Force Special Operations Group.\n  Even as a cost savings device, the transfer of 8 to 12 planes out of \nPope makes no sense, as planes will have to be flown in--often on a \nvoluntarily basis if they are Reserve units--from around the country \nand those units will have to go on TDY orders, etcetera. This also does \nnot provide for the moving to the left effects of weather grounding \nplanes that would have to fly into Pope from the rest of the country. \nAs the XVIII ABN Corps Commander said, the downstream effects will be \nproblematic.\n  This amendment is simple and it supports the C-130 Avionic \nModernization Program that the Air Land Subcommittee validated \nyesterday by accepting the chairman's $75 million mark and the Manchin \namendment.\n  The Secretary of the Air Force shall, by September 30, 2017, station \naircraft previously modified by the C-130 Avionics Modernization \nProgram, AMP, in direct support of the daily training and contingency \nrequirements of the Army Airborne and Special Operations units. The \nSecretary shall provide such personnel as required to maintain and \noperate such aircraft.\n  There are roughly 260 C-130Hs left--I believe the AF will try and \nretire up to 100, and it will hopefully replace 50 more with C-130J \nmodels--this leaves 100 C-130Hs that need AMP.\n  The AF spent $2.3 billion on C-130H AMP, the program was on schedule \nand cost when the AF cancelled it, the design was validated by the \nJROC, Joint Requirements Oversight Council, and the program had begun \nLow Rate Initial Production, LRIP.\n  We currently have five C-130H AMP aircraft at Little Rock that will \nbe flown to the bone yard at a loss of approx $300 million, as well as \nfour AMP kits that can be modified to fit any C-130H, three simulators \nand all software that will be thrown away\n  We can have nine AMP C-130Hs plus simulators and software for $75 \nmillion--this also adheres to the law Congress passed last year and was \nvalidated by the Manchin amendment yesterday.\n  The bottom line is, if the AF does not take this course, it will send \nthe five C-130H AMP aircraft to the boneyard, wasting $300 million, not \nto mention the simulators and software. Total amount spent for AMP was \n$2.3 billion. Program was approved by JROC and was on schedule and cost \nwhen AF tried to cancel it. There are roughly 260 C-130Hs left--I \nbelieve the AF will try and retire up to 100, and it will hopefully \nreplace 50 more with C-130J models--this leaves 100 C-130Hs that need \nAMP. Total cost to get nine aircraft, all simulators and software \nrunning again is approximately $75M which was funded this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, very quickly, the Senator from North \nCarolina worked very hard to get legislative language in the bill which \nhas a study of the sufficiency of the airlift requirements for the \nunits stationed at Fort Bragg, NC. This legislation would take several \naircraft that are at Little Rock and move them up to North Carolina. It \nwould not effectively help the mobility of our forces. It would \nmicromanage the use of military aircraft. As such, I would ask that \nthere be a ``no'' vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to share my concerns \nregarding the administration's recently finalized Clean Water Act rule \nissued by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to define waters of \nthe United States.\n  The Clean Water Act clearly states it is the ``policy of Congress to \nrecognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and \nrights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.'' Despite \nthis partnership and the limits to Federal authority, the President and \nhis administration, along with some lawmakers, have sought in recent \nyears to clarify and extend the scope of Federal jurisdiction under the \nClean Water Act in a manner that would expand the Federal Government's \nability to regulate waters of the United States--in short, a Federal \npower grab. Changing the scope of the law, including the Clean Water \nAct, is solely the responsibility of Congress. Yet, the President's \nadministration has again elected to bypass the legislative process by \nfinalizing this rule.\n  When I am in Louisiana, I consistently hear from my constituents \nabout the impacts this rule could have on private property development, \ntimberland, farmland, and other bodies of water that would be subject \nto Federal control. They tell me this rule will create more uncertainty \nand impact infrastructure projects and jobs despite the EPA and the \nCorps' assurances to the contrary.\n  Louisiana is experiencing significant economic growth--growth that is \nbringing jobs to those Americans who have had the hardest time finding \njobs with this recent poorly performing economy. This progress will be \nnegatively affected as a result of this rule.\n  In addition to the increased costs and regulations, the rule invites \ncostly litigation, and it can significantly restrict the ability of \nlandowners to make decisions about their property and make it harder \nfor State and local governments to plan for their own development.\n  Let me note that this is not the only rule the EPA has been working \non that will negatively impact the economy and the job growth in my \nState. Their proposed rule to lower the standard for ground-level ozone \nwill hurt job development in Louisiana, carrying with it health impacts \nto workers and families that are not fully considered by the EPA. It is \nclearly established that the higher the standard of living, the \nhealthier the family. These rules will lower the standard of living for \nthose who lose their jobs.\n  In Calcasieu Parish, more than $60 billion in various manufacturing \nprojects are underway and are in the process of being approved--that is \n$60 billion with a ``b.'' These will require construction workers--\nagain creating the kinds of jobs our economy needs more of. These \nprojects can be severely impacted as a consequence of this rule.\n  We see in this graphic display the navigable waters prior to the \nrelease of the rule this past week in Calcasieu Parish. Now we will see \nthe bodies that will fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal \nGovernment under the finalized rule. Again, this here is under current \nlaw. And that is what it will be. This will impact the ability of local \ngovernment to plan their development.\n  Instead of people in Louisiana deciding how best to use their \nproperty, the Federal Government will be able to dictate many land use \ndecisions, which have always been local. Again, this rule is a major \ntakeover effort by the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers. The \nadministration has stated that this rule is narrowly defined. However, \nunder the new definitions for tributaries, adjacent waters, and waters \nthat are neighboring a traditional navigable water, virtually any water \nbody could fall under the Agency's regulatory authority. And if certain \nbodies of water don't fit these definitions, the Agency can make a \ncase-by-case determinations of significant nexus.\n  Assistant Secretary Jo-Ellen Darcy from the Army Corps said last week \nthat this rule is a huge win for public health and the economy and \nreflects that clean water matters to the American people.\n  First, let me point back to this map that community leaders in \nCalcasieu Parish provided for me, highlighting that this is not a win \nfor the economy and could significantly impact economic and private \nland development moving forward.\n  Secondly, as a physician--I am a doctor--I understand the importance \nof human health, and I also understand the impacts on human health as a \nconsequence of overregulation by the Federal Government. If people are \npoor, their health suffers. There is a strong statistical relationship \nwhen, because of regulations and regulatory uncertainty, jobs are lost \noverseas. Again, I believe this revised rule is a power grab by the \nadministration and not based upon any congressional action.\n  We took a vote on this issue back in March, during the budget debate, \nto limit the expansion of Federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water \nAct, which I supported. Last fall, we took a similar vote while I was \nin the House of Representatives to repeal this harmful regulation. My \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator John Barrasso, has a bill, the Federal \nWater Quality Protection Act. It is a good bill that provides clarity \nfor how EPA should and should not define the waters of the United \nStates. I know the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, intends to move this bill \nthrough his committee soon, and I wish to offer my support for that \nlegislation.\n  Again, we have seen time and again that this administration will \nattempt to overreach the limits of what the executive branch should do. \nWhen it comes to the EPA's overreach, the waters of the United States \nrule isn't the exception; it is the norm.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3759-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CASSIDY.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about the bill that is \nbefore us and reauthorizing funding priorities for the Department of \nDefense.\n  I wish first to congratulate Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Jack \nReed for working together on a very important bill. There are a lot of \nimportant issues and a lot of important priorities in this legislation \nfor our home State in Michigan.\n  The fact that we are supporting the A-10s so our troops have the \nclose air support they need is very important. It is important that we \nare continuing to invest in research and development and new kinds of \ntechnologies. We are very proud in Michigan to be the ones that are on \nthe frontlines providing research and development for the Army. If the \nArmy drives it, we design it, fix it, and build it in Warren, MI, and \nin the surrounding area of Macomb County that we call the Defense \nCorridor, and we are very proud of that. We have vital military \nequipment manufactured here in the United States, and in Michigan, \nspecifically, that is supported in this legislation.\n  It provides very important pay increase and support for our troops \nthat are actually critical.\n  My concern is not with the contents of what we are doing in this \nparticular bill in terms of supporting the defense of our country and \nsupporting our troops. It is the fact that we have budget gimmicks \nbeing used to fund the Department of Defense.\n  Our troops deserve more than budget gimmicks. Those on the frontlines \ndeserve more than basically funding essential services or pay raises or \nessential equipment through funds that we know are sort of made-up \nfunds--another name for deficit spending. This has been done over the \nyears, as we\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\nwent to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, when there was a fund set up--the \noverseas contingency account--not including any money in it, but it was \na way to mask the fact that we were not funding the wars and we were in \nfact abusing deficit spending to do it.\n  So to continue that with the critical items in this bill is a mistake \nand, frankly, not worthy of the men and women who are on the \nfrontlines, putting their lives--putting themselves--in harm's way \nevery single day. So it is critical that we do better in terms of this \nbudget and the structure of this budget.\n  Our families also deserve better, because we need to fully fund the \nfull defense of our country--both here at home and overseas--without \nbudget gimmicks, without adding to the deficit. All those things that \ncreate a strong country and security for our families need to be done \nin a way that does not include budget gimmicks. And that, frankly, is \nnot what is being proposed.\n  That is why I am very proud to be a cosponsor of Senator Reed's \namendment, which would cap the spending on what has been called this \noverseas contingency account. Others of us at various points have \ncalled it the fake money account because there is no money in it. It is \na fancy way of covering up the fact that we are spending and adding to \nthe deficit. Senator Reed would basically indicate that this would be \ncapped. We would try to begin to rein that in, to cap that amount. We \nwould also say very clearly that we are going to address the issues \nthat affect the United States in terms of our strength, the defense, \nbroadly, of our country--whether it is in the Department of Defense or \nwhether it is in other parts of our overall budget as a Nation--by \nbasically lifting the caps--for those watching, we talk about the \nBudget Control Act, but there are caps--in a way so we can fully fund \nboth the Department of Defense but also the other things that need to \nbe done to create security and to fully make sure our families are \nsafe, our economy is safe, and that we are aggressively moving forward \nas an economy.\n  That is what Senator Reed's amendment would do. It brings some \nbalance. It begins to rein in what is a policy that does not make sense \nin terms of using budget gimmicks. As I said before, our troops \ncertainly deserve better than that, and our families deserve better \nthan that.\n  Using gimmicks is a convenient way to avoid dealing with what the \nreal problem is. There is this thing called sequestration. People \nwonder: What in the world is that? We put in a policy a number of years \nago to limit spending. The good news is that we have brought the annual \nbudget deficit down by two thirds. This is good news for our country. \nTwo thirds of the annual deficit is gone. But now, as we go forward and \nlook at what is going to grow the economy and what is going to keep us \nsafe, we look at the threats around the world that are coming at us--\nnot just through the Department of Defense but through every area of \nthe budget. When we look at what we need in terms of jobs and the \neconomy and so on, we know we need to revisit that policy and stop the \ngimmicks. Don't use gimmicks going forward to pretend that we are still \nmeeting sequestration but to look honestly at the needs of our country \ntoday and move forward.\n\n  Frankly, on the security front alone, security is more than just what \nhappens at the Department of Defense, as important as that is. It is \nall of the programs that we rely on day in and day out to keep our \ncountry safe. Certainly, we care about border security all the time. \nThat is not predominantly funded in the Department of Defense. We look \nat cyber security. It is one of the No. 1 issues we have, and we are \nhearing now from a consumer standpoint, from a security threat or \nterrorist standpoint, and from a business security standpoint. Cyber \nsecurity is absolutely critical, and it is not given the same priority \nof importance as the Department of Defense is as we look at the overall \ndefense of our country.\n  Counterterrorism--who answers the call, no matter what it is? In \nBoston, a terrorist attack--who was on the frontlines there? It was \nlocal police, local fire, which are under the broad budget parameters \nthat are being discussed now by the majority. The Republican majority \nwould provide less funding--less funding--for the frontline defense in \nour neighborhoods and in our communities.\n  Stopping weapons of mass destruction, airport security is something \nwe all know about as we get on airplanes all the time, every week. \nThere is Ebola protection, when we look at the Centers for Disease \nControl and all of the issues that relate to diseases--whether it is \nthreats at home or whether it is those that can be used in some way as \na terrorist attack. Many of the Federal agencies fighting terrorism at \nhome and protecting us from deadly diseases such as Ebola will not \nreceive critical funding under the budget that has been proposed.\n  Now, there is a willingness to use budget gimmicks in the Department \nof Defense. Again, our troops are certainly worthy of much more than \nbudget gimmicks. But when we look more broadly at the whole budget, we \ndon't even see enough to use budget gimmicks of these things. I don't \nthink we should be using budget gimmicks, but the point is there is not \nan acknowledgement that there is more to defense and safety for our \ncountry than just in one department.\n  To be strong abroad we need to be strong at home, as well, and in so \nmany other areas, as we know. If we want to talk about competing around \nthe globe, if we want to talk about what we need to be doing to be \nsecure, to have a robust economy, to outcompete the competition, we \nhave also to talk about educating our young people--which, by the way, \nis cut in the overall scheme of things in this budget. We have to talk \nabout lowering the costs of college. If there is one thing we are \nhearing over and over from young people or from those going back to job \ntraining programs who lost their job in the economy, going back to get \nnew skills to get a new job, it is about the huge debts they are \nincurring to do the right thing. People coming out of college are now \nin a situation where they can't qualify even to buy that first home. \nThey are telling me: Do something about college loan debt. We can't \nhelp young people coming out of college to buy a house. They don't \nqualify because of the amount of debt, and the amount of debt they have \nwill equal a house. That is a security issue for us--education, the \nability to have a college education, job training.\n  Investing in cures for diseases--how exciting it is for us to hear \nabout all the opportunities now through the National Institutes of \nHealth. We have so many promising opportunities and treatments and \ncures, such as on Alzheimer's--which, by the way, takes one out of \nevery five Medicare dollars--and in other areas, such as cancers, \nParkinson's disease, mental health disorders. That is part of our \nstrength and being secure and strong and robust for the future.\n  Of course, if we are going to be strong, we have to fix our roads and \nour bridges, and we don't have dollars in this budget. In fact, the \nwhole highway trust fund is going to run out in less than 60 days now \nif no action is taken by the majority, if there is no sense of urgency \nfrom our Republican colleagues.\n  So we look overall at securing those things at home and abroad, \nwhether it is making sure--beyond the Department of Defense--that we \nare funding our border security, cyber security, counterterrorism, \npolice and fire departments, airport security, and Ebola protection or \nwhether it is investing in our own people in all of this to create the \nopportunity for strong businesses, entrepreneurs, and an educated \nworkforce or for infrastructure, making sure that we have those \nairports and we have those roads.\n  As I conclude, let me say that all of this leads to the fact that we \nneed to next week vote yes on Senator Reed's amendment because that is \nwhat it is all about: real safety, real security, growing the economy \nof our country. Our people deserve better than budget gimmicks that are \nin this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3760-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3760-S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, it has been 5 years since Americans were \nforced into a broken and unhappy relationship with ObamaCare. Ever \nsince\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\nthe implementation of this failed law, Americans have received one \nbroken promise after another. For Montana families, reflecting on the \nconsequences of this law is not a happy trip down memory lane. Too many \nMontanans have seen their work hours cut, they have been forced off the \nplans they liked, and they were told they could not see the doctors \nwhom they trusted.\n  The reviews have been in for quite some time, and ObamaCare is not \nanything close to what Montanans were promised. Five years later, \ninsurance companies are still unable to find stable rates that do not \nforce more uncertainty and hardship upon Montanans. It has been widely \nreported across the country that rates for millions of Americans are \nset to skyrocket again. Look no further than Montana, where it is \nevident that health care premiums are not as affordable as President \nObama promised they would be. Policies sold through ObamaCare exchanges \nare becoming even more expensive. In fact, in Montana, according to \nfilings with the Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance, \ninsurers across the board are asking for double-digit increases for \n2016 policies on top of more increases that occurred just last year.\n  Blue Cross Blue Shield, which is Montana's largest insurer that \nboasts 255,000 consumers in the State, is asking for an average \nincrease of 23 percent for Montanans enrolled in individual plans. That \nis the start.\n  PacificSource filed papers with the commissioner requesting an \naverage of a 31-percent increase for individual plans. What about \nMontana Health CO-OP? They have requested a 38-percent increase for \nindividual plans. And Montanans who were insured under Time Insurance \nare facing a staggering 47-percent increase in 2016.\n  Increased premiums make it harder for Montanans to have access to \naffordable health care. It is money that no longer is in the pockets of \nMontanans, and those rate increases are not just in Montana. Across the \nNation, Americans are seeing massive and debilitating rate increases. \nThese hikes are a far cry from what Montanans--from what the American \npeople were promised.\n  In 2007, President Obama said himself that by the end of his first \nterm, ObamaCare would ``cover every American and cut the cost of a \ntypical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year.''\n  Montanans have not seen their premiums decreased by $2,500 a year. It \nis not even close. Unfortunately, this is the predictable result of \nforcing a partisan piece of legislation through Congress without \ntransparent consideration or bipartisan input. We need to ensure health \ncare is affordable, and it needs to be accessible for all Montanans. \nThat starts with repealing ObamaCare, repealing its costly mandates, \nrepealing its burdensome taxes, and repealing the senseless \nregulations. ObamaCare is not working and it is not popular. This law \nis a bureaucratic nightmare that hurts small businesses.\n  I just came out of a meeting with some homebuilders and small \nbusiness owners from Montana. I showed them this chart before I came \ndown to the floor. One of the builders said: This likely means I no \nlonger will be able to provide health care insurance for my employees.\n  Growing up in Montana, I grew up hunting, camping, backpacking, \nfishing. In fact, I was fly fishing in Montana before Brad Pitt made it \ncool in the movie ``A River Runs Through It.'' I know that when your \nfishing line gets tangled up, you have two options. I have been there \nmany times on one of the banks of Montana's rivers. Sometimes you take \na minute, sometimes you take several minutes, and you work to untangle \nthe line. But other times the line gets so badly knotted up that the \nbest option, instead of spending a long time untangling the line, is to \nsimply cut the line.\n  After 5 failed years, the American people know ObamaCare is too badly \ntangled to fix. It is time to cut the line and tie on a new fly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy).

Mr. President, I wish to begin my comments on this \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act, S. 1376, by thanking all of \nthe members of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. I would especially \nlike to thank the subcommittee's chairman, Senator Sessions, for the \nclose working relationship we share.\n  I want my colleagues to note that Senator Sessions and his staff \nworked closely with me and my staff in developing the elements of the \nbill pertaining to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. This bipartisan \neffort has proved fruitful as all of our provisions were adopted \nunanimously by the full committee during the markup of this bill.\n  The annual National Defense Authorization Act is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation Congress passes every year, and this \nyear will mark what I hope will be the passing of a defense \nauthorization act for the 54th year in a row.\n  I would like to give my colleagues a brief overview of the provisions \nin what we will call the NDAA, which we are considering today, as they \nrelate to the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.\n  The jurisdiction of the subcommittee includes missile defense, \nstrategic forces, space programs, the defense-funded portions of the \nDepartment of Energy, nonproliferation, and the Defense Nuclear \nFacilities Safety Board.\n  In preparing the provisions in the bill that relate to the areas of \nour jurisdiction, the subcommittee held six hearings and three \nbriefings on defense programs at the Department of Energy, strategic \nnuclear forces, missile defense, and space programs at the Department \nof Defense.\n  As I mentioned before, our committee oversees the strategic nuclear \nforces based on a triad of air, sea, and land-based delivery platforms. \nThis triad is, as Secretary Carter has called it, ``the bedrock'' of \nour national defense posture. In the wake of the Department of \nDefense's 2014 nuclear enterprise review, this is a significant year \nfor reforms and investments to ensure the safety, security, and the \neffectiveness of our nuclear deterrent.\n  Among the key priorities going forward, I look forward to working \nwith our leaders at the Department of Energy, at DOD, and my colleagues \non the committee to take advantage of smart opportunities to enhance \ncommonality across nuclear systems, sharing expertise and resources \nacross the services--particularly the Navy and Air Force--to enhance \nthe capabilities and cost-effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent in the \nfuture.\n  Critically, the bill creates a position in the Air Force responsible \nfor nuclear command, control, and communications acquisition and \npolicy. The Air Force is responsible for over 70 percent of this \nmission, which essentially connects the President to the nuclear weapon \nand the delivery platform. We have found that since the communications \nlayers involve space, air, and ground systems, there is fragmentation \nin an overall strategy as we begin the modernization of the overall \nsystem, which must be fail-safe.\n  Through hearings and briefings concerning the state of other nations' \nnuclear programs, it was clear that we face an increasingly complex \nglobal nuclear environment. We are well past the days of the Cold War. \nToday, our deterrent strategy must now account for a wide range of \nnuclear-armed nations beyond simply Russia to now include Pakistan, \nIndia, North Korea, and even China's modernization of its strategic \narsenal. Our bill contains a provision that directs the Office of Net \nAssessment to begin a study on what effect, if any, this multipolar \nnuclear environment will have on our deterrent strategy. This is an \nimportant area which will only grow as time goes on.\n  In the area of missile defense, this bill fully authorizes the \nPresident's budget request for the Missile Defense Agency and maintains \nour commitments to key allies. It includes several provisions that \nadvance MDA's efforts to deploy additional sensors and to improve the \nreliability and effectiveness\n\n[[Page S3762]]\n\nof the ground-based interceptors. The bill also contains the GAO's \nannual review of MDA's acquisition programs.\n\n  Moving on to space programs, the bill addresses several key aspects \nof space system acquisition. It includes important provisions aimed at \nmaintaining fair competition among space launch providers through \nfiscal year 2017. It does not, however, solve a potential 2- to 3-year \ngap after that, as launch providers work to develop and certify a new \nAmerican-made rocket engine to replace the Russian RD-180. I hope that \ngap does not occur, but if it does, I am sure this committee will \nrevisit and correct the issue so we can maintain a competitive and \nhealthy launch industrial base that both ensures DOD's access to space \nand saves taxpayer dollars. The bill also makes important contributions \nto ensuring that we address the threats we may face in space by \nrequiring an interagency policy and a principal DOD position to address \nthese threats.\n  We have authorized the President's requested level of funding for the \nnuclear modernization programs at the Department of Energy's National \nNuclear Security Administration, or NNSA. We also create a program that \nenables the scientists and engineers at the NNSA to work on new \nconcepts and methods that shorten the time and the cost for future life \nextensions of our warheads.\n  Let me close noting that we fully fund the President's request for \nnonproliferation at both the National Nuclear Security Administration \nand the Department of Defense. At the NNSA, these programs collect \nloose nuclear material around the world, which could be used as \nterrorist devices against us. The NNSA also maintains a network of \nradiation detectors at borders across the world to detect the illegal \ntransfer of nuclear material before it can cross our borders here in \nAmerica.\n  Finally, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program at the Department \nof Defense will continue to secure weapons of mass destruction all \naround the world, as it did with Syria's chemical weapons and dangerous \npathogens at Ebola clinics in West Africa. The relatively small sum of \nmoney in this program has made a noticeable difference in reducing \ndangerous threats to our country.\n  I take particular pride in this program as the enduring legacy of my \nfellow Hoosier, Senator Richard Lugar, who has done our Nation and the \nworld a great service as a champion for nuclear nonproliferation. He \nand Senator Sam Nunn were extraordinary leaders, and we are proud to \ntry to follow in their tradition.\n  I again thank Senator Sessions for the productive and bipartisan \nrelationship we have had on the subcommittee and also all members on \nthe subcommittee for taking part in our hearings and in crafting the \nprovisions under this subcommittee's jurisdiction.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  I yield back any remaining time that has been allotted.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had a number of our colleagues come \nto the floor to talk about the importance of the Export-Import Bank, \nand I want to see if I can put in context the exceptionally important \nwork done by our colleagues Senator Cantwell and Senator Heitkamp on \nthis issue.\n  We have been talking in this body for weeks now about the importance \nof trade and particularly tapping global markets, given the fact that \nthere are going to be 1 billion middle-class people in the developing \nworld in 2025. This is an exceptional opportunity for us to be able to \nsell the products we make here, whether they are computers or wine or \nhelicopters or planes, you name it.\n  We had a big debate about trade promotion authority. What I want to \nspend just a few minutes talking about is whether a Senator was for \ntrade promotion authority or not, they ought to support the Export-\nImport Bank because the Export-Import Bank provides key financing tools \nto promote products that are made in my home State, in the States of \nour colleagues, and all across the land. It has supported tens of \nthousands of American jobs--even hundreds of thousands--for decades. It \ndoesn't cost American taxpayers a single dime. In fact, the Export-\nImport Bank covers its own costs and then some. It actually generates \nrevenue for taxpayers--$7 billion over the last two decades and $675 \nmillion in fiscal year 2014 alone.\n  So what I would submit is the Export-Import Bank is a way to ensure \nthat in this country we get trade done right. I happen to believe it \nmakes sense to support the trade promotion act because that is going to \nensure that we are going to have a chance to drive down some of those \ntariffs that are barriers to American products. Whether you are for it \nor not, you ought to support the Export-Import Bank because it provides \nkey tools so we can reduce barriers to our exports, take on modern \nchallenges that threaten American workers, and fight to create more \nhigh-wage jobs in the United States because it provides the financing \nyou need in order to actually secure one of these deals. The Export-\nImport Bank is a core part of getting trade done right.\n  Countries, including Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Canada, all have \nagencies that are up and running and do it in a fashion that make their \nexports more competitive. How are they doing it? They are using \nfinancing tools, including supporting their manufacturers and pushing \ntheir products into the global marketplace.\n  As Senators Cantwell and Heitkamp have said, we need this tool to \nmake sure our country doesn't fall behind. We shouldn't let the Export-\nImport Bank become some kind of ideological pinata that you keep \nbashing on, not recognizing it will hurt our competitiveness. I think \nit would be legislative malpractice to let the Bank expire because it \nwould needlessly endanger the thousands of businesses and tens of \nthousands of jobs supported by Ex-Im, including many in my home State.\n  In particular, in Oregon, one can see that Ex-Im is a very \nsubstantial help to small- and medium-sized companies. In fact, 86 \npercent of the funds disbursed in fiscal year 2014 went to small \nbusinesses. Thanks to the Export-Import Bank, companies in Albany could \nfind markets abroad and hire new workers. They manufacture important \nthings such as titanium casting.\n  Selmet is a perfect example, a company that got its start in my home \nState years ago. Today, it employs hundreds of people in Oregon and \nacross the United States, and 40 percent of its revenue comes from \noverseas. They got off the ground with help from Ex-Im Bank, and it has \ncustomers in France, Germany, and Asia, and it is looking to expand \nfurther.\n  These kinds of success stories are ones you see in every single State \nbecause these startups got help when it was essential to have that \nadded boost to be able to seize the opportunities around the world and \ncreate high-skilled, high-wage jobs.\n  To me, when we debate the future of the Export-Import Bank, \ncolleagues, this is about red, white, and blue jobs. Keeping the \nExport-Import Bank up and running with the important financing tools it \noffers is part of getting trade done right.\n  I commend our colleagues Senators Cantwell, Heitkamp, Murray, and \nGraham, who have come together in a bipartisan way to work to extend \nthe Bank as quickly as possible, and they have my support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3762-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3762-S3763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL HEMP HISTORY WEEK\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I asked for an extra few minutes. I want to \nspend another few minutes just talking about another part of our \neconomy that I think can grow in the days ahead, and I would ask \nunanimous consent, Mr. President, to bring a basket of Oregon products \nonto the floor at this time.\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week is National Hemp History Week, \nand to help celebrate I thought I would show a few Oregon-made hemp \nproducts to highlight the many uses and opportunities for industrial \nhemp in my State and across the country.\n  In the basket I brought, I have food, soap, clothes, and even deck \nsealant, all made in Oregon, bought and sold in American stores and \nused by Americans. Oregon companies such as Bob's Red Mill, \nFiddlebumps, and Hemp Shield contribute to our economy in unique ways. \nIndustrial hemp supports a $620 million industry in America, and our \ncompanies have found innovative ways of incorporating it into everyday \nproducts.\n  However, the full growth potential of this industry is being cut down \nbefore it can fully bloom because a single ingredient that links all of \nthese products--the hemp itself--cannot be grown in America. The \nunfortunate reality is that current Federal rules prohibit our farmers \nfrom growing industrial hemp on American soil. This means 100 percent \nof the hemp used in these products is imported from other nations. The \nFederal ban on hemp amounts, in my view, to a restriction on free \nenterprise, and it doesn't accomplish anything but stifles job creation \nand economic growth.\n  We are the world's largest consumers of hemp products, but we are the \nonly major industrialized nation to ban hemp farming. This hasn't \nalways been the case, and it doesn't have to continue to be the case. \nIt was once a booming crop in America and it can and should be again.\n  American farmers were growing this product as early as the 1600s, \nbefore our Nation was even founded. The Declaration of Independence, \ncolleagues, was written on paper made from hemp. In the 1800s and early \n1900s, it was used to make rope, heating oil, and textiles. During \nWorld War II we used it as part of the Hemp for Victory Program to \nsupport our soldiers. But everything got changed when hemp got wrapped \nup with marijuana in Federal regulations, and it has been banned ever \nsince. Are they related? Maybe industrial hemp and marijuana are \nrelated species, but one should not be confused with the other, much \nlike a Chihuahua and a St. Bernard. Mixing hemp in with a ban on \ngrowing marijuana is based on a lot of misconception. No matter where \nMembers of this body come down on medical or recreational marijuana, \nindustrial hemp and marijuana might be related plant species, but there \nare big differences between them, such as their chemical makeup.\n\n  Because they are not the same plant, they should not be treated with \nthe same regulation and prohibitions. In my view, keeping the ban on \ngrowing hemp makes about as much sense as instituting a ban on \nPortobello mushrooms. There is no reason to outlaw a product that is \nperfectly safe because of what it is related to.\n  That is why the majority leader Senator McConnell and I came \ntogether, with our colleague from Kentucky Rand Paul and my colleague \nfrom Oregon Jeff Merkley--we came together on a bipartisan basis to \nintroduce the Industrial Hemp Farming Act. Our bill would make sure \nhemp does not get lumped into the definition of marijuana in the \nControlled Substances Act.\n  Our bill is all about stopping the unfair punishment of entrepreneurs \nand farmers who want to be part of a growing ag industry here in \nAmerica. Companies in our Nation that are importing hemp to use in \nfood, cosmetics, soap, clothing, and auto parts, they ought to be \nbuying that hemp from American farmers and contributing to our \nagricultural sector.\n  I will close by way of saying there are also big environmental \nbenefits to industrial hemp. It takes less water to grow hemp than it \ndoes to grow cotton, and hemp generally requires fewer pesticides than \nother crops. I will put it this way, colleagues: If you can buy it at \nyour local supermarket--and I got involved in this because I saw it at \nCostco when my wife was pregnant with our third child--if you can buy \nit at the local supermarket, American farmers ought to be able to grow \nit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, the distinguished majority leader \nSenator McConnell, his colleague Senator Rand Paul, and my colleague \nSenator Merkley in our legislation to address this gap in American law \nand today join me in celebrating National Hemp History Week by learning \nmore about this safe and versatile crop and the potential it holds to \nbolster American agriculture and the domestic economy.\n  These products are products that are sold all across America. We \nought to have a chance for our farmers--farmers in Nebraska, farmers in \nArkansas, farmers in Indiana--to be able to grow this product and reap \nthe benefits of the private economy associated with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is ``Waste of the Week'' time again, and \nthe waste of the Federal Government's spending just keeps piling up. \nToday, I am taking a look at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. \nWe all have a stake in this. I am a veteran, but even those of us who \nare not veterans have a stake in making sure our veterans are getting \nthe use of taxpayer dollars for their benefit for the sacrifices they \nmade.\n  Over the past year, we have been hearing on the floor and continue to \nsee story after story of mismanagement that is plaguing the VA. Many of \nthese news articles tell the story of our Nation's heroes not receiving \nthe care or the resources they have earned and that they deserve. Last \nmonth--just last month--I read yet another frightening headline, \nfrustrating. ``Veterans Affairs improperly spent $6 Billion annually, \nsenior VA official says''--improperly spent $6 billion annually.\n  According to an internal memo written by the VA's senior official for \nprocurement, the VA has been wasting taxpayer money by violating \nFederal contracting rules to pay for medical care and expenses. Under \nlaw, VA purchases require competitive bidding and proper contracts, but \ntestimony from Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Logistics \nJan Frye, before Congress last month revealed that just the opposite is \noccurring.\n  So the medical care and supplies our veterans need for their medical \nneeds are being compromised at a cost of $6 billion a year. Mr. Frye \nwrote:\n\n       Over the past five years, some senior VA acquisition and \n     finance officials have willfully violated the public trust \n     while Federal procurement and financial laws were debased. \n     Their overt actions and dereliction of duties combined have \n     resulted in billions of taxpayer dollars being spent without \n     regard to Federal laws and regulations, making a mockery of \n     Federal statutes.\n\n  An example of this violation is found with VA purchase cards. \nTypically, VA uses these cards for smaller purchases of up to $3,000, \naccording to the rules and regulations. But they were inappropriately \nused to buy billions of dollars' worth of medical supplies without \ncontracts or oversight. Mr. Frye continued:\n\n       In addition, doors are flung wide open for fraud, waste and \n     abuse when contracts are not executed. For example, by law, \n     prices paid for goods or services subject to contract can \n     only be determined to be fair and reasonable by duly \n     appointed contracting officers. I can state without \n     reservation that VA has and continues to waste millions of \n     dollars by paying excessive prices for goods and services due \n     to breaches of Federal procurement laws.\n\n  According to reports, the VA has failed to engage in a competitive \nbidding or signing contract process ensuring a good deal for the \nservices they are unable to provide in house, such as specialized tests \nand surgeries and other procedures. In fact, the VA has paid at least \n$5 billion in such fees in violation of Federal rules.\n  This is yet but another example of what the White House has \nrecognized--as--and I quote--``corrosive culture'' at the Veterans' \nAdministration. I think we all agree our 8.7 million American veterans \nand our more than 130 million taxpayers deserve a lot better. Given the \nlarge scale of purchases made by the VA, proper procurement procedures \nensure the best products for veterans and the best value for taxpayers.\n  Aside from higher prices, a lack of contracts can result in a lack of \noversight. The VA, just like Congress, is accountable and must be \naccountable for what it spends. Now, I understand the incredible \npressure the VA has been under with the recent influx of new\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\nveterans. I appreciate the good work of many people who work at the VA. \nStill, no matter the growth in need, it is never in order to violate \nFederal law. This kind of reckless spending cannot and must not be \ntolerated.\n  Each year, Congress sends billions of dollars to the VA to care for \nour veterans. With those funds, comes an obligation to use every dollar \nof those funds properly. By simply requiring the VA to comply with \nFederal law, we can save $6 billion. This is a simple fix with large \nresults and we should take it.\n  Today, I am adding an additional $6 billion to our ever-increasing \ngauge of taxpayer money that comes to Washington and is spent for \nimproper and unnecessary purposes. We are now two-thirds of the way to \nour goal of $100 billion. We are going to be doing this every week as \nlong as the Senate is in session this year. I hope we have to add an \nadditional attachment to this gauge because, folks, there is no end to \ndiscovering the kind of waste of taxpayers' money for unnecessary \nprograms, violating the law, violating regulations, mismanaging the \nspending at the Federal level. We are going to continue to point out \nthese issues week after week. Hopefully, we can get the attention of \nour colleagues and the American people, and they will demand that we do \nsomething about this.\n  While we have not been able--no thanks to the administration--to come \nup with a sensible, long-term fix to our deficit spending and \ncontinuing plunge into debt, we can at least look at these programs \nthat have been identified by the inspector generals, by the Government \nAccountability Office, and by the Office of Management and Budget as \nwasting taxpayer dollars.\n  So there is much we can do while we are trying to get to the point \nwhere we have an administration that allows us to address the larger \nissue; that is, a government out of control, spending taxpayers' money \nand wasting money, which we will point out every week. Tune in again \nnext week for the next ``Waste of the Week.''\n  I thank my colleague from Nebraska for generously yielding me the \ntime to do this. I have somewhat of a schedule hitch. She was gracious \nenough to allow me the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3764-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3764-S3765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the National \nDefense Authorization Act or NDAA. The brave men and women who serve in \nour Armed Forces have protected our Nation for generations. Because of \ntheir selflessness, we are able to enjoy many freedoms here at home, \nbut it is important to remember that these liberties are not free.\n  The sacrifices made by our servicemembers are extraordinary, and we \nmust ensure that they have the resources necessary and needed to defend \nthe United States. That is why the NDAA has been passed each of the \nlast 53 years. I was proud to continue this tradition by working with \nmy colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee to pass the fiscal \nyear 2016 NDAA only a few weeks ago.\n  While this bill is not perfect, it is the result of a bipartisan \ncompromise to perform the most important function of the Federal \nGovernment, providing for the national defense. This bill's importance \nis widely known, but the details are not often given enough attention.\n  For this reason, I would like to take a moment to discuss some of the \nkey provisions that play such a critical role in preserving the \nsecurity of our Nation and the effectiveness of our military. Included \nin this bill are several commonsense proposals to cut inefficiencies \nand use the savings that are generated to better meet the needs of our \nwarfighters.\n  For example, the Air Force's next-generation bomber and new tanker \nprogram have both suffered delays and they cannot spend the full amount \nrequested when the budget was submitted in February. So this bill \nreduces funding for these programs accordingly and moves about $660 \nmillion in savings to meet unfunded requirements of our military.\n  Across a large number of budget lines, unjustified increases were \nreduced, troubled programs were cut, and again the difference was used \nto meet high-priority requirements of our men and women in uniform.\n  The bill also combats the continued growth in headquarters staff at \nthe Pentagon and major commands, an issue I discussed with Secretary \nCarter at his confirmation hearing. Two years ago, the Department \nannounced its intention to reduce 20 percent of its headquarters staff \nby 2019. However, it has yet to provide the Armed Services Committee \nwith a plan to accomplish these reductions.\n  This legislation takes action. It reduces funding for headquarters \nand management staff by 7.5 percent. This goes beyond even the \nDepartment's stated goal. It results in $1.7 billion in savings that \nare reprioritized to support more important needs. In all, the bill \nmoves about $10 billion from unnecessary spending to increase the \ncapabilities of our warfighters. One such area is the development of \nthe advanced technologies.\n  This bill sets aside $400 million for the offset initiative announced \nby the Department in November of last year. The technological \nsuperiority of our forces has come under increasing threat in recent \nyears. This is an issue that the Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee, which I chair, has followed closely.\n  The new funding devoted to this initiative is targeted toward the \ndevelopment of the next-generation technology, such as lasers and \nrailguns that will enable our military's continued advantage on the \nbattlefield of the future.\n  I am also pleased that this bill will fully support the modernization \nof our nuclear forces, and it includes additional funding requested by \nthe Department to address critical needs in our nuclear forces \nidentified in reviews last year.\n  The bill reauthorizes key assistance and training programs, and it \nalso provides the Secretary of Defense new authority to partner with \nnations in the Middle East, the South Pacific, and Eastern Europe to \nsupport U.S. interests in these key regions. It also codifies the \nDepartment of Defense's role in defending the Nation in cyber space, \nand it requires the Department to regularly conduct training exercises \nwith other governmental agencies to meet this responsibility.\n  The importance of the last two issues I mentioned, cyber security and \nsecurity assistance programs, was reinforced during a recent trip that \nI led to Eastern Europe.\n  Our allies there are deeply concerned by Russia's military \nintervention in Ukraine and their increasingly provocative behavior. \nThey are all calling for more cooperation with the United States in \nboth of these key areas.\n  These are just a few of the reasons why the NDAA is such an important \npiece of legislation. While I strongly support many of its provisions, \nit is important to repeat that this is the product of bipartisan \ncompromise, not consensus.\n  One of the most hotly debated topics during the committee's markup \nprocess was the use of overseas contingency operations funds to meet \nbasic defense requirements. In a world where ISIL continues to expand \nits reach, Russia has seized Crimea and pours fighters into eastern \nUkraine, and China is intimidating its neighbors and building islands \nin the South China Sea, we must fund our national defense. To not do so \nwould be unacceptable. We cannot hold our military hostage to a \npolitical controversy.\n  Despite disagreements, the committee has again produced a compromise \nproduct--as it has year after year--that supports our national defense \nand the needs of our men and women in uniform. I am inspired by their \nservice, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to \nprotect our great Nation as the full Senate considers the NDAA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I understand that we are now in a \nperiod of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Therefore, it is not in order for me to call up an \namendment to the Defense bill.

January 2015 was that decision's \nfifth anniversary, and it has had a pretty nefarious effect on our \ndemocracy.\n  The premise of the decision was that unlimited corporate expenditures \nwould not corrupt or exert improper influence in our American \ndemocratic process because there would be a regime of--to quote the \ndecision--``effective disclosure'' that would ``provide shareholders \nand citizens with the information needed to hold corporations and \nelected officials accountable for their positions and supporters.''\n  Well, here we are. Everybody in this room knows that there has been \nno effective disclosure whatsoever. We live in a world of dark money in \nwhich special interests spend tens and even hundreds of millions of \ndollars in elections to buy influence and to try to make sure that \npeople get their way. There is neither public knowledge nor \naccountability about that dark money spending.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal, in an editorial in June 2012, \ndescribed the problem very well:\n\n       Money. Buckets of it. Tidal waves that one pundit has \n     dubbed the ``tsunami of slime.''\n\n  Well, we who are in this political world have experienced firsthand \nthat tsunami of slime that the Citizens United decision unleashed. In \nthe 2014 midterm elections, the Washington Post has reported that at \nleast 31 percent of all independent spending in those elections was \nspent by groups that don't disclose who their donors are. You don't \nknow who is behind their money.\n  You know the candidates know who is behind the money. For sure they \nare going to be told, but the public doesn't know who is behind that \nmoney.\n  And that 31 percent doesn't even count what are called issue ads, \nwhere somebody says the Presiding Officer, for instance, has a terrible \nposition on this issue and you need to call her and tell her that her \nposition is terrible, anti-American, wicked, no good, and that she is \nawful--and on and on they go. That is an issue ad, and so it doesn't \neven count. So that whole extra bit--also dark--is not even part of the \n31 percent.\n  And the big, obvious thing that the Citizens United decision \ncompletely overlooked is that if you give big corporations and hugely \nwealthy special interests the ability to spend on elections, guess what \nelse you give them. You give them the ability to threaten to spend or \nto promise to spend, and you know that those threats and promises are \nnever going to be in any regime of effective disclosure. That is the \nultimate private exercise of political influence. We have no idea how \nbig the effect is of those silent threats and promises--silent, at \nleast, to the public.\n  The American people are pretty fed up. The New York Times this week \nreported on a poll, and I will just quote a little bit from the story:\n\n       The findings reveal deep support among Republicans and \n     Democrats alike for new measures to restrict the influence of \n     wealthy givers, including limiting the amount of money that \n     can be spent by ``super PACs'' and forcing more public \n     disclosure on organizations now permitted to intervene in \n     elections without disclosing the names of their donors.\n\n  And the story continues:\n\n       And by a significant margin, they reject the argument that \n     underpins close to four decades of Supreme Court \n     jurisprudence on campaign finance: that political money is a \n     form of speech protected by the First Amendment.\n\n  Clearly, money facilitates speech, but it also facilitates bribery. \nIt also facilitates simply bludgeoning political actors and political \nparties with pressure.\n  Now, the results here:\n\n       More than four in five Americans [more than 80 percent of \n     Americans] say money plays too great a role in political \n     campaigns . . . while two-thirds say that the wealthy have \n     more of a chance to influence the elections process than \n     other Americans.\n\n  That is not healthy when 80 percent of Americans think that money \nplays too great a part and two-thirds of Americans think that they \ndon't have an equal shot in elections compared to the wealthy.\n  And it is not only Democrats and independents who feel this way. I \nwill continue to read:\n\n       Those concerns--and the divide between Washington elites \n     and the rest of the country--extend to Republicans. Three-\n     quarters of self-identified Republicans support requiring \n     more disclosure by outside spending organizations. . . . \n     Republicans in the poll were almost as likely as Democrats to \n     favor further restrictions on campaign donations.\n\n  So if three-quarters of self-identified Republicans support requiring \nmore disclosure by outside political spending organizations, I would \nhope that I could get support for this amendment which would require \nsome disclosure.\n  It would require any company that contracts with the Department of \nDefense--and they get big contracts with billions, hundreds of billions \nof dollars--to disclose all of its campaign spending over $10,000. It \nis a requirement that would apply to all the corporate officers, the \nboard members, and to anyone who owns 5 percent or more of the company.\n  When there is that much money sloshing around in the defense budget, \nand when political actors are making the decisions about where that \ngoes, we ought to be able to connect the dots between those \ncorporations and whom they are giving big money to.\n  So this is a very simple disclosure provision. Again, 75 percent of \nRepublicans support increased disclosure, and, in fact, a considerable \nnumber of Republicans in the Senate used to support disclosure. Over \nand over, you see Members who are still here, including the majority \nleader, who were ardent supporters of disclosure--ardent supporters of \ndisclosure, that is, until it turned out that after Citizens United, \nthe big, dark money tended to come in on behalf of--guess what--\nRepublicans.\n  So the disclosure principle evaporated, but I think it has to come \nback. The public is sick of it. It is time we cleaned up the political \nprocess from all this dark money. It is totally consistent with the \npremise of the Citizens United decision.\n  So when the time comes for me to call up this amendment and get it \npending, I will do so with the hope that we can find some Republican \nsupport for the American people being allowed to know who is spending \nbig bucks to influence elections. We are entitled to know that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3765-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3765-S3766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1521\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, one other thing I wish to speak in \nfavor of is the amendment of Senator Reed, my senior Senator--Senator \nJack Reed of Rhode Island--to cut the so-called OCO budget gimmick from \nthe Defense bill.\n  I am on the Budget Committee, and I have heard very passionate \nprotestations from my colleagues on the Budget Committee about the \nimportance of reducing the deficit, not dealing with the national debt, \nreducing borrowing, deficit spending, and all of that. Well, when it \ncomes to this particular bill, suddenly all of those concerns have gone \ncompletely out the window. They are funding a significant portion of \nthis Defense authorization with imaginary money, with an account that \nis not intended to support ongoing, continuing, baseline defense \nexpenditures, and that is reserved for overseas contingencies and that, \ntherefore, doesn't have to be paid for. So it would be a clear increase \nto the debt and the deficit to go down this road, and we would very \nmuch prefer that instead of using the so-called OCO gimmick to fund \nthis authorization with deficit spending, we sit down and have a mature \nand consequential discussion between the White House and the Senate and \nthe House on where our spending is going to go and with what accounts \nwe are going to be able to do it. Before we start going account by \naccount through the appropriations process, we have a plan in mind so \nthat we don't find that certain favored accounts get dealt with first \nand then the rug gets pulled out from under the others.\n  I think that is a reasonable way, and I support Senator Reed's \namendment and his notion that we should have a bipartisan plan to \nreplace the arbitrary sequester cuts with a balanced deficit-reduction \nstrategy that includes, among other things, closing some wasteful tax \nloopholes.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when we talk about national security \nissues and the vulnerabilities we have as a nation, I can think of no \nother area where we face such challenges and yet such opportunities \nwhen it comes to our energy assets and how we can utilize our energy \npolicies at their intersection points with our national security \npolicies.\n  The inability of the United States to export oil is a vulnerability \nto our nation. At a time when we have risen to be the world's top \nproducer of oil, our outdated 1970s-era ban on oil exports is causing \nus to miss out on a significant economic- and security-related \nbenefits.\n  The good news is we can change this. It is within our power to change \nthis, and that is why I have come to the floor this afternoon.\n  Here is a fact: The United States is the only advanced Nation that \nprohibits crude oil exports. We are the only one. Countries such as \nAustralia, Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom, Canada, and even New \nZealand all allow for both imports and exports, just like the normal \ntrade in any other commodity. It is distinctly weird that we would \nprohibit our own exports.\n  We are also in a position where our friends and our trading partners \nare openly asking us for assistance. They are coming to us and saying: \nHey, can you help? We are your friends. We are your allies. You have \nthe resources.\n  The world has changed dramatically. We have new alliances. We have \nnew threats. We have new hopes. We have new fears. It is my own hope \nthat while the world may have changed, our Nation's role as a global \nleader has not eroded. This is an area where we have an opportunity to \nprove it has not eroded.\n  Our energy renaissance is a new thing, and sometimes it takes time to \nunderstand the implications of new things, of changes, but here is \nwhere we have been. We have already held about half a dozen hearings on \nthe topic of oil exports in the House and in the Senate since last \nJanuary. I introduced this subject last January 2014, and I said at \nthat time that 2014 was going to be the year of the report, where we \nwould seek out the experts, we would ask the think tanks to weigh in on \nthis issue, and so they did. The reports that came out were numerous, \nthey were considered, they were thoughtful, and they were all very \nhelpful. Reports came out of the Brookings Institution, Columbia \nUniversity, the Center for a New American Security--too many to even \nlist here. The individual experts who are in favor of allowing oil \nexports are also quite impressive. These are people whom we look to for \nleadership in a host of different areas.\n  There was a piece in the Wall Street Journal that I ask unanimous \nconsent be printed in the Record, penned by Leon Panetta and Stephen \nHadley, the Defense Secretary in the Obama administration and the \nNational Security Advisor in the Bush administration. They wrote a \npiece that was entitled ``The Oil-Export Ban Harms National Security.'' \nIt is well-founded, well-written, and to the point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Wall Street Journal (Opinion) May 19, 2015]\n\n               The Oil-Export Ban Harms National Security\n\n\n The U.S. is willfully denying itself a tool that could prove vital in \n           dealing with threats from Russia, Iran and others\n\n               (By Leon E. Panetta and Stephen J. Hadley)\n\n       The United States faces a startling array of global \n     security threats, demanding national resolve and the resolve \n     of our closest allies in Europe and Asia. Iran's moves to \n     become a regional hegemon, Russia's aggression in Ukraine, \n     and conflicts driven by Islamic terrorism throughout the \n     Middle East and North Africa are a few of the challenges \n     calling for steadfast commitment to American democratic \n     principles and military readiness. The pathway to achieving \n     U.S. goals also can be economic--as simple as ensuring that \n     allies and friends have access to secure supplies of energy.\n       Blocking access to these supplies is the ban on exporting \n     U.S. crude oil that was enacted, along with domestic price \n     controls, after the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The price controls \n     ended in 1981 but the export ban lives on, though America is \n     awash in oil.\n       The U.S. has broken free of its dependence on energy from \n     unstable sources. Only 27% of the petroleum consumed here \n     last year was imported, the lowest level in 30 years. Nearly \n     half of those imports came from Canada and Mexico. But our \n     friends and allies, particularly in Europe, do not enjoy the \n     same degree of independence. The moment has come for the U.S. \n     to deploy its oil and gas in support of its security \n     interests around the world.\n       Consider Iran. Multilateral sanctions, including a cap on \n     its oil exports, brought Tehran to the negotiating table. \n     Those sanctions would have proved hollow without the surge in \n     domestic U.S. crude oil production that displaced imports. \n     Much of that foreign oil in turn found a home in European \n     countries, which then reduced their imports of Iranian oil to \n     zero.\n       The prospect of a nuclear agreement with Iran does not \n     permit the U.S. to stand still. Once world economic growth \n     increases the demand for oil, Iran is poised to ramp up its \n     exports rapidly to nations whose reduced Iranian imports were \n     critical to the sanctions' success, including Japan, South \n     Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, India and China. U.S. exports would \n     help those countries diversify their sources and avoid \n     returning to their former level of dependence on Iran.\n       More critically, if negotiations fail, or if Tehran fails \n     to comply with its commitments, the sanctions should snap \n     back into place, with an even tighter embargo on Iranian oil \n     exports. It will be much harder to insist that other \n     countries limit Iranian imports if the U.S. refuses to sell \n     them its oil.\n       There are other threats arising from global oil suppliers \n     that the U.S. cannot afford to ignore. Libya is racked by \n     civil war and attacks by the Islamic State. Venezuela's \n     mismanaged economy is near collapse.\n       Most ominous is Russia's energy stranglehold on Europe. \n     Fourteen NATO countries buy 15% or more of their oil from \n     Russia, with several countries in Eastern and Central Europe \n     exceeding 50%. Russia is the sole or predominant source of \n     natural gas for several European countries including Finland, \n     Slovakia, Bulgaria and the Baltic states. Europe as a whole \n     relies on Russia for more than a quarter of its natural gas.\n       This situation leaves Europe vulnerable to Kremlin \n     coercion. In January 2009, Russia cut off natural gas to \n     Ukraine, and several European countries completely lost their \n     gas supply. A recent EU ``stress test'' showed that a \n     prolonged Russian supply disruption would result in several \n     countries losing 60% of their gas supplies.\n       Further, revenue from sales to Europe provides Russia with \n     considerable financial resources to fund its aggression in \n     Ukraine. That conflict could conceivably spread through \n     Central Europe toward the Baltic states. So far, the trans-\n     Atlantic alliance has held firm, but the trajectory of this \n     conflict is unpredictable. The U.S. can provide friends and \n     allies with a stable alternative to threats of supply \n     disruption. This is a strategic imperative as well as a \n     matter of economic self-interest.\n       The domestic shale energy boom has supported an estimated \n     2.1 million U.S. jobs, according to a 2013 IHS study, but the \n     recent downturn in oil prices has led to massive cuts in \n     capital spending for exploration and production. Layoffs in \n     the oil patch have spread outward, notably to the steel \n     industry. Lifting the export ban would put some of these \n     workers back on the job and boost the U.S. economy.\n       Why, then, does the ban endure? Habit and myth have \n     something to do with it. U.S. energy policy remains rooted in \n     the scarcity mentality that took hold in the 1970s. Even now, \n     public perception has yet to catch up to the reality that \n     America has surpassed both Russia and Saudi Arabia as the \n     world's largest producer of liquid petroleum (exceeding 11 \n     million barrels a day). The U.S. became the largest natural \n     gas producer in 2010, and the federal government will now \n     license exports of liquefied natural gas.\n       The fear that exporting U.S. oil would cause domestic \n     gasoline prices to rise is misplaced. The U.S. already \n     exports refined petroleum, including 875,000 barrels a day of \n     gasoline in December 2014. The result is that U.S. gasoline \n     prices approximate the world price. Several recent studies, \n     including by the Brookings Institution, Resources for the \n     Future and Rice University's Center for Energy Studies, \n     demonstrate that crude oil exports would actually put \n     downward pressure on U.S. gasoline prices, as more oil supply \n     hits the global market and lowers global prices.\n       Too often foreign-policy debates in America focus on issues \n     such as how much military power should be deployed to the \n     Middle East, whether the U.S. should provide arms to the \n     Ukrainians, or what tougher economic sanctions should be \n     imposed on Iran. Ignored is a powerful, nonlethal tool: \n     America's abundance of oil and natural gas. The U.S. remains \n     the great arsenal of democracy. It should also be the great \n     arsenal of energy.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. It said directly: We keep this ban in place, this \ndecades-\n\n[[Page S3767]]\n\nold ban. It hurts us as a nation. It harms us from a national security \nperspective, not to mention the benefits that oil exports will provide \nwhen it comes to increased production and increased jobs benefits to \nour economy.\n  There are other folks out there who have also weighed in. Larry \nSummers, formerly the Treasury Secretary for President Clinton and also \nDirector of the National Economic Council for President Obama, said \nthis about lifting the ban on oil exports: ``The merits are as clear as \nthe merits with respect to any significant public policy issue that I \nhave ever encountered.'' This is a guy many people looked to for \nleadership in a host of different areas. The merits are as clear as the \nmerits with respect to any significant public policy issue he has \nencountered.\n  Tom Donilon, formerly the National Security Advisor to President \nObama, has said that allowing exports ``will increase diversity of \nsupply, increase competition, reduce volatility and lower prices in \nglobal markets.''\n  The questions we needed to ask about oil exports have been asked, and \nanswered favorably. Independent experts have studied what would happen \nif we lift the ban and almost universally encouraged us to move forward \nto lift this outdated, outmoded policy.\n  This is not a partisan issue. My colleague from North Dakota is on \nthe floor today. We have introduced bipartisan legislation to remove \nthis ban. This is something which is simply in the best interest of the \nUnited States, both in terms of our economic strength and in terms of \nour national security.\n  I am here today to tell our colleagues, to repeat and remind our \ncolleagues that the time to legislate on oil exports is now. I think \nthe bill we have in front of us, the National Defense Authorization Act \nbeing led by our friend and colleague from Arizona, is the perfect \nvehicle on which to advance this. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to \ncall up and make pending my amendment No. 1594, related to crude oil \nexports.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the request to make this amendment pending \nat this point in time, but if I may proceed to speak to three quick \ncomponents to the amendment.\n  The first requires the Department of Energy to assess the impact that \nlifting sanctions on Iran would have on global oil markets. We would \nlikely see higher Iranian oil exports, even as American producers are \nprohibited from accessing global markets. So our friends in Japan, \nIndia, South Korea, and elsewhere would continue importing from Iran, \nin part because they cannot get the crude oil from us. They cannot \nimport from us. That situation is simply unacceptable. We would be \nlifting sanctions on Iranian oil while maintaining them on American \noil.\n  I have made this point and I have repeated it before: Leaving in \nplace the oil export ban on U.S. producers while at the same time \nsanctions are relieved on Iranian producers effectively sanctions U.S. \noil production.\n  There was an article in Reuters this week that revealed that India is \nnow importing record volumes of oil directly from Iran. Another from \nMay showed record oil exports out of Iraq to global markets. Yet \nanother shows the highest volumes of oil exports from Saudi Arabia in \n10 years. So the fact is that we are simply not competing.\n  The second component of my amendment says that 30 days after \ncompletion of this report, all U.S. crude oil may be exported on the \nsame basis as the regulations and law currently allow for exports of \npetroleum products. Today, we can export gasoline, we can export \ndiesel, we can export jet fuel--really, any refined product we can \nexport without a license--but we cannot export crude oil. It does not \nmake sense, and it is high time we resolve that inconsistency.\n  The third component of my amendment preserves the authorities of the \nPresident to block exports during emergencies, during a national \nsecurity crisis, and so forth.\n  So what we have done is we have borrowed language on these \nauthorities directly from the legislation from 20 years ago that \nauthorized oil exports from Alaska's North Slope, which was a measure \nthat passed the Senate on a bipartisan vote, 74 to 25, and was signed \ninto law by President Clinton. What we had over 20 years ago was an \noverwhelmingly favorable vote well before this American energy \nrenaissance began.\n  I find the whole idea that oil exports would still be prohibited a \nlittle mind-boggling. The Commerce Department keeps a list of \ncommodities that are in short supply. They call this the short supply \ncontrols. Historically, these controls were generally not blanket \nprohibitions; they were on items such as aluminum, copper, iron and \nsteel scrap, diamond bort and powder, nickel selenium, and the polio \nvaccine--not blanket prohibitions, just bits of them. Only three items \nremain on the short supply controls list. One of them--you guessed it--\nis crude oil, the second is western red cedar, and the third is horse \nfor slaughter. There is also a small caveat here that prohibits exports \nfrom the Naval Petroleum Reserves, but, really, the list is pretty \nshort. There are three things: crude oil, western cedar trees, and \nhorse for slaughter. Clearly our policy needs to be modernized.\n  We see many parts of the world in a state of unrest. Many parts of \nthe world are seemingly on fire. America and American energy need to be \nready to render vital assistance to our friends who are counting on us \nto demonstrate that global leadership. This is our chance, and I look \nforward to further discussion on the floor as we move this NDAA measure \nforward.\n  I encourage colleagues to look at this amendment, look at the merits \nof the reports that have gone down in the past year, and look to \nupdating this very outdated policy that is holding us back as a nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for her \nremarks. Please count me in.

Mr. President, this Saturday will be the 71st \nanniversary of one of the greatest days in history--D-day, June 6, \n1944, the day that led to Allied victory in Europe in World War II, the \npreservation of Western democracy, no less, and freedom for generations \nto come.\n  Few days in history belong to individuals, but this day, D-day, \nbelongs to Dwight David Eisenhower. Ike came to this day, which forever \nestablished his place in history as a soldier, as a Kansan, and most of \nall as an American.\n  I come to the floor today as a Senator, as a marine, and as Ike's \nfellow Kansan. Most of all, I come to share Ike with my fellow \nAmericans and my colleagues in the Senate.\n  There are days in history that change nations and the course of \nhistory itself. D-day, June 6, 1944, was one of those days. The events \ngrowing out of that day changed the course of millions of lives, \npreserved Western civilization, and led to victory over a ruthless \ntyranny totally dedicated to destroying democracy.\n  The sacrifices and human losses were immense. Several weeks ago, on \nMay 8, the whole of Europe--from Amsterdam to Moscow--was not only \ncelebrating European victory in World War II but also remembering the \nspecial sacrifices of the brave young Americans who made victory \npossible when it seemed impossible, especially in June of 1944, when \nthe whole of Europe and much of Russia was under the Nazi boot. These \ncataclysmic events were set in motion on D-day by the heroic \ndecisionmaking of one man, a Kansan from modest origins and humble \nroots--Dwight David Eisenhower--who, at the direction of the President \nof the United States, carried individually the sole responsibility of \nsupreme command of all Allied forces in Europe in World War II.\n  The decision to launch the invasion was his alone, and the risk of \nfailure was enormous, with huge human losses assured for America and \nall of its allies. Ike's decision, however, proved correct and was \nfollowed by the greatest demonstration of military coalition leadership \never seen in history--before or since D-day. This brilliant leadership \nby General Eisenhower led to victory in Europe in 1945, followed by the \ndefeat of Japan.\n  Ike never let his gigantic role in history push his ego ahead of \nmodesty, common sense, and humility. As he famously said in 1945, \n``Humility must always be the portion of any man who receives acclaim \nearned in blood of his followers and sacrifices of his friends.''\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\n  Ike's transcending humanity won not only his fellow citizens' respect \nbut also their affection. Indeed, he won the respect and affection of \nmuch of the world, and he is celebrated internationally to this very \nday.\n  Currently, I am privileged to serve as the chairman of the Eisenhower \nMemorial Commission. Two giants of the United States Senate brought me \nto this role: Congressional Medal of Honor winner Danny Inouye and U.S. \nArmy Flying Tiger pilot Ted Stevens, both combat-decorated World War II \nveterans who decided Ike, both as general and as President, should be \nnationally memorialized. They decided and convinced the Congress that \nthe general and President Eisenhower should be nationally celebrated. \nAnd the day it all began was D-day.\n  Senator Inouye from Hawaii and Senator Stevens from Alaska knew that \nIke represented more than Kansas, more than America, but the entire \nworld as well and that he spoke to the world. His identity was simple, \nbasic, and convincing. In paying homage in 1945 to the British fathers \nand mothers of the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who had died under his \ncommand, he also said, ``I am not a native of this land. I come from \nthe very heart of America.''\n  It is a paradox of unfortunate irony that those members of the \n``greatest generation'' who come on Honor Flights from all across our \ngreat Nation to the World War II Memorial cannot visit, reflect, and \npay homage to a memorial to the general who led them to victory.\n  Today, in the midst of a much different war and during a time when \nour Nation is searching for resolve, commitment, and leadership, I \nsuggest and recommend that all of my colleagues reflect upon the unique \nleadership of America's greatest general when the future of Western \ndemocracy was in grave peril. Time is of the essence, and now is the \ntime to complete a lasting memorial and tribute to America's greatest \nwartime general and President of the United States whose legacy was 8 \nyears of peace and prosperity. The veterans of World War II and their \nfamilies know this, and their counterparts all over the world know this \nas well. With the completion of the Eisenhower memorial, their children \nand grandchildren and generations to come will understand the \ntremendous commitment undertaken in defense of freedom, then and now.\n  Now is the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OIL EXPORTS\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP.

What \ndo I mean by that? Changing this policy has hundreds of good ideas and \ngood reasons, and there is absolutely no reason not to do it. As we \ncontinue to pursue fairness for the oil-and-gas-producing industry, \nallowing them to seek their market as we continue to pursue an \nopportunity for our consumers to experience lower oil and gas prices, \nas we kind of move forward with oil and gas policy, I think it is \ncritically important that we understand and appreciate that in this \narena, the effort is bipartisan, the effort is essential for energy \nsecurity in our country, energy independence in our country, and energy \nsecurity across the world.\n  I applaud Senator Murkowski for taking on this issue. I believe that \nas she has said, this is the year it must get done. I look forward to \nour continuing efforts, our bipartisan efforts to move this along.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3768-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3768-S3770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING VIETNAM VETERANS AND NORTH DAKOTA'S SOLDIERS WHO LOST THEIR \n                            LIVES IN VIETNAM\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, before I begin to talk about the 198 \nNorth Dakotans who died while serving our country in Vietnam, I want to \nfirst mention and publicly thank a great Vietnam veteran, Jim \nSchothorst of Grand Forks. He is a Vietnam veteran. He enlisted in the \nArmy and served in Vietnam from December 1966 to March 1969 as a \nconstruction engineer with the 169th Engineer Battalion.\n  He was raised in McVille. He now lives in Grand Forks. He received \nhis degree from the University of North Dakota and was employed with \nthe Grand Forks Health Department for 25 years.\n  Jim has been extraordinarily helpful to the North Dakota \ncongressional delegation whenever we have needed to gather input or \nhear from Grand Forks area veterans.\n  Thank you, Jim, for your service to our country.\n  I want to again extend my comments and talk about 14 men who did not \nmake it home from Vietnam.\n\n\n                          Wesley Craig Brenno\n\n  The first soldier whom I will talk about is Wesley Craig Brenno. \nCraig was from Larson. He was born February 18, 1945. He served in the \nMarine Corps Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines. Craig died on \nMarch 28, 1967. He was 22 years old.\n  He attended school in Columbus and was a star athlete. He was voted \nmost valuable player, and he lettered in baseball, basketball, and \nfootball from eighth grade through his senior year of high school.\n  In 1963, he began his college career at the University of North \nDakota on a baseball scholarship and became an active member and \nofficer of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. After finishing his junior \nyear of college, Craig enlisted in the Marine Corps. The Acting \nSecretary of the Navy wrote the following in Craig's citation for the \nSilver Star Medal.\n\n       He unhesitatingly assumed the hazardous point position and \n     while fearlessly advancing at the front of his team, he was \n     severely wounded by an enemy mine. Despite intense pain, he \n     valiantly continued to direct his men, urging them forward to \n     complete their mission.\n\n  About a week after sustaining that injury, Craig died from his \nwounds. Nearly 600 people attended Craig's funeral.\n  In addition to receiving many medals honoring his sacrifice and \nservice, Craig was also inducted into the North Dakota American Legion \nBaseball Hall of Fame, and his fraternity named their library after \nhim.\n  His family cherishes an essay entitled ``My Philosophy of Life'' \nCraig wrote in the eighth grade, where he stated:\n\n       I believe in a free country. People must have courage and \n     be willing to fight for our freedom.\n\n\n                           Christopher Davis\n\n  Christopher Davis was from Belcourt and was born June 1, 1942. He \nserved in the Army's 17th Field Hospital as a medic. Chris was 24 years \nold when he died on March 18, 1967.\n  He was one of seven children. Also, his nephew, Gerald, was raised by \nChris's parents and the two were as close as brothers. Gerald remembers \nChris's fun personality and the little jokes and tricks he played on \npeople, like dressing up and impersonating others. Chris loved to sing \nand play the guitar, and once won second place in a contest singing \nRicky Nelson's ``Poor Little Fool.''\n  While serving in Vietnam, Chris mailed his parents a letter \ndescribing seeing more blood in 1 day in the hospital in Vietnam than \nhe had seen in his whole lifetime before that.\n  After Chris died, Gerald served in the Army in Vietnam. Gerald went \nto visit the hospital where Chris worked but left almost as soon as he \nentered because of the awful cries and screams that he heard. Chris's \nfamily says that Chris's son Marcus has similar looks and mannerisms to \nChris. Marcus was just a baby when Chris died.\n\n\n                             DeWayne Selby\n\n  DeWayne Selby was from Bismarck. He was born July 6, 1948. He served \nin the Marine Corps' India Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. DeWayne \ndied on May 26, 1968. He was 19 years old.\n  DeWayne was one of four children. His brother, Richard, also served \nour country in the Navy. DeWayne's sister, Phyllis, and his wife, Evan, \nremember what a soft heart DeWayne had. When he was 15 years old, he \nmoved in with his grandparents so he could help take care of his aging \ngrandfather. After high school, DeWayne worked as a mechanic, often \nfixing cars for free for\n\n[[Page S3769]]\n\npeople who did not have any money. DeWayne taught Phyllis how to play \nfootball and baseball with the boys, but if they got too rough, DeWayne \nprotected his little sister.\n  DeWayne was shot and killed about a month into his tour of duty in \nVietnam.\n\n\n                              Larry Warbis\n\n  Larry Warbis was from Haynes.

He was \n19 years old.\n  Larry was one of five children and attended Haynes High School, where \nhe played basketball. He then worked at the Haynes elevator, where his \nbrother managed the elevator.\n  Larry's sister, Vicki, says that she and Larry spent their free time \ntogether hunting, catching snakes, and shooting pheasants year-round. \nTheir mother scolded them for shooting pheasants out of season but then \ncooked the birds for the family to eat anyway.\n  Vicki remembers Larry as a kind, soft person. Their cousin, Sharon \nCampbell, remembers having fun babysitting Larry and what a nice young \nman he grew up to be.\n  Larry was killed about 2 months into his tour of duty in Vietnam. \nLarry's body was returned to his family on his 20th birthday.\n\n\n                        Dennis ``Buddy'' Wosick\n\n  Dennis ``Buddy'' Wosick was from Grand Forks and was born September \n26, 1947. He served in the Army's 11th Infantry Brigade. Buddy died on \nJune 9, 1969. He was 21 years old.\n  Although Dennis was his name, he was known to all of his family and \nfriends as Buddy. First, he was his dad's little buddy, and as he grew \nup, he became a buddy to all who knew him.\n  He had dreams about becoming an astronaut, and he could fix anything, \nincluding HAM radios, TVs, and cars. To this day, Buddy's family still \nhears from people who knew him and people who have beautiful stories \nabout his character, like when he gave up his lunch at school for \nanother boy who had been bullied and whose sandwich was thrown on the \nground.\n  Buddy died saving the men in his barracks from an explosion that \ncould have killed them if he had not bravely jumped into the ammunition \ntruck to drive it from the targeted barracks as it was being attacked. \nHis sister, Kathy, whom I had the privilege to meet last Sunday in \nFargo, believes that Buddy knew he was giving his life by driving that \ntruck away, but that was the kind of guy Buddy was.\n\n\n                    Ernest ``Ernie'' Bartolina, Jr.\n\n  Ernest ``Ernie'' Bartolina, Jr., was a Bismarck native. He was born \nDecember 29, 1942. He served as a captain in the Marine Corps flying \nhelicopters. Ernie was 26 years old when he died on February 7, 1969.\n  He played the French horn in the band while attending Bismarck High \nSchool. He later attended Bismarck Junior College and the University of \nNorth Dakota where he received a degree in accounting.\n  Ernie's sister, Jan, says that he liked to have fun and had a good \nsense of humor. He and his dad enjoyed hunting and fishing together as \noften as they could.\n  Ernie was killed when the helicopter he was flying on an emergency \nmedical evacuation mission was shot down and crashed. The only survivor \nof the crash spoke with Jan and explained that Ernie's calm and \ncollected manner was the reason that survivor was able to live and that \nErnie was highly respected by his fellow Marines.\n\n\n                            Paul Charnetzki\n\n  Paul Charnetzki was from Valley City and was born May 25, 1936. He \nserved in the Army's Military Assistance Command--Vietnam Advisers. \nPaul was 31 years old when he died on February 7, 1968.\n  Paul left behind his wife and five sons. One son, also named Paul, \nsaid that his father loved this country and the Army. He was a \nprofessional soldier, and he respected and cared for his fellow \nsoldiers.\n  He spent as much time as he could with his sons, settling their \nfights and pretending to be tackled in their backyard football games.\n  Paul was killed when the Vietnamese unit he was advising was \nambushed. He was shot while assisting his unit members into the \nevacuation helicopter.\n  Paul was awarded the Silver Star Medal for his gallantry in action, \nand his son Paul believes that he would have been proud of that award, \nbut even more proud of what his friends told Paul's family; that he was \nthe ultimate warrior.\n\n\n                         Joseph ``Bill'' Crary\n\n  Joseph ``Bill'' Crary was from Fargo and was born April 18, 1945. He \nserved in the Army's 196th Infantry Brigade. He was 25 years old when \nhe died on May 27, 1970.\n  Bill was one of seven children. There were three sets of twins in his \nfamily. Bill and his twin sister, Kathy, were the oldest twins in the \nfamily. Bill's brother, Mike, also served in Vietnam.\n  The Crary family honors Mike as a hero for his service and \nselflessness as well. Mike told Bill that instead of being drafted, \nBill should enlist and Mike would offer to sign up for a second tour of \nduty so Bill would not have to serve in Vietnam, but Bill did not \nagree.\n  Bill had earned a degree from St. Louis University and was attending \nthe University of North Dakota Law School when he was drafted.\n  His siblings believe Bill was special and excelled at everything. \nThey believe he could have held office at the highest level. Bill's \ncousin, Jim Crary, says Bill always saw the bright side of situations \nand was determined to do the best at whatever he was doing. Jim wrote a \nbook about Bill titled ``War Doesn't Bother Butterflies (But It Killed \nBill).'' Jim's book details Bill's life and death and includes letters \nBill wrote to friends and family.\n  In Vietnam, Bill became a medic and died 1 month after arriving in \nVietnam. He was killed after running to provide first aid and evacuate \na fellow soldier who had been shot. Bill was awarded the Silver Star \nfor his heroism and his devotion to his duty.\n\n\n                             Roger Foreman\n\n  Roger Foreman was from New Town and was born August 4, 1947. He \nserved in the Army's 101st Airborne Division. Roger died on July 18, \n1969. He was 21 years old.\n  He was the oldest of three children. His father, Earl, was wounded \nwhile serving in the Army in World War II.\n  Roger's brother, Dale, says that Roger was a caring person who loved \nhis family and his country. Roger also loved his mom's home cooking. \nHis mother is still alive today. She is 95 years old.\n  In his free time, Roger enjoyed hunting, fishing, motorcycles, track, \nfootball, and basketball. A highlight of his high school experience was \ntaking second place in the 1963 State Class B Basketball Tournament.\n  After his death, Roger was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for Valor \nand the Purple Heart.\n\n\n                              James Fowler\n\n  James Fowler was from Bismarck and was born January 7, 1938. He was a \nlieutenant colonel in the Air Force's 523rd Tactical Fighter Squadron. \nJames was 34 years old when he went missing on June 6, 1972.\n  In Bismarck, he attended St. Mary's High School. His family says he \nalways loved North Dakota.\n  In 1960, James earned a degree in architecture from the University of \nNotre Dame, where there is today a scholarship named after him for his \noutstanding work called Outstanding ROTC.\n  In 1972, James and CPT John Seuell were flying an F4D aircraft that \nwas shot down over Vietnam. Their bodies have never been recovered.\n  In addition to his mother Mildred and his sister Marcene, James left \nbehind his wife Maralyn, daughter Jody, and son Stephen.\n  In 1989, the sons of the two MIA pilots met by chance. Stephen and \nCaptain John Seuell's son, also named John, met at a banquet, learned \nthat they grew up near each other, and both began attending the Air \nForce Academy in Florida. Both boys had lifelong dreams to fly and \nbecome pilots like their fathers.\n\n\n                         ROBERT ``BOB'' HIMLER\n\n  Robert ``Bob'' Himler was from Williston and was born October 21, \n1942. He served as a captain in the Marine Corps. Robert was 25 years \nold when he died on October 24, 1968.\n  He was attending the University of North Dakota with plans to become \na doctor, but he paused his studies to enlist in the Marines.\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n  In Vietnam, Robert was killed when the helicopter he was flying was \nstruck by hostile fire, crashed, and burned.\n  In addition to his parents and siblings, he left behind his wife, \nDoris.\n  Robert's family says that everyone loved him and that to this day, \nwhenever his classmates see his sister, Patty, they still talk about \nhim.\n  Robert's mother's husband, Duane, has a diary that Robert kept while \nhe served in Vietnam. Duane notes the interesting fact that Robert \nstopped writing in the diary about 5 months before he died.\n\n\n                             BYRON KULLAND\n\n  Byron Kulland was from New Town and was born on November 9, 1947.

He \nserved in the Army's 101st Airborne Division Artillery. John was 22 \nyears old when he died on November 27, 1968.\n  John's family says that he loved barefoot waterskiing and flying. \nJohn chose to serve so that none of his three brothers would ever have \nto.\n  The last letter John mailed to his parents from Vietnam described, \nwith a positive outlook, living and working in less-than-ideal \nconditions. In his letter, he wrote that he expected to be promoted and \nreceive a better aircraft in about 1 month. But almost 2 weeks after \nwriting the letter, John's aircraft was shot down and John was killed.\n  His captain wrote John's parents a letter that said:\n\n       John was the most outstanding young officer in my battery.\n       He was hardworking and conscientious in all that he did. \n     His personal courage on combat operations won him not only \n     the respect of all the officers and men in the battery, but \n     also that of Lt. Col. Bartholomew, the battalion commander, \n     who personally chose John as his pilot.\n\n  In addition to his parents, brothers, and sister, John left behind \nhis wife Leona, daughter Lori, and son Michael. John's daughter Lori \nfeels that both her dad and mom were heroes--her dad for his service \nand sacrifice and her mom for dealing with the pain of losing her \nhusband.\n  I want to take a moment and thank all of the pages who have been so \npatient as I have read these stories of these incredible men who gave \ntheir lives for our country.\n  I think one of the reasons why we have periods of commemoration and \nwhy we do this is so that we remind not only those of us who lived \nduring this time but we remind a younger generation of that sacrifice \nand that opportunity to serve our country and to honor those people who \ngave the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Our Vietnam veterans had a lot of challenges when they returned home \nright after Vietnam, and their challenges continue--whether it is \nuntreated post-traumatic stress or just simply being part of a war that \ngenerated so much controversy in our country--but it can never diminish \nthe sacrifice these men and their families made for our country.\n  Again, I thank the pages for their attention, and I hope these are \nvoices and names they will remember for a long time along with me.

TOM PERRY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of Elder L. Tom \nPerry, an exemplary leader whose kindness, compassion, and love were as \nboundless as his optimism. Elder Perry quietly passed away on May 30 \nafter a brief battle with thyroid cancer. Serving as an apostle in the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for more than 40 years, \nElder Perry traveled the world, strengthening congregations, visiting \nthe poor, and ministering to the sick and afflicted. Throughout his \necclesiastical service, his words and actions inspired countless \nLatter-day Saints and many more outside the church. As millions across \nthe world mourn his passing, we find peace in his teachings and take \nsolace in the memory of a man who consecrated his life to the service \nof others.\n  From humble beginnings, Elder Perry developed a strong sense of \ndiscipline that would later define his church service. Born to Leslie \nThomas and Nora Sonne Perry in 1922, his father was a lawyer and his \nmother was a teacher by profession. Together, they taught Tom the \nprinciples of honest work and self-reliance. Elder Perry was no \nstranger to hard labor, and some of his earliest memories included long \ndays working the fields, milking the family cow, and cutting hay by \nhand with an old scythe. From these early experiences, Elder Perry \nlearned that nothing would be handed to him and that he had to work for \neverything he received. And work he did.\n  After finishing his first year of college, Elder Perry accepted a \ncall to serve his church in the Northern States Mission. During the 2 \nyears Elder Perry worked as a volunteer missionary, he developed a \npowerful testimony of Jesus Christ--a testimony that inspired a life of \nlove and selfless service. After serving his church, Elder Perry \ndesired to serve his country. He enlisted in the United States Marine \nCorps only a month after returning from his church mission.\n  Elder Perry's marine battalion was deployed to Nagasaki shortly after \nthe Japanese surrender. Observing the devastation and suffering of the \nJapanese people only softened Elder Perry's already tender heart. In \nhis off-duty hours, he rallied a group of fellow marines to help him \nrebuild a Protestant chapel. On the same tour, he also helped repair a \nCatholic orphanage and build another chapel on the island of Saipan. \nWhile in Japan, Elder Perry grew especially close to a Protestant \ncongregation. When he was transferred to another city, a group of \nnearly 200 members of this congregation gathered to bid him farewell. \nAs his train crawled out of the station, each member of the \ncongregation lined up along the track as Elder Perry reached out to \ntouch their hands one by one. He loved these people, and they loved him \nback, making the goodbye all the more difficult. Last Saturday, \nthousands of us tasted that same bittersweet emotion when Elder Perry \ndeparted this mortal life for the next. Like this small Japanese \ncongregation, we were all moved by his kindness, energized by his \nenthusiasm, and humbled by his service.\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\n  After his honorable release from the Marine Corps, Elder Perry \nreturned to Utah State University, where he earned a degree in finance \nand married his wife, Virginia Lee. Together, they were the parents of \nthree children: Barbara, Linda Gay, and Lee. Family was always the \nhighest priority for Elder Perry. Although his successful business \ncareer demanded much of his attention, he always made special \nsacrifices to spend time with his wife and children.\n  Elder Perry was also committed to balancing his busy work schedule \nwith his church service. As his family moved across the country--from \nIdaho and California, to New York and Boston--Elder Perry served in \nvarious leadership positions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-\nday Saints, including two bishoprics, a high council, and two stake \npresidencies. In April 1974, he accepted a calling to serve in the \nQuorum of the Twelve Apostles. Sadly, after serving as an apostle for \nonly 8 months, Elder Perry's beloved wife, Virginia Lee, died of \ncancer. Nine years later, cancer would also take his daughter, Barbara. \nAlthough Elder Perry's life was marked by tragedy, it was not defined \nby it. His faith in God was unshakeable, as was his optimism. In \nresponse to heartbreak, Elder Perry said, ``[The Lord] is very kind. \nEven though some experiences are hard, he floods your mind with \nmemories and gives you other opportunities. Life doesn't end just \nbecause you have a tragedy--there's a new mountain to climb.''\n  Elder Perry never stopped climbing those mountains, and he served \nvaliantly as an Apostle of Jesus Christ. In 1976, he married Barbara \nDayton--his loving helpmeet and able partner who helped him bear the \nheavy responsibility of his apostolic calling. I will always remember \nElder Perry for the zeal and energy he brought to every facet of his \nlife. Nothing could temper his enthusiasm, and nothing could deter him \nfrom doing what was right.\n  Elder Perry never tired of his calling. He so loved meeting with \nchurch members and leaders throughout the world that he once said, ``My \nassociation with great men has been not only an education, but an \ninspiration.'' I can easily say the same of my own association with \nElder Perry; it has been both an education and an inspiration, and I \nwill always be grateful for his example.\n  I will never forget Elder Perry, his life of dedicated service, and \nhis unwavering optimism.

Mr. President, I wish to welcome a great new diplomatic \ndevelopment in my home State of Colorado. Last week, Denver was proud \nto officially welcome the opening of the Taipei Economic and Cultural \nOffice, TECO, the de-facto consulate of Taiwan in the United States. \nThe TECO office in Denver will serve Colorado, as well as the States of \nMissouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota.\n  I thank Taiwan's leadership for this wise decision, particularly Dr. \nLyushun Shen, the Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural \nRepresentative Office in the United States, TECRO in Washington, DC, as \nwell as Mr. Jack J.C. Yang, the Director General of the new TECO Office \nin Denver.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee \non Asia, the Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Cooperation, I am \ncommitted to ensuring that the U.S.-Taiwan partnership continues to \ngrow and prosper. Our nations must continue to work together to ensure \nregional stability and to advance economic ties, including through \nlandmark initiatives such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP.\n  Our friendship has never been stronger. Taiwan is now the tenth \nlargest trading partner for the U.S., while the U.S. is Taiwan's \nlargest foreign investor. Our people-to-people relations are \nflourishing, with over 20,000 Taiwanese students studying in the U.S. \neach year. Over 75 U.S. cities have established sister city \nrelationships with their Taiwanese counterparts, including Colorado \nSprings, CO, which has been a sister city to Kaohsiung since 1983.\n  I know our nation's bonds with Taiwan will only grow stronger, and I \nam proud that Denver will now be front and center in ensuring the \ncontinued friendship between our nations and peoples. I am confident \nthat our Taiwanese friends will not find more hospitable and welcoming \nhosts for their diplomats and visitors than the people of the great \nState of Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3771-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING SONNY SMITH\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the service \nand sacrifice of Johnson County Auxiliary Sheriff Deputy Sonny Smith \nwho gave his life while in the line of duty on May 15, 2015.\n  Deputy Smith led a life of service. The last 11 years he dedicated to \nsafety and law enforcement as a detention officer. He continued to \nserve for the past 6 years as an auxiliary deputy protecting the people \nof Johnson County on a volunteer basis.\n  Service was an important part of Sonny's life. He served his country \nin the United States Navy and continued that commitment to his \ncommunity when he left the military. Sonny was known for his compassion \nand leadership throughout Johnson County. His generosity was always on \ndisplay. His fellow officers say they will remember Sonny as a humble \nman who was always willing to serve his neighbors. As a father of high \nschool students, Sonny attended all the pep rallies, football games and \nfundraisers. He was always helping Clarksville High School. His \ndaughters Makayla and Callie describe their dad as a man always willing \nto help others in need.\n  While he made a living working as a security guard at Arkansas \nNuclear One, Sonny was a reliable handyman that many in the community \nreached out to for help repairing their garage doors.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Sonny's family, including his wife \nAmy, his daughters, and sons Dakota and Charlie.\n  Deputy Sonny Smith was a true hero, not only because of the uniform \nhe wore, but also because of his final actions. By taking the lead when \nhe responded to a residential burglary call and exercising his \nprofessional training, he saved the lives of his fellow officers.\n  I humbly offer my appreciation and gratitude for his selfless service \nto Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3771-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3771-S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, I spoke on the \nfloor about two of the outstanding Federal workers at the National \nInstitutes of Health and I indicated at the time that I would be \nspeaking periodically about other Federal workers who are doing \nextraordinary things on behalf of the American taxpayer. People wonder \nwhere their tax dollars go; I would like to provide a few examples.\n  As I said at the time, ``Government workers guard our borders; \nprotect us from terrorists; treat our wounded veterans; dispense Social \nSecurity checks to our retirees; find cures for diseases; guide the \nNation's air traffic; explore the tiniest particles and the vast \nexpanse of outer space; ensure our air is safe to breathe, our water is \nsafe to drink, and our food is safe to eat; support our servicemen and \nwomen in harm's way; and promote our interests and ideals abroad. Who \ndoes the government work for? Government Works for America.''\n  The Partnership for Public Service announced the finalists for the \n2015 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals, also known as the \n``Sammies,'' last month during Public Service Recognition Week. As the \nPartnership notes, ``Federal employees are responsible for many \nnoteworthy and inspiring accomplishments that are seldom recognized or \ncelebrated. The Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nhighlight excellence in our Federal workforce and inspire other \ntalented and dedicated individuals to go into public service.''\n  Also last month, on May 5, the Washington Post, citing an Office of \nPersonnel Management--OPM--exit survey of senior government managers \nwho have retired or moved to other, nonfederal jobs, reported that the \nsingle biggest factor for leaving is the ``political environment'', \nwhich was blamed as a contributing factor ``to a great extent'' or ``to \na very great extent'' by 42 percent of the individuals surveyed. The \narticle, by Post columnist Joe Davidson, quoted Brian M. Kent, a \nretired senior-level Federal scientist, who said, ``Expect to be \noverworked, undercompensated and mistreated by both parties on the \nHill, who do not appreciate the value of our expertise, our dedication \nand our talents.''\n  Congress and the American people need to realize that the Federal \nworkforce is a crucial asset. There are some people who dislike \ngovernment so much that they want to demonize and demoralize the \nworkforce and deter young people from considering a career in public \nservice. That is counterproductive. Find and remove the bad apples--\nyes, but acknowledge that they are few and far between. Overwhelmingly, \nFederal workers are hard-working and patriotic Americans. Rather than \ndenigrate them, we should treat them with respect in acknowledging \ntheir service to our Nation.\n  One way to acknowledge that service is through the Sammies. I am \nproud that so many of the finalists this year work and/or live in \nMaryland, spread across several agencies and several of the award \ncategories. I would like to mention a few today.\n\n\n              Dr. Gretchen K. Campbell and Dr. Ronald Ross\n\n  The mission of the National Institute of Standards & Technology, \nNIST, which is headquartered in Gaithersburg, MD, is to ``promote U.S. \ninnovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement \nscience, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic \nsecurity and improve our quality of life''. NIST's weights and measures \nservices, a job assigned to the Federal Government in the Constitution, \nprovide the basis for the fairness and efficiency of sales. These \nservices underpin the efficiency of about one-half of the U.S. economy, \nor about $7 trillion of the U.S. gross domestic product--GDP. Eighty \npercent of global merchandise trade is influenced by testing and other \nmeasurement-related requirements of regulations and standards. U.S. \ncompanies increasingly depend on NIST to help ensure access to global \nmarkets that create new business and jobs.\n  Gretchen K. Campbell is a physicist at NIST and is a finalist in the \n2015 ``Call To Service'' Medal. This medal recognizes a Federal \nemployee whose professional achievements reflect the important \ncontributions that a new generation brings to public service. We are \nall familiar with electronics. Now, scientists like Dr. Campbell are \nexploring a new frontier--a circuitry system that uses the flow of \natoms rather than electrons that may lead to a wide range of future \ntechnological advances. Dr. Campbell, who is just 35, is a pioneer and \nintellectual leader in this new and theoretical field of physics known \nas atomtronics, and has conducted a series of seminal experiments that \nshow its promise and possibilities.\n  Using light to control matter, Dr. Campbell created the first \ncontrollable atomtronic circuit in 2011 by moving ultra-cold atoms \nthrough a wire made of light--just as electrons flow through a metal \nwire. She added a permeable barrier to this circuit, also made of \nlight, to serve as the control element, much as a transistor can \ncontrol the current in an electronic circuit.\n  Just as electronic devices manipulate the flow of electrons, \natomtronic devices manipulate the flow of atoms, which are made up of \nelectrons, protons, and neutrons. Since atoms have properties that are \nvery different from electrons--they do not have charged particles, for \ninstance--atomtronic devices have the potential to go beyond the \ncapabilities of electronics.\n  Atomtronics will not supplant electronics, but may offer new kinds of \nfunctions and applications. An atomtronic circuit, for example, could \nbe useful in applications such as rotation sensors, improving the \nfunctioning of gyroscopes used to stabilize spacecraft and airplanes. \nAtomtronic circuitry may be able to perform quantum computations that \ncould offer a significant leap forward in computing speed, performance, \nand capability and lead to the next generation of technology that will \nenable smaller and cheaper devices.\n  Dr. Ronald Ross, a Fellow at NIST, is a finalist for the 2015 \nHomeland Security & Law Enforcement Medal. This medal recognizes a \nFederal employee for a significant contribution to the Nation in \nactivities related to homeland security and law enforcement. Mr. Ross, \ncalled the ``rock star of cybersecurity'' by his colleagues, developed \nand implemented a state-of-the-art system to assess risks and protect \nFederal computer networks from cyberattacks, helping secure information \ncritical to the Nation's national and economic security. Most recently, \nDr. Ross helped to establish the government-wide program for cloud \nsecurity assessment and authorization.\n  The Federal Government used to rely on a rigid checklist approach to \nsecuring computer networks, often ignoring changing threats and \nevolving technology, and not always distinguishing what information \nneeded higher security and what data was of lesser importance. Dr. \nRoss, belying the image of a hidebound bureaucrat, designed the Risk \nManagement Framework as a way for government agencies to decide how \ncritical their various data sets are and to pick the right level of \nprotection. With the framework Dr. Ross developed, agencies can go \nthrough an assessment process and decide where to concentrate resources \nand tighten security.\n  The impact of Dr. Ross's work includes reducing the cost of \nimplementing cybersecurity controls and demonstrating compliance with \nmultiple security requirements, and enhancing system interoperability \namong Federal agencies. Dr. Ross and his team have worked with the \nGeneral Services Administration, the Department of Defense, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to test and validate the risk framework \nunveiled earlier this year that will be used by cloud computing service \nproviders, allowing them to host some of the Federal Government's most \nsensitive information. And as the principal architect of a new national \ntesting program and infrastructure, Dr. Ross also has been \ncollaborating with the National Security Agency to develop the first-\never network of commercial testing laboratories capable of evaluating \nthe security of information technology--IT--products.\n\n\n     Robert Bunge, Michael Gerber, Mark Paese, and Gregory Zwicker\n\n  The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration--NOAA--is \nheadquartered in Silver Spring, MD. NOAA's mission is ``Science, \nService, and Stewardship''. The agency attempts ``to understand and \npredict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts; to disseminate \nthat knowledge and information; and to conserve and manage coastal and \nmarine ecosystems and resources''. NOAA's research, services, and \nproducts--ranging from daily weather forecasts, severe storm warnings \nand climate monitoring to fisheries management, coastal restoration and \nsupporting marine commerce--affect more than one-third of America's \nGDP.\n  Robert Bunge, Michael Gerber, Mark Paese, and Gregory Zwicker of the \nNational Weather Service's Wireless Emergency Alerts Team at NOAA are \nalso finalists for the 2015 Homeland Security & Law Enforcement Medal. \nThey have developed a fast and geographically targeted cell phone alert \nsystem, launched in 2012, for weather emergencies such as tornadoes, \nflash floods, and hurricanes that reaches millions of people, saving \nlives and preventing injuries. So far, the system has transmitted more \nthan 13,000 warnings for the most dangerous types of severe weather to \nthe cell phones of millions of people potentially in harm's way across \nthe United States.\n  While other weather alert systems have been in use for years, this \nnew method of using mobile devices and targeting very precise \ngeographic areas is a significant improvement. It took many years of \ncoordination with the Federal Communications Commission,\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\nDHS, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the major wireless \ntelecommunications providers.\n  Previously, weather emergency alerts from one of the 122 weather \nservice offices around the country were emailed to the Washington, D.C. \noffice and then forwarded to FEMA, which sent the alert to affected \ncounties using television and radio broadcast technology. Cellular \ncompanies could independently text the warning information to their \ncell phone customers in the affected county, but the system was slow \nand too broadly targeted. The new weather alert system structures the \ninformation into concise messages--90 or fewer characters--and uses \ngeo-targeted data to broadcast the messages rapidly over cell phones \nonly in the affected areas.\n  The team worked with six of the largest cell phone companies to build \nthe sophisticated technology needed to make the system work. They \ndeveloped the infrastructure and protocol for the alerts, facilitated \nthe decision-making for the weather alerts to be transmitted, and \nconducted extensive public awareness and educational programs. Mr. \nBunge led the technical team, overseeing the software development, the \ndata specialists, the coding, the host servers and other information \ntechnology needs, and helped create a system that targets the cell \nphone alerts to specific geographic locations. Mr. Gerber is a \nmeteorologist and a specialist in how the weather service information \nis disseminated, and he played a critical role in making sure the right \nkind of weather alerts would be available and properly transmitted. He \nalso is credited with convincing the wireless carriers to participate \nand make the needed investments. Mr. Paese handled many of the \ncomplicated management issues while Mr. Zwicker was involved in \ntraining some 2,000 weather forecasters in more than 122 offices around \nthe country to use the system in coordination with Federal emergency \nmanagement officials.\n  Here's an example of how effective the new system is: on July 1, \n2013, a tornado obliterated a dome in East Windsor, CT, where 29 \nchildren had been playing soccer. Seconds before the tornado struck, a \ncell phone alert prompted the camp manager to rush the children out of \nthe dome and into an adjacent building, preventing injuries and quite \npossibly fatalities.\n\n\n                           Dr. Hyun Lillehoj\n\n  The Agricultural Research Service--ARS--is the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's USDA chief scientific in-house research agency, with \nheadquarters colocated here in Washington, DC and in Beltsville, MD. \nThe agency's job is ``to find solutions to agricultural problems that \naffect Americans every day from field to table''. ARS conducts research \nto develop and transfer solutions to agricultural problems of high \nnational priority and provide information access and dissemination to: \nensure high-quality, safe food, and other agricultural products; assess \nthe nutritional needs of Americans; sustain a competitive agricultural \neconomy; enhance the natural resource base and the environment; and \nprovide economic opportunities for rural citizens, communities, and \nsociety as a whole.\n  Dr. Hyun Lillehoj, a senior research molecular biologist at ARS in \nBeltsville, is a finalist for the 2015 Career Achievement Medal. This \nmedal recognizes a Federal employee for significant accomplishments \nthroughout a lifetime of achievement in public service. Dr. Lillehoj \nhas pioneered industry-leading research to improve the health of \ncommercial poultry without the use of antibiotics, protecting consumers \nand making the U.S. poultry industry more competitive by saving it \nbillions of dollars.\n  There is growing concern over the widespread use of antibiotics in \npoultry and other food industries, which health experts say contributes \nto the development of drug-resistant bacteria. These so-called \n``superbugs'' infect hundreds of thousands and kill tens of thousands \nof Americans each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention.\n  During three decades as a molecular biologist at ARS, Dr. Lillehoj \nhas helped mitigate the use of antibiotics in poultry, finding that \ncertain food supplements, probiotics, and nutrients can replace \nantibiotics as an effective means of enhancing the immune system and \nfighting common parasitic diseases and bacterial infections. The USDA \nestimates that the poultry diseases Dr. Lillehoj is working to combat \ncause more than $600 million in losses in the United States and $3.2 \nbillion worldwide.\n  Dr. Lillehoj has developed novel diagnostic and therapeutic products \nand discovered DNA markers for the genetic selection of disease-\nresistant chickens, paving the way for breeding healthier chickens that \nwill benefit both consumers and the Nation's $45 billion poultry \nindustry. She has done this by creating one of the first gene libraries \nfrom commercial chickens and depositing more than 55,000 individual \ngene sequences from this database into the public domain, providing \nother researchers with information that could lead to breeding poultry \nwith superior resistance to parasites. She also has identified natural \nantimicrobial molecules that have anti-cancer properties and kill \ninfectious parasites; discovered a second-generation parasite vaccine \nwith an improved protection profile over current vaccines; developed \ntherapeutic antibodies that boost immunity for poultry; formulated \nhealth-promoting probiotics for veterinary use; and discovered organic, \nplant-derived herbal extracts and essential oils that fight infectious \ndiseases affecting animals and humans. She is recognized as a world \nleader in understanding host-pathogen interactions of an avian parasite \nclosely related to human malaria that is a major cause of disease \naffecting poultry and livestock. She also has done original research on \na bacterium that is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness \nin the U.S. Her scientific breakthroughs are documented in 10 U.S. and \ninternational patents, more than 350 peer-reviewed scientific papers, \n14 book chapters, and 230 worldwide collaborations with academia, \nforeign governments and private industry. She has mentored more than \n120 young scientists.\n  Dr. Lillehoj embodies the American Dream. She is from South Korea. \nShe came to the United States in 1969 after her father died, when she \nwas just out of high school, and with just $200 in her pocket. At \nfirst, she wanted to be a cancer researcher, but her focus soon turned \nto immunology and she received a government scholarship. After she \nreceived her Ph.D., she went to work at the National Institutes of \nHealth. USDA successfully recruited her in 1984, and she has been at \nARS ever since. The government's investment in her has paid enormous \ndividends.\n  These are just a few of the Nation's talented, creative, dedicated, \nand hard-working Federal employees. I ask my colleagues and all \nAmericans to join me in congratulating them on their successes and \nthanking them for their public service. We are a strong and prosperous \nNation, in part, because of our Federal workforce. We cannot take it \nfor granted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3773-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BILL GALLAGHER\n\n Mr. DAINES.

It gives me great pleasure to recognize his years \nof dedication to protecting the United States of America and Nevada.\n  Lt. Col. Knuf enlisted on July 11, 1983, and was commissioned from \nthe Academy of Military Science in Knoxville, TN. He most recently \nearned a degree from the School of Aerospace Medicine as a \nbioenvironmental engineer. He has been a great asset to the Nevada Air \nNational Guard throughout his years, serving as deputy base civil \nengineer, base civil engineer, civil engineering squadron commander, \nand most recently as the officer in charge of the Bioenvironmental \nEngineering Flight and as the base environmental manager in the 152nd \nMedical Group of the Nevada Air National Guard. Throughout his service, \nLieutenant Colonel Knuf deployed to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan in \nsupport of Operation Enduring Freedom and to Saudi Arabia in support of \nOperation Southern Watch. His selfless contribution to this country is \ninvaluable.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Knuf's service to the United States of America \nearns him a place among the heroes who have so valiantly defended our \nNation. I offer my greatest appreciation to Lieutenant Colonel Knuf for \nhis courageous contributions to defending our freedom. Words could \nnever fully express my deep appreciation for his sacrifice or for the \nsacrifices of all veterans and active military members across the \ncountry.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I recognize \nthat Congress has a responsibility not only to honor these brave \nindividuals who serve our Nation, but also to ensure they are cared for \nwhen they return home. I remain committed to upholding this promise for \nour veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the Nation. \nLieutenant Colonel Knuf's sacrifice warrants only the greatest respect \nand care in return.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Knuf has demonstrated professionalism, commitment \nto excellence, and dedication to the highest standards of the Nevada \nAir National Guard.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize June and \nRobert Sebo for their generous contribution to Honor Flight Nevada, \nhonoring their best friend, Ray Parks. Mr. Parks was a World War II \nveteran who served in the U.S. Coast Guard for well over 30 years. Mr. \nand Mrs. Sebos' contribution to this amazing organization is not only a \ngrand gesture in memory of Mr. Park's service to our country, but also \na great gift to Nevada's heroes. The $37,000 will send more than 30 \nveterans to visit our Nation's capital, giving them an opportunity to \nvisit their memorials.\n  I would also like to recognize both Mayor Gino Martini and the City \nof Sparks for accommodating the Third Annual Honor Flight Pancake \nBreakfast, a great event that helps make Honor Flight Nevada possible. \nThe annual pancake breakfast provides Nevadans with an opportunity to \nsupport their local veterans and help Honor Flight Nevada succeed. The \ngenerous donation of Mayor Martini and his wife, Ruth Martini, as well \nas their commitment to helping Honor Flight Nevada, are shining \nexamples of the strength of our Nevada community. The breakfast could \nalso not take place without the hard work of Teri Bath, who coordinates \nthe entire event. I have had the privilege of attending this pancake \nbreakfast, and I can say first hand her work with this organization is \ninvaluable.\n  Honor Flight Nevada is a nonprofit organization committed to honoring \nthe brave men and women who so valiantly defended our freedom. The \norganization sets up trips from Nevada to Washington, DC, providing our \nNation's veterans with an incredible opportunity to visit the memorials \nhonoring their service. From the National World War II Memorial, to the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, all the \nway to Arlington Cemetery, every veteran has the chance to see the \nmemorials that stand as a testimony to the great sacrifice they have \nmade.\n  The organization is led by Jon Yuspa, an individual who has truly \nimpacted the lives of heroes across the State. Honor Flight Nevada \noffered its first trip to 30 World War II veterans in 2012 and now does \nas many as four trips per year. I have personally been at the Reno-\nTahoe International Airport to send off the veterans as they prepare to \ndepart from Nevada and have also met them in our Nation's capital as \nthey observed the World War II Memorial. I can attest to the positive \nimpact that accompanies their journey. This truly is a life-changing \nexperience for those who deserve only the greatest gratitude for their \nservice.\n  Honor Flight Nevada's mission is noble, and I thank everyone who \ncontributed for their commitment and compassion to Nevada's veterans. \nToday, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nthe many Nevadans who make these trips possible, especially Mr. and \nMrs. Sebo for their donation.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize Rev. Dr. Tellis \nJerome Chapman of Galilee Missionary Baptist Church in Detroit, MI as \nthe congregation and the broader community celebrate his 30th pastoral \nanniversary.\n  Born and raised in the State of Mississippi, Reverend Chapman is a \ngraduate of Jackson State University and has received honorary doctoral \ndegrees from Natchez College and Dallas Baptist College. Reverend \nChapman has served as pastor in churches across the South. On March 31, \n1985, Reverend Chapman was called to the pastorate of Galilee \nMissionary Baptist Church where he has been devoted to serving for the \npast 30 years. Through his charismatic and dynamic leadership he has \nleft a permanent mark on the congregation and Greater Detroit \ncommunity.\n  The congregation has steadily grown under Pastor Chapman's \nleadership. His original vision of a church with classrooms, a daycare, \nand a senior citizen building came to fruition in 1997.

Mr. President. Louisiana has a rich culture and \nhistory known for fostering artistic and musical creativity. After the \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina, two Louisiana entrepreneurs opened a \nsmall business to provide their friends and neighbors with a safe and \nfun distraction during the recovery and rebuilding process. This week's \n``Throwback Thursday'' honorary Small Business of the Week is Painting \nwith a Twist of Mandeville, LA.\n  In 2007, longtime friends Cathy Deano and Renee Maloney became \nbusiness partners after seeing a need in the greater New Orleans area \nfor a distraction and relief after Hurricane Katrina. The pair opened a \nsmall painting studio, Painting with a Twist, formerly known as Corks N \nCanvas, where folks could learn to paint and enjoy a glass of wine at \nthe same time. Today, Painting with a Twist has expanded to over 210 \nfranchise locations across the country, with Deano and Maloney \nretaining ownership of four locations while also maintaining the \nfranchise headquarters in Mandeville. Painting with a Twist owns \ncopyrights to over 3,500 pieces of art and is also the country's \nlargest employer of aspiring artists.\n  When they first started their small business, Deano and Maloney set \naside one day's salary each week per month to donate to local \ncharities, in order to support the recovery and restoration efforts in \nsoutheast Louisiana. Today, that tradition continues with their \ncampaign ``Painting with a Purpose.'' Held monthly at all Painting with \na Twist locations, this event raises funds for charities and nonprofits \nin each franchise's area.\n  Congratulations again to Painting with a Twist for being selected as \nthis week's ``Throwback Thursday'' honorary Small Business of the Week. \nThank you for your commitment to advancing the arts in Louisiana and \nfor your continued dedication to giving back to your community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3775-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CELEBRATING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF ``THE GOONIES''\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this Sunday marks the 30th \nanniversary of the release of the beloved film, ``The Goonies.'' With \nenduring and relatable themes of adventure, adolescence, and \nfriendship, ``The Goonies'' has withstood the test of time and firmly \nestablished its place in American culture as a cult classic. A large \npart of what makes this film unique and impactful is its iconic setting \nalong the stunning Oregon coastline. Indeed, so significant is the \nfilm's location that thousands of fans from around the world are \ngathering this week for a four-day festival in Astoria, Oregon--or, \n``The Goon Docks''--to celebrate the magic that is ``The Goonies.'' In \nfact, Astoria has held a Goonies-based festival every year since the \nfilm's release in 1985.\n  ``The Goonies'' 30th anniversary celebration will include a variety \nof events around Astoria, as well as Cannon Beach, OR--another Oregon \ncoastal town that served as an idyllic backdrop for the film. Most \nnotably, Cannon Beach's impressive Haystack Rock is featured \nprominently in the film's opening scene. Fans will be able to relive \ntheir favorite Goonies memories by participating in festivities such as \ntours of the filming locations, treasure hunts, and a group ``truffle \nshuffle.'' Astoria's Oregon Film Museum also invites festival attendees \nto visit its Goonies gallery, take a mug shot with friends, and even \nmake their own feature film. Needless to say, it is sure to be a \nweekend of fun, nostalgia, and, in typical Goonie fashion, adventure.\n  Just as the original Goonies fans and stars have grown and matured \nsince the film's release in 1985, so has Oregon's film industry. With \nits magnificent and diverse natural beauty, Oregon has become a much \nsought after location for film production. As the backdrop for major \ntelevision shows and box-office hits alike, film production in Oregon \nbrings with it good-paying jobs and tourism that in turn support local \nbusinesses and economic development across the State. Certainly all \nfilm producers in Oregon and across the country should aspire to \nachieve the remarkable success of ``The Goonies''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3775-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3775-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3775-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following measure, having been reported from the Committee on \nIndian Affairs, was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs, pursuant to the order of May 27, 1988, for a period not \nto exceed 60 days:\n\n       S. 710.

A bill to reauthorize the Second Chance Act of 2007; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Portman to \nreintroduce the bipartisan Second Chance Reauthorization Act. This \nlegislation builds on the success of the original law and takes \nimportant new steps to ensure that people coming out of prison are \ngiven a fair chance to turn their lives around. When inmates are \nreleased from prison, they face many\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\nchallenges, including finding housing and employment, combating \nsubstance abuse, and accessing physical and mental healthcare. This \nlegislation aims to improve their ability to reenter society, become \nproductive members of their families and communities, and reduce the \nlikelihood that they will reoffend. Investing in reentry services has \nbeen proven to reduce recidivism and bring down prison costs. It is \nalso the right thing to do.\n  This legislation is urgently needed. While the United States is home \nto less than 5 percent of the world's population, we have nearly 25 \npercent of the world's prison population. With more than two million \npeople behind bars, and 650,000 ex-offenders being released each year, \nwe need to reauthorize these critical programs that reduce crime and \nincrease public safety.\n  Budgets at the State and Federal level are strained by our system of \nmass incarceration, and we all suffer as a result. The truth is that \nwhen so much money goes to locking people away, we have fewer resources \nfor programs that actually prevent crime in the first place. Investing \nin reentry programs that break the cycle of crime helps reduce prison \ncosts and keeps us all safer. That is why law enforcement groups like \nthe National Association of Police Organizations support this bill. \nThey understand better than most that we cannot afford to stay on our \ncurrent path.\n  My home State of Vermont was recently awarded a grant to implement a \nStatewide Recidivism Reduction Program through the Second Chance Act. \nThe Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Corrections, Andrew \nPallito, says that he sees the positive impact of Second Chance \nprogramming every day. In Commissioner Pallito's words, ``The Second \nChance Act is not just about giving incarcerated individuals another \nopportunity to succeed, it is about significantly improving the \noutcomes we all want for children, families and communities.''\n  We have seen that these programs are succeeding in States across the \ncountry. North Carolina, with the help of six Second Chance grants, has \nreduced its recidivism rate by 18.1 percent since 2007. It has focused \non individualized case planning, use of evidence-based practices, and \ncoordination of services through local reentry councils.\n  Georgia has reduced its recidivism rate by 13.5 percent since 2007 by \ndirecting greater resources to rehabilitation, community supervision, \nand programs addressing reentry needs. Thirteen Second Chance grants \nhave helped support these successful efforts and the statewide \nincarceration rate has decreased by 4.8 percent.\n  These programs are working, and it would be irresponsible not to \ncontinue supporting these critical efforts that are improving public \nsafety and bringing down prison costs.\n  I am introducing this bill so that it can be a part of our \nconversation in the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate about the \nurgent need for criminal justice reform. Recidivism rates at the State \nand local levels are unacceptably high. Nearly \\2/3\\ of former inmates \nare rearrested within 3 years of release and about half ofthem end up \nback behind bars. Any serious effort to address reform must include \nefforts to support reentry. Nearly all prisoners will return to our \ncommunities at some point and it is wise policy to help make that \ntransition successful. We all benefit--our families, our neighborhoods, \nour economy--when people become productive, stable members of society. \nThat is the goal of the Second Chance Act. That is why it is supported \nby American Probation and Parole Association, the National Association \nof Counties, the American Bar Association, and the United Methodist \nChurch, among many others.\n  Let me be specific. This bill will help former inmates overcome some \nof the obstacles they face in finding a job, a place to live, and \naccessing healthcare services. Meeting these basic needs has become \nincreasingly difficult because people coming out of jail are too often \ntreated as second class citizens for the rest of their lives. As a \nformer prosecutor, I believe in tough sentences for those who break out \nlaws. However, once someone has paid their debt to society, he should \nnot be burdened by past mistakes forever.\n  Chairman Grassley convened a Judiciary Committee hearing last month \nthat highlighted just this issue. The hearing focused on the importance \nof the right to counsel for poor defendants charged with misdemeanors. \nDuring that hearing, we heard testimony about Melinda, a single mother \nin Ohio who suffered a seizure while cleaning her house. When the \npolice and paramedics arrived, they found unsecured cleaning supplies \nand Melinda ended up with a conviction for child endangerment. Years \nlater, she was fired from her job when her employer learned of her \ncriminal record. This left her unable to pay her rent, buy food for her \nfamily, or lead a productive life. This is just not right, and it \ncertainly does not make any of us safer.\n  Any criminal conviction, no matter how minor, can hinder a person's \nchances of success for their entire lives. The Second Chance Act equips \npeople to deal with this difficult environment, and that assistance \nstarts before inmates are even released. Grants under this program have \nenabled states to hire case managers who meet with inmates while they \nare in jail to plan for their release, and continue to be a resource \nonce they have returned home. Case managers help former offenders \nidentify where to continue substance abuse treatment, apply for jobs, \nand enroll in parenting classes. They also help them build conflict \nresolution skills and avoid certain people or places that threaten \ntheir recovery.\n  A key component to remaining crime-free is getting and keeping a job, \nand this reauthorization implements a new ``Transitional Jobs \nStrategy'' to help identify and address the root causes of chronic \nunemployment for ex-offenders. This new strategy will support those \nindividuals committed to working hard and getting their lives back on \ntrack by offering programs like vocational education, life skills \ntraining, or child care services. I am proud of this addition to the \nbill and believe it will improve lives and stimulate our economy.\n  We have learned from recent reports by the General Accounting Office \nand the Inspector General that our Nation's aging prison population is \ncosting the Federal Bureau of Prisons millions every year due to their \nincreasing medical needs. Many of these older prisoners no longer \nrepresent a threat to public safety, so this bill increases the \ndiscretion of prison officials to determine when inmates over 60 should \nbe released to home detention. It simply doesn't make sense to spend \nmoney incarcerating and caring for elderly inmates who are not \ndangerous.\n  Although the Second Chance reauthorization has passed with strong \nbipartisan support through the Judiciary Committee each of the last two \nCongresses, the act expired in 2010. We need to pass this legislation \nthis Congress as part of comprehensive criminal justice reform.\n  I am hopeful that with partners like Senator Portman and \nRepresentatives Sensenbrenner and Davis we will finally reauthorize it \nthis Congress. We have been working hard to reach an agreement that is \nfair, fiscally responsible, and meets the needs of key stakeholders. We \nhave the support of faith groups, law enforcement, and groups who \nprovide services to the mentally ill and those struggling with \naddiction. This broad coalition has one thing in common--we all want to \nsee our justice system work better.\n  I thank Senator Portman, Representative Sensenbrenner, and \nRepresentative Davis for their hard work and cooperation. We have come \ntogether in a truly exceptional way in this bipartisan, bicameral \neffort. I look forward to joining with Democrats and Republicans to get \nthis bill passed and signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1516.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, in \nintroducing the Power Efficiency and Resilience, POWER, Act.\n  The POWER Act would expand tax incentives for industrial energy \nefficiency systems, including combined heat and power, CHP, and waste \nheat to power, WHP, technologies, making\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\nthe incentives more accessible an providing parity with other forms of \nrenewable energy. The upfront costs of CHP and WHP can be expensive, \nand facilities seeking to lower their energy bills often lack access to \nthe capital needed for purchasing the equipment. The POWER Act aims to \nspur investment in these efficient technologies that capture wasted \nheat from electricity generation and industrial processes and use it to \nheat or cool buildings or to generate additional electricity. Capturing \nthis otherwise wasted resource has the potential to increase electrical \ngeneration efficiency by nearly 80 percent and reduce electricity costs \nfor industrial users.\n  While technologies such as solar energy and fuel cells currently \nbenefit from a 30 percent investment tax credit, ITC, the incentives \nfor CHP are more limited. CHP systems are only eligible for a 10 \npercent ITC for the first 15 megawatts, MW, of projects that are \nsmaller than 50 MW in capacity. Moreover, while WHP has the potential \nto produce 15 gigawatts of emissions-free electricity nationwide, it \ncurrently does not qualify for the ITC. The limits on the size and \nscope of the ITC have hampered companies from making important \ninvestments to increase their efficiency. The POWER Act would increase \nthe ITC for CHP to 30 percent, allow WHP to qualify for the credit, \nremove the limit on project size to ensure large industrial systems are \neligible, and extend the credit through December 2018 to allow time for \nequipment purchase, installation, and permitting.\n  By making our industrial sector more efficient, we would be reducing \ncosts for manufacturers and helping them to better compete in the \nglobal marketplace. CHP can also help us be a more resilient nation. \nCritical institutions that have combined heat and power can keep the \npower on even when the lights go out. That is why some hospitals, \nwastewater treatment plants, and military bases are installing CHP--\nthey have to keep operating even in extreme weather or during \nblackouts. The POWER Act can save energy, reduce costs, build \nresilience, and reduce emissions.\n  Woodard & Curran, headquartered in Portland, Maine, noted in its \nsupport for the bill that the POWER Act: ``. . . will allow more \ncompanies to reduce energy use and costs by installing combined heat \nand power, CHP, systems. As a developer of such projects, we know that \nthis technology poses a significant opportunity to generate new \nbusinesses, create jobs, and reduce our Nation's energy consumption. \nCHP is still largely an untapped resource, and we could double its \ninstalled capacity over the next decade with the right policies in \nplace.'' Another company in Scarborough, ME, Self-Gen, Inc., stated: \n``Every year, the United States sends enough wasted heat from \nelectricity generation up our chimneys to power Japan. Combined heat \nand power can harness this heat as a resource to create more \nelectricity, nearly doubling efficiency. Senator Collins' POWER Act \nwill help us use this technology throughout Maine and across the \nnation, moving the United States towards increased energy \nindependence.''\n  The POWER Act would allow more U.S. companies to install CHP and WHP \nsystems, which would help improve the energy efficiency and lower costs \nfor some of the largest energy users. The legislation has the support \nof a broad coalition of businesses from across the country, several \nenvironmental organizations, and a number of trade associations. I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3780-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 192--REQUIRING THAT LEGISLATION CONSIDERED BY THE \n                  SENATE BE CONFINED TO A SINGLE ISSUE\n\n  Mr. ENZI submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 193\n\n       Whereas, prior to the landmark decision of the Supreme \n     Court of the United States in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 \n     U.S. 479 (1965), married women in many States were lawfully \n     forbidden from using family planning tools such as \n     contraceptives and condoms;\n       Whereas the historic Griswold case provided precedent for \n     future cases in the Supreme Court that extended the right to \n     use contraceptives to all women, regardless of marital \n     status;\n       Whereas, since Griswold, millions of women have used \n     contraceptives to plan pregnancies, resulting in healthier \n     women, healthier pregnancies, healthier families, and greater \n     financial security for families;\n       Whereas, despite having the legal right to use \n     contraceptives, many women who need family planning and \n     sexual health services still face financial and other \n     barriers to getting the necessary care;\n       Whereas, because of limited access to affordable family \n     planning services, low-income women are 5 times more likely \n     to have an unintended pregnancy compared to women with higher \n     incomes, and unintended pregnancy rates are increasing for \n     poor and low-income women while decreasing for women with \n     higher incomes;\n       Whereas black and Latino women are disproportionately \n     affected by the lack of access to contraceptives and \n     reproductive health care;\n       Whereas programs such as the population research and \n     voluntary family planning programs under title X of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.) and the \n     Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) help low-income women access high-\n     quality, affordable family planning care, including \n     contraceptives, that helps women plan pregnancies and stay \n     healthy;\n       Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     (Public Law 111-148) is helping realize the promise of \n     Griswold by removing barriers to care by requiring that all \n     insurance providers offer contraceptives and reproductive \n     preventive health care services at no cost to women, and, as \n     of 2014, more than 55,000,0000 women were benefitting from \n     coverage without cost-sharing for preventive services, \n     including birth control, according to the Department of \n     Health and Human Services;\n       Whereas, each year, publicly funded contraceptives and \n     family planning services help prevent approximately 2,000,000 \n     unplanned pregnancies, 800,000 abortions, 400,000 \n     miscarriages, and 200,000 pre-term and low birth rate births;\n       Whereas, in 2015, the Institute of Medicine listed using \n     birth control to reduce unintended pregnancies as 1 of 15 \n     core measures for furthering health progress and improving \n     health;\n       Whereas, as the number of contraceptive methods expands, it \n     is more important than ever that all women have access to the \n     full range of contraceptive methods, including the most \n     effective methods, so that each woman can choose the method \n     that works best for her; and\n       Whereas every dollar invested in publicly funded \n     contraceptive saves taxpayers $7.09: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 1965 Griswold v. \n     Connecticut decision of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States;\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\n       (2) recognizes that birth control constitutes basic health \n     care for women;\n       (3) recognizes that, despite the monumental Griswold \n     decision, affordable contraceptives unfortunately remain \n     inaccessible to many poor and low-income women;\n       (4) encourages robust investment in publicly funded family \n     planning services as a means to help women plan pregnancies \n     and have healthier babies;\n       (5) recognizes that investments in publicly funded family \n     planning services help prevent unplanned pregnancies and \n     abortions and help save taxpayer dollars;\n       (6) acknowledges that all women, regardless of income or \n     zip code, should have affordable access to the tools that \n     help women plan and space their pregnancies; and\n       (7) recognizes the value of the publicly funded family \n     planning safety net in helping to realize the promise of the \n     Griswold decision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3781-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3781-S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1614.

COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE UNITED STATES \n                   OVERHEAD SATELLITE ARCHITECTURE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The current approach to the overhead satellite \n     architecture of the United States is increasingly \n     unsustainable in the long run\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n     due to high and growing costs, long design time, over \n     reliance on large, expensive vehicles that need heavy launch \n     and represent potential single points of failure, an \n     inability to take full advantage of rapid technological \n     innovation in the commercial sector, a lack of commercial-\n     like acquisition practices, a lack of competition, inadequate \n     communications paths and ground processing systems, and the \n     vulnerability to anti-satellite attack without an adequate \n     capability to replace and replenish lost or damaged space \n     vehicles.\n       (2) The overhead satellite capabilities of the United \n     States are in grave peril due to an over reliance on a big \n     government, centralized planning, and an acquisition model \n     based on a series of 10-year plans.\n       (3) In past years, the National Reconnaissance Office was \n     the United States model for excellence in acquisition and \n     program management. This was in no small part due to \n     competition within the National Reconnaissance Office between \n     Program A (the Air Force satellite reconnaissance element), \n     Program B (the Central Intelligence Agency satellite \n     reconnaissance element), and Program C (the Navy \n     reconnaissance element), for the best, most innovative, and \n     most cost-effective satellite and aircraft reconnaissance \n     systems, which were delivered on time and under budget. \n     Programs A, B, and C existed from 1962 to 1992.\n       (4) On September 23, 1971, National Security Adviser Henry \n     Kissinger issued a short memo regarding the President's \n     decision to pursue the first electro-optical imaging (EOI) \n     satellite, to be undertaken ``under a realistic funding \n     program, with a view toward achieving an operational \n     capability in 1976.'' It took almost exactly 5 years to \n     design and launch the first KH-11 satellite into orbit on \n     December 19, 1976. The United States needs to get back to \n     this kind of timeline in designing and launching United \n     States overhead reconnaissance satellites.\n       (5) The United States cannot afford to wait a decade or \n     more from design to launch of a satellite if the United \n     States is to maintain its technological edge.\n       (6) The culture of innovation and competition must be \n     fostered and reinforced in the requirements, planning, \n     design, and research and development processes for the United \n     States entire overhead satellite architecture, to take into \n     account and prioritize--\n       (A) the intelligence requirements of United States \n     warfighters and national policymakers;\n       (B) the need for resiliency and rapid reconstitution of the \n     architecture in an increasingly contested space environment; \n     and\n       (C) the ability to leverage rapid developments and \n     innovation in commercial sector satellite, processing and \n     sensor technology.\n       (7) Space is no longer an uncontested environment, as it \n     had been in the past. The United States must be open to \n     innovative solutions such as distributed, disaggregated \n     architectures that could allow for better resiliency against \n     the space threat, and also allow for ready reconstitution, \n     constant replenishment, and frequent technological refresh.\n       (8) The current cost-constrained budget environment \n     dictates that the United States can no longer ignore the \n     costs of systems and potentially less expensive alternatives.\n       (9) In April 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said \n     that the United States needed to reform acquisition across \n     the Department of Defense, that the costs of the ``exquisite \n     solution'' were making defense unaffordable, and that ``we \n     needed to shift away from the 99-percent exquisite service-\n     centric platforms that are so costly and so complex that they \n     take forever to build and only then in very limited \n     quantities. With the pace of technological and geopolitical \n     change and the range of possible contingencies, we must look \n     more to the 80 percent multi-service solution that can be \n     produced on time, on budget and in significant numbers.''.\n       (10) The National Space Policy of the United States of \n     America issued on June 28, 2010, states ``To promote a robust \n     domestic commercial space industry, departments and agencies \n     shall:\n       ``Purchase and use commercial space capabilities and \n     services to the maximum practical extent when such \n     capabilities and services are available in the marketplace \n     and meet United States Government requirements;\n       ``Modify commercial space capabilities and services to meet \n     government requirements when existing commercial capabilities \n     and services do not fully meet these requirements and the \n     potential modification represents a more cost-effective and \n     timely acquisition approach for the government;\n       ``Develop governmental space systems only when it is in the \n     national interest and there is no suitable, cost-effective \n     United States commercial or, as appropriate, foreign \n     commercial service or system that is or will be available;''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) overhead satellite collection and processing known as \n     commodity overhead satellite collection and processing should \n     be undertaken as much as possible by the commercial sector in \n     order to offload cost and risk from the taxpayer, while \n     national programs should continue their tradition of \n     excellence in innovation to address the truly complex \n     exquisite problem sets and requirements that cannot be \n     addressed by the commercial sector;\n       (2) overhead satellite architecture should be designed in \n     such a way that a number of elements common to nearly all \n     spacecraft should be standardized, which would bring costs \n     down, simplify execution and preserve the industrial base; \n     and\n       (3) the entire overhead satellite architecture of the \n     United States, including programs funded by the Department of \n     Defense or by an element of the intelligence community, \n     commercial imagery providers, and foreign partner \n     capabilities, should be viewed and treated as an integrated \n     whole, not simply as a series of satellite systems of the \n     Department of Defense, the intelligence community, or private \n     entities;\n       (4) the state of the current overhead architecture and \n     planning for the future architecture should receive priority \n     personal attention from the President, the senior national \n     security and scientific advisors to the President, the \n     Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to ensure that \n     the architecture--\n       (A) meets the needs of the United States in peacetime and \n     in wartime; responsibly stewards the taxpayers' dollars;\n       (B) accurately takes into account cost and performance \n     tradeoffs of the architecture;\n       (C) meets realistic requirements;\n       (D) produces and fosters excellence, innovation, and \n     competition;\n       (E) produces innovative satellite systems in under 5 years \n     that are able to leverage common, standardized design \n     elements and commercially available technologies;\n       (F) takes advantage of rapid advances in commercial \n     technology, innovation, and commercial-like acquisition \n     practices; and\n       (G) fosters competition and a robust industrial base.\n       (c) Strategy on the United States Overhead Satellite \n     Architecture.--\n       (1) Requirement for strategy.--The Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall develop a strategy, with \n     milestones and benchmarks, to ensure that there is a \n     wholesale review of the entire approach of the United States \n     to overhead satellite architecture, including programs of the \n     Department of Defense that are funded under the Military \n     Intelligence Program, programs of elements of the \n     intelligence community that are funded under the National \n     Intelligence Program, programs carried out by the commercial \n     satellite and imagery sectors, and foreign partner \n     capabilities, to ensure that such architecture comports with \n     the principles of the Sense of Congress in subsection (b).\n       (2) Report on strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff shall report to the Committee on \n     Armed Services and the Select Committee on Intelligence of \n     the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives on the strategy required by paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1663.

SUPPORT FOR SECURITY OF AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Through the sacrifice and dedication of members of the \n     Armed Forces, civilian personnel, and our Afghan partners as \n     well as the American people's generous investment, oppressive \n     Taliban rule has given way to a nascent democracy in \n     Afghanistan. It is in our national security interest to help \n     prevent Afghanistan from ever again becoming a safe haven and \n     training ground for international terrorism and to solidify \n     and preserve the gains our men and women in uniform fought so \n     hard to establish.\n       (2) The United States through its National Action Plan on \n     Women, Peace, and Security has made firm commitments to \n     support the\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\n     human rights of the women and girls of Afghanistan. The \n     National Action Plan states that ``the engagement and \n     protection of women as agents of peace and stability will be \n     central to United States efforts to promote security, \n     prevent, respond to, and resolve conflict, and rebuild \n     societies''.\n       (3) As stated in the Department of Defense's October 2014 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan, the Department of Defense and the International \n     Security Assistance Force (ISAF) ``maintain a robust program \n     dedicated to improving the recruitment, retention, and \n     treatment of women in the Afghan National Security Forces \n     (ANSF), and to improving the status of Afghan women in \n     general''.\n       (4) According to the Department of Defense's October 2014 \n     Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in \n     Afghanistan, the ``Afghan MoI showed significant support for \n     women in the MoI and is taking steps to protect and empower \n     female police and female MoI staff''. Although some positive \n     steps have been made, progress remains slow to reach the \n     MoI's goal of recruiting 10,000 women in the Afghan National \n     Police (ANP) in the next 10 years.\n       (5) According to Inclusive Security, women only make up \n     approximately 1 percent of the Afghan National Police. There \n     are about 2,200 women serving in the police force, fewer than \n     the goal of 5,000 women set by the Government of Afghanistan.\n       (6) According to the International Crisis Group, there are \n     not enough female police officers to staff all provincial \n     Family Response Units (FRUs). United Nations Assistance \n     Mission Afghanistan and the Office of the High Commissioner \n     for Refugees found that ``in the absence of Family Response \n     Units or visible women police officers, women victims almost \n     never approach police stations willingly, fearing they will \n     be arrested, their reputations stained or worse''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress on Promotion of Security of Afghan \n     Women.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a safe \n     haven and training ground for international terrorism;\n       (2) as an important part of a strategy to achieve this \n     objective and to help Afghanistan achieve its full potential, \n     the United States Government should continue to regularly \n     press the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan \n     to commit to the meaningful inclusion of women in the \n     political, economic, and security transition process and to \n     ensure that women's concerns are fully reflected in relevant \n     negotiations;\n       (3) the United States Government and the Government of \n     Afghanistan should reaffirm their commitment to supporting \n     Afghan civil society, including women's organizations, as \n     agreed to during the meeting between the International \n     Community and the Government of Afghanistan on the Tokyo \n     Mutual Accountability Framework (TMAF) in July 2013;\n       (4) the United States Government should continue to support \n     and encourage efforts to recruit and retain women in the \n     Afghan National Security Forces, who are critical to the \n     success of NATO's Resolute Support Mission and future \n     Enduring Partnership mission; and\n       (5) the United States should bid on no less than one gender \n     advisor billet within the Resolute Support Mission Gender \n     Advisory Unit and continue to work with other countries to \n     ensure that the Resolute Support Mission Gender Advisory Unit \n     billets are fully staffed.\n       (c) Plan to Promote Security of Afghan Women.--\n       (1) Reporting requirement.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     conjunction with the Secretary of State, shall include in the \n     report required under section 1225 of the Carl Levin and \n     Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291; 128 Stat. 3550)--\n       (A) an assessment of the security of Afghan women and \n     girls, including information regarding efforts to increase \n     the recruitment and retention of women in the ANSF; and\n       (B) an assessment of the implementation of the plans for \n     the recruitment, integration, retention, training, treatment, \n     and provision of appropriate facilities and transportation \n     for women in the ANSF, including the challenges associated \n     with such implementation and the steps being taken to address \n     those challenges.\n       (2) Plan required.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall, in \n     coordination with the Secretary of State, to the extent \n     practicable, support the efforts of the Government of \n     Afghanistan to promote the security of Afghan women and girls \n     during and after the security transition process through the \n     development and implementation by the Government of \n     Afghanistan of an Afghan-led plan that should include the \n     elements described in this paragraph.\n       (B) Training.--The Secretary of Defense, working with the \n     NATO-led Resolute Support mission should encourage the \n     Government of Afghanistan to develop--\n       (i) measures for the evaluation of the effectiveness of \n     existing training for Afghan National Security Forces on this \n     issue;\n       (ii) a plan to increase the number of female security \n     officers specifically trained to address cases of gender-\n     based violence, including ensuring the Afghan National \n     Police's Family Response Units (FRUs) have the necessary \n     resources and are available to women across Afghanistan;\n       (iii) mechanisms to enhance the capacity for units of \n     National Police's Family Response Units to fulfill their \n     mandate as well as indicators measuring the operational \n     effectiveness of these units;\n       (iv) a plan to address the development of accountability \n     mechanisms for ANA and ANP personnel who violate codes of \n     conduct related to the human rights of women and girls, \n     including female members of the ANSF; and\n       (v) a plan to develop training for the ANA and the ANP to \n     increase awareness and responsiveness among ANA and ANP \n     personnel regarding the unique security challenges women \n     confront when serving in those forces.\n       (C) Enrollment and treatment.--The Secretary of Defense, in \n     cooperation with the Afghan Ministries of Defense and \n     Interior, shall seek to assist the Government of Afghanistan \n     in including as part of the plan developed under subparagraph \n     (A) the development and implementation of a plan to increase \n     the number of female members of the ANA and ANP and to \n     promote their equal treatment, including through such steps \n     as providing appropriate equipment, modifying facilities, and \n     ensuring literacy and gender awareness training for recruits.\n       (D) Allocation of funds.--\n       (i) In general.--Of the funds available to the Department \n     of Defense for the Afghan Security Forces Fund for Fiscal \n     Year 2016, no less than $10,000,000 should be used for the \n     recruitment, integration, retention, training, and treatment \n     of women in the ANSF as well as the recruitment, training, \n     and contracting of female security personnel for future \n     elections.\n       (ii) Types of programs and activities.--Such programs and \n     activities may include--\n\n       (I) efforts to recruit women into the ANSF, including the \n     special operations forces;\n       (II) programs and activities of the Afghan Ministry of \n     Defense Directorate of Human Rights and Gender Integration \n     and the Afghan Ministry of Interior Office of Human Rights, \n     Gender and Child Rights;\n       (III) development and dissemination of gender and human \n     rights educational and training materials and programs within \n     the Afghan Ministry of Defense and the Afghan Ministry of \n     Interior;\n       (IV) efforts to address harassment and violence against \n     women within the ANSF;\n       (V) improvements to infrastructure that address the \n     requirements of women serving in the ANSF, including \n     appropriate equipment for female security and police forces, \n     and transportation for policewomen to their station\n       (VI) support for ANP Family Response Units; and\n       (VII) security provisions for high-profile female police \n     and army officers.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1748.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IRAN NEGOTIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) President Obama has routinely spoken about a hard line \n     when dealing with Iran on the subject of their nuclear \n     program and related sanctions.\n       (2) March 5, 2012, in remarks after meeting with Benjamin \n     Netanyahu, President Obama stated: ``. . . I reserve all \n     options, and my policy here is not going to be one of \n     containment. My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining \n     nuclear weapons. And as I indicated yesterday in my speech, \n     when I say all options are at the table, I mean it.''\n       (3) On September 25, 2012, in a speech to the United \n     Nations General Assembly, President Obama stated: ``Make no \n     mistake: A nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be \n     contained. . .the United States will do what we must to \n     prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.''\n       (4) On April 2, 2015, in an address in the Rose Garden, \n     President Obama stated that ``Iran has also agreed to the \n     most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency \n     regime'' and, ``This deal was not based on trust. It's based \n     on unprecedented verification.''\n       (5) Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has \n     routinely spoken out openly against the United States and any \n     sanctions against Iran's nuclear program and related \n     sanctions.\n       (6) April 9, 2015, in response to the nuclear agreement, \n     Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: ``Iran's government and security \n     forces wouldn't permit outside inspections of the country's \n     military sites, which are officially nonnuclear but where \n     United Nations investigators suspect Tehran conducted tests \n     related to atomic weapons development.''\n       (7) On May 20, 2015, in a graduation speech at the Imam \n     Hussein Military University in Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \n     ruled out ``allowing international inspectors to interview \n     Iranian nuclear scientists as part of any potential deal on \n     its nuclear program'', and reiterated that the country \n     ``would not allow the inspection of military sites''.\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that no \n     negotiations should be allowed to continue with respect to a \n     nuclear agreement with Iran that does not include robust \n     inspections and proper verification of all Iran's nuclear \n     programs, military installations, and access to scientists \n     and their respective progress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1788.

Mr. President, I rise this evening in support of the \nfiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which provides our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines with the critical resources they \nrequire to meet our critical national security missions.\n  Let me begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to both the chairman, \nSenator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Reed, for tackling many \nof the complex and challenging issues facing our Nation and our \nmilitary.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have never been more concerned about \nglobal instability and the threats posed to our country by radical \nIslamic extremists. We must work together to ensure our collective \ndefense and this bill puts us on the path to doing so.\n\n  The legislation affirms the strategic importance of our Navy and \nshipbuilding programs by fully funding the DDG 1000 Program and \nauthorizing $400 million in incremental funding authority toward an \nadditional DDG 51 beyond those included in the current multiyear \nprocurement contract. This additional ship is very much needed by our \nNavy and it would fulfill the terms of a 2002 swap agreement between \nthe two major shipbuilders regarding the construction of large surface \ncombatants. Both my colleague Senator Angus King and I advocated for \nthese critical provisions.\n  I am so proud of the highly skilled and hard-working men and women of \nBath Iron Works in my State who construct these ships for the Navy. The \nDDG 1000 is the lead ship of its class. It will bolster our ability to \nproject power. It promises to deliver a wide array of cutting-edge \ninnovations such as stealth technology, electric propulsion, and a \nsmaller crew size.\n  Our destroyers are the workhorses of the Navy. Recently, the Bath-\nbuilt USS Farragut, which I was honored to christen almost 10 years \nago, was dispatched to the Strait of Hormuz after Iranian naval forces \nharassed commercial vessels transiting the area. The USS Farragut \nescorted U.S.-flagged ships through the Strait, projecting American \npower and sending a strong signal to enemies and allies alike that the \nU.S. Navy is prepared and ready to respond to acts of aggression.\n  Our Navy fleet provides the robust forward presence our Nation \nrequires to respond not only to acts of aggression but to humanitarian \ndisasters as well as to protect critical trade groups that facilitate \nglobal commerce and security. The power of presence cannot be taken for \ngranted or ignored, which is why the investments in our Navy that are \nauthorized by this bill are so critical. We simply need more ships to \nbe where we want to be in the world when we want to be and need to be \nthere. The Navy's plan shows that unless we make the investments that \nare needed, our fleet will continue to shrink and, thus, jeopardize our \nnational security.\n  This bill also maintains investments in our public shipyards, which \nare another set of strategic facilities in our national security \narsenal.\n  Recently, I had the honor of hosting our Secretary of Labor, Thomas \nPerez, in Maine. We visited and were so impressed by the very \nsuccessful apprenticeship program at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in \nKittery, ME. The shipyard in Kittery is one of only four remaining \npublic naval shipyards, and it is renowned for its skilled and \ndedicated workforce that is helping our Nation transition from the Los \nAngeles Class to the Virginia Class submarines.\n  This bill also provides the resources necessary to help our allies \nand partners around the world. When Hamas fired more than 3,000 rockets \ninto Israel last summer, the value of U.S.-Israeli cooperative missile \ndefense programs became crystal clear.\n  During those countless attacks, it was the Iron Dome missile defense \nsystem developed in Israel, with cooperation and assistance from the \nUnited States, that saved countless civilian lives.\n  In addition, this bill continues to improve and strengthen the \nmilitary's response to sexual assault. How well I remember at an Armed \nServices subcommittee hearing a decade ago when I first raised the \nissue of sexual assault in the military, and how dismissive the reply \nwas of GEN George Casey. Fortunately, that attitude has changed, and in \nthe last 2 years, significant reforms have been implemented to help \ncombat these crimes and improve services and care for the survivors of \nsexual assault.\n  Still, the work of translating the military's stated policy of zero \ntolerance into reality remains unfinished business. Key provisions in \nthis year's bill build upon the past reforms we have made by improving \nthe protections for victims of sexual assault, enhancing confidential \nreporting options, and expanding the authority of special victims' \ncounsel to assist the survivors of sexual assault. The Department of \nDefense must, however, do more to eliminate, once and for all, \nretaliation against the victims of sexual assault who come forward to \nreport these crimes.\n  To further support our men and women in uniform, this bill rejects a \nprovision proposed by the administration that would consolidate TRICARE \nand limit care options for servicemembers and their families. This bill \npreserves the U.S. Family Health Plan, which serves as a model of high-\nquality and cost-effective care. This program has been extremely \nsuccessful and popular among enrollees in Maine. I have been impressed \nwith the work I have seen them do in case management of chronic \ndiseases such as diabetes.\n  This bill also directs the Pentagon to rein in or eliminate \nunnecessary, wasteful spending. It cuts headquarters and administrative \ncosts by 7.5 percent in the year 2016. In this time of budget \nconstraints, we owe it to taxpayers to assess every efficiency and use \nevery cost-saving measure, while also continuing to ensure the security \nof our Nation.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the committee for making the right decision \nin rejecting the President's proposal to authorize a new base \nrealignment and closure round in 2016. I have been through BRAC rounds, \nand they have required significant costs and have failed to deliver on \nthe promised savings, as has been documented by the Government \nAccountability Office--GAO.\n  This bill would also better tailor the HUBZone Program to meet the \nneeds of communities affected by the closure of U.S. military \ninstallations through the previous BRAC process. The provisions \nincluded in the bill are drawn from the HUBZone Expansion Act that I \nauthored with my colleague Senator King.\n  I urge support of this highly significant legislation. I am pleased \nto have worked with the members of the committee on which I have served \nfor so many years. Again, I congratulate the leaders of the committee \nand the members of the committee for their excellent work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3845-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3845-S3847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT AND THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act. This is a bipartisan bill that will provide \nour servicemembers with the funding they need to continue to keep our \ncountry safe.\n  Over the last 5 months, we have had numerous senior military \nofficials, senior military officers, and foreign policy experts talk to \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on which I serve about the \nsignificant challenges that our country faces. The senior Senator from \nArizona talked about this very eloquently today on the floor about \nISIL, a resurgent Russia, North Korea with nuclear weapons, and this \nNDAA bill that we are now debating on the floor focuses on addressing \nthese challenges. It also makes important modernizations to our \ninvestments with regard to military weapons, cuts bureaucratic redtape \nat the Pentagon, and ensures that our Armed Forces remain the most \nagile and lethal in the world. It upholds our commitments to our \nservicemembers, to their families, to military retirees, and to their \nfamilies.\n  It is remarkable that right now, as we debate this bill--this \ncritically important bill on the Senate floor--the\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\nPresident of the United States has already come out and said he is \ngoing to likely veto it if it is in its current form. He is going to \nveto the NDAA. Think about that. One of the most important things we \nare doing to take care of our troops, and the President is threatening \na veto. Now, during the markup of this bill, many Members on the other \nside of the aisle--our colleagues--also threatened to work on the \namendments but to not vote for the bill. They were all going to vote \nagainst the bill. But we stood firm--the chairman and other members of \nthe committee--and said: This is not the kind of bill we play politics \nwith. This is not the kind of bill we try to make political points on. \nThis is a bill that funds our troops, that funds the defense of our \nNation. Guess what happened. They got the message. Only four members of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee voted against this bill. It was a \nvery bipartisan bill coming out of the committee, and I certainly hope, \nwhen this bill passes the U.S. Senate and moves to conference with the \nHouse and then moves to the President's desk, that he does not play \npolitics with our troops; that he removes his threat to veto one of the \nmost important pieces of legislation that we will work on this year.\n  I wish to thank the senior Senator from Arizona, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, for his critical leadership in ushering this \nbill out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I had the distinct \nhonor of traveling with Senator McCain recently to Asia, including to \nVietnam, where his service has inspired countless millions of Americans \nas well as the people of Vietnam. I saw that firsthand. It was \nhumbling. It was an honor to be there with him, Senator Reed, and \nSenator Ernst on a trip I will certainly remember for a lifetime.\n  Now, we all took an oath a few months ago to pledge solemnly to \n``defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic.'' We took that oath right here on this floor. \nThat is what the NDAA does. It gives our servicemembers what they need \nto fight and defend our great Nation. That is why 53 NDAAs have \nconsecutively passed the Congress.\n  It hasn't been about partisanship. This bill has moved through the \nCongress every year for over half a century because it is so important. \nSo again, I would say it would be remarkable if the President of the \nUnited States would veto this, particularly given the threats that we \nsee to our Nation.\n  I want to talk about those rising threats and one of the biggest ones \nthat doesn't get enough attention. We have heard from the chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee and from both sides of the aisle \nabout what those threats are facing our Nation: ISIS, Iran, Russia, \nChina. These are rising threats, no doubt. But there is a rising threat \nto our national security that almost never gets talked about, and in \nsome ways it is the biggest threat that our Nation faces.\n  I am talking about our economy. I am talking about the need for a \nstrong economy. Our economy is one of the most critical elements of our \nnational security. A strong robust economy is our best defense. We have \nthe greatest military in the world, no doubt--the most professional \nmilitary force in the world, no doubt. We have built this up over \ndecades. But we built this up and we have it because for decades we \nhave had a strong economy. For decades we have had the most innovative, \nrobust economy in the world.\n  A strong economy is our best weapon against those who would do us \nharm. A strong economy means more peace, more security, and more \nprosperity. When America is strong, when it is working, when it is \nproducing, when our economy is robust, the world is safer. Our strength \nsends a signal to the world. It allows us to set the narrative, to set \nthe rules. It allows us to become the beacon that this country has been \nfor generations.\n  Right now, we don't have this critical component of our national \nsecurity, a strong economy. We do not have this. As a matter of fact, \nour economy is getting weaker, not stronger. The verdict is in. \nEconomists from all across the country, of all political persuasions, \nagree that the recovery from the last recession has been one of the \nslowest economic recoveries this country has ever had. We have not had \na slower recovery in well over 50 years. The American Enterprise \nInstitute has called this recovery ``glacially and painfully slow by \nhistoric standards.'' Even the Center for American Progress, a very \nliberal think tank, has said that ``this has been a poor recovery in \nevery regard.''\n  That was last year. This year it is worse. The gross domestic \nproduct, which is the value of everything this country produces, last \nquarter shrank. Let me repeat that. We didn't grow. We didn't grow by 1 \npercent, 2 percent. The economy of the United States shrank by almost 1 \npercent. We contracted. It is the third time the economy has shrunk \nsince 2009.\n  We don't even have a recovery. We don't have a recovery. Right now we \nhave no growth. That means Americans have less money in their pockets. \nIt means wages haven't kept up with inflation. It means the gap between \nthe richest and the poorest is growing. We must get back to higher \ngrowth rates. We must get back to traditional levels of American \ngrowth. We must get back to an economy that makes us stronger globally \nand produces hope and opportunity at home.\n  It wasn't too long ago that we expected in this country at least 4 \npercent annual GDP growth. That is a very normal, traditional level of \nAmerican growth. When President Reagan was in office, the average \ngrowth rate was about 4.8 percent. During President Clinton and the \nfirst term of President Bush it was 3.5 to 4 percent GDP growth.\n  (Mr. PERDUE assumed the Chair.)\n  My colleague from Louisiana, who was just presiding, wrote a recent \nexcellent article in the Wall Street Journal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 30, 2015]\n\n                 Dismal Growth Needs the 3.5% Solution\n\n\nThe steps to spurring the economy include allowing oil exports and not \n                  taxing repatriated overseas profits\n\n                  (By Bill Cassidy and Louis Woodhill)\n\n       On Wednesday the Commerce Department announced that first-\n     quarter growth of gross domestic product was a dismal 0.2%. \n     Following fourth-quarter GDP growth in 2014 of an anemic \n     2.2%, the already sluggish economy has slowed almost to a \n     halt.\n       America is facing a harsh reality. The recovery that began \n     in 2009 is the weakest in postwar history. Millions have \n     dropped out of the labor force, frustrated by lack of \n     opportunity. Lower-income workers are underemployed, middle-\n     incomes have not advanced as in the past, and government \n     dependency has increased. As budget battles rage in Congress, \n     ignored is what really matters: rapid, sustained economic \n     growth.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the U.S. \n     economy will grow by a meager 2.3% over the next decade, and \n     its estimate has declined in the past six months. At this \n     growth rate, Americans face a future of stagnation, \n     inequality and despair.\n       Here's why: From 1790 to 2014, U.S. GDP in real dollars \n     grew at an average annual rate of 3.73%. Had America grown at \n     the CBO's ``economic speed limit'' of 2.3% for its entire \n     history, GDP would be $780 billion today instead of more than \n     $17 trillion. And GDP per capita would be $2,433, lower than \n     Papua New Guinea's.\n       Looked at differently, had GDP grown from 2001 to 2014 at \n     the 3.87% annual rate of 1993-2000, the federal government \n     would have had a $500 billion surplus in 2014 instead of a \n     $500 billion deficit. And that's with the same excessive \n     government spending.\n       The last time the federal budget balanced was 2001 when \n     there was a $128 billion surplus. This was not achieved with \n     spending cuts and tax increases; instead it came after four \n     years of rapid growth--4.45% on average from 1997 to 2000. \n     Helping fuel the economy was a capital-gains tax cut that \n     took effect on Jan. 1, 1997.\n       The low growth rate during the Obama administration, \n     averaging 1.36%, is not an accident. If the cost of \n     regulations are recognized as taxation by other means, \n     President Obama's first six years of taxes and regulations \n     (and threats of more of both) have undermined confidence \n     among entrepreneurs, small business owners, and the investors \n     that would back them with capital. For the first time in \n     memory, the number of business entities in America is \n     actually falling, according to the Census Bureau.\n       An example of what not to do is the EPA's proposed ozone \n     rule, which the National Association of Manufacturers \n     predicts will reduce GDP by $140 billion a year, destroy 1.4 \n     million jobs per year and cost each household $830 per year. \n     All for health-benefits claims that public-health experts \n     find questionable.\n       It's important to be realistic about the future, but 2.3% \n     growth is fatalistic, not realistic.\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\n       President Obama and the Congress should be agreeing on what \n     it takes to achieve 3.5% growth. Looking at Social Security \n     Trustees' reports, 3.5% is the rate of growth required to \n     ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, with no \n     tax increases and no benefit cuts.\n       There are tangible steps we can take toward a pro-growth \n     economy. One step is to reform the uncompetitive corporate \n     tax code, as recommended by President Obama's Bipartisan Debt \n     Commission, among others, including the repatriation of \n     overseas profits without any additional taxation. Increase \n     oil and natural gas exports, which the National Association \n     of Manufacturers estimates would raise 2020 GDP by as much as \n     1%, while reducing unemployment by 0.5% due to an increase in \n     manufacturing jobs. Rein in the EPA's animus for fossil \n     fuels. Replace ObamaCare with a plan that lowers, rather than \n     raises, the cost of employment, and which does not \n     incentivize businesses to lay off low-wage workers or cut \n     their hours.\n       Congress should devise a plan for 3.5% economic growth. \n     This isn't wishful thinking. High growth is historically \n     normal for the United States. It is the present imperative, \n     it is the only way forward.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. The title is ``Dismal Growth Needs the 3.5% Solution.'' \nHe noted that from 1790 to 2014, almost the entire history of our great \nNation, this country grew annually at 3.7 percent GDP growth--3.7 \npercent. The Obama administration's annual growth rate has been 1.3 \npercent. Think about that--1.3 percent.\n  According to the former CBO Director, the difference between 2.5 \npercent and 3.5 percent growth--just 1 percent GDP growth difference--\nwill have a huge impact on American families. We would be able to \nproduce nationally 2.5 million more jobs and the average income in \nterms of wages would be $9,000 higher--$9,000 higher. Think about what \nyou could do with that amount of money. Think about what American \nfamilies could do with that amount of money, just by going 1 percent \nhigher in our growth rate.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania recently mentioned that \nin order to double the standard of living for a family--to double their \nincome--at 3 percent growth, you can do that in 24 years, or a \ngeneration. That is why every generation of Americans has benefitted \nand done better than the previous one, because we have grown at 3, 3.5, \n4 percent growth rate. We are doubling our standard of living. At 1 \npercent growth, which is the Obama growth rate, it takes 72 years to \ndouble your standard of living--72 years. That is the trajectory we are \non.\n  What is most disturbing about this is that this is a huge issue for \nthe country. You don't read about it in the press. Heck, last quarter \nwe shrunk. The economy of the United States, the greatest economy in \nthe world, shrunk, and there was barely a press report about it. It has \nbecome what people are now referring to as the new normal. Traditional \nlevels of American growth at 3.5, 4 or 4.5 percent GDP growth--nope, in \nthe Obama era that is a thing of the past. We are in the new normal \nera, with 1.5 percent GDP growth--maybe 2, if we are lucky.\n  We need to change that. We need to get the traditional levels of \nAmerican growth. What is most amazing is that the administration seems \nto be just shrugging its shoulders. Oh, we contracted last quarter? \nThat is no big deal. A 1.5 percent to 2 percent GDP growth for the \nentire Obama administration record--that is fine.\n  But it is a big deal, and it is not fine. We need to change this.\n  Since 2009, the White House has blamed everything from former George \nW. Bush to the weather to climate change to Europe's health to growth \nproblems in Africa for these slow growth rates. But have you ever heard \nthe President say: It might be the policies of my own administration. \nIt might be the fact that we are overregulating every element of this \ngreat economy of ours. They need to stop blaming and start fixing this \neconomy.\n  We need to get our country moving again. We have so many comparative \nadvantages to other countries--so many. We have the greatest \nuniversities in the world right here in America--the greatest \nuniversities in the world compared to any other country. We have \nagriculture, farmers who feed the world. We have a high-tech sector \nthat is the envy of the world. We have a capital markets sector that \ncommercializes great ideas quicker than any place in the world. We have \nnatural resources--oil, gas, minerals--that are the envy of the world. \nWe are producing more natural gas than any place in the world right \nnow. We are producing more oil than Saudi Arabia right now because our \nprivate sector has innovation, ingenuity, hard work. We have tremendous \nadvantages that almost any other country would envy.\n  What we need to do now is unleash this country's might, unleash the \ngreat potential that is the American economy. We need to refuel \nAmerica. When we grow our economy, we will protect our country.\n  We need regulatory reform. Right now the cost of regulations to our \neconomy according to the President's own Small Business Administration \nis close to $2 trillion a year. That is almost $15,000 per American \nfamily. Think about that--$15,000 per family is keeping us down. We \nneed a competitive tax system. We need to unleash the might of our \nprivate sector through cutting redtape and making sure that we are open \nfor business, not strangling businesses with redtape from Washington.\n  I want to emphasize these issues because we have been talking about \nthe NDAA, the national defense of our country, for the past few days on \nthe Senate floor, and we are going to be talking about these important \nissues next week as well. And they are critical issues, but this is a \ncritical issue. If we can't grow our economy, if we can't get back to \ntraditional levels of American growth, we are going to continue to have \nchallenges. But if we can do this, if we can grow consistently by 4.5 \nor 5 percent in GDP growth, that is the best way to address our \nchallenges, our deficit, our $18 trillion debt, our national security \nand the funding of our military. We need to focus more on the economy.\n  This administration has failed the American people on these issues. \nWe need to unleash the might of this great economy of ours, and we will \nkeep our country safe by doing so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/04/senate-section/article/S3847-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 8, 2015, AT 3 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
