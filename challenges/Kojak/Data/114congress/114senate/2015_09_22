Mr. President, ask a family to show you the first \npicture of their child these days, and you are likely to get a black-\nand-white image with delicate fingers and tiny toes. Maybe it is their \nprecious Christine. Maybe it is their little guy Brett. But one thing's \nfor sure--that baby is their child.\n  Scientific advances like the sonogram are helping pull back the \ncurtain on the mystery of life, they are helping foster a new spirit of \ncompassionate protection for the most defenseless, and they are \nproviding new opportunities to bridge old political divides.\n  We in this Chamber are never going to agree completely on the \nabortion question, but we should at least be able to agree that if an \nunborn child has reached the point where he or she can feel pain, that \nchild's life deserves protection. Science is telling us that a child \ncan reach this stage around 20 weeks--in other words, 5 months. This is \nwhen unborn children can react--even recoil--to stimuli an adult would \nrecognize as painful. This is when doctors even administer fetal \nanesthesia during surgery.\n  As the New England Journal of Medicine study recently demonstrated, \nbabies delivered at this age can survive outside the womb. So even if \nwe differ on the larger abortion issue, can't we at least agree that \nchildren at this late stage of development deserve our protection? The \nAmerican people seem to think so. Polls show that American women and \nAmerican men oppose abortions after 5 months. The fact is that we are \nnow one of just seven nations--among them countries such as North Korea \nand China--that allow elective abortions at such a late stage. Can't we \ndo better than this as a country? The Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act would allow America to finally join the ranks of the \nmost civilized nations on this issue.\n  Just this past weekend in Louisville, hundreds of Kentuckians \ngathered to spread a message of dignity and hope. They marched for \nthose who may not meet them. They marched for those who may not hear \nthem. But I hope Americans across the country, including participants \nin the 37th annual Walk for Life, will be encouraged to know that their \nvoices of humanity and of respect are finally being heard again in a \nSenate under new leadership.\n  The executive director of Kentucky Right to Life said the issue \nbefore us is ``critical.'' She said, ``We have worked tirelessly to \ngive these defenseless babies some protection.'' Several States have \nalready taken action to protect these children. So has the House of \nRepresentatives. Now it is up to each of us to show where we stand. We \nare seeing how science is changing this debate.\n  So what I am asking every colleague is this: Look in your hearts and \nhelp us stand up for the most innocent life, help us protect that \nbeating heart in that sonogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6859-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6859-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3134 AND H.R. 3504\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, it is said you cannot make the same mistake \ntwice because the second time it is a choice, it is not a mistake. I \nrepeat: It is said you cannot make the same mistake twice because the \nsecond time you make it, it is a choice. On every issue, Republicans \nare choosing to employ the same failed strategy they have tried time \nand time again. They are making choices. Over and over again, they drag \nCongress and the American people through votes that are nothing more \nthan publicity stunts, solely designed to boost their conservative \nrecords.\n  Today we stand in the midst of yet another show vote designed to \nhonor the political wish lists of extremists. Once again, Republicans \nhave decided to place a woman's health at the center of their \nideological campaign. We have seen this tactic before. It does not \nwork.\n  Americans are tired of the Republican attacks on the health of women. \nEarlier this year, Republicans manipulated a bill. The bill was to help \nvictims of human trafficking. They turned it into a political football \nby attaching ideological abortion riders. They have tried to repeatedly \ncut off funds for Planned Parenthood, a critical safety net provider \nfor women.\n  Now today, in the face of a government shutdown, they decide to waste \nthe Senate's time on a 20-week abortion ban. Every Senator in this body \nknows this bill is going nowhere. This attack is a waste of time. The \nbill on its merits is no good. It will accomplish nothing. By holding \ntoday's vote, the Republican leader is pandering to the rightwing \nextremists in his party who are willing to take our government hostage, \ntrying to score nothing more than political points.\n  The time for partisan politics is over. The Senate, our government, \ncannot afford to be subjected to meaningless attacks on the health of \nwomen. We will be in session for only 2 more days this week. The House \nwill not convene today or tomorrow. On October 1 the government will \nrun out of money. With or without the stamp of approval Republicans are \nso desperately seeking, on October 1 the government will be out of \nmoney.\n  Republicans should end their partisan attack on women and join \nDemocrats in carrying out one of our primary responsibilities as \nelected officials, as Members of Congress, and that is to keep the \ngovernment doors open. Actions speak louder than words. These partisan \nattacks on the health of women, led by Republicans and the leader \nspecifically today, will not only push Congress to the brink of another \ngovernment shutdown--we are there. It would show once again that \nRepublicans would rather attack women's health than keep their \nobligation to the American people.\n  On Thursday we are going to be in a very difficult time squeeze. We \nare going to have another vote, abortion related, on Planned \nParenthood, and then we are going to have to try to figure out a way to \nfund the government. This responsibility is on the Republicans. They \ncontrol the House and the Senate. It is not our responsibility. We will \nhelp in any way we can. We have not held up anything procedurally. We \ndo not intend to do that. We want to move forward and get the \ngovernment funded. But we are at a crossroads here. I am not sure we \ncan make it with the time set because of all of these unnecessary votes \nthat have been scheduled by the Republican leader these last couple of \nweeks. I hope we can make it and not have to see the government shut \ndown again. But, you know, we have seen that before. The American \npeople have been to that rodeo before. Who has suffered? The American \npeople.\n  I would hope the Republican leader has a plan to help us get out of \nthis morass they have created. We will do everything we can within \nreason to make sure the American people are treated fairly in the \nupcoming spending bills, but we have to get there by October 1.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6860-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 11 \na.m. will be equally divided between the leaders or their designees.\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to address the issue before \nthe Senate. It relates to the divisive and controversial issue of \nabortion. It comes at an unusual moment in the history of the Congress.\n  This week, for the first time, the Pope will be addressing a joint \nsession of Congress. It was 50 years ago when the first Pope visited \nthe United States. The arrival of Pope Francis this week is a cause of \ngreat celebration to people from my State of Illinois and across this \nNation because of their respect for his leadership of the Catholic \nChurch. It calls to question, of course, the relationship between \nreligion and our government.\n  This summer I finished a book called ``Mayflower,'' which told the \nstory of the Pilgrims coming to the United States, settling in in our \ncountry, looking for a new opportunity but looking more than anything \nfor freedom of religious belief. They were followed by scores and \nthousands of others who came for the same reason.\n  My mother was an immigrant to this country, brought here at the age \nof 2. Her mother brought her and her sister and brother to our shores \nfor a variety of reasons. But there is one thing that sticks out in \nthat journey. Up in my office I have something that my grandmother \ncarried across the ocean from Lithuania to the United States. It was a \nRoman Catholic prayer book written in Lithuanian. It was contraband in \n1911 in Lithuania for her to possess it because the Russians were in \ncontrol and the Russians were imposing the orthodox religion and making \nit difficult to practice the Catholic religion. I never knew my \ngrandmother, but she was one brave lady to bring three kids across the \nocean and stick in her bag that prayer book which meant so much to her, \nthat prayer book which she could use in the United States of America \nwithout the government telling her she could not.\n  We have tried to strike the right balance between religion and our \ndemocracy from the beginning. I believe our Founding Fathers got it \nright. They said three things in the Constitution about religion: \nfirst, that each of us would have the freedom to worship as we choose \nor to choose not to worship; second, that the government would not \nchoose a religion and that we would not have an official government \nreligion; and third, that there would be no religious test for public \noffice in America.\n  I thought those were settled principles, but this Presidential \ncampaign suggests otherwise. We had the outrageous suggestion by a \nRepublican Presidential candidate this last weekend that a Muslim \nshould never serve as President of the United States. I would think \nthat a man of his background and learning would at least take the time \nto understand our Constitution and the express provision which says \nthat he is wrong, that there will never by a religious litmus test to \nserve in public office in the United States.\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\n  And now, this week on the floor of the Senate, we will have two votes \non the issue of abortion. There was a time when this issue came before \nus frequently--not so much lately. It is a divisive and controversial \nissue; that is for sure. But this week the Republican Senate leadership \nhas allowed two of their Presidential candidates to raise this issue on \nthe floor of the Senate. It is no coincidence this issue comes before \nus the same week the Pope, the leader of the Catholic Church, will be \naddressing a joint session of Congress. It is more than a coincidence.\n  This particular bill relates to when a person can terminate a \npregnancy. For 47 years, if I am not mistaken--maybe I have that \ncalculation slightly wrong--we have had Supreme Court guidance on when \nthe government can play a role in the decision about the termination of \na pregnancy. Now there is an effort on the floor of the Senate to \nchange that basic guidance from the Roe v. Wade decision. Each time we \nstep into this question, into something which seems as clear as ``at 20 \nweeks we will draw a line and after that there cannot be a legal \ntermination of pregnancy,'' we find we are walking into an area of \nuncertainty.\n  I remember meeting many years ago, when we were debating this issue, \na woman from Illinois. She was from the town of Naperville. In 1996 she \ntold me a harrowing story of how legislation such as the bill before us \nwould have impacted her. She learned late in her pregnancy that the \nchild she was carrying could not survive outside the womb. Her doctors \ndiagnosed her baby with at least nine major anomalies, including a \nfluid-filled cranium with no brain tissue. Sadly, she also had \nunderlying medical conditions--personal conditions--that complicated \nher pregnancy even more. Doctors were concerned that if she went \nthrough with the pregnancy at that point, she ran the risk of never \nhaving another baby. With tears in her eyes, she told me how she and \nher husband agonized over the news and eventually decided it was best \nfor them and their other children to terminate that pregnancy.\n  If the bill before us today--the 20-week abortion bill--had been the \nlaw of the land back then, sadly it would have jeopardized and \nendangered her health.\n  Well, 18 years later she came back to see me. I learned she was able \nto do what was best for her family in terminating that pregnancy. That \nwas her decision with her doctor and her husband. But she was given a \nsecond chance. Soon after, she became pregnant again. This time she was \nthankful to give birth to a healthy baby boy. When she came to see me, \nshe told me about her son Nick. She said he had become a star football \nplayer and had a bright future ahead of him.\n  If this bill had been the law of the land, this woman in Illinois--\nand others like her--would not even have had the choice to terminate a \npregnancy for her own health protection and for the opportunity to have \nanother baby. That is the challenge we face when we try to spell out in \nlaw all of the medical possibilities, limiting opportunities and \ndecisions to be made by individuals under the most heartbreaking \ncircumstances.\n  This bill has other issues. The fact that the rape and incest \nexceptions, which have largely been built into the law to this point, \nwould be changed dramatically by this law raises questions as well. \nThere is a requirement, as I understand it, in this law that victims of \nincest would have had to report to a law enforcement agency that crime \nof incest before they would even be able to terminate a pregnancy under \nthese circumstances. That is not even realistic--to think some young \nchild in a household, who has been exploited by another member of the \nfamily, would think to go to a law enforcement agency and report that \nother member of her family before they could qualify to terminate a \npregnancy in this circumstance.\n  That shows the extremes this bill goes to. I hope we will defeat this \nmeasure. I sincerely hope the other Republican Presidential candidate, \nwho is going to try to shut down the government over the funding of \nPlanned Parenthood later in the week, does not prevail either. We need \nto move on to find other issues--not divisive issues but issues we can \nbuild a bipartisan consensus on to make this a stronger country.\n  We need to address the issue of funding our government and to accept \nthe responsibilities to move forward in a bipartisan fashion. This bill \ndoes not do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we vote on whether to proceed to \nH.R. 36, I want to respond to a couple of arguments made by a \nDemocratic Senator yesterday.\n  First, that Democratic Senator quoted Hal Lawrence of the American \nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for the proposition that a \n20-week fetus is not viable. The American Congress of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the group Dr. Lawrence represents, has long opposed this \nlegislation.\n  According to the Senator I am confronting on this issue, Dr. Lawrence \nsaid the following on May 13, 2015:\n\n       In no way, shape or form is a 20-week fetus viable. There \n     is no evidence anywhere of a 20-week fetus surviving, even \n     with intensive medical care.\n\n  But as explained by the Washington Post Fact Checker of May 26 of \nthis year, Dr. Lawrence's statement is simply incorrect when applied to \nH.R. 36. The bill uses a method of calculating fetal age that is based \non the day that fertilization actually occurred. The legislation would \nprotect the unborn beginning at 20 weeks after fertilization, which is \nthe same as 22 weeks of pregnancy, also known as 22-week gestational \nage. Gestational age is a measure of calculating the unborn baby's age \nthat relies on the date of the mother's last normal menstrual period.\n  It is well established that babies can survive at 22-week gestational \nage. As noted in the Washington Post, for example: ``That babies can \nsurvive at 22 weeks gestational age has been known for 15 years.''\n  Perhaps Dr. Lawrence was confused about what H.R. 36 would \naccomplish. The Washington Post Fact Checker article sets the record \nstraight.\n  Second, the Senator I am referring to said earlier that abortions \npast 20-week fetal age are extraordinarily rare. Some jurisdictions \nwith the most lax abortion policies don't even collect data on the \nstage of pregnancy when an abortion is performed, while other \njurisdictions may have reporting requirements but are not really \nenforcing those reporting requirements. Because data on late-term \nabortions is not widely available, it is hard to know what hard \nevidence really exists to support the claim. We do know that several \nhundred doctors, and well over 200 facilities across the United States, \noffer abortions after 20 weeks of fetal age.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Washington Post article I earlier referred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 26, 2015]\n\n  Setting the Record Straight on Measuring Fetal Age and the `20-Week \n                               Abortion'\n\n                        (By Michelle Ye Hee Lee)\n\n       ``In no way, shape or form is a 20-week fetus viable. \n     There's no evidence of a 20-week fetus surviving, even with \n     intensive medical care.''--American Congress of Obstetricians \n     and Gynecologists Executive Vice President Hal Lawrence, \n     quoted in a news article, May 13, 2015\n       Several readers requested The Fact Checker to examine \n     claims related to the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection \n     Act, recently passed by the House. This bill is commonly \n     referred to as the ``20-week abortion ban.''\n       The abortion debate is fraught with rhetoric that cannot be \n     easily fact-checked. But a reader pointed us to the quote \n     above and asked whether a new study on the viability of 22-\n     week fetuses can be applied to 20-week fetuses, when using a \n     different method to count gestational age. To add to the \n     confusion, states vary in their definitions for gestational \n     age. The quote above is one example of several instances in \n     recent media coverage that related to definitions of \n     gestational age.\n       This is a technical, but important, part of the bill. The \n     little-known difference between two methods of counting \n     gestational age is contributing to inconsistent media \n     coverage, and could mislead the public, parents and providers \n     about the bill's provisions.\n       So what exactly is going on?\n\n\n                               The Facts\n\n       The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act bans late-term \n     abortions after the midpoint of a woman's pregnancy, and \n     before the fetus typically is considered viable to live \n     outside of the womb. The age of viability has\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\n     been pegged at 24 to 28 weeks. Proponents argue an abortion \n     ban at younger than 24 weeks, saying fetuses can feel pain \n     before then--a claim based in complex science and disputed by \n     the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. \n     (Supporters point to various studies related to fetal \n     development, compiled here.)\n       A new study published in the New England Journal of \n     Medicine on May 7 examined how hospitals differ in whether \n     and how they treat extremely premature babies, starting at 22 \n     weeks. Proponents of the bill say this study, funded by the \n     National Institutes of Health, shows that the babies who \n     would be saved through the 20-week abortion ban could now be \n     considered viable. Some media reports also echoed the same \n     conclusions.\n       Sound confusing? The distinction is this: The bill defines \n     the age of the fetus as ``post-fertilization age,'' \n     calculated from the moment of conception. This is different \n     from the widely-accepted definition used by medical \n     professionals and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, counting the fetus age from the first day of the \n     pregnant woman's last menstrual period (``LMP'').\n       Fertilization typically happens about two weeks after the \n     first day of LMP. The idea is that it is difficult to know \n     exactly when you became pregnant, but you know when you \n     started your last period. That is why the bill's supporters \n     say the 20-week age measured from fertilization essentially \n     is the LMP-measured age of 22 weeks.\n       The bill's definition is a more technical and accurate \n     measure, said Michael Woeste, House Judiciary Committee \n     spokesman. He noted an excerpt in The Developing Human: \n     Clinically Oriented Embryology, arguing that the LMP method \n     is error prone partly because ``it depends on the mother's \n     memory of an event that occurred several weeks before she \n     realized she was pregnant'' and that ``the day fertilization \n     occurs is the most accurate reference point for estimating \n     age.''\n       Lawrence's quote at the top of this fact check comes from a \n     statement during a recent media call. (The American Congress \n     of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, opposed the \n     bill.) He was referring to the 20-week LMP age, not the 20-\n     week post-fertilization age.\n       The rest of his statement during the call explains his \n     point further and how it ties in with the legislation (and \n     also wrote an op-ed about it in Time):\n       ``Now, I'd like to talk a bit about why supporters of a 20-\n     week abortion ban are, quite simply, wrong. There is no \n     medical milestone associated with 20 weeks. Gestation is a \n     gradual process, and it can vary depending on the \n     circumstances, such as the woman's health.\n       ``But still, even accounting for this, the 20-week mark is \n     just not notable from a fetal development standpoint. More \n     than 40 years ago, the Supreme Court stipulated that abortion \n     is legal until a fetus is viable. Well, in no way, shape or \n     form is a 20-week fetus viable. There is no evidence anywhere \n     of a 20-week fetus surviving, even with intensive medical \n     care.\n       ``Unfortunately, some advocates of abortion bans are \n     pointing to a new study, just published last week, that they \n     claim heralds 22 weeks as being the new point of viability. \n     They suggest that we might someday reach viability at 20 \n     weeks. It is essential that we address that now, before this \n     becomes another myth about abortion that is accepted as \n     reality.''\n       We spoke with the main authors of the study, Matthew Rysavy \n     and Dr. Edward Bell of University of Iowa. They collected \n     data for nearly 5,000 infants born between 22 and 27 weeks of \n     gestation (using LMP method) and did not have abnormalities \n     at birth. These babies are extremely pre-term, as full term \n     is considered at 39 to 40 weeks, according to ACOG \n     guidelines.\n       Researchers found that 22 percent of the babies born at 22 \n     weeks received active treatment, and hospitals varied in \n     their whether and how they gave treatment to babies born \n     between 22 and 27 weeks. There were 78 babies born at 22 \n     weeks who received aggressive treatment. Among them, 18 of \n     them survived (23 percent) to toddler age. Seven (9 percent) \n     of them did not have severe or moderate impairment by the \n     time they were toddlers.\n       That babies can survive at 22 weeks is not a new finding; \n     it has been known for 15 years, Rysavy said. The point of the \n     study was to highlight differences in practices and outcomes \n     between hospitals, he said. Many factors, including \n     gestational age, influence how well a baby does: ``Our paper \n     wasn't exactly intended for identifying which infants would \n     do well.''\n       The Fact Checker asked if, using the ``post-fertilization'' \n     age definition in the bill, their findings can carry over to \n     babies at 20 weeks old from the point of conception. Bell and \n     Rysavy said that would be ``terribly confusing'' to the \n     public, pregnant women and even to politicians. Bell said the \n     LMP method is used around the world, and that the time of \n     conception accurately cannot be ascertained.\n       ``You cannot redefine gestational age based on conception. \n     . . . The new terms are politician terms. They have no \n     relevance at all to medicine or biology. They're just going \n     to confuse everybody,'' Bell said. ``They have the right to \n     do that for the purpose of making laws, but to me, it just \n     looks like an attempt to obfuscate and create confusion. We \n     already have a well-established definition of the length of \n     pregnancy that has worked just fine, for generations, has \n     been used forever.''\n       Rysavy also sent us this diagram, of the American Academy \n     of Pediatrics' terminology for age during the perinatal \n     period:\n       ACOG recommends using LMP and updating the due date with \n     other measures, such as ultrasounds, since women may have \n     irregular cycles and there is variability in how long a \n     fertilized egg becomes implanted in the uterus (thus \n     beginning pregnancy). Lawrence, in a statement, said: ``The \n     fact that federal legislation is basing restrictions on \n     reproductive care based on a non-medical calculation of \n     pregnancy is evidence of what happens when lawmakers try to \n     legislate women's health.''\n\n\n                            The Bottom Line\n\n       New research confirmed that 22-week fetuses, measured from \n     the first day of the pregnant woman's last menstrual cycle, \n     can survive. Babies born before that age did not survive. So, \n     Lawrence is correct that 20-week fetuses, measured from the \n     first day of the pregnant woman's last menstrual cycle, are \n     not viable. He is incorrect when using the definition in the \n     Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\n       The Fact Checker takes no stance on which definition should \n     be used. However, we want to set the record straight for the \n     public and the media. This is a technical point over how \n     gestational age is calculated. But it is important, as it has \n     contributed to some misleading headlines, lack of context in \n     news coverage and general confusion in the public debate. It \n     also has contributed to the rhetoric on both sides; the \n     difference between the two definitions has not been clear in \n     much of the news reporting.\n       In many way, the debate is similar to how budget figures \n     can vary dramatically depending on the baseline that is used. \n     Reporters need to specify exactly what method of measuring \n     the pregnancy is being used, as the difference is not \n     trivial.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am opposed to late-term abortions and \nwould support legislation to ban them except in unusual circumstances. \nA carefully drawn, short list of exceptions to apply in those rare \ncases should have been included in this bill. Regrettably, the bill \nbefore us provides no exception for when the physical health of the \nmother is at risk of serious harm, the most glaring deficiency in this \nlegislation.\n  Let me give just three examples of devastating conditions that could \nthreaten the physical health of a pregnant woman. An extremely serious \ncondition triggered by pregnancy in some women is preeclampsia, which \ntends to develop after the 20th week of pregnancy. This condition can \nlead to serious, long-term health consequences for a woman, including \nliver and kidney problems, vision disturbances, seizures and strokes.\n  Another example would be a woman diagnosed with cancer who requires \nchemotherapy and radiation but cannot be treated while pregnant. A \nmassive infection, such as severe sepsis, is yet another case of a \ngrave illness that could cause grievous harm for a pregnant woman and \nto her physical health.\n  Almost every country in Europe that limits late-term abortions allows \nfor exceptions for the physical health of the mother. Like these \nEuropean countries, States such as Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, and others that ban late-term abortions provide \nan exception for the health as well as the life of the woman. But the \nbill before us does not.\n  I have advocated that we add language that would provide an exception \nwhen the woman is at serious risk of grievous injury to her physical \nhealth. This is an appropriately high standard to meet, but one that \nwould allow a woman to terminate her pregnancy when the alternative is \nserious harm to her physical health.\n  Under this bill, a doctor who performs such an abortion after 20 \nweeks to prevent grievous physical injury to the pregnant woman would \nbe subject to criminal penalties of up to 5 years in prison.\n  Do we really want to make a criminal out of a physician who is trying \nto prevent a woman with preeclampsia from suffering damage to her \nkidneys or liver or having a stroke or seizures? Do we want the threat \nof prison for a doctor who knows that his pregnant patient needs \nchemotherapy or radiation treatments? If a woman has the terrible \nmisfortune to have a serious infection of amniotic fluid that threatens \nher physical health and her ability to have children in the future, do \nwe want her doctor to be unable to perform an abortion because he faces \nthe prospect of years in prison if he terminates her pregnancy?\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n  The way the rape and incest exceptions to this bill are drafted is \nalso problematic. I do not question the good motives of the sponsors of \nthis bill, as I share their goal of prohibiting late-term abortions. My \npoint, however, is that all of these language problems could be solved, \nand then we might well be able to enact a law that would accomplish the \ngoal of ending late-term abortions except in those unusual cases where \nan exception is warranted. Therefore, I shall cast my vote in \nopposition to this well-meaning but flawed bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I am a proud pro-life Senator, and I stand \non the floor of the Senate today with a gnawing feeling in the pit of \nmy stomach. It is a feeling that comes with the knowledge that over the \npast 40 years more than 50 million Americans have not had the chance to \nhave their feet touch the soil of our country. That is why I am \nthankful for the opportunity we have this week here in the Senate--an \nopportunity to celebrate life and to protect life, God's most amazing \ngift of all.\n  I am proud to have joined my colleague and senior Senator from my \nState, Lindsey Graham, in introducing this version of the pain-capable \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  The studies are very, very clear that this legislation can save more \nthan 18,000 lives each and every year. That is right, 18,000 lives each \nand every year. We aren't talking about anything other than the results \nof sound science. And because of that sound science, we know that at \napproximately 5 months babies can feel pain. We know that if a baby \nwere to need prenatal surgery at that age, they would be given \nanesthesia. Why? Because that little life--that little life--feels \npain.\n  Yesterday, Senator Blunt gave name after name after name of babies \nborn around 5 months who have gone on to live healthy and full lives. \nThis is not about pro-choice or pro-life. It is simply about protecting \nten fingers, ten toes, and one beating heart, and bringing the amazing \ngift of life.\n  In our world, out of nearly 200 nations, only seven allow abortions \non demand after 20 weeks--only seven out of 200 nations. Who is among \nthe seven nations? China, North Korea, Vietnam, and the United States. \nReally?\n  So while I may stand here today with a gnawing in my stomach, I also \nstand with hope--hope that we can take a massive step forward in \nprotecting life--18,000 lives a year--by passing this important \nlegislation.\n  America is truly a great nation. So let's improve our reputation and \nnot lower our expectations because, as John Winthrop said nearly 400 \nyears ago, ``We shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people \nare upon us.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time spent in a \nquorum call before the 11 a.m. vote be equally charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are about a week away from the deadline \nto keep the Federal Government open. Our National Highway System, which \nat one time was a matter of great pride, will soon run out of money. \nThe nominations of 16 consensus judicial nominees that came out of \ncommittee with bipartisan support are languishing on the Senate floor. \nWe're not allowed to have a vote on the Senate floor about them even \nthough, in many cases, they are courts with judicial emergencies. There \nis still strong support in the Senate for passing meaningful \nimmigration reform as we did 2 years ago by a 2-to-1 margin, \nRepublicans and Democrats. Now, those are just a few of the pressing \nissues that the Senate should have been working on this month. Instead, \nthe Senate Republican leadership has wasted 2 weeks on political show \nvotes. And with a government shutdown looming, Senate Republicans plan \nto use this week to continue their relentless attack on women's health \ncare.\n  Republicans brought us to this brink just 2 years ago, and, once \nagain, they are trying to use Americans' access to health care as \nleverage in a fight over funding the Federal Government. This time, \nthough, Republicans also seem intent on holding hostage the \nconstitutional rights of women as part of this political exercise. \nFrankly, what I hear when I go home is the American people, including \nwomen across this country, have had enough.\n  It is incredible to me that, in 2015, we are debating Federal funding \nfor one of the Nation's largest and most trusted providers of basic \nhealth care. For nearly 100 years, Planned Parenthood has provided \nwomen's health care and has enjoyed the leadership and support of great \nAmericans like the civil rights leader, Rosa Parks, who was a member of \nthe organization's board of advocates.\n  Over 90 percent of the services Planned Parenthood provides are \npreventative, including annual health exams, cervical and breast cancer \nscreenings, and HIV screenings for millions of American women, men, and \nyoung people. It is these preventive services and only these preventive \nservices that are paid for with Federal funds.\n  Republicans are focused on abortion services that are not paid for \nwith Federal dollars and are otherwise only a very small part of what \nPlanned Parenthood does. Republicans say it is because of recently \nreleased videos that purport to show wrongdoing on the part of Planned \nParenthood. But these surreptitiously recorded videos were heavily \nedited in a misleading way and generated by an organization formed with \nan agenda to end safe and legal abortion in our country.\n  In reality, this partisan debate is nothing more than an opportunity \nfor Senate Republicans to wage their personal opposition to a woman's \ndecision to access safe and legal abortions in this country. They are \nentitled to their own beliefs. But missing from these arguments are the \nstories of women across this country whose health and lives are at \nstake when politicians play doctor and tell women they cannot make \ntheir own health care decisions. That is exactly the situation we face \nwith the bill the Senate will vote on today, which puts women's health \nat risk by imposing a nationwide ban on abortions at 20 weeks or more \nand criminalizing the doctors who care for them.\n  The bill before us is as unconstitutional as it is extreme. Federal \ncourts have repeatedly struck down similar State 20-week bans as \nunconstitutional. Just last year, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to \nreview a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision permanently blocking \nArizona's 20-week-ban law. And this bill makes no exception where the \nhealth of the woman is at risk. The exceptions it does include are \nseverely limited. It is only if a woman's health has deteriorated to \nthe point at which she might die is she allowed to have an abortion \nunder the bill's exception for a woman's life.\n  The bill's so-called rape exception is, in reality, an overwhelming \nbureaucracy requiring survivors to jump through hoop after hoop, such \nas filing police reports or going to mandatory counseling. We should \nnot be forcing these survivors to relive their trauma again and again \nbefore they can access abortion services. How many incest victims do \nyou think are going to be able to do that, going through all these \nbureaucratic hoops? Doctors providing safe abortion care who fail to \ncomply with all of the bill's requirements would face up to 5 years of \njail time.\n  Now, it has all these dangerous provisions, but you know what is even \nmore shocking? This bill has had no committee process in the Senate. \nThere have been no Senate hearings on this bill, not one single \nRepublican chairman of any committee in the Senate has held a hearing. \nThere has been no debate in the Judiciary Committee. We've not had a \nchance to hear from women and doctors about the care this bill would \ncriminalize. I know last Congress, the current majority leader, who is \na friend of mine, repeatedly urged the Senate to follow ``regular \norder'' on all legislation. On this bill, there was no regular order. \nIt was brought straight to the floor. This is not a political point; it \nis about what process in this body represents. It gives Senators the \nopportunity to grapple with\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nthe real impact of legislation like this. That is what was lost here.\n  In Vermont, I witnessed the devastating effect of restricting women's \naccess to safe and legal abortion. I say this, Mr. President, because I \nam the only Member of the U.S. Senate who has ever prosecuted somebody \nin an abortion case. When I was a young prosecutor in Vermont, I was \ncalled to a hospital to see a young woman who nearly died from \nhemorrhaging caused by a botched abortion. She was unable to obtain a \nsafe abortion in my state because it was illegal. I prosecuted the man \nwho had arranged for her unsafe and illegal abortion that nearly killed \nher.\n  Don't talk about hypotheticals. I saw the tragic impact that the lack \nof safe legal abortion care had on women and families in my state, and \nso I talked to doctors about challenging Vermont's law. In that case, \nBeecham v. Leahy, the conservative Vermont Supreme Court called out the \nhypocrisy of a statute whose stated purpose was to protect women's \nhealth, rightly asking, ``Where is that concern for the health of the \npregnant woman when she is denied the advice and assistance of her \ndoctor?'' One year before Roe v. Wade, the Vermont Supreme Court, all \nmembers of it were Republicans, ruled that protecting women's health \nrequired access to safe and legal abortion services, ensuring that \nwomen in our state would no longer be subjected to back alley \nabortions. We should not forget that this history was once reality for \nso many women in our Nation. That is why I supported our Vermont \nSupreme Court's decision that we should not deny women's health by \ndenying access to safe and legal abortion services.\n  As we consider the bill before us today, we should also remember what \nBeecham v. Leahy and, a year later, when Roe made clear which should be \ncrystal clear for all of us here today in 2015, abortion is an \nextremely difficult and personal choice. And if we truly want to reduce \nabortions--as I do, and I suspect most of us do, maybe all of us do--we \nshould be making sure that family planning services are universally \navailable. We should support organizations like Planned Parenthood that \ncan provide family planning services, especially in rural areas and \nelsewhere where they might not be available, because that, in itself, \nwill lower the number of abortions.\n  I oppose the bill pending before us. I hope that Senators on both \nsides of the aisle will do the same. And this Senate, which I love, \nought to turn away from show votes and start leading responsibly so \nthat we can avoid yet another government shutdown with billions upon \nbillions of dollars that would be wasted.\n  Now, some want a shutdown because they think it might help their \ncampaigns or their press availability. None of them are going to tell \nthe press when they have that shutdown how many billions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' money they waste by doing it. So let us remember again, the \nVermont Supreme Court, at that time a very conservative Supreme Court, \nin the case of Beecham v. Leahy, when they called out the hypocrisy of \na statute whose stated purpose was to protect women's health, said, \n``Where is that concern for the health of the pregnant woman when she's \ndenied the advice and assistance of her doctor?''\n  Let's stop the show voting; let's stop playing for whatever group we \nwant to raise money from for a campaign or for the Presidency by \nforcing a shutdown. And let's think about the taxpayers of this country \nwhich are going to try to force a shutdown, then let's put a dollar \nfigure on it and say how much the grandstanding cost. It will cost into \nthe billions and billions of dollars and makes this great nation look \nfoolish around the world.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

While I was unable to \nvote today, I would have opposed this bill, which would have amended \nthe Criminal Code to prohibit any person from performing an abortion \nafter 20 weeks. As the father of three daughters, I believe that a \nwoman's health, not politicians in Washington, should drive important \nmedical decisions. It is critical that we as a nation continue to have \na meaningful and respectful dialogue about an issue we all care about \ndeeply, and I do not believe that this bill would have advanced that \ndialogue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will speak more on that in just a moment, but there are \ntwo lines in that speech of particular relevance to the vote we are \nabout to take.\n\n  This is what President Obama had to say:\n\n       As Commander-in-Chief, my highest priority is the security \n     of the American people [and] our own safety, our own \n     security, depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to \n     defend this nation and uphold the values that we stand for.\n\n  He was certainly right. It does. And doing what it takes requires \nmany things--everything from amphibious shipping, Joint Strike \nFighters, and forward presence, to preserving our gains in Afghanistan \nand investing in the naval systems required to balance against Chinese \nexpansion in Asia.\n  So when President Obama sent us a budget request asking for $612 \nbillion in defense spending, we worked across the aisle to craft a \nbipartisan appropriations bill at that level. Democrats hailed the \ndefense spending as a win-win and a victory for their States. They \nvoted to pass it out of the Appropriations Committee. This is how the \nDefense appropriations bill came out of the Appropriations Committee: \n27 to 3.\n  But then, as the Washington Post put it, Democrats ``decided to block \nall spending bills starting with the defense appropriations measure'' \nas part of some ``filibuster summer'' strategy designed to pump more \ntaxpayer cash into Washington bureaucracies such as the IRS. The same \nPresident who had lectured the Nation about doing ``what it takes to \ndefend this nation'' seemed content to have our military held hostage \nto the whims of the far left. The White House cheered as they voted \nrepeatedly to block the bill that funds pay raises and medical care for \nour troops. It was outrageous then, and it is outrageous now.\n  China is deploying ships to the Bering Sea and to the coast of \nAlaska. Russia's military is positioning itself in Syria to attack \nanti-regime forces under the guise of a counterterrorism campaign. \nRefugees are pouring forth in the thousands, causing instability in \nJordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Europe. And 1 year after the President's \nspeech, ISIL is consolidating its gains within Syria and Iraq as it \ndemonstrates an agility and an operational flexibility that threaten \nour country and our national security interests.\n  The sad lesson of the last 7 years is that our global conventional \ndrawdown and withdrawal from the Middle East emboldened Russia and \nChina. Our ambitious train-and-equip and economy-of-force programs to \ntrain combat forces within Yemen, Afghanistan, and Iraq and our program \nto train an opposition to fight within Syria--all have failed to defeat \nthe enemy. And Iran now appears free under the President's deal to \ninspect its own suspected nuclear site and to funnel more cash to \nHezbollah.\n  If President Obama is committed to protecting the American people, he \nwill convince his party to end its blockade of funding our military. We \nare going to give our Democratic friends that chance again in a few \nmoments.\n  The goal of Democrats' ``filibuster summer'' was to force Congress \nback to the brink. They have succeeded in doing that. They think it is \nthe only way to force America to accept their demands for more debt and \nmore bureaucracy. But it is time Democrats started considering the \nneeds of our country, not the wants of the far left or the IRS. Ending \ntheir blockade of funding for our military at a time of significant \ninternational threats would show they are ready to start putting \nAmericans first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have voted on this before. It seems that \nis what we have been doing the last few weeks--revoting. Vote once and \nvote again. The results are going to be the same. We have made it clear \nwe are not going to proceed to appropriations bills under the \nRepublicans' partisan budget. We have 12 appropriations bills, not 1. \nWe have 12.\n  We seek a budget agreement that fairly prevents mindless sequester \ncuts to defense and to the middle class. I am gratified that our votes \non this measure have caused the Republican leader to acknowledge \npublicly that we need to negotiate an end to this fiscal crisis that \nhas been created by the Republicans.\n  As for this upcoming vote, there is no reason for Senators to change \ntheir votes from how they voted earlier this year. This is yet another \ncase of the Republicans just wasting time rather than addressing the \nreal deal. Another revote.\n  We read in this morning's papers that the Republican leader intends \nto bring a clean continuing resolution before the Senate later this \nweek. Congratulations. We appreciate that very much. But bringing it to \na conclusion now is certainly very important because we are running out \nof time. The end of the fiscal year is now. On September 30, we need \nmore money or the government will shut down. It is not as though we are \nmaking up something. They have done it before. And who has been hurt? \nThe American middle class more than anyone else.\n  I hope we will just move on to the business at hand. The business at \nhand is to make sure the government does not close. We have cooperated \nevery way we can. We are not asking for revotes on tearing down the \ntree numerous times. We have agreed to that. We are not trying in any \nway to procedurally stop us from moving to important funding measures. \nSo I hope we can move on past this as quickly as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n               Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Bill\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, unfortunately, our Democratic friends have \nnow blocked another vital piece of legislation from moving forward by a \nvote of 54 to 42. The cloture vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act has failed on that cloture vote. But I want to point out \nto our colleagues that this is not the end of this discussion. This is \nthe beginning of the discussion once again.\n  I would point out that over the years we have actually been making \nsome progress in favor of an agenda that favors life. In 2007 eight \nSenate Republicans opposed defunding Planned Parenthood, by 2011 five \nSenate Republicans opposed defunding Planned Parenthood, and in August \njust one Senator opposed it by voting to filibuster the bill. Last time \nwe had zero Democratic Senators vote on such a measure. In August we \ngot two.\n  The pain-capable bill that was blocked by Senate Democrats last year, \nof course, is what we just voted on again. Today we had an opportunity \nto be on the record and advocate for what is a top priority for pro-\nlife groups.\n  There is legislation that has passed in the House of \nRepresentatives--namely, the born-alive piece of legislation, which \nreally shouldn't divide Congress the way perhaps the defunding of \nPlanned Parenthood bill has because at some point, whether you are pro-\nchoice or pro-life, hopefully we can agree that a child who is \nbasically grown to full-term in their mother should be protected from \nthe abortion industries. I think we are going to have other \nopportunities to vote on that issue.\n  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is really a moral \nimperative for our Nation. It says a lot about who we are as a country. \nThis Chamber just had the opportunity to send a clear message that \nAmerica is a nation that seeks to advance a culture of life and \nopportunity for everyone, particularly those who are the most \nvulnerable. As a father of two daughters, I don't understand the \nrationale of some of my colleagues on the other side. Do they believe \nthere should be no limitation on access to abortion at all? No limit?\n  Well, we will have an opportunity for another vote that perhaps will \ngive them a chance to go on record on the born-alive bill that passed \nthe House of Representatives last week. Unfortunately, I think it \nappears that by blocking this vote, some of our colleagues were simply \nunable to cast aside the pressures of special interest\n\n[[Page S6866]]\n\ngroups to take a stand for life. But it is important to note for pro-\nlife Members such as myself that protecting the sanctity of life is an \nongoing mission, and it doesn't end with this one vote.\n  Mr. President, briefly on another matter, we will shortly consider or \nreconsider another vote that should be a clear-cut issue. This vote \nwould make sure that our military has what they need in order to \nprotect our country and deal with the rising and diverse threats to \nnational security occurring around the world. This will most pointedly \nhelp our troops maintain their status as the greatest military. The \nDefense appropriations bill includes simple initiatives that make sense \nand serve our troops well, such as giving them a well-deserved pay \nraise.\n  I think it is worth reminding those here today that this will be the \nsecond opportunity to move this legislation forward. Earlier, our \ncolleagues across the aisle blocked this Defense appropriations bill \nthat provides critical funding for our troops and refused to allow it \nto move forward. That legislation, as the majority leader pointed out, \nwas voted overwhelmingly out of the Appropriations Committee in June \nwith the support of many of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who then turned and voted against it on the floor. I guess, in \nthe famous words of John Kerry, they were for it before they were \nagainst it.\n  So the bill we will be considering and voting on shortly is not a \npiece of partisan legislation, but holding up this legislation is \nunfortunately indicative of a larger strategy of keeping the Senate \ntied in knots and making it impossible for it to function as intended. \nIf the goal is to stymie real progress, I would have to congratulate \nour friends across the aisle. But unfortunately they have taken as a \nhostage in this partisan political fight the very military which they \nclaim to support and which I believe they do support, but their vote \ncertainly does not indicate that when they vote against funding our \ntroops.\n  I would point out that in 2013 the Democratic leader himself \nadvocated for something we call regular order around here when it comes \nto setting our Nation's fiscal policy.\n  Fortunately, this year, under the new majority, we were able to pass \na budget for the first time since 2009. But then what should have \nhappened after that is the Appropriations Committee should have done \nits work--in fact, it did do its work--and then those bills would come \nto the floor and they would be voted on by the Senate. But that is what \nour Democratic colleagues have blocked. I think they have gone a bridge \ntoo far in blocking the funding for our military, particularly with the \nheadlines we see in the newspapers and the conflicts arising and \nspreading across the world.\n  So this is the first time in 6 years that the Appropriations \nCommittee has approved and reported out all 12 appropriations bills. \nBut then these bills became hostage to something our Democratic friends \ncalled ``filibuster summer''--a political strategy telegraphed from the \npages of the Washington Post just last June to block all appropriations \nbills.\n  I said it then and it bears repeating that stifling debate and \nblocking votes is a pretty lousy political strategy, and it is not what \nthe American people sent us here to do. It is what lost my friends \nacross the aisle control of this Chamber nearly a year ago. It is a \nlosing strategy, it is bad policy, and it is cynical politics. It is \nsimply shameful to take these partisan political fights to the point of \ndenying our troops the resources they need in order to do their job.\n  So the Appropriations Committee has done its work on a bipartisan \nbasis and painstakingly drafted, considered, and passed all 12 \nappropriations bills. Now this Chamber should do our job and move those \nappropriations bills forward, starting with the Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  Now that the majority leader has moved to reconsider that failed \nvote, earlier blocked by our Democratic colleagues, I hope our friends \nacross the aisle have had a chance to reconsider and to think carefully \nabout the ramifications of their decision and that they will join us in \nmoving this bill forward. The world is far too dangerous and the \nthreats are far too real to take this important piece of legislation \nhostage and prevent the resources going to the troops, who simply \ndeserve it.\n  Quite simply, we have no time to lose when it comes to fulfilling one \nof our most basic duties to the American people: defending against \nthreats to national security. I would urge my fellow colleagues to join \nme in moving this important bill forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I respect my colleague from Texas, the \nmajority whip. I disagree with his conclusion. I am vice chairman of \nthe Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. The chairman is Senator \nCochran of Mississippi. The two of us and our staffs worked night and \nday to put together a good Defense appropriations bill. I think we did \na good job.\n  The problem is, there is a difference between the Democrats and the \nRepublicans about the total amount to be spent on the defense budget. \nThe Republicans suggest that we should take $38 billion and put it into \nthe defense budget but not to add a similar amount to the nondefense \nbudget. I could go onto the arcane language of OCO and all of the \nsequestration. I am going to try to avoid that and keep this at a level \nwhere most people understand what we are talking about.\n  Our concern is not about funding the military on the Democratic side. \nWe wholeheartedly support that, all of us. Not a single Democrat \ndissents from what I have just said, but the question is whether or not \nthe money that is going to be invested in nondefense agencies is also \ngoing to be protected in this appropriations process. That is all we \nhave asked for.\n  We are willing to put $38 billion more into defense, let's put the \nsame amount in nondefense. What is nondefense? Nondefense, frankly, \nincludes a lot of appropriations programs that are critically important \nto middle-income families across America. Are we going to continue to \nfund educational programs so that the kids of working families have a \nshot at college? That is nondefense spending.\n  Are we going to make sure that we make the basic processes of \ngovernment be protected when it comes to investing in nondefense? May I \ngive you an example? Medical research. Is that worth putting money \ninto? From the Republican side, that is nondefense, that is not really \nthat important. I think it is critically important. Once every 67 \nseconds in America, one of our citizens is diagnosed with Alzheimer's--\nonce every 67 seconds.\n  It is a tragedy. It is an expensive tragedy. It cost us over $200 \nbillion last year just to care for Alzheimer's patients in America \nunder Medicare and Medicaid. That does not even come close to \ncalculating the sacrifices made by family members on behalf of those \nwho are suffering from Alzheimer's. So should we invest more money in \nAlzheimer's research? Should we put more money into an effort to delay \nthe onset of Alzheimer's or, God willing, find a cure? Of course we \nshould. That is nondefense spending. That is not a priority of the \nother side of the aisle.\n  What we have said to them is: We need to sit down and work this out. \nBe fair to defense to keep us strong and safe as a nation, but make \nthose critical investments in programs that make a difference to \nmiddle-income families across America. What we are asking for today is \nnothing new. As the Senator from Texas reminded us, we took a vote on \nthis issue. It was over 3 months ago--the same vote. We took the same \nvote we are about to take at noon today as to whether or not we should \nhave this lopsided appropriation, money to the defense budget but not \nto the nondefense budget. We said no. Balance it. Be fair. Be as \nconcerned about middle-income families in America as you are about the \ndefense of our Nation. Let the budget reflect that.\n  But they said no. So we are back again. It was on June 18 when the \nleadership on the Democratic side of the aisle, aided by others who \nfelt the same way, sent a letter to the Republicans and said: Let's not \nwaste any time shouting at one another and giving speeches on the \nfloor. Let's sit down in closed, bipartisan negotiations and work out \nthe budget, bring the President in. He is critical. We need his \nparticipation. But let's work it out.\n  We wrote that letter on June 18. Here we are more than 3 months later \nin the\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nsame predicament. We should have taken the time before now--days before \nthe end of the fiscal year, at the end of September--to sit down and \nwork this out by budget negotiation. But they refused. They don't want \nto sit down.\n  Instead, they want us to go through these show votes. Last week--last \nweek we had five unnecessary separate votes on the Iran agreement. We \nhad already established, by public announcement of every Senator and by \nan open public vote, where we stood. Senator McConnell insisted on \nspending another week and five more votes on exactly the same thing \nwith exactly the same outcome. What a waste of Senate time.\n  Look at this week. This week is a challenge because of the visit of \nthe Pope and the Jewish holy day, but instead of dealing with \nsubstantive issues, this week we have allowed two Republican \nPresidential candidates who are Senators to have their day on the \nfloor. I think we should be rolling up our sleeves and tackling this \nissue. I don't want to see a government shutdown. We allowed the \nSenator from Texas to do that a few years ago, and we paid a heavy \nprice for it. He has now threatened to do it again. He likes shutting \ndown our government, thinks that is a great expression of his \neffectiveness as a leader. So be it. Maybe it is to some, but not to \nmost.\n  Instead we should be involved in real budget negotiations. I want to \ntell you, this idea of a continuing resolution--what is a continuing \nresolution? It says: Spend the money this year the same way you spent \nit last year. What if your family had that charge? What if we said: \nSpend the same amount for groceries and utilities that you did last \nyear, spend it this year. You would say: Wait a minute, that does not \nreflect the things that have changed in my family. My son is off to \ncollege. We are changing the place where we live and such.\n  That is not the kind of thing that you would respect. That is what a \ncontinuing resolution does. It continues to spend money the same way. \nIt wastes taxpayers' money. Senator Cochran and I, on a bipartisan \nbasis, came up with a better approach. It is an appropriations bill \nwhich we think keeps us safe and spends our defense dollars wisely. So \nlet's not get comfortable with a continuing resolution. It is not good \nfor the Department of Defense, not good for the men and women in \nuniform who risk their lives for us every single day.\n  It is important for us to do the responsible thing and move forward. \nLet's not waste any more time with repeat votes and show-boat votes; \nlet's instead focus our time on negotiating a sound budget.\n  On June 18, we sent an invitation to the Republicans to sit down and \nnegotiate a budget. The invitation is still open, but we are running \nout of time. It is important that the President be in that negotiation. \nIt has been 96 days since the last vote we had on this issue. We are \ngoing to face it again in just a few moments.\n  There has not been any progress made on budget negotiations. I ask \nthe Republican leadership of the House and Senate: What are you waiting \nfor? When are you going to sit down and govern? When are you going to \nsit down and work out problems instead of dreaming up new ways to shut \ndown the Government of the United States of America?\n  There are signs we are headed back to the same old process that was \nused before. By the end of the week, they are talking about filibusters \non the Republican side, and staying in all night, and maybe we will \nhear another Dr. Seuss book read to us in the middle of the night by \nthe Texas Senator.\n  I am not sure what lies ahead, but what the American people are sick \nand tired of is what they see on the Senate floor today. They want us \nto do our work. They want us to compromise, to agree, to do what is \nbest for this Nation.\n  Having one show vote after another does not accomplish that. I ask my \ncolleagues: Work together. I ask the leaders on the Republican side: \nInstead of one more monotonous, predicable vote after another, should \nwe not sit down and work out a budget negotiation that serves our \nNation, not only the defense budget, but all of America, including \nmiddle-income families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the motion \nto proceed to the Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2016. The Committee on Appropriations approved the bill on June 11 \nby a vote of 27 to 3. The bill provides $489.1 billion in base funding, \nand $86.8 billion in overseas contingency operations, which is \nconsistent with both the fiscal year 2016 budget resolution and the \nDefense Subcommittee's allocation.\n  The bill provides funding to protect the security interests of our \ncountry. The Senate should return to regular order starting with this \nnational security legislation. It is a bipartisan bill that provides \nthe President, as Commander in Chief, with the resources to protect our \nNation. I urge the Senate to approve proceeding to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes for the minority, 1 minute for \nthe majority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 2685, an act making appropriations for the \n     Department of Defense for the fiscal year ending September \n     30, 2016, and for other purposes.\n         Mitch McConnell, John Cornyn, James Lankford, Roger F. \n           Wicker, John Barrasso, Thom Tillis, Steve Daines, Tom \n           Cotton, Kelly Ayotte, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, John \n           Thune, Jerry Moran, Richard C.

I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum \ncall for this cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was struck by some things the \nDemocratic leader said this morning about funding the Government. First \nhe said it was not the Democrats' responsibility to work toward \nsensible solutions because ``we've helped in any way we can, we've not \nheld up anything procedurally.''\n  That was just minutes before his party voted again to hold up a bill \nprocedurally that would fund the military at a time with unprecedented \ninternational threats. Then he said this: ``We've made it clear that \nwe're not going to proceed to appropriations bills''--talk about a \nmixed message.\n  His party has crowed for months about its filibuster summer strategy \nof blocking every last funding bill in the hopes of taking Americans to \nthe brink. They have now succeeded in taking us there. They think it is \nthe only way to force America to accept their demands for more debt and \nmore bureaucracy. But that is not what Americans want. Americans want \nDemocrats to now work with us responsibly to help our country get out \nof the situation that they, in fact, have engineered.\n  The bill before us would do that. It would keep the government funded \nthrough the fall while adhering to the bipartisan spending levels \nalready agreed to by both parties. For 1 year, it would defund Planned \nParenthood and protect women's health by funding community health \nclinics with the $235 million instead. This would allow us to press the \npause button as we investigate the serious scandals surrounding Planned \nParenthood.\n  I know Democrats have already blocked virtually every bill to fund \nthe government this year, but I am asking them to allow the Senate to \nfund the government now. I know Democrats have relied on Planned \nParenthood as a political ally, but they must be moved by the \nhorrifying images we have seen. Can they not resolve to protect women's \nhealth instead of their powerful political friends?\n  I am not happy that we have been forced into pursuing a CR instead of \nthe normal appropriations process. After all, for the first time in 6 \nyears, a Senate under new leadership actually passed a budget. After \nall, for the first time in 6 years, a Senate under new leadership \npassed all 12 necessary bills to fund the government out of committee. \nIt is truly regrettable to see the actions of the party on the other \nside that led us to this point. The bill before us now represents the \nbest option to keep the government funded, to protect women's health, \nto press the pause button on funding for a scandal-plagued organization \nas we investigate further into some truly shocking allegations.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nrecess until 2:15 p.m. today for the weekly conference meetings.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend allow me to speak prior to \nthat?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After the remarks of the Democratic leader.\n  I am sorry, Mr. President. I didn't realize the Democratic leader \nwished to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I served in the House of Representatives. It \nwas standard over there for Members at committee hearings and on the \nfloor to always say: I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend my \nremarks. That was standard practice in the House. We don't do that \nhere. But certainly in the House it would have been totally \ninappropriate to say: I ask unanimous consent to revise and extend the \nremarks of my friend from California or wherever they might be from, \nbut that is basically what my friend, the Republican leader, has done.\n  He has no right to make up what I said this morning. What I said this \nmorning is in the Record. The fact is that he can't rewrite what I \nsaid. Here is what I said earlier today: We have made it clear that we \nwill not proceed to appropriations bills under the Republicans' \npartisan budget. That is what I said verbatim this morning.\n  We seek a budget agreement that fairly prevents mindless sequester \ncuts to defense and the middle class alike. We want negotiations to \nstart, and I said I am gratified our votes on this measure have caused \nthe Republican leader to acknowledge that we need to negotiate, and \nthat is true. I am happy to see that, and I have publicly commended the \nRepublican leader for the statements he has made in recent days about \nhow we need a clean CR. I also said this morning, as far as the \nupcoming vote, that there is no reason for Senators to change their \nvotes from how they voted earlier, and that was on the Defense \nappropriations revote. This is yet another case of the Republican \nleader just wasting time before we address the real deal.\n  We read in this morning's papers that the Republican leader plans to \nbring a clean continuing resolution before the Senate later this week. \nThat is not a day too soon. That is what I said, and that is what I say \nagain.\n  This vote on Planned Parenthood this Thursday is another rerun vote. \nI do not in any way take away from people who feel strongly about their \nposition on abortion, Planned Parenthood, and the 20-week abortion. I \nunderstand how strongly people feel on both sides of that issue, but \nthis is yet another rerun vote.\n  The Republicans--in the 9 months they have been running the Senate--\nhave had more revotes than any other majority party in the history of \nour country. They are No. 1 in revotes. We have revoted and revoted and \nrevoted. We voted on Planned Parenthood earlier this year in August, \nand we voted on abortion today. How many times will the Republican \nleader need to return to this same show vote?\n  We are going to prevent a government shutdown with a clean continuing \nresolution. That is what he said, and I agree with him.\n  When will we avoid a default by addressing the debt limit? When will \nwe address cyber security and the highway trust fund? All of these \nthings are important to do, and I am anxious to get them done. We have \na lot of problems out there in our great country. We have so many \nthings to do. We haven't addressed the energy problems that face this \nNation.\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\n  We have fires that are ravaging the great Western part of the United \nStates. The government entities that are fighting these fires don't \nhave the money to fight them. The two worst fires in the history of the \nState of California are just being tamped down, but they are still not \ncompleted. Hundreds of homes have burned. We have a country that is \nburning up.\n  The Governor of Nevada is a good man. He is a Republican Governor, \nand I have great admiration for him. I suggested his name to the \nPresident of the United States to become a Federal judge, and he \naccepted my recommendation. He then resigned that position to run for \nGovernor. He is now conducting a 3-day event in Nevada--bringing people \nin from all over the West and all over the country--to talk about what \nis happening to Nevada. We are having so many problems in Nevada. Lake \nMead is drying up, and Lake Tahoe is having tremendous problems. We \nhave a snowpack that basically doesn't exist. We don't have many rivers \nin Nevada, but those little rivers that we have, including the mighty \nColorado, are in deep trouble. We have snowpack in upper Colorado that \nevaporates before it gets into the river.\n  I am willing to do whatever is necessary to move forward in funding \nthis government, but to blame us for not funding the government is \nreally carrying things to extremes.\n  I have completed my statement, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his suggestion of \nthe absence of a quorum?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I withhold my suggestion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6870-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the \nfollowing Senators to speak about the importance of the reauthorization \nof the Export-Import Bank. I ask that Senator Coons be recognized for 5 \nminutes but first that Senator King be recognized for 5 minutes and \nthat I be recognized for 10 minutes, reserving the remaining time for \nothers who may join us.\n  I wish to initially yield time to Senator King.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                   Export-Import Bank Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, as the Senator from North Dakota just \nmentioned, we are here on the floor to talk about the importance of the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. There are a lot of issues \nhere that are contentious and controversial, and there are arguments to \nbe made on both sides, but this one, frankly, puzzles me. I do not \nunderstand why the Congress has not moved with alacrity to reauthorize \nan agency of the Federal Government that fills a gap in the private \nmarket which is not filled by private enterprise, which has been in \nbusiness for over 80 years, and which helps and assists businesses \nlarge and small across America and returns money to the Treasury. This \nis not a cost to the Treasury. This is not some kind of budget bill \nthat increases our deficit. This actually will increase revenue because \nthis agency makes a net return for the taxpayers.\n  When General Electric last week announced the possible layoff of 500 \npeople across the country and the moving of jobs overseas--because \nvirtually every other industrialized country in the world has an \nexport-import bank, an export promotion authority that is comparable to \nwhat we have, General Electric says: We are going to have to go where \nthey provide that kind of support.\n  One staff member of the committee in the other body, which has voted \nto not reauthorize this, said: Well, for General Electric, this is a \ndrop in the bucket.\n  Well, of those 400 or 500 jobs General Electric is talking about, 80 \nof them are at a General Electric plant in Bangor, ME, and 80 good jobs \nin Bangor, ME, is not a drop in the bucket.\n  I would invite that staff member to come to Bangor, ME, and talk to \nthe families of those people who are going to lose their jobs because \nof this ridiculous policy of not reauthorizing a governmental agency \nthat is serving the public needs of this country, particularly in an \nage of expanding global trade. We are competing with the rest of the \nworld, and we are shooting ourselves in the foot in the process. It \nsimply makes no sense.\n  I have visited with small businesses in Maine--as few as 35 jobs \nwhich depend upon the actions of the Export-Import Bank in order to be \nable to finance their receivables from foreign countries and then they \ncan compete in the international marketplace.\n  There is simply no reason to not move with some speed to reauthorize \nthis agency. We are penalizing American businesses in global \ncompetition for no good reason that I can discern. If there are issues \nat the Bank with its management or whatever, let's fix those. Let's \nhave hearings. Let's find what the problems are and fix them but not \neliminate an agency that is doing good and returning money to the \ntaxpayers, particularly at this moment in American and world history \nwhere international trade and world exports are so important.\n  I hope my colleagues in both Houses, on both sides of the aisle will \njoin with us to make a simple reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank \nso it can continue to do the good work it has done on behalf of \nbusinesses in Maine and North Dakota and Texas and California and New \nYork and all over this country.\n  This is just common sense. There are things around here that I \nunderstand we have controversies about and we can argue about, but I \nhave not heard any argument that holds any water as to why this agency \nshould not be continued and allowed to provide the benefits it has and \ndoes and will do for the businesses and, more importantly, the \nemployees of those businesses all across the country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to address the issue of the Export-\nImport Bank reauthorization, if I might, for a few moments. My \ncolleague, the Senator from the State of Maine, has just spoken to it, \nand I expect my colleague from the State of North Dakota will also \nfollow along the same lines. I wish to join with my colleagues here \ntoday in standing up for American manufacturing and in standing up for \nAmerican businesses that rely on the Export-Import Bank for the \ncritical financing they need to export their products to the markets of \nthe world. Many of us have said the same thing on this floor over the \nweeks or months since its authorization expired.\n  It is striking to me that because of the views of a few Members of \nthe House and Senate, this valuable tool which has helped American \ncompanies sell their goods around the world for more than 80 years has \nbeen allowed to expire. As we just heard from the Senator from Maine, \nthe Export-Import Bank actually operates at no cost to the taxpayer, \nand it is something that has helped American businesses sell almost $30 \nbillion in goods and supported more than 150,000 American jobs last \nyear alone. So I really think the opposition to the reauthorization of \nthe Export-Import Bank is badly misguided. It is my hope that we will \nfind some bipartisan path toward the restoration of this critical tool.\n  In my first 4 years in the Senate, I was the chair of the Africa \nsubcommittee on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I took advantage \nof that opportunity to learn a great deal more about this vast \ncontinent with 54 countries and the opportunities it provides for \nAmerican companies to sell their exported products to their growing \nmarkets.\n  Most folks think of the Export-Import Bank as principally providing \nfinancing for a few very large companies--companies such as General \nElectric and Boeing--and it does provide essential financing for their \nexport sales,\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\nbut those big companies also have enormous supplier chains that employ \nfolks all over the country. I could focus today on the important sales \nthat Boeing and GE have made to Africa and its growing market, but I \nwish to focus on a very small company with an important story that I \nthink helps illuminate why Ex-Im financing matters.\n  This little company is called Acrow Bridge. Although it is \nheadquartered in New Jersey, it has a manufacturing plant right near \nLewisburg, PA. That plant rolls out steel bridges. It is in Milton, PA. \nIt has been making bridges from the same model Patton's troops used as \nthey rolled across France and Germany during the Second World War, \nmodular bridges that are easy to install in remote places without a \nwhole lot of infrastructure support.\n  Why does that matter? Because they recently successfully competed for \nbig contracts to sell hundreds of bridges to areas in Africa, including \ncountries like Cameroon or Zambia that badly need infrastructure.\n  Who are their competitors? Comparable companies from China and from \nEurope that are also seeking to sell into these growing markets.\n  Why do I care? I am from Delaware. I care about manufacturing all \nover this country, but this Acrow Bridge company ships their bridges \nfrom Pennsylvania to Delaware, where, in New Castle, the Voigt & \nSchweitzer hot dip galvanizing company takes each bridge and dips it in \nzinc and galvanizes it before it is put on a ship and sent off to \nplaces all over the world. Voigt & Schweitzer doesn't employ thousands \nof people, but it employs dozens of people. Acrow Bridge in Milton, PA, \ndoesn't employ thousands of people, but it employs dozens of people. \nManufacturing across our country critically depends on access to export \nmarkets.\n  I recently had a chance to meet up with the Acrow Bridge export sales \nspecialist at a conference in Gabon in Africa. He was alarmed that in \nthe absence of Ex-Im financing, his key competitors are much more \nlikely to succeed in the next contract and the next contract and the \nnext contract.\n  We folks are just unilaterally disarming here in the fight to access \nthe growing markets of the world, and I can't for the life of me fathom \nwhy we have done this. As my colleague from Maine said, if there are \nissues with the Ex-Im Bank, put them on the floor, put them on the \ntable, and let's address them.\n  In my experience, when the Bank makes a loan to American businesses, \nit is not replacing private capital that would otherwise have been \nmaking that loan. Most often, it supplements private capital or makes a \nprivate bank more inclined to put up its own. And more often than not, \nEx-Im serves as the lender of last resort, especially when you are \nfinancing sales into risky, growing markets in countries like Cameroon, \nZambia, or elsewhere in Africa.\n  I don't think the Export-Import Bank is doing something best left to \nthe private sector; I think it picks up where the private sector leaves \noff and it provides key financing to level the global playing field and \nmake it possible for our manufacturers, for our small businesses to \ncompete around the world.\n  Frankly, most of our competitors have much more robust financing \navailable for their export sales than the Export-Import Bank provides. \nI just can't fathom why we would allow American businesses to be put at \nsuch a key competitive disadvantage. It is my real hope that before it \nis too late, we will take up and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  There were disappointing and concerning announcements just in recent \nweeks by General Electric and by Boeing that they are already moving \nemployment overseas or they are seriously considering it. GE just \nannounced they are moving a turboprop engine development center to \nEurope because they can't remain competitive in the absence of Ex-Im \nfinancing. That is going to cause the loss of 500 jobs in a community \nhere in America. And Boeing has made even more concerning \nannouncements.\n  I think it is critical that we in Congress come together and show \nthat we care about American jobs and that we care about fighting for \nAmerican manufacturers because we recognize that 95 percent of the \nopportunity in the world is in the growing sectors that are represented \nby the export markets of the world.\n  It is my hope that we can find a way through this, that the \nunwillingness to reopen the Bank, which is sending the wrong message to \nthe world markets, is something we can come together and address. At a \ntime when our economy is gaining steam and Americans are going back to \nwork, we need to continue to help American companies to compete around \nthe world, not make it harder. So I think we should stop playing \npolitics with American jobs, stop pursuing an ideological agenda, and \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank immediately.\n  Thank you.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, we have just heard what I think is \nalmost a horror story from two great Senators, one representing 80 \njobs, one representing maybe just dozens of jobs, but every one of \nthose jobs matters in America. We come here every week and we say we \nare here fighting for the middle class. We are here fighting to build \nthe American economy. We are here fighting to make sure our \nmanufacturing and our businesses are competitive in a highly charged \nand highly competitive world. And we have an institution that is \ncritical to making sure we have access to these export markets, doesn't \ncost the Treasury a dime, is used by large corporations and small \ncorporations alike, and it is supported by Democrats and Republicans. \nBut why do we shut down the Ex-Im Bank?\n  I serve on the banking committee, and we had a hearing. The bill we \nhave been considering these many months is the Kirk-Heitkamp bill. I \nhave taken responsibility for addressing some of the concerns about the \nEx-Im Bank and looking at how we can reform some of the things that are \nlegitimate concerns about how the Bank operates. But I will tell my \ncolleagues from that hearing that what we saw is the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, we saw the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And \nwe might imagine that those two witnesses were the Republican \nwitnesses. They were not the Republican witnesses; they were the \nDemocratic witnesses. The Republican witnesses came from intellectual \nthink tanks. They came from institutions of higher learning with \nconservative think tanks. They all had a theory about the Ex-Im Bank. I \nasked them a simple question when it came time for me to ask them a \nquestion. I asked every one of those persons who represented a think \ntank or represented an academic institution how many jobs they have \ncreated, what their output is, what their contribution to the gross \ndomestic product was. They didn't have much of an answer. I said: Why \nshould I believe what you are telling me in terms of this being the \nslippery slope toward the demise of democracy as we know it, which is \nreally how the Ex-Im Bank has been categorized against the word of the \nNational Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of \nManufacturers.\n\n  This has become an irrational ideological fight. And, unfortunately, \nwe have irrational ideological fights almost daily in the Congress, to \nno good end for the American people. But this Senator will say this: \nThis fight has devastating consequences. We now have shut down the \nBank. No new credit is coming in for 2\\1/2\\ months--2\\1/2\\ months where \na small manufacturer in Delaware may say: Well, how have we done this \nin the past? How have we taken on currency risk? How have we taken on \ndebt risk? How have we guaranteed this in the past? Call your local \nbank. Do you know what the banker is going to tell you? Call the Ex-Im \nBank because in spite of what they tell you, somehow magically in this \nmarket will emerge a private institution that will carry on the \nresponsibility of the Ex-Im Bank.\n  That is not reality. The largest supporters of the Ex-Im Bank are \nthose financial institutions that want to continue to provide credit \nand help grow those American businesses that are putting Americans back \nto work.\n  One of the things I did want to talk about today is that way too \noften we hear about the so-called bank of Boeing, the bank of GE, and \nhow it is that this institution helps only those large\n\n[[Page S6872]]\n\nmanufacturers. What I would tell you, first, is if you look at the \nbusiness model of GE or the business model of Boeing, what they do is \nassemble. They assemble products that are manufactured all across the \ncountry, and the components are manufactured in large shops and small \nshops all the way down the supply chain to small communities that are \ndoing things in Jamestown, ND, that are growing jobs. In the \ncommunities that you just heard about in Bangor, ME, and communities in \nDelaware, they are building out those jobs. Those are the people we are \nhearing from. Those are the people who are shaking their heads, saying: \nWhy is it that you guys talk all the time about helping American \nbusiness, growing the economy, growing exports? You talk all the time \nabout jobs and the need to bring back the innovation, and you curtail \nand limit my ability to grow and, quite frankly, my ability to survive. \nHow does that happen?\n  I want to talk about the equipment wholesalers that will see a \nnegative impact. Look at this--35 to 40 percent, if Ex-Im isn't \nreauthorized.\n  Equipment wholesalers stated that without the Export-Import Bank, it \nwill be at a disadvantage in increasingly globalized markets. No \naccess--do you know why? Because there are 80 other countries that have \nexport credit agencies.\n  The first thing China and India did when Asia slowed down, when they \nknew their economies were beginning to suffer some of the consequences \nof slow growth--guess what they did. The first thing they did is pump \nmore money into their export credit agencies--in fact, billions more \ninto those export credit agencies. Then, when this institution shut \ndown the Ex-Im Bank, they shouted: Hip, hip, hooray. They knew that not \nonly did they have money to capitalize and to guarantee these sales, \nbut they were operating in a market where we have unilaterally, \neconomically disarmed in the export market.\n  When we go back and take a look at how the U.S. Export-Import Bank \nhas supported more than 850,000 jobs, when we look at Wahpeton, ND--\nWahpeton, ND, is the largest town next to my hometown. Not a lot of \npeople live there, but for the people who work there, those jobs \nmatter. Look at that--almost $1 million--and those jobs are being \nthreatened today because of the inactivity of this institution.\n  Sixty percent of WCCO Belting's annual sales and revenues come from \ncustomers who are located outside the United States of America. This is \na small town in Wahpeton, ND. Many of the pages here probably didn't \neven know such a place existed, but the people who work there are doing \na great job, and they are contributing to the global economy. More \nimportantly, they are building up their local economy, and they are \nbuilding up the U.S. manufacturing and trade deficit. This is something \nI know the Presiding Officer, as a former member of the OMB and \nsomebody who has watched the American economy, is very concerned about, \nmaking sure that the trade deficit is favorable to us, that we are \nactually exporting more than we are importing. That is how we grow our \neconomy. That is called new wealth creation.\n  When we look at not just manufacturing, but we look at J.M. Grain, a \nbusiness that I visited--built out of nothing by a mom and pop who put \ntheir heads together and said: This is something I think we can do. \nThey built this great business. The Export-Import Bank provides credit \nand credit insurance needed for J.M. Grain to export its products. If \nEx-Im isn't reauthorized, J.M. Grain may be forced to sell its products \nto larger corporations that can finance the exports--consolidation--\nbecause we can't take care of small business.\n  Even though we hear the platitudes and all of the statements quite to \nthe contrary on the floor of the Senate and the Congress, that we care \nabout small business, we do nothing in terms of our actions to really \nprove that.\n  Amity Technology is a great story. This is a family--the developers \nof this company come from the family who developed the Bobcat skid-\nsteer loaders, if you can imagine that. That company was sold and has \nmoved on, yet those young entrepreneurs--those young inventors--have \ntaken the next step. This is a company that is absolutely dependent on \nthe Export-Import Bank. If you look at this, it has supported more than \n$50 million in exports in the last decade. Without the help of the \nExport-Import Bank, Amity would lose at least 10 percent of its \nbusiness.\n  Story after story in America--this is just North Dakota. We can tell \nyou more stories about what is happening in North Dakota, but stories \nafter stories in the State of North Dakota and across the country \ninclude small businessmen and small businesswomen who are shaking their \nheads, saying: What did we do? Why is it that something such as the \nExport-Import Bank, which is so critical to our being successful and \ndoesn't cost the American taxpayers a dime. Why is it that this is so \nhard?\n  I have to try and explain how it is that we got 64 votes for the \nExport-Import Bank here on the floor of the Senate--a huge majority. We \nthink we actually have the support of about 67 Members of the Senate--a \nveto-proof majority, if you look at it that way.\n  And we know that over in the House of Representatives there is well \nover 50 percent of the Members of that body that would vote for the Ex-\nIm Bank. Where is the hangup? Where is the problem?\n  Quite honestly, the problem is with leadership because if this isn't \na priority or if the Ex-Im Bank may be a problem for a Speaker who has \na small but vocal group of conservatives who hate the Ex-Im Bank and \nwho have made this their celebrity cause, then we will just send it \nover here and we will try to sneak it in. That is kind of the idea, \nright? We need a vehicle.\n  I hear that so often for good ideas and for things we know we have \nmajority votes for and well over majority votes for: We need a vehicle. \nI joke to my staff that I am going to introduce a bill, and it is going \nto be called ``the vehicle.'' Then we will be able to do everything we \nhave to do to keep the American economy moving forward--the things that \nwe can all agree on--because then, maybe, the American public will see \nsomething that is not rancor and disagreement. They will see us \nlistening to American business, to American manufacturers, to American \nworkers, and they will hear that we actually will respond, and we will \nmove this bill forward.\n  Now there is a lot of talk that we may not get this done in \nSeptember. No, it doesn't look very good. And if you had told me when \nwe shut down the Bank in June, if you had told me that we were going to \nopen it up in July, I would have said: That is not likely. We will get \nthe Bank reopened in July.\n  July came and went, and the promise of the vehicle, which was \nsupposed to be the Transportation bill, never materialized. And the \npromise of putting it somewhere where we could actually get it done \nnever materialized. So we went home in August, and I said: Well, we \nwill get it done in September. We will figure out a way to reauthorize \nthe Ex-Im Bank in September because we can't shut it down for that \nlong.\n  September has come and gone. We have got other priorities--no \nopportunity for floor time. Now we are looking at October, and the \npromise once again in October is that we are going to put it on the \nTransportation bill. Well, this Senator has heard that promise twice. \nSo I think it is now time to ask for consideration of this bill.\n  People say: We all need to reserve the special floor time of the \nSenate for really important ideas. I say that these people, the 80 \npeople, 90 people in Bangor, ME, think this is an important idea. All \nthe people now who supply GE who are looking at GE's plan to move a lot \nof this manufacturing and assembly overseas, they think this is very \nimportant. They think American jobs, American manufacturing, our trade \ndeficit, and our access to global markets, are very important for the \nCongress to consider.\n  So we have a bill that has broad bipartisan support: the Kirk-\nHeitkamp Export-Import Reauthorization bill. We can put that bill on \nthe floor. We can move it in an expedited fashion because we have a \nprocedure to do this. When there is a will, there is a way. We can move \npretty quickly to votes here if we want to, and we can pass this bill. \nThen we can send it over to the House of Representatives. They can put \nit on the floor, and they can pass this bill. It\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\ncan get sent to the President's desk and get signed, and we can reopen \nthe Export-Import Bank. We can hang out a big sign: ``Open for business \nonce again.''\n  But the longer we wait, the longer we continue to allow this to \nbecome the celebrity cause of a very, very small minority of hard-core \nconservatives in this country, the harder it is going to be to \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Make no mistake. At the end of the \nday, it is not about inside-the-beltway politics. It is not about \nwhether we are going to have political winners or losers. What this is \nabout is people's livelihoods. It is about helping American workers do \nwhat we know we do best: innovate, create, manufacture, and export.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer so much for the time. We will continue \nto be talking about the Ex-Im Bank. As you know, I almost can't even \napproach a group because they think I am going to regale them with 20 \nhours of the Ex-Im Bank and the challenges we have with \nreauthorization.\n  But I will tell you this: The Ex-Im Bank is not only about \nmanufacturing; it is almost a metaphor for what is wrong in the \nCongress. What that is, is an institution that creates jobs, has broad \nbipartisan support, and has the ability to provide opportunity for \nAmerican workers, and we shut it down because the Congress cannot \nfigure out how to avoid a minority of people dictating the agenda.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Ashley Aldridge\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to share a \nstory with Members of the Senate and those following us this evening. \nIt is an amazing story of the selfless courage of a young Illinois \nmother who many are calling--with good reason--a guardian angel.\n  Ashley Aldridge of Auburn, IL, was home making lunch for two little \nbabies last Tuesday. She heard someone outside crying for help. She \nlooked out her kitchen window and saw an elderly man in a wheelchair on \nthe railroad tracks near her mobile home. He was calling for help.\n  Without a moment's hesitation Ashley asked a neighbor to stay with \nher kids and she ran toward the man in distress. She saw the railroad \nguard arms coming down and heard the oncoming train. When she reached \nthe man in the wheelchair, Earl Moorman, Ashley discovered that the \nwheel of his chair was lodged in the tracks. There was no moving it. So \nAshley tried to pick up Mr. Moorman. Now, Mr. Moorman is 75 years old \nand he weighs about 200 pounds. Ashley could not move him. She tried \nagain. With an Amtrak train barreling down the tracks at 81 miles an \nhour, Ashley Aldridge somehow, some way found the strength to lift Earl \nMoorman up and out of his trapped wheelchair. Not 5 seconds after she \ndragged him off the railroad track, the train hit the wheelchair and \nsmashed it into bits.\n  When the last car on the Amtrak train passed, Ashley looked up and \nsaw a police car on the other side of the tracks. Someone had heard Mr. \nMoorman and called 911. The police were there quickly, but they could \nnot get there fast enough to save Mr. Moorman. Ashley Aldridge, a 19-\nyear-old wife and stay-at-home mom with two little kids got there in \ntime. No wonder Earl Moorman is calling Ashley his guardian angel.\n  Ashley Aldridge and Earl Moorman live in Auburn, IL. It is a little \ntown about 20 miles south of my hometown of Springfield. Auburn's mayor \nand town council and all the folks around town are hailing Ashley \nAldridge as a hero. She is that and more. In a world in which we often \nhear the message that we should only be concerned about ourselves and \nour own families, Ashley is an inspiration. Without a moment's \nhesitation this brave, young mom risked her own life to save the life \nof a man she had never met. It is an amazing story of selfless courage. \nIn this world filled with so many innocent people in danger, I hope we \nwill all remember and be inspired by the courage of this remarkable \nyoung woman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Religious Liberty\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this is a historic week in Washington, DC. \nLater today Pope Francis will arrive in Washington for a 2-day visit. \nDuring his time here, the Holy Father will meet with President Obama, \ncelebrate mass, canonize a new saint, and address a joint meeting of \nCongress. This will be the first time a Pope has ever addressed \nCongress.\n  In light of Pope Francis's historic visit, I believe today is an \nappropriate time to reflect on the importance of religious liberty in \nAmerican life. This will be the first of a series of addresses I will \nbe delivering on this vital subject. Religious liberty is an issue of \ndeep significance to me. I come from a family of faith. I represent a \nState that was founded by religious pioneers fleeing persecution.\n  In my many travels, I have seen people express religious devotion in \na multitude of ways, affirming their belief in the Divine through song, \nword, and deed. I have also seen misguided government officials limit \nreligious expression, often in the name of security or some other \nnebulous goal. I have seen people of courage stand up to these \nofficials, refusing to accept claims that the commands of the State \ntrump rights of religious belief, nor am I alone in viewing religious \nliberty as a vitally important subject. Indeed, throughout our history, \nprotecting religious liberty has been a priority of lawmakers and \nlaymen alike.\n  As far back as 1657, residents of the community known today as \nFlushing, NY, petitioned colonial leaders to end restrictions on \nreligious practice that prevented some community members from \npracticing their faith. Their petition, known as the Flushing \nRemonstrance, declared that community members should be allowed to \ndecide for themselves how to worship.\n  In 1776, 120 years later, Virginia adopted a declaration of rights \nthat proclaimed in no uncertain terms that ``all men are equally \nentitled to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of \nconscience.''\n  This was followed a decade later by the famous words of the First \nAmendment, which forbids Congress from making any law that prohibits \nthe free exercise of religion. More recently, our leaders have \ncontinued to affirm the importance of religious liberty in both word \nand deed. In 1984, the United States joined 47 other nations in \napproving the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which of course \nproclaims that every person has a right to ``manifest his religion or \nbelief in teaching, practice, worship or observance.''\n  Four decades later, in 1800, Congress passed a law declaring that \ngovernment may not ``substantially burden a person's exercise of \nreligion,'' unless doing so is necessary to further a compelling \ngovernment interest. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and \nBarrack Obama have all issued proclamations affirming the continued \nimportance of religious liberty in American life. President Obama's \nmost recent proclamation, issued on January 15 of this year, called \nreligious freedom a ``fundamental libert[y].''\n  He declared that every person should be ``free to choose and live \ntheir faith.'' There can be no question that religious liberty has been \na central concern throughout our Nation's history. Over the coming \nweeks, I will discuss a number of topics related to religious liberty. \nThese topics will include, among other things, the legal and political \nhistory of religious liberty in our country, the ways in which \nreligious liberty is under attack both at home and abroad, and what we \nin Congress should do to protect religious freedom against such \nencroachments. I will also address the history and importance of \nreligion in the public square and the ways in which religion is \nbeneficial to society.\n  Today, however, I begin with first principles: why religious freedom \nmatters, why it is important, why it is worth protecting. It is common, \nwhen speaking of religious liberty, to begin by noting that religious \nexercise is the first individual right listed in the Constitution. This \npriority of place denotes that religious exercise has special \nsignificance.\n  Of all the potential rights out there, both God-given and manmade, \nthe Founders chose to list religious freedom first. Part of this, no \ndoubt, had to do with history. The United States exists because of \nreligious freedom. The\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nPilgrims set sail because they wanted to go to a place where they could \npractice their beliefs free from state interference. The Founders of \nMaryland similarly sought a new land where an oppressed religious \nminority, Catholics, could live out their faith openly and honestly.\n  Pennsylvania was a haven for Quakers and other religious groups. \nAlthough the motivations of colonists were multifaceted, the desire for \nreligious freedom was a driving force behind many settlers' decisions \nto come to America. They came to escape persecution, to practice their \nreligion as they wished without the need for official state sanction or \nthe threat of state-sponsored suppression.\n  But history is not the end of the story. There is something inherent \nin the nature of religious exercise that merits special protection. To \nexplain, I first need to talk a bit about the character of government. \nI will then connect my discussion back to religious liberty. Government \nis, at bottom, a war of wills. It is how we answer the fundamental \nquestion of all human relations: Who decides?\n  Government is the instrument by which we place certain conduct off-\nlimits or make other conduct compulsory and then back up those rules \nwith threat of force. We may extol democracy as the best and highest \nform of government, while at the same time disparaging autocracy or \nother dictatorial regimes, but the difference between these governments \nis a difference of form, not function.\n  All governments limit individual freedom. The question is, Who \ndecides what those limits are and how far they extend? When government \nlimits freedom, it makes a value judgment that the conduct proscribed \nis less important, less worthy, than whatever goal the government is \nseeking to accomplish. Take the fight against drugs. Long ago, Congress \nmade a decision that avoiding the devastating consequences of drug \naddiction and drug violence is a more worthy goal than permitting \npeople to choose for themselves whether to ingest certain mind-altering \nsubstances. We made a value judgment that reducing violence and \npreventing addiction is more important than giving people unfettered \ncontrol over what they consume.\n  It is easy to see why. Violence and addiction are tangible, \ndevastating harms that ruin lives and destroy aspirations. The ability \nto consume mind-altering substances, by contrast, is a narrow concern \nthat does not go to any core concept of personhood. In other areas, the \ncalculus may be more complicated. Whether we are debating the proper \napproach to energy production, health insurance, infrastructure \ninvestment, education standards or tax reform, we weigh competing \nvalues. The policy we ultimately select depends on which values to \nwhich we give greater weight.\n  Now to religious liberty. I said earlier that religious liberty \nmerits special protection. Indeed, it deserves preeminent protection \nagainst all other rights. The reason is that rights of conscience and \nof religious exercise go to the very heart of who we are as human \nbeings and how we make sense of our world. There can be no higher value \nthan enabling people to find purpose in their lives, to make sense of \nthe sorrows and disappointments, as well as the joys that attend life \nhere on the Earth.\n  Indeed, the choices we make about what we believe and about whom we \nstand among are the most important choices we make in life. When a \nperson feels called by a higher power to perform some act or to refrain \nfrom some activity, that person is defining himself by reference to his \nbeliefs. Those beliefs may seem irrational to some or silly to others, \nbut to the person who holds those beliefs they make all the difference \nin the world.\n  When government interferes with religious exercise, it seeks to \ninsert itself into the place of God. It tells a believer that his views \nabout what really matters may be an interesting curiosity, a nice \npsychosocial experiment, perhaps, but that at the end of the day they \nare illegitimate. The state's interests must prevail because the state \nis the source of justice and truth.\n  What is going on is a value judgment. Just as with all other \ngovernment decrees, when a state commands a person to violate his \nreligious beliefs, it makes a value judgment that the state's \nobjectives override all contrary concerns. It just so happens that in \nthis case, those contrary concerns are an individual's most personal, \ndeeply held beliefs.\n  This is a problem for three reasons: First, we have or are supposed \nto have a limited government. Our government is supposed to serve us. \nIt is supposed to help us flourish, not vice versa. But the government \nthat overrides religious belief is not a limited government; it is a \ntyranny. It presumes power to decide for its citizens the most \nfundamental and defining choices of life: who we are, why we are here, \nwhat our purpose is, and how we find happiness.\n  No decision is more fundamental to human existence than the decision \nwe make regarding our relationship to the Divine. No act of government \ncan be more intrusive or more invasive of individual autonomy and free \nwill than the act of compelling a person to violate his or her \nsincerely chosen religious beliefs. We should have more humility than \nto think we can define better than our fellow citizens the purpose of \nlife and the ends thereof. Certainly a limited government such as ours \nought not tell its people that it knows best on matters far beyond its \nambit.\n  Second, valuing transient policy objectives over deeply held \nreligious beliefs places citizens on the horns of an impossible \ndilemma: either obey God whose commands are eternal and unalterable or \nobey the state, which controls life, liberty, and property here on \nEarth. There are some who seek to equate religious liberties with other \nforms of liberty or to downgrade it to a form of ``belief liberty.''\n  Under this view, as explained by LDS Apostle Dallin H. Oaks, there is \nnothing particularly special about religious liberty. It is merely the \nability to believe as one chooses about spiritual matters, just as one \nmight choose a political party, a favorite philosopher or a favorite \nactor, but there is no equivalency. Religious liberty alone goes to \none's conception of self of one's place in the universe. It alone goes \nto those most fundamental questions that help us find purpose in our \nlives. What is more, it implicates duties that transcend mere personal \nchoice and become obligatory in the life of the believer.\n\n  Professor Robbie George, the chairman of the U.S. Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom, explains powerfully the flaw in the \nclaim that religious liberty is just another type of so-called belief \nliberty:\n\n       The right to follow one's conscience, and the obligation to \n     respect conscience--especially in matters of faith--obtain \n     not because people as autonomous agents should be able to do \n     as they please; they obtain, and are stringent and sometimes \n     overriding, because people have duties and the obligation to \n     fulfill them. . . . The right of conscience is a right to do \n     what one judge's oneself to be under an obligation to do, \n     whether one welcomes the obligation or must overcome strong \n     aversion in order to fulfill it.\n\n  When government denies religious freedom, it forces believers to \nchoose between duty to God and duty to man--duty to man backed by a \nthreat of force. No government that values its citizens' agency and \ncertainly no limited government that exists at the suffrage of the \npeople should put its citizens to such an impossible choice.\n  The third reason why valuing State objectives over religious beliefs \nis a problem is that it sets up the State as moral arbiter. I will \nspeak only briefly to this point.\n  When the State declares certain beliefs out of bounds or unworthy of \nprotection, it tells the world that the opinions of government \nofficials trump rights of conscience. It tells believers that \ngovernment knows best and that their benighted views--the believers' \nviews, that is--have been weighed and found wanting. The current \nwisdom, which may be contrary to the wisdom of all human history, must \ntriumph for no reason other than it is current and currently favored by \ngovernment elites. All must fall before the State, which is supreme \nboth in matters of might and morality.\n  This aggressive view of the State's moral authority has no place in a \nsystem of limited government and is completely contrary to our \nconstitution. Humility should be our watchword. We should remember that \nwe may be wrong.\n  Now, this doesn't mean religious freedom should be unlimited, that\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nthere should be no boundaries on religious exercise. When a religious \npractice causes injury or threatens to upend important State goals, \ngovernment does have a proper role to play in balancing interests. But \nthe standard that must be met before the State intervenes should be \nvery high.\n  Again, we are not talking here about mere personal preferences, about \nthings people would rather do or not do, all else being equal; we are \ntalking about acts that, as Professor George puts it, individuals feel \nthey have an obligation to do, an obligation that comes not from family \nor friends or from society but from God himself.\n  Before we ask individuals to contravene commands they believe come \nfrom a higher power, we had better be sure that what we are asking is \nabsolutely necessary. We had better be sure that what we are asking \nfurthers a compelling government interest and is the only way to \naccomplish that interest. Only this standard, which requires government \nto exhaust all other options before invading the religious liberty over \nits citizens, adequately accounts for the centrality of faith in the \nlives of believers and the proper relationship between individual and \nState.\n  Mr. President, my argument today has been based on first principles, \non the inviolate right of each and every person to look out for himself \nor herself, the purpose of life, and his or her place in the universe. \nIt has also been based on the principle, enshrined in our Constitution, \nthat ours is a limited government that exists to serve, not dominate, \nits people.\n  I have purposely stayed away from arguing that religion is a good \nthing, a net benefit to society, because I believe religious freedom \ndeserves special protection separate and apart from whether religion \nmakes men and women better citizens. Religious liberty should be a \nprotected value because the State has no authority to tell individuals \nhow they should approach the Divine or prescribe for them the meaning \nof their lives. It is a matter of autonomy, a question of who serves \nwhom. But I would be remiss if I did not briefly outline the many ways \nreligion and religious exercise have benefited our Nation.\n  Today, many people sadly view religion as a sort of fetter, a chain \nthat holds us back as a society from achieving our true potential. They \nsee religion as the antagonist of social justice, as a refuge for \nreactionaries who do not understand or who fear our modern world. This \nview is not only shortsighted, it is ignorant.\n  The two greatest social movements in our Nation's history--the \nabolition movement and the civil rights movement--were inspired by \nreligious conviction and led by religious leaders. We speak today of \nDr. Martin Luther King, but we forget that before he was a doctor, he \nwas a reverend. In 1967, the year before his death, Reverend King \nproclaimed:\n\n       Before I was a civil rights leader, I was a preacher of the \n     Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my \n     greatest commitment. . . . [A]ll that I do in civil rights I \n     do because I consider it a part of my ministry.\n\n  Religion instills in our youth principles of morality and right \nbehavior. I do not claim that religion is necessary for a person to be \na good citizen, but I do affirm that religion, rightly practiced, \ninstills virtues--concern for others, a desire for good, objectives \nbeyond the mere pursuit of something pleasures--that lead to engaged \ncitizens and a healthy society. Happily, religious freedom is not just \na good in and of itself but is a good for society as well.\n  I will have much more to say on this topic in a future set of \nremarks. For present purposes, I will conclude with this point: \nReligious liberty is a fundamental feature of our Republic. It is why \nwe exist as a nation. It helps to explain why we have endured so long \ndespite our many differences. It has been a bedrock of our laws for \ncenturies and was largely uncontested until only a few years ago. It \ndeserves continuing protection as a preeminent value because it \nsafeguards our ability as citizens to find purpose in our lives and to \ndivine for ourselves who we are. It matters more than any other \nfreedom. That is why it was listed first in the Constitution.\n  Too many of our fellow citizens--perhaps even too many in this body--\nhave lost sight of the purpose and importance of religious liberty and \nof our duty as legislators to protect the freedom of all citizens to \nbelieve and to act according to their beliefs.\n  I will return to this theme in the coming weeks as I deliver \nadditional remarks on this most crucial topic. All I can say is that \nreligious freedom means everything to me. I think it means everything \nto people of good will who really have studied how this Nation came \nabout, how it progressed, how it has overcome some of the most \nmonumental problems in the history of the world, and how we have been \nso successful after all these years.\n  We have a tendency in this current climate, in this current world to \nstart to decry religious belief. I want to make sure that we don't end \nit, that we augment it, and that we get back to where we should be as a \nNation so that we can continue to maintain this great Nation as the \ngreatest Nation with the greatest freedom and the greatest Constitution \nin the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, the Senator from Alaska be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I was proud and honored to vote for \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the Pain-Capable Unborn Child \nProtection Act, offered by my dear friend and leader, Senator Graham of \nSouth Carolina.\n  Nearly 17 years ago to this day, I came to the Senate floor to cast a \nvote to override then-President Clinton's veto of the Federal partial-\nbirth abortion ban and to speak out for the voiceless unborn children \nwho were victims of that deplorable practice. As supporters of that \neffort to end partial-birth abortions in the United States will recall, \nit was a long journey to see legislation finally signed into law in \n2003 but a journey fully consistent with America's long commitment to \nthe rights and dignity of all human life. Enacting that legislation \ncalled upon our Nation's moral conscience in the same way our country \nis compelled to action in the face of injustice at home and abroad, and \nI believe we as a nation are better off for it today.\n  The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act the Senate considered \ntoday is no different. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation to protect the lives of unborn children by banning \nabortions beyond the time when a child in the womb can feel pain. My \nsupport for this bill is a continuation of my longstanding and \nunequivocal pro-life record since I was first elected to the Senate.\n  As was the case when the Senate considered the ban on partial-birth \nabortion, we have to recognize that the bill the Senate voted on today \ndoes not fit neatly into the traditional debate about whether you are \npro-life or pro-choice. The bill is about banning the extreme practice \nof late-term abortions and protecting the lives of fully formed human \nbeings who can feel real pain. These abortions occur at the beginning \nof the sixth month of pregnancy. They end the life of a human being who \nhas been found worthy of fetal anesthesia to dull the pain the \nprocedure causes but somehow unworthy of life. I submit that to oppose \nthis bill, to vote to allow this practice to continue to be legal in \nthis country, is extreme and unconscionable.\n  This effort puts us on the right side of the American people and the \nright side of history. This legislation has 45 cosponsors in the \nSenate, and it passed the House by a vote of 242 to 184 in May of this \nyear. A recent poll found that 64 percent of Americans support \nrestricting late-term abortions.\n  I am proudly pro-life because I believe this is a human rights issue \ninextricably tied to the values of our Nation. These are the same \nvalues that have resulted in a long-held American commitment to \nfighting for human rights and for the disadvantaged and the voiceless \naround the world. The same commitment to fighting for human life must \nbe true in our Nation today for unborn children.\n  In April 2014, Time magazine ran a story called ``A Preemie \nRevolution: Cutting-edge medicine and dedicated caregivers are helping \nthe tiniest babies survive--and thrive.'' The article\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\ndiscussed remarkable medical advancements that have resulted in a \nsteadily decreasing age of viability for infants born prematurely. It \ndetails the complexities of caring for premature babies, the challenge \nof seeing to things as basic as breathing for these babies, as well as \nthe ``round-the-clock SWAT team of nearly 300 [medical professionals]'' \nthat come together at neonatal intensive care units, NICU, to fight for \nthese tiny lives.\n  In the author's words:\n\n       [I]n some ways, the work of a NICU will always seem like an \n     exercise in disproportion--an army of people and a mountain \n     of infrastructure caring for a pound of life. But it's a \n     disproportion that speaks very well of us.\n\n  The painstaking fight for human life that goes on in NICUs around the \ncountry is irreconcilable with the current status quo in our Federal \nlaw that permits late-term abortions.\n  As we know, what is at stake in this debate is made all the more real \nand urgent by the heinous video footage showing Planned Parenthood's \nrole in the harvesting of unborn babies' body parts. I was proud to \nvote in support of defunding Planned Parenthood while preserving \nFederal funding for women's health services in facilities such as \ncommunity health centers.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the significance of this vote today, \nthe reality of the practice that this bill is aimed at prohibiting, and \nwhat permitting late-term abortions says about our Nation's commitment \nto fighting for life and standing up for human rights when our \nconscience calls us to. I deeply regret that this body failed today to \nvote for the voiceless and ban late-term abortions and protect life. I \nurge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider their \nposition on this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, listening to the last two speakers, I am \nreminded what a privilege and honor it is to be able to serve in the \nSenate alongside great Americans--the President pro tempore, the \nSenator from Utah, and the Senator from Arizona, John McCain, who have \nserved this country for decades--decades--with honor and distinction, \nand, as we saw in their remarks just a few minutes ago, with wisdom \nfrom experience and conviction.\n  We took two important votes today. One, as Senator McCain was talking \nabout, was the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, very important \npro-life legislation. I agree with what the Senator from Arizona said \nabout that very important bill and commend the Presiding Officer for \nhis leadership throughout the country.\n  We also voted on the Defense appropriations bill today, another \nimportant bill. I am not sure it is going to get a lot of press, but I \nwish to talk about what is going on there because it is actually very \nimportant for the American people to really have a sense of what is \nhappening. We saw in the media, we see all over Washington and on TV \nthis talk concerning a government shutdown. I think a lot of people \nhave concerns about it. Let me talk about that in the context of the \nbill we voted on today, which, unfortunately, was filibustered by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  A lot of us who are new here in the Senate--the Presiding Officer, my \ncolleague from North Carolina--ran on the issue of a dysfunctional \nSenate, where the most basic function of government was not happening. \nLet me give one critical example. We weren't passing a budget, we \nweren't funding government, and we weren't doing regular order in terms \nof appropriations bills. So many of us ran to say: Enough, we are going \nto change things here. With all due respect to my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, they neglected this function--no budget, no \nappropriations bills--for years. The most basic function of government \nwas not happening in the Senate.\n  So many of us campaigned to change that--to work hard to change \nthat--because we knew that is what the American people wanted. And we \nhave done it. We are starting to do it. For example, we passed the \nbudget resolution.\n  If we look at the 10 years out of our budget versus the 10 years out \nof the President's budget, we cut $5 to $7 trillion in terms of the \nPresident's wasteful spending. That is serious. We did that. We passed \nthe budget resolution. We debated it here for a number of weeks, not \ndays. The other side of the aisle hadn't done that for years.\n  When I went back home and said we did that, a lot of people in Alaska \nsaid: Well, big deal, my household passes a budget every year. My \nbusiness passes a budget every year. The State of Alaska passes a \nbudget every year.\n  But it is a big deal because we hadn't done it here. But now we are \ndoing it because that is what we committed to do.\n  So that is one step: We passed a budget. Then the Members of this \nbody, working hard, particularly through the Appropriations Committee, \npassed 12 appropriations bills--9 of which passed out of the committee \nwith very, very strong bipartisan votes--to fund the government. So far \nso good--that is what we are supposed to be doing here. We are back to \nwork, back to regular order.\n  One of these bills was the Defense appropriation bill. What does that \nmean? It is kind of a wonky term. That is the bill that funds our \nmilitary, that funds our national defense, that funds the sergeant in \nthe Marine Corps and the Army--a really important bill. It passed out \nof the committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 27 to 3. We \nalmost can't get any more bipartisan than that, 27 to 3. Virtually \neverybody, Democrats and Republicans, voted for that because they know \nhow important it is.\n  So what happened today? We took the next step in the regular order \nprocess as we promised the American people to fund our government by \nbringing forward that bill. At 27 to 3, it should be no problem passing \nit in the Senate. Look at how many Democrats voted for that bill. So we \nwanted to move forward on that bill. We all know how critical that bill \nis--probably one of the most critical appropriations bills we have \nbecause it is funding the defense of our Nation and the brave men and \nwomen who serve our Nation.\n  So what happened in the vote today? Well, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle decided: No, we are going to filibuster that. I know \nwe voted 27 to 3 to move it out of committee, but now we are going to \nfilibuster that.\n  In fact, according to the leader on the other side of the aisle, the \nDemocrats are saying they are going to filibuster all 12 appropriations \nbills--all 12 of them.\n  Let me repeat. Here is what is happening. We passed the budget. We \npassed, for the most part, very bipartisan appropriations bills. Let me \nread a few of them: Agriculture, 28 to 2, out of committee; Commerce, \nJustice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, 27 \nto 3; Defense, 27 to 3; Energy and Water, 26 to 4; State and Foreign \nOperations, 27 to 3.\n  This is a list of very bipartisan work by the Senate in the \nAppropriations Committee. I commend all the Members of this body who \nworked so hard on that. But now we hear that the other side is going to \nfilibuster every single one of these. They did it today. That is \nactually the second time they did it with regard to the Defense \nappropriations bill. They are going to do it again and again and again.\n  It is my view that we should bring all 12 of these bills to the \nSenate floor, like we did today. We are trying to move forward and fund \nthis government. We are trying to get back to regular order, the way \nthe Senate used to work. It hadn't worked like that for years, but now \nwe are trying to do that. If the other side of the aisle wants to \ncontinually filibuster the funding of our government, let them stand up \nto the American people and do that.\n  For example, I think we should bring up the Military Construction and \nVeterans Affairs appropriations bill that passed out of committee 21 to \n9. It is very important for the country. Let's bring it up. Let's have \na vote on it. If they want to filibuster that, I think they will have \nto explain why they are not supporting veterans.\n  This will make one thing clear, though. In all the talk we hear in \nthe media every day about Republicans wanting to shut down the \ngovernment, I think it is pretty clear when we look at what is \nhappening here with the filibustering of all the appropriations bills \nthat there is another side to this story. There is another side to this \nstory. The\n\n[[Page S6877]]\n\ndefunding of the government--of our troops, as we saw today--is \nhappening because of the filibuster.\n  It is my hope that our friends in the media, who love to talk about \nthis story, are going to look a little bit more deeply--look at these \nvotes today, look at the budget, look at what the Appropriations \nCommittee has been doing--and tell the real story. There are people \nvery focused on stopping the funding of the government. We saw it \ntoday. It is not the majority party in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n               Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Bill\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the great State \nof Alaska for his comments. I wish to be associated with those \ncomments. I also thank him not only for his service in the Senate but \nfor his service in the Marines.\n  I stand here today heartbroken over the failure to advance a bill \nthat would protect the lives of unborn babies--babies who are old \nenough, who, with proper care, can survive when born at this age.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken regarding all that we know about \nthe science of fetal development--how unborn babies feel pain, when \nthey feel pain, the related neurological data, and so on. Others will \ntell us that the United States is out of step with the overwhelming \nmajority of other nations on this policy. Others will show poll numbers \nthat demonstrate that an overwhelming majority of Americans, especially \nwomen, think this policy is a good policy--the policy that was voted \ndown in this Chamber today.\n  But we don't need to know all that to know what is right and what is \nwrong. We know what is right. Any of us who have ever watched our \nwife's belly grow, as I did with the miracle of my son and daughter; \nany of us who have ever experienced the excitement before learning the \nresults of a prenatal test; any of us who have seen an ultrasound or \nattended a baby shower, we all know. We know because of the hundreds \nand thousands of friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers whose own \nbaby stories we have watched over our lives. The stories of successful \ndeliveries, the complications, the joys, the tragedies, and all of \nthese stories--the beautiful stories and the bittersweet stories--have \ntaught us the truth about the unborn. We all know. We don't need to be \nscientists to understand what the science can tell us.\n  So I wish to tell some stories that illustrate what this bill, which \nwas voted down today in this Chamber, is about.\n  I want to start with Samuel. As early as 1999, we were doing fetal \nsurgeries here in the United States. Samuel's parents, Julie and Alex, \nwere given the terrible news that their unborn son had permanent nerve \ndamage from an opening in his spine due to spina bifida. Doctors said \nthat half of all babies with spina bifida were aborted, but Julie and \nAlex chose a different path for Samuel. This was at 21 weeks. Samuel \nwas operated on in utero. Today he is all grown up. Samuel said that he \nbelieves God sent him to Earth to help stop abortion.\n  Then there is Elijah.\n  When April Leffingwell's ultrasound at 20 weeks revealed a life-\nthreatening tumor growing in Elijah's left lung, she knew his life was \nin grave danger. Thankfully, this fateful diagnosis was not the end of \nthe story. Instead, Elijah's life was saved by an innovative fetal \nsurgery performed at just 25 weeks. During the surgery, 3 years ago, 5-\nmonth-old baby Elijah was given anesthesia to protect him from pain. He \nwas then partially removed from his mother's womb, and the life-\nthreatening tumor the size of an orange was removed. Elijah's primary \nsurgeon at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia said that he would have \ndied if the operation were not done before birth. Now, several years \nlater, after a challenging beginning, Elijah is a healthy and very \nactive toddler.\n  Here is another story, about Micah.\n  Micah's mom Danielle went into labor and delivered Micah when he was \njust 22 weeks old. This is little Micah shortly after delivery as shown \nin this picture. She was given the worst of news--that her son would \nnot survive. But Micah received state-of-the-art care and spent the \nnext 4 months in the neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU. Micah's \nparents kept vigil at his side and watched all the developmental \nmilestones, which should have been reached in utero, be reached in the \nartificial environment in the NICU. And slowly, day by day, he made \nit. He thrived and is 3 years old.\n\n  Micah and his family are here today at the Senate. I met them earlier \ntoday. He actually gave me this band that says ``Miracles for Micah.'' \nSurely my colleagues can see what Micah's parents see; that their son \nwas just as precious at 22 weeks as he is today at 3 years old.\n  There are more stories. Some of us remember former Philadelphia \nEagles player Vaughn Hebron. Vaughn and his wife Kim were given the \nnews that their twins, 5 months old in utero, were facing what is \ncalled twin-transfusion--a life-threatening condition. Doctors said \nthere was a 70-percent chance that one or both of the twins would die, \nbut Vaughn and his wife chose to fight for their boys. They received \nstate-of-the-art care and both boys are now healthy teenagers.\n  All of these children--the Hebron twins, Micah, Elijah, Samuel--there \nis only one difference between them and the babies aborted, \ndismembered, and sold by Planned Parenthood; the only difference is \nthat these children were wanted and welcomed. If they are wanted and \nwelcome, we fight like mad to save them. We throw everything at them \nthat science and medicine can possibly do. We save their lives and we \ncreate miracles every day.\n  We need this bill to protect those poor babies who are unwanted and \nunwelcome. We don't strip born children of their right to life and \nprotection just because their parents don't want them. We take care of \nthem at taxpayer expense. We try to help their parents support them. We \nprovide health care for them. If their parents will not or can't raise \nthem, we seek adoptive families for them. But if they are a few months, \neven a few days or a few minutes younger, our law denies them the \nopportunity to grow, to learn, and to become the bright-eyed, world-\nchanging children we all cherish and protect.\n  They say a picture is worth a thousand words. I think this one says \nit better than anything any of us will say on this Senate floor. This \nis a baby in utero around 20 weeks. There is simply no arguing that \nthis is a baby. At this age, she is about 10 ounces, about 10 inches \nlong--about the size of a big banana. A baby this age is practicing \nswallowing for the first time. She is moving. Her skin is thickening up \nso it is starting to lose that translucent look. A good fraction of the \nbabies who are delivered prematurely at this age survive. A few weeks \nlater, almost all of them survive.\n  The bill we voted on today would have protected babies from this age \nand older--when they can feel pain, when they look like humans in \nphotographs and sonograms, and when they are kicking around in their \nmama's bellies. Although we didn't advance this bill today, we must not \ngive up. I am not giving up on my colleagues because I believe justice \ncan still win out. This bill must eventually pass. History will clothe \nus in disgrace if we fail to do so. The law should protect these \nchildren. Nobody put it better than the late great children's author \nDr. Seuss when he said: ``A person's a person, no matter how small.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n              Corporate Culture in the Automobile Industry\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, Volkswagen has become part of the lexicon \nof the American economy, American culture. Volkswagen Beetles, at the \ntime when I was growing up as a kid, were all a part of the America we \nknow and love. Now we find out that Volkswagen for years has been \npurposely deceiving the American public--for that matter, their \ncustomers around the world--on their diesel cars by deceptively telling \nthem what the mileage is on the cars. And oh, by the way, in the United \nStates, because they were supposedly getting great mileage, there was a \ntax benefit to the purchasers of those vehicles.\n  What in the world is happening to the American automobile industry \nand those foreign manufacturers that are selling automobiles here to \ntake advantage of the American automobile-\n\n[[Page S6878]]\n\nconsuming public? It is an outrage that VW would take advantage of its \nconsumers by purposely deceiving them on their mileage on diesel \nvehicles.\n  First there was General Motors. Over 100 people died as a result of a \ndefective ignition switch that General Motors did not tell us about, \nand in the process just recently--last week--announced a fine of $900 \nmillion. Where are our U.S. regulatory agencies? What is the Obama \nadministration doing about this in its regulatory agencies? Why are \nthey not dropping the hammer on corporations and corporate executives \nthat are purposely deceiving the American people about faulty \nautomobile products that cause the loss of lives and property? It was \nGeneral Motors. Then it was Takata airbags, which are in a lot of \nautomobiles but especially in Hondas and Toyotas. We know that a number \nof people have lost their lives, a number of people have been maimed, \nand they are driving around with an airbag in the middle of the \nsteering wheel--which now there have been millions and millions of \nrecalls--and in the middle of that steering wheel is an explosive \ngrenade because it hasn't been replaced.\n  Today, Volkswagen admitted, over the course of the last half dozen \nyears, that they have deceived people on their diesel vehicles by \ndeceptively telling them what the gas mileage was. Has the corporate \nculture in what is an automobile society shrunk so low that we can't be \nupfront when our products are defective or when we are trying to gain \ncompetitive advantage? I lay this not only on the corporate culture, I \nlay it at the feet of the U.S. regulatory agencies that ought to be \ndoing their job and ought to be doing it in a forceful way. Then there \nought to be some prosecutions, and corporate executives who knew this \nand have done it ought to be going to jail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                        Criminal Justice Reform\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, in the coming days we know that we are \ngoing to have an extraordinary visit. This is a historic occasion. We \nare going to gather both Houses of Congress to hear from Pope Francis. \nDuring his time in the United States, Pope Francis has chosen to do \nsomething that I think is extraordinary--to visit with the imprisoned.\n  In his address here, he may or may not discuss the American criminal \njustice system, but this visit alone, which speaks to something deep \nwithin the Catholic faith, deep within the Christian religion, \nreflected in Matthew 25: ``I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was \nsick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit \nme.'' This step by the Pope, to me, is an extraordinary accomplishment \nin bringing a further highlight to the challenges we have in the United \nStates with our criminal justice system.\n  The Pope has predicated his time as Pope on an ideal of mercy. His \nmotto, ``miserando atque eligendo,'' which translates to ``to be shown \nmercy and be chosen,'' to me is extraordinary. I actually believe the \nPope and what he is doing resonates not just in a religious sense with \nthe Christian faith but in the American sense with our shared \ncollective values.\n  I have taken the time to speak on the Senate floor on numerous \noccasions about our criminal justice system from many perspectives, but \non this occasion, I would like to talk about those moral values which \ndo not divide us as a nation but unite us. Those are values deep within \nthe core of our country, part of our heritage, part of our songs, our \npledges, and our words.\n  We know the criminal justice system as it stands right now has many \nissues. If it was just analyzed on an economic angle, it would be \nenough to show how this criminal justice system is out of step with who \nwe are as a people. We know that right now we in America are \nimprisoning more people than anybody else on the globe. We are the \n``incarceration nation'' when it comes to comparing ourselves with \nother global nations. We are about 5 percent of the global population \nbut 25 percent of the global prison population. One out of every four \npeople on the planet Earth who are incarcerated are in the United \nStates of America. The cost of that, from a fiscal perspective, is \nincredible.\n  We spend over a quarter of a trillion dollars every single year on \nour criminal justice system, a significant cost to American taxpayers. \nIt is estimated that between 1980 and 2004, we would have had 20 \npercent less poverty in America if not for mass incarceration. Think \nabout that for a second--the costs of poverty on our productivity. We \nknow that only about 9 percent of children who are poor are going to go \nto college. There are significant costs associated with poverty, both \nfiscal and moral. The poverty rate would be 20 percent lower if we had \nincarceration rates at the same levels as our industrial peers.\n  At a time that our roads and our bridges are crumbling, as we as a \nnation have seen ourselves having gone from having the best \ninfrastructure on the globe to now being a nation with an \ninfrastructure that is not even ranked in the top 10 globally, at a \ntime that we have seen investment go down as a percentage of our GDP, \none thing we have seen go up is our investment in the prison \ninfrastructure.\n  We know that between 1990 and 2005, a new prison opened in the United \nStates every 10 days. We have seen our prison population on a Federal \nlevel go up over the last 30 years about 800 percent. Looking at this \nfrom the fiscal perspective, we know we are digging a hole for \nourselves--self-inflicted economic wounds that are just unnecessary for \na nation of free people. Take for example a report from the Center for \nEconomic and Policy Research. They concluded that in the year 2008 \nalone, ex-offender unemployment losses to our economy were the \nequivalent of 1.5 to 1.7 million workers or $57 billion to $65 billion \nannually. In other words, when our folks come out of prison, as most \ndo, they find it so hard to reintegrate into our economy. They find it \nhard to start jobs as there are bars to employment, finding it hard to \nstart businesses as there are bars to business licenses. And that loss \nto our economy is the equivalent of about 1.6 million workers or $57 \nbillion to $65 billion annually.\n  This reality, the fiscal reality alone--before we even talk about our \nvalues as a country, before we even talk about our morals--should be \nenough for us to find greater urgency about the need to reform our \ncriminal justice system, especially because States in America are \nbeginning to show that you can save taxpayer dollars by reducing \nincarceration levels and empowering people to succeed while \nsimultaneously lowering the crime rate. This alone should be enough to \nshow that we have a broken criminal justice system that violates the \nideals of economic prudence and fiscal conservatism. We are digging an \neconomic hole for ourselves.\n\n  While the Pope will talk to us with a moral force during his visit, \nit is also important to understand that as a moral nation, the values \nwe have put forth into the world are being violated by our criminal \njustice system as well.\n  This body has been a body that has spoken with clarity on numerous \nmoral issues--from the Civil Rights Act to the Fair Housing Act--but \nnow we are seeing that we are failing to do what is necessary when it \ncomes to living up to those powerful words of equal justice under the \nlaw. It is inscribed on the Supreme Court just hundreds of yards from \nwhere I am standing right now.\n  We now know that there is no difference in drug usage and selling \nrates between African Americans, Whites, and Latinos. Yet our criminal \njustice system is incarcerating minorities in this country well \ndisproportionate to their numbers in those drug crimes.\n  Even at a time when we have had our last three Presidents admit to \nusing drugs--the last two admitted to violating the drug laws--we still \nhave a nation in which we are treating certain people differently.\n  Take, for example, that we now know that African Americans and Whites \nhave no difference for selling and using drugs, but Blacks are about \n3.7 times more likely to be arrested for a marijuana related crime. \nTake, for example, that African Americans and Whites are arrested for \nthe same crimes, and Blacks are given sentences that are about 20 \npercent longer than Whites for those similar crimes. African Americans \nare about 21 percent more likely to receive a mandatory minimum than \nWhites facing similar charges.\n  This disproportionate experience under the law has created harrowing\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\nresults within our Nation. There are more African Americans in jail, \nprison or under State or Federal supervision today than there were \nAfrican Americans enslaved in 1850.\n  Even though African Americans make up 14.7 percent of the population \nin my State of New Jersey, they make up 61 percent of the total \ncorrectional population. One in three African-American men born in 2001 \nwill go to prison during their lifetime. These numbers are astonishing, \nand in many ways they are being fueled by a criminal justice system \nthat, from arrests to sentencing, is treating African Americans harsher \nthan their White peers. This value of equal justice under the law is \nnot being fulfilled.\n  Latinos face the same challenges. Native Americans are also grossly \noverrepresented in our criminal justice system, with incarceration \nrates that are 38 percent higher than the national average. There is no \ndifference in proclivity for drug crimes among people of color, but we \nhave a system that actually punishes those who are of color in \ndifferent ways. We need to begin, as a Congress and a nation, to find \nways to have drug laws that make sense. The explosion of incarcerations \nin this country was fueled by the war on drugs, and we know that \ncertain communities are facing the harsh impact of that enforcement in \nways that other communities are not.\n  We need to reform our harsh mandatory minimum policies. For too long \nwe have taken away judicial discretion and tied the hands of sentencing \nexperts who can and should weigh other factors when it comes to making \nsentencing decisions. We need to now avoid what Congress intended--\ngiving these harsh sentences to people who are not drug kingpins or \nlarge players but often low-level offenders.\n  This idea of equal opportunity as well is something that is of value \nand is deep within our system. Unfortunately, the trends we see in our \ncriminal justice system aren't limited to adults and the treatment \nunder the law, but they are also showing that our kids as well do not \nalways face equal pathways to opportunity. Today we know that the \nnumber of children who are born to people who are incarcerated or have \nan incarcerated parent is growing astonishingly. Right now, 1 in 28 \nchildren is growing up with a parent in prison, and 1 in 9 African-\nAmerican kids, as a result of this mass incarceration \ndisproportionately hitting minority communities, is growing up with a \nparent behind bars. These kids often struggle more in school, have \nfamilies who are often poorer, and have limited opportunities of \nsuccess.\n  Over half of imprisoned parents were the primary earners for their \nchildren prior to their incarceration, and a child with an incarcerated \nfather is more likely to be suspended from school than a peer without \nan incarcerated father--23 percent compared to 4 percent. These are \nserious gulfs in opportunity being created by a broken criminal justice \nsystem. The gulfs of opportunity between young people based on race \nstart young and actually only grow with time.\n  For too many children, zero-tolerance discipline policies in schools \nacross America serve as a gateway into the criminal justice system and \na lifetime of devastating collateral consequences. And just as in the \nAmerican criminal justice system, too many young people of color in \nAmerica are falling into the trap of that school-to-prison pipeline.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil \nRights in March 2014, Black students were suspended at a rate three \ntimes greater than White students. On average, 5 percent of White \nstudents are suspended compared to 16 percent of Black students. \nStudents who have been suspended or expelled as a part of their \nschool's disciplinary policy are 3 times as likely to become involved \nin the juvenile justice system within the next year. There is evidence \nshowing that kids of different races face the harshness of those \npolicies in different ways. In other words, minority students are often \ntreated harshly while others see leniency. We need to begin to enact \ncommonsense policies that provide for equal opportunity--those \ncommonsense policies that don't lead to suspension or involvement with \npolice officers when in the past the infraction typically would have \nbeen dealt with the school internally. We need to find a system where a \nchild's one mistake does not become a lifetime sentence, where children \nare empowered to succeed and not fear a retribution that destabilizes \ntheir lives.\n\n  We also know that it is important that we begin to think: Are we a \nnation of second chances? Are we a nation where words such as \nredemption and mercy have meaning? Are we a nation that can live up to \nthese ideals where just because you fall down and stumble and make a \nmistake, you cannot be someone who can still stand up again and make \nyour way?\n  We know that every single year approximately 600,000 Americans finish \ntheir prison sentences after paying their debt to society and reenter \ntheir communities. They often find themselves unable to work, to vote, \nto get back to school or to get a loan. The collateral consequences are \nextraordinary.\n  The American Bar Association has identified over 46,000 collateral \nconsequences that impact people with criminal records. About 60 to 70 \npercent of them are employment-related. In other words, even though we \nare saying to people who have paid their debt that they now need to get \nback to work, we are actually putting up bars which prevent them from \ndoing so. They are finding it hard to get a job, get a business \nlicense, get a loan, or get a Pell grant, and if they fall and stumble, \nthey often find it hard to even get food stamps or get the social \nsafety net that often keeps people from abject desperation. These \nrealities place too many roadblocks in the way of people coming home.\n  During Pope Francis's visits to prisons, he is said to have asked \nhimself: Why did God allow that I should not be here? But for the grace \nof God.\n  In advance of his visit, I believe we should be asking ourselves: \nWhat do these ideals of mercy and redemption mean to us--this idea that \nwhen we see people who are broken by society, we should understand that \nwe should be investing in their success? It actually not only makes \nmoral sense to do so, but it makes sense to do so because we will reap \nthe economic benefit.\n  If you take, for example, Americans who are suffering from addiction, \nwe now know that $1 invested in people with addiction to get treatment \nproduces a benefit in reducing interactions with the police and \nincarceration by $4 to $7. Yet the overwhelming majority of people with \ndrug addictions do not get treatment. Not only is that fiscally \nunsound, but that makes no sense in the ideals of our morals as a \nnation, that we should help people who are broken by disease.\n  This is the point we have come to as a nation, where we know that \ndoing the morally right thing actually helps to save the dollars of our \ntaxpayers so that we can keep that in our own pockets or invest them in \nareas that we so desperately need.\n  Take, for example, a simple thing that companies around this country, \nsuch as Bed Bath & Beyond and Starbucks, are doing but we don't do in \nthe Federal Government--this commonsense idea that those who have paid \ntheir debt will be given a level playing field and a fair shot to get a \njob to prove that they are worthy of work. Some people call this Ban \nthe Box, something that 18 States have done. But here in the Federal \nGovernment, we still make people--right at the point of application--\ncheck the box and say that they have been formally incarcerated, which \nmeans, for many Americans, that it gives them 50 to 60 percent less \nchance of even getting an interview or getting an opportunity to \ndemonstrate their worth and make their case.\n  We know that simple things such as moving that time of disclosure of \na previous criminal conviction to later in the process could elevate \nthe chances of getting more people to work. And when they get to work, \nthey begin to be there for their families, their kids, our economy, and \nthey become productive, as opposed to what we have now, which over time \nis a recidivism rate--the rate at which people go back to prison--that \nis upwards of 75 percent, costing us again billions of dollars as \ntaxpayers.\n  This system is broken. It makes no economic sense, but more \nimportantly, it violates our ideals as a nation of equal justice under \nthe law, the ideal of\n\n[[Page S6880]]\n\nhaving a second chance in our country, and the ideal of equal \nopportunity for all.\n  We must now embrace the urgency of the moment. To have a wasteful \nsystem that is broken, that further harms and injures people with \nillnesses--whether it be mental health disorder or an addiction--that \naggravates them with practices such as putting children in solitary \nconfinement--all of these things violate our principals as a nation, \nand it is time for us to join together and embrace change.\n  I feel honored that right now in this country there is an emerging \nbipartisan and nonpartisan coalition around criminal justice reform. We \nsee people from all across the political perspective approaching it \nfrom different perspectives--from Christian Evangelicals to fiscal \nconservatives to civil libertarians to civil rights activists--all \nbeginning to say the system is morally bankrupt. It is bankrupting \nStates and our Nation. It is a violation of who we are as a country, \nand it just makes no sense.\n  It was James Baldwin who once said:\n\n       There is never time in the future in which we will work out \n     our salvation. The challenge is in the moment; the time is \n     always now.\n\n  With this visit from the Pope and his further spotlighting our \ncriminal justice system, let us find that moral urgency in our Nation. \nLet us find the grit that we have shown in the past for overcoming \ninjustice. Let us join together and begin with even more urgency to do \nthe hard work of correcting the ills within our criminal justice \nsystem, of fixing what is broken, and making right in America that \nwhich we hold so dear--that we are a nation indeed with liberty and \njustice for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, has been waiting, and so I will be very quick with the \nstatement that I am going to give.\n\n\n                        Remembering Jim Santini\n\n  Mr. President, today Nevada lost a historic figure. This morning \nformer U.S. Congressman Jim Santini of Nevada passed away. He was a \nremarkably good person--a tremendous person who understood Nevada so \nwell.\n  He was a native Nevadan, born in Reno. He came from a real heritage \nthat caused him to love his State of Nevada. His grandfather, Walter E. \nClark, was the longest serving president at the University of Nevada. \nHis uncle is a famous writer--a really celebrated author--Walter Van \nTillburg Clark. It has been a long time, but what a great writer. His \nmost famous work was ``The Ox-Bow Incident.'' I read it again a few \nyears ago. It was made into a movie, which I watched again. It was \nconsidered by most to be the most--actually, the first modern Western \nnovel.\n\n  So Jim Santini breathed what Nevada was all about. He knew the State \nextremely well. He graduated from the University of Nevada--the same \nschool where his grandfather was the president. He became close friends \nwith former Senator Richard Bryan of Nevada, a two-term Governor and a \nstriking figure in his own right. They were inseparable friends. They \nwere in college together. They went to the same law school--Hastings \nLaw School in San Francisco.\n  Jim graduated from law school in 1962. He immediately decided he \nwould serve his country, and for 3 years he served in the U.S. Army. \nHis service to his State and country spans many decades.\n  His good friend Richard Bryan convinced him that he should move from \nReno. The growth in the State was in the southern part of the State, \nthe Las Vegas area. Jim--in some respects reluctantly--moved from his \nroots to southern Nevada, where he excelled. He worked as a deputy \ndistrict attorney. After the first public defender in the State of \nNevada decided to run for public office, he was replaced--that is \nRichard Bryan, the first public defender in Clark County--he was \nreplaced with his good friend Jim Santini, who became a public \ndefender.\n  It was a short time thereafter that he was elected justice of the \npeace of Las Vegas. During this period of time, the role of the justice \nof the peace changed. It became more of a judicial officer rather than \nsomeone who became fabulously wealthy by marrying hundreds and hundreds \nof people. That is the way it used to be. He did a very good job as \njustice of the peace. He was so impressive that the Governor of the \nState of Nevada, Mike O'Callaghan, appointed him to serve as a Nevada \ndistrict court judge representing Clark County.\n  In 1972 Jim ran for Nevada's at-large congressional seat. From 1864, \nwhen Nevada became a State, until 1982, Nevada only had one \nCongressman, one Member of Congress, and it was an at-large seat. And \nwhen Jim ran for that in 1972, he ran against Republican incumbent \nDavid Towell, who just 2 years before was in a race with Congressman \nWalter S. Baring, who served in Congress for some 22 years representing \nNevada's at-large congressional seat and who was defeated in the \nprimary. But David Towell came from nowhere and beat the Democrat in \nthat case. Santini came right back, and David Towell was a one-term \nCongressman.\n  Jim represented the State of Nevada in Congress very honorably for \nfour terms. He was well respected, well regarded, and very popular in \nthe State of Nevada. However, in 1982 Jim decided to run for the \nSenate, and he was not successful. In 1986 he ran for the Senate again. \nI was his opponent. It was a relatively close race, but when that race \nwas over, it was over. I knew Jim before he and I became opponents. We \nworked together on many different projects. We never had a cross word. \nTo this day we never had a cross word.\n  Jim became a counsel--a lawyer--and a lobbyist for America's tourism \nand travel industry. He worked to bring tourists to the United States \nand to the State of Nevada, and he did it very admirably and very well.\n  Jim Santini had a wonderful wife, Ann Santini. She has quite a career \nin her own right. She is the director of international affairs for the \nLDS Church here in Washington, DC. They have four children: Lisa, Lori, \nMark, and J.D. They have 11 grandchildren.\n  Before leaving Jim Santini, we have to speak about his uniqueness. \nHere is a man who had--there may be someone who has a better arrowhead \ncollection than Jim Santini; I just don't know who it would be. He \nspent many decades--a lot of the time in Nevada but around the \ncountry--collecting arrowheads. He had a great collection of \narrowheads. He also collected Indian baskets, and in Nevada we had \nprobably the most famous basket weaver in the history of the country, a \nwoman by the name of Dat So La Lee. She is really a very famous woman. \nMany of her baskets are worth over $1 million. She made baskets this \nbig--woven, of course, by hand--and baskets this large. Jim collected \nbaskets. I don't know how many he wound up having of Dat So La Lee's, \nbut I am sure he had some.\n  It is with a great deal of sadness that I report to my friends in \nNevada and the friends Jim had here in Washington that Jim passed away \nthis morning. I said that earlier. I will miss him. He and I exchanged \nletters right after the first of the year, right after I got hurt, \ninjured my eye. He always was a kind, gracious man, and I will miss him \nvery much, as will everyone in Nevada and his friends here in \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                              Papal Visit\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am delighted that Pope Francis will be \naddressing a joint session of Congress on Thursday.\n  The Pope has played, in my view, an extraordinary role since he \nassumed his position in speaking out with courage and brilliance about \nsome of the most important issues facing our world. From the moment he \nwas elected, he immediately let it be known that he would be a \ndifferent kind of Pope, a different kind of religious leader. In \nchoosing his Papal name--Francis--he said:\n\n       Francis of Assisi. For me, he is the man of poverty, the \n     man of peace, the man who loves and protects creation.\n\n  What I want to do in a short period of time is read some of the very \nprofound and important statements Pope Francis has made over the last \nseveral years. They are incisive, they are courageous, and they speak \nto a world in trouble that needs the kind of leadership that he is \nproviding.\n\n[[Page S6881]]\n\n  Let me quote from a number of the statements he has made.\n  Quote:\n\n       While the income of a minority is increasing exponentially, \n     that of the majority is crumbling. This imbalance results \n     from ideologies which uphold the absolute autonomy of markets \n     and financial speculation, and thus deny the right of control \n     to States, which are themselves charged with providing for \n     the common good.\n\n  Obviously, he is not talking about the United States; he is talking \nabout the global economy. But certainly in our country, when he talks \nabout the income of the minority increasing exponentially and that of \nthe majority crumbling, he is, of course, right. We have right now in \nour country the top one-tenth of 1 percent owning almost as much wealth \nas the bottom 90 percent. We have about 58 percent of all new income \nbeing created now going to the top 1 percent. In the last several \nyears, we have seen the 14 wealthiest people in America increase their \nwealth by $156 billion, and that increase in wealth is more wealth than \nis owned by the bottom 40 percent of the American people.\n  As the Pope points out, this is not by any means just an American \nissue; this is a global issue. We are moving toward a period where very \nshortly the top 1 percent of the people on the planet will own more \nwealth than the bottom 99 percent. To me, that is immoral, that is \nwrong, that is unsustainable, and I am glad the Pope has raised that \nissue.\n  He talks about another issue which is even more profound. It is one \nthing to talk about income and wealth inequality, and it is another \nthing to talk about poverty.\n  Here, he says:\n\n       We have created new idols. The worship of the golden calf \n     of old has found a new and heartless image in the cult of \n     money and the dictatorship of an economy which is faceless \n     and lacking any truly humane goal.\n\n  ``The worship of the golden calf of old has found a new and heartless \nimage in the cult of money.'' What does that mean? Well, I take it to \nmean that we are living in a society which turns its back on people who \nwork hard, decent people, people who are good parents, but yet we \nworship those people who for whatever reason--sometimes honestly and \nwith creativity, sometimes dishonestly and illegally--have become \nmillionaires and billionaires. Those are the people we worship. The \nmore money they make, the more they get worshipped. I think the Pope is \nright in saying that is not something we should be doing.\n  In another statement, which is certainly relevant for a lot of the \ndiscussions we have here on the floor of the Senate, he said:\n\n       In this context, some people continue to defend trickle-\n     down theories which assume that economic growth, encouraged \n     by a free market, will inevitably succeed in bringing about \n     greater justice and inclusiveness in the world. This opinion, \n     which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a \n     crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding \n     economic power and in the sacralized workings of the \n     prevailing economic system.\n\n  What is he talking about? He is talking about a lot of what has gone \non here in this country for many decades. There is a theory, which the \nPope is right in saying has never been confirmed by the facts--quite \nthe contrary--that if we give huge tax breaks to billionaires and large \ncorporations, somehow that money will trickle down to the middle class \nand working class. Well, that theory has not proved to be true. Under \ntrickle-down economics, the rich get richer and virtually everybody \nelse gets poorer. I think the Pope is quite right in making that point.\n  Let me again quote the Pope. This is what he said:\n\n       Man is not in charge today, money is in charge. Money \n     rules.\n\n  Money rules. Well, 5 years ago the U.S. Supreme Court by a 5-to-4 \ndecision passed the disastrous Citizens United decision which basically \nsaid to the wealthiest people in this country: You already own much of \nthe economy; now we are going to give you the opportunity to buy the \nUnited States Government. And that is exactly what they are now \nattempting to do. Money rules. You have one family--the Koch brothers--\nwho will spend $900 million in this election cycle to elect candidates \nwho will protect the wealthy and powerful. That is more money than will \nbe spent by either the Democratic or Republican Party. When one family \nis spending more money than either of the two major political parties, \nI think it is an example of what the Pope is talking about when he says \n``money rules.''\n\n  Money does rule, and that is why, in my view, we have to overturn \nCitizens United and move to the public funding of elections--so the \nwealthy and the powerful will not be able to buy elections.\n  He also said something very interesting about the media. This is what \nhe said:\n\n       These things become the norm: that some homeless people die \n     of cold on the streets is not news. In contrast, a ten point \n     drop on the stock markets of some cities is a tragedy.\n\n  Well, what is news? Is he right? We talk about the stock market going \nup, the stock market going up. It is big news. The 45 million Americans \nliving in poverty--I don't hear much discussion about that. There are \nthousands of people dying every single year because they don't have \nhealth insurance and can't get to a doctor when they need to. That \nain't big news--not big news at all. I think it is an interesting point \nabout what constitutes news, and I think the Pope makes a very good \npoint in that regard.\n  Let me give another quote:\n\n       It is a well-known fact that current levels of production \n     are sufficient, yet millions of people are still suffering \n     and dying of starvation. This, dear friends, is truly \n     scandalous.\n\n  I think what the Pope is talking about is that in a world where we \nhave enormous productive capability--industrial, agricultural--we have \na situation where children die of diseases that are preventable all \nover the world, where people go hungry all over the world. Yet, as he \nsays, our current levels of production are sufficient. We are producing \nenough to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to provide what people \nneed, and yet we have an economy which works day after day to make \nbillionaires richer and turns its back on desperate people all over the \nworld.\n  Let me end with this quote:\n\n       Today everything comes under the laws of competition and \n     the survival of the fittest, where the powerful feed upon the \n     powerless. As a consequence, masses of people find themselves \n     excluded and marginalized: without work, without \n     possibilities, without any means of escape.\n\n  That is certainly true in the United States. It is certainly truer \nall over the world. We are living in a world of the survival of the \nfittest. If you are poor, if you are unemployed, if you are hungry, \ngovernment turns its back on you. But if you are rich, if you are \npowerful, if you can make campaign contributions of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, we love you, we welcome you, and we need you more \nand more.\n  I think during this week where we welcome the Pope to Washington, DC, \nI would hope that some of my colleagues would examine the very profound \nlessons he is teaching people all over this world.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wicker pertaining to the introduction of S. 2067 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Barrasso). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important \nissue. It is a fundamental constitutional issue for this body and part \nof our duty in the Senate and the Congress; that is, to ensure next \nweek the funding for the government which expires at the end of the \nmonth. With only 1 week until the current government funding runs out, \nit is our responsibility to work together to make sure that the \ngovernment keeps running, that we do not disrupt people's lives, that \nwe do not end up spending more money because we shut the government \ndown to reopen it, and that we provide certainty with all of the \nchallenges we face at home and, of course, the threats we face abroad.\n  An issue has come up that is a very important issue, and that is an \norganization called Planned Parenthood and holding Planned Parenthood \naccountable in the wake of deeply disturbing videos that discuss the \nappalling practice of harvesting the organs and body parts of unborn \nbabies.\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\n  Like Americans across all political spectrums, I was just sick--sick \nto see the contents of recent videos that have been disclosed that show \na callous disregard by officials at Planned Parenthood for the dignity \nof human life. These videos have shocked the conscience of people \nacross our country because this organization does receive taxpayer \nfunding. I understand why we have had an important debate in this body \nabout redirecting this funding because of Planned Parenthood's actions \nand fully investigating what was revealed in these disturbing videos \nthat show the practice of the harvesting of organs and body parts of \nunborn babies.\n  So I support the efforts of the Judiciary Committee to investigate \nthese disturbing videos. I also do not believe it is appropriate that \ntaxpayer funds should be used to fund a private organization that \nperforms hundreds of thousands of abortions each year and that engages \nin the horrific practices that were shown in these videos.\n  That is why last month I joined a bipartisan majority of Senators in \nvoting to redirect Federal funding from Planned Parenthood to community \nhealth centers that provide women's health services, including \nmammograms, cancer screenings, and contraceptives. In New Hampshire \nthere are more than 30 community health centers, compared to 5 Planned \nParenthood clinics.\n  But when we had this debate and vote on the Senate floor, we received \nonly 53 votes in favor of redirecting this money from Planned \nParenthood to community health centers which provide women's health \nservices, falling well short of the 60-vote threshold required to \nadvance this legislation in the Senate. Yet despite already having had \na vote on this, which failed the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, there \nare some that are pushing to attach this issue to the funding of the \ngovernment, even though when we had the vote here, we did not have the \nvotes to get it passed in the Senate, and even though the President \nhimself has explicitly said he would veto any bill that prohibits \nfunding for Planned Parenthood or redirects that funding to community \nhealth centers.\n  In fact, the President is so dug in on funding for Planned Parenthood \nthat he is prepared to let the government shut down over it. And those \nwho are pushing the strategy, saying we should go forward with it \nanyway--they have not explained how we would obtain 67 votes in the \nSenate.\n  When we had the vote on it, we only got 53, not even enough to \nadvance the legislation in the Senate, which requires 60. The President \ncertainly knows that we do not have 67 votes in the Senate to override \nhis veto. Nevertheless, those who are pushing the strategy to attach \nthis to the government funding bill--this issue of redirecting the \nfunding--also know that there are not 60 votes in the Senate, never \nmind 67 to override a Presidential veto. So the result is that if we \npassed the bill, even if we could get the 60 votes, the President is \nsure to veto it, and the 67 votes are not there to override his veto.\n  In the end, we are heading for an imminent government shutdown if \nthis is not resolved. Everyone who looks at this issue knows the \nreality of where the votes lie. In fact, those on my side of the aisle \nwho have been pushing the strategy of pass the bill, send it to the \nPresident for his veto, I have asked them the question: Let's assume we \nget the 60 votes to do that; first of all, how do we get those 60 \nvotes? I have not received an answer to that question. Then I have \nasked the next question: Even if we could get those 60 votes to pass it \nout of the Senate and to send this to the President's desk with a \ngovernment funding bill that redirects the money to Planned Parenthood \nover his opposition and he vetoes it, where do the 67 votes come from? \nI have not received an answer to that.\n  So I am here on the floor today to say: I am tired of the political \ngames. I am tired of the President's game on this, that he is so dug in \non this issue that he would be willing to let the government shut down. \nI am tired of the people on my side of the aisle who are pushing this \nstrategy even though they know they do not have the votes to have it \npass the Senate, and they certainly don't have the votes to override a \nPresidential veto, so, therefore, they cannot answer the question: What \nis the end game for success here, even if you feel as passionately \nabout these issues as we all do?\n  So here we are again with the political posturing on both sides. I \ndon't want to play this game anymore. I think it is too important that \nwe not relive the movie of where we were in 2013 when the government \nshut down because I asked the very same question then, when the issue \nwas defunding ObamaCare. I asked the question: How does this end? How \ndoes it end successfully to defund ObamaCare? How does it end without \nshutting down the government? I never received an answer then, and I \nhave not received an answer now from those who are pushing this \nstrategy.\n  We saw the movie in 2013. I do not think we should relive that movie. \nLet's remember what happened. When you shut the government down and you \nreopen it, it actually costs us more money. So if you care about the \nfiscal state of the country, let's not waste money shutting down the \ngovernment with no results. You think about the economy and the \ndisruption in people's lives. I remember my constituents calling me on \nthe phone, because I was answering my phones. I remember people who \nsaved for years for a family vacation to our national parks and could \nnot participate in that family vacation and lost the money they had \nsunk into it for years in their savings for their big family vacation \nbecause people were pushing to keep the government shut down, even \nthough they had no strategy for achieving a result on it.\n\n  I remember the uncertainty and the hardship for working families and \nour military. Even though we keep our national security piece open \nduring a government shutdown, there is so much uncertainty about whom \nthat covers and whom it doesn't. When we look at the threats we are \nfacing around the world right now, we do not need uncertainty when it \ncomes to those who keep us safe at home on the law enforcement end, on \nour intel, on our military, and all the civilian workforce that \nsupports them and makes sure they can do their job every single day.\n  The bottom line is, in 2013 we did not get a result, the funding for \nObamaCare continued, the government was shut down, it cost us more \nmoney and disruption. We never got an answer then for how that would \nend successfully. Here we find ourselves again, the same group of \npeople pushing the same strategy on the Planned Parenthood issue, \nsaying we should shut the government down again, even though they \ncannot answer the question: How do we get to 60 votes? How do we get to \n67 votes so that you can actually achieve a result here? I think the \nanswer is that they don't know the answer, because we all know where \nthe votes are. It is not going to happen.\n  So I am here on the floor because I feel strongly. I agree with the \nNational Right to Life on this. In a recent op-ed, the National Right \nto Life rightly points out that pursuing this shutdown strategy could \nactually undermine efforts to hold Planned Parenthood accountable, \nprimarily by shifting public attention in the political blame game that \nwould result inevitably from the shutdown. The National Right to Life \nalso cited a study by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nwhich found that the majority of Federal funds flowing to Planned \nParenthood would not even be temporarily interrupted if the government \nshut down because the funds flow from mandatory spending programs like \nMedicaid rather than the congressional funding process, which is the \ndiscretionary spending piece impacted by what we will vote on regarding \nthe continuing resolution.\n  Again, this was the same issue that actually came up in 2013 when it \ncame to the tactics of trying to defund ObamaCare without a strategy \nfor success. Right now we are playing a game of chicken. It is a \ndangerous game. We already know as we stand here where the votes are \nand what it takes to keep the government open. Yet, as I understand it, \nwe are going to be taking another vote on Thursday so we can show the \nproponents of those who are again seeking to attach the Planned \nParenthood redirecting-of-funding issue to the government funding bill \nthat, guess what, we already know the answer to this. We don't have the \nvotes. We are not going to get to 60 in the Senate, never mind the 67 \nit would take to override a Presidential veto.\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\n  So we all know what it is going to take to keep the government open. \nI think we should have that vote now, instead of continuing to have the \npolitical show votes that show the people where we know the votes \nalready are on this issue. That means a clean funding bill now, so that \nwe are not wasting time, so that we are not bringing ourselves closer \nto the brink of a shutdown.\n  So in good conscience, while I fully support redirecting the money \nfrom Planned Parenthood to community health centers who serve women, I \ncannot in good conscience participate again in this process, one that \nwould ensure we come closer to the brink of a shutdown, when I have not \nheard a strategy for success.\n  I think the American people are owed an answer to the question: What \nis your strategy of success if you are threatening to shut down the \ngovernment? I would ask the same of President Obama: If this is such an \nimportant issue to you that you are willing also to participate in this \nexercise of threatening a shutdown, is it that important to you given \nthat the money can be redirected to community health centers that \nprovide services to women?\n  That said, it is time to quit the games on both sides of the aisle. I \ncame here to solve problems. That means we need to address this issue \nnow. We should have the vote on the clean funding bill now. We should \nmake sure we keep the government running, given the challenges we are \nfacing at home and abroad, so that we do not have shutdown 2 and relive \nthe movie we saw in 2013, and that was not a good one for the country.\n\n  I hope we will take the vote right now instead of continuing to play \npolitical games on both sides of the aisle while the clock ticks down. \nThis is a very important issue for our country, and I am prepared right \nnow to vote for a bill that will keep the government funded.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Oil Export Ban\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, last week a bipartisan majority of \nSenators--Members of this body--voted to try to stop President Obama's \ndangerous and desperate deal with Iran--that is right, dangerous and \ndesperate.\n  The President wants to give Iran relief from the economic sanctions \nthe world imposed. I believe President Obama traded away these \nsanctions too readily and he got too little in return. These sanctions \nincluded limits on the sale of Iranian oil. According to one estimate, \nIran could soon begin to export as many as 1 million additional barrels \nof oil each and every day. I know the money Iran makes from these sales \nwill go to shoring up its economy, and it will go to building up Iran's \nmilitary. Some of it will undoubtedly go to supporting global \nterrorists. That is what President Obama traded away. Iran will be \nallowed to sell its oil anywhere in the world, yet American oil \nproducers are largely prohibited from selling American oil anywhere in \nthe world. Apparently, that is exactly the way the White House wants to \nkeep things.\n  There is legislation working its way through Congress right now to \nlift the ban on American crude oil exports. The Obama administration \nhas said it doesn't support the bill. There is bipartisan support of \nthe bill but not this White House--oh no. They think Congress shouldn't \neven get to decide. They think it should be up to Washington \nbureaucrats in the Obama administration to make the decisions. The \nadministration thinks they are the only ones who should be allowed to \ndecide whether the oil export ban gets lifted.\n  It was the Obama administration that let Iran off the hook by signing \nsuch a terrible deal. It is the Obama administration that now wants to \nlift the sanctions and give Iran access to more than $100 billion. \nShould the Obama administration be the one to decide whether Iran gets \nto sell its oil without American competition? Is that what the \nPresident wants? Why is the Obama administration so interested in \nmaking sure Iran's economy gets back on its feet faster?\n  The President ought to be focused on helping America's economy, not \nIran's economy. Right now American producers export about 500,000 \nbarrels of oil a day. Where does it go? It goes to Canada. Iran is \nexporting about 1 million barrels a day. But once President Obama lifts \nthe sanctions, that number is going to jump to almost 2 million barrels \na day--2 million barrels a day. So President Obama favors a situation \nwhere Iran will be allowed to export four times as much oil as America \ndoes--four times as much. That is what the President is in favor of. \nAnd Senate Democrats who voted to help the President lift the sanctions \nwant the same thing. That is what they say, 4 to 1--Iran over the \nUnited States.\n  Republicans want something very different. If the export ban is \nlifted, U.S. energy producers could export another 1.6 million barrels \na day. Our daily oil exports would jump from half a million barrels to \nabout 2 million barrels. That is what we want, to lift the sanctions. \nAt the same time, Republicans voted to keep the sanctions in place \nagainst Iran. So under Republican plans, America would be exporting \ntwice as much oil as Iran.\n  The Democrats vote four for Iran, one for the United States, and \nRepublicans voted two for the United States, one for Iran. That is the \ndifference between what Washington Democrats want and what Senate \nRepublicans want.\n  The Brookings Institution looked at this in September of 2014. They \ncame out with a report. They looked at a variety of different scenarios \nfor how much oil America might export. They found that for every \nscenario they looked at, ``there are positive gains for U.S. \nhouseholds,'' with the United States being able to export more crude \noil. The Government Accountability Office said the same thing last \nyear. It said that ``removing export restrictions is expected to \nincrease the size of the economy''--that is the U.S. economy--``with \nimplications for employment, investment, public revenue and trade.''\n  Those are key for America.\n  These studies and others predict that adding American crude oil to \nglobal supplies could ultimately reduce gasoline prices right here at \nhome. By how much, you ask? Well, one study estimated it would save \nAmerican consumers a combined average of almost $6 billion per year. \nThis study found the savings would help increase the U.S. economy by \nabout $38 billion by 2020. New oil exports could support an additional \n300,000 jobs by 2020.\n  These are huge benefits for the American economy, for American \nfamilies--all because we free up American energy and we allow it to \ncompete in the world's markets.\n  There would also be benefits for America's foreign policy. More oil \nwould reduce prices worldwide. That means the other countries that \nexport a lot of oil won't be able to make as much money off of their \nown oil sales. They would have to compete with us. This includes Iran. \nIt includes countries such as Russia and Venezuela that use the wealth \nfrom their energy sales to pilot their own economies and not for the \ngood.\n  New oil exports would undercut the ability of those countries to do \nthings that are not in America's best interest. It would also help \nAmerican allies around the world. Poland gets 96 percent of its oil \nfrom Russia. When they are negotiating to buy more oil, they would \nlove--love--the opportunity and the option of American oil as an \nalternative. Belgium gets 60 percent of its oil from Russia and Saudi \nArabia. Japan gets 75 percent of its oil from Russia and the Middle \nEast. All of these countries and many more around the world could \nbenefit from U.S. oil being sold on the world market.\n  Of course, another country that would really be helped is Israel. \nPresident Obama's reckless deal with Iran has put Israel in a much more \ndangerous situation. Even the White House seems to recognize this. The \nObama administration says that it plans to offer Israel more military \naid--aid to be used to bolster Israel's defenses against Iran. But the \nadministration should not stop at military aid; it should also\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n\noffer Israel the opportunity to import American oil. Israel has trouble \nbuying oil from many of its neighboring countries because they do not \nrecognize the State of Israel. That leaves places such as Russia and \nIraqi Kurdistan as its largest suppliers of crude oil.\n  If the Israelis had the opportunity to buy from American oil \nproducers instead, that would be a big help in making sure their oil \nsupply is stable and secure. It would also help repair some of the \nsignificant damage the President's Iran deal did to the relations \nbetween our two countries.\n  This should be an easy call. Ending the ban on U.S. oil exports would \nbe good for American families, good for our national security, and good \nfor our allies. The Obama administration should change course now. The \nObama administration should work with Congress to end this ban on \nAmerican energy exports as quickly as possible.\n  This past Saturday marked 7 years since a Canadian company filed its \napplication to build the Keystone KL Pipeline--7 years. It has been \nburied in the bureaucratic limbo of the State Department ever since. \nThat pipeline would provide American jobs just as more oil exports \nwould. Americans should not have to wait another 7 years for Washington \nto lift the oil export ban and unleash the power of American energy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n             Climate Change and Nonprofit Energy Efficiency\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I rise today to talk about a critical \nissue that I think the Pope's arrival today in Washington really \nhighlights, and I am hopeful we will be addressing it in this Chamber.\n  I wanted to join Senator Whitehouse yesterday. He has been an \nunwavering voice on the need for Congress to take legislative action to \naddress climate change. He hit a milestone in May of this year by \ngiving his 100th speech on the floor calling on his colleagues to act \non climate change. He has also brought together a group of Senators to \nform a climate action task force, and I am proud to be a member of the \ngroup.\n  I believe we need a strong energy agenda for America, one that \nrecognizes the challenges of climate change and that empowers people to \nbe part of the solution.\n  The Pope has called climate change ``one of the principal challenges \nfacing humanity in our day.'' He has gained international attention for \nhis commitment to protecting our world and serving those in need. \nThursday, when we have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear from \nthe Pope as he addresses Congress, I anticipate he will call on all \nAmericans to come together to tackle many challenges, but among them is \nclimate change.\n  During my time in the Senate, we have made some progress on this \nissue. In 2008 we took action to raise gas mileage standards for cars \nfor the first time in decades. We have also made energy efficiency \nimprovements for consumer goods and have maintained tax credits for \nenergy-efficient products and renewable sources. We passed farm bills \nin 2008 and again in 2014 with a large number of conservation, \nenvironment, and energy groups strongly supporting them. As a member of \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I have ensured \nthat the energy title promoted investment in the next generation of \nbiofuels crops, which are important renewable sources of energy. \nEarlier this year, we passed the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act of \n2015, bipartisan legislation sponsored by Senators Portman and Shaheen. \nIt included the Water Heater Efficiency Act, which I worked on with \nSenator Hoeven. This bipartisan measure enabled rural electric co-ops \nto optimize their energy management through continued use of energy-\nefficient water heaters. It also included measures to encourage energy \nefficiency practices in office spaces. These achievements are thanks to \na combination of many factors. It continues to be the case that we need \nbipartisanship to move sound energy policy forward. And while we have \ntaken some action, there is so much more to be done.\n  This summer, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed a \nbipartisan, comprehensive energy bill. I commend Chairwoman Murkowski \nfor her tireless efforts and Senator Cantwell for her introduction \ntoday of the Energy bill--a bill I am a sponsor of--which sets a bar on \ncomprehensive energy policy reform that would aggressively move our \ncountry forward in addressing climate change. Both of these pieces of \nlegislation include the bill I have with Senator Hoeven, the Nonprofit \nEnergy Efficiency Act, which would allow the nonprofit community to \nsave energy and money through a retrofit program.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have worked to find innovative \nsolutions that move us forward. One example is this bill. Our bill \nempowers the nonprofit and faith communities to make energy efficiency \nimprovements. It would help both our environment and our local \ncommunities by ensuring nonprofit organizations can benefit from \npolicies that promote greater energy savings and efficiencies.\n  Whether feeding the hungry, helping the sick, or mentoring youth, my \nState's nearly 7,000 nonprofit organizations work hard every day to \nmake a difference in people's lives. Nonprofit organizations are at the \nheart of our country and serve millions of Americans every day. Houses \nof worship, hospitals, schools, youth centers, and other not-for-profit \nentities provide critical services and assistance to communities across \nthe country, but like businesses they must count their pennies and \noperate on a budget. Right now, nonprofit organizations--which, by the \nway, are often in very old buildings, including churches, synagogues, \nmosques--cannot benefit from any of the energy efficiency programs \navailable to regular businesses because these programs are provided in \nthe form of tax credits, and because nonprofits are tax exempt they \ncan't get these credits. That often leaves nonprofits with a difficult \nchoice. They can either invest in energy efficiency projects or they \ncan dedicate their very scarce resources to providing valuable \nresources to the community, but we know investing in energy efficiency \nimprovements today can lead to savings over time that go beyond the \ncost of the initial investment. So our nonprofits find themselves \nasking this question: Should we help fewer people for a year or two in \norder to replace our heating system and then use the long-term savings \nto serve our community well into the future? That is not a choice they \nshould have to make.\n\n  Our bill provides $10 million each year for the next 5 years to \ncreate a pilot program at the U.S. Department of Energy that would help \nlocal nonprofit organizations make their buildings more energy \nefficient. The grants would promote energy efficiency in savings by \nhelping to upgrade and retrofit old buildings as well as installing \nrenewable energy generators and heaters. We worked to ensure that the \ngrants will achieve a significant amount of energy savings and are done \nin a cost-effective manner. The grants would require a 50-percent match \nso that there is complete buy-in from nonprofits. This will be \nespecially valuable to the many nonprofit organizations that work from \nolder, less energy-efficient buildings.\n  We are taking a fiscally responsible approach. Our amendment is fully \noffset. We have support from both sides of the aisle with not just \nSenator Hoeven and myself but Senators Stabenow, Risch, Schatz, Blunt, \nMikulski, Whitehouse, and Udall. I am proud to say we have the support \nof many religious organizations and nonprofits, including the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops that has been a leading supporter of our \nefforts. They say the bill would enable them to reduce their operating \ncosts, lessen impact on their environment, and bolster America's energy \nindependence.\n  The bill is now part of both the Energy Policy Modernization Act that \nrecently passed in a bipartisan manner out of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, and it is also part of the bill Senator Cantwell \nintroduced this morning. Although Senators may differ on the specific \ndetails of these two energy plans, I believe we can find broad \nagreement that energy efficiency must be a part of any energy plan. \nEnergy efficiency is an issue we should be able to find common ground \non. It is good for the economy, good for consumers, and good for the \nenvironment.\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\n  I urge my fellow Senators to work together to keep taking real steps \nforward on meaningful energy legislation that does something about \nclimate change.\n  As we prepare to welcome Pope Francis to this Congress, it is time to \npass legislation that will help nonprofits continue to serve our \ncommunities and conserve our natural resources for generations to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I rise to reiterate the importance of \nproviding necessary resources to our men and women in uniform.\n  We are rapidly approaching the end of the fiscal year, and there are \nmany major issues awaiting thoughtful consideration and action by \nCongress. There is one item on our to-do list that should have already \nbeen checked off; that is, fully funding our national security. That is \nwhy I am very disappointed that once again efforts to advance the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act were halted today by my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle.\n  Congress's first priority is, and should be, the defense of our \nNation. We should not be hindered by political games in meeting that \ncore duty that we have. The world is a dangerous place. It is not \ngetting any safer. We cannot afford to be complacent about these \nthreats. Our Nation faces challenges from nation states and asymmetric \nthreats. These threats span the globe.\n  In Asia, Chinese behavior in the South China Sea threatens the \nlongstanding freedom of navigation and our ability to operate on the \nhigh seas. Continuing China's pattern of increasing antagonism, a \nsenior Chinese admiral recently declared that the entire South China \nSea belongs to China. China's increasing military power, bullying of \nits neighbors, expansionist policies, and rejection of international \nnorms threatens to upend the stability of that region. Simply put, \nChina's behavior has dramatic consequences for the interests of the \nUnited States and our allies. The Asia-Pacific region will continue to \ngrow in importance to the global economy. The ability of our military \nto operate freely in the Pacific is a key component to our national \ndefense strategy and our economic security. We must vote to provide the \nnecessary resources to address this challenge.\n  Additionally, the violence in Syria and Iraq continues to grow. This \ninstability has created a vacuum in which terrorist groups like ISIL \ncontinue to operate. Its actions threaten the security of the United \nStates and its allies in the region as well as basic human rights and \nreligious freedom.\n  These challenges are far from the only threats that are facing our \nNation. We still have thousands of servicemembers deployed in \nAfghanistan. What is more, regional conflicts in Yemen and Libya \njeopardize U.S. interests. The same is true of the growing number of \nterrorist groups from the Sinai Peninsula to West Africa.\n  Congress must ensure that our Nation's military has the necessary \nresources to protect the United States and to meet our commitments to \nour allies. As the character of these threats changes between the \nconventional, the unconventional, and the unknown, failure to \nappropriate defense resources is a threat in itself to our defense \nstrategy.\n  As a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have heard our \nNation's highest military officers repeatedly testify on a wide array \nof threats to our national security. For example, in his testimony to \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on July 29, Secretary of Defense \nAsh Carter highlighted the threat that is posed by Iran. Beyond its \nnuclear program, Iran's support for proxies like Hezbollah and the \nAssad regime, its hostility toward our ally Israel, and its \ncontribution to the ongoing violence in Yemen--they all present very \nserious threats to the interests of the United States.\n  Additionally, referring to the nuclear deal President Obama has \nsigned with Iran, Secretary Carter said the deal places ``no \nlimitations on what the Department of Defense can and will do to pursue \nour defense strategy in the region''--``no limitations on what the \nDepartment of Defense can and will do.''\n  For the Department of Defense to operate robustly and swiftly and \nwithout limitation requires funding of its people, programs, equipment, \nsupplies, and research and development. Yet with an array of dangers \nfacing our Nation, the Commander in Chief of our military has stated he \nwill veto defense spending unless it is accompanied by an increase in \nnondefense spending.\n  To be clear, this appropriations bill would provide the President \nwith the funding he asked for in his budget request. A strong \nbipartisan majority in this body has already voted that we must provide \nour military men and women with the resources they need to protect this \ncountry. In June of this year, the Senate voted 71 to 25 and said we \nmust authorize spending at a level similar to what is contained in the \nDefense appropriations bill, but when it comes to actually \nappropriating the necessary resources by stepping up and voting to \nsupply our military servicemembers with the resources they need to \naccomplish the missions they are given, the minority party objects \nbecause they contend that nondefense spending is insufficient.\n  I fundamentally disagree with this view. All government spending is \nnot created equal. Resources that support our soldiers should not be \nheld up for any reason--least of all in an attempt to increase spending \non various objectives that are championed by the EPA or the IRS.\n  For the first time in 6 years, the Senate Appropriations Committee \nhas sent all 12 appropriations bills to the floor. That is a positive \nstep. That is a good thing, but unfortunately, despite their support in \ncommittee, my friends on the other side of the aisle have blocked them \non this floor.\n  So now we find ourselves once again at the brink. Once again, we are \nveering toward a crisis. We can and we must do better to responsibly \ngovern. That starts with providing for our common defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, today Pope Francis arrives in \nWashington. In 2 days, he will be speaking to a joint meeting of \nCongress, where he will undoubtedly remind us all to remember what he \nhas termed ``the most abandoned.''\n  It was Pope Francis who said: ``I invite all of the institutions of \nthe world, the Church, each of us, as one single human family, to give \na voice to all of those who suffer silently from hunger, so that this \nvoice becomes a roar which can shake the world.''\n  He continued and said: ``This campaign [to end hunger] is an \ninvitation to all of us . . . to stop thinking that our daily actions \ndo not have an impact on the lives of those who suffer from hunger \nfirsthand.''\n  It turns out that the Pope's message on addressing hunger is more \ntimely than we could have imagined. In a moment, I will explain why. It \nhas to do with the government shutdown. Certainly we know from 2 years \nago that a government shutdown hurts every family in America, it hurts \nsmall businesses across America, it sets the economy back, it creates \nall sorts of obstructions and frustrations, and it is a self-inflicted \nwound on America. Yet my colleagues across the aisle are contending \nthat is exactly where they want to head, another showdown over social \nissues. We have been down this road before. It is a needless self-\ninflicted wound. We shouldn't be planning to go there.\n  But here is why the Pope's words on hunger are particularly timely:\n  Two years ago when we had a government shutdown, it did not impact \nthe program known as SNAP or food stamps--the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program or food stamps, as we often refer to it. That is \nbecause we still had funds left from the stimulus program to be able to \nmake sure hungry Americans did have the ability to receive the credits \non their electronic food stamp card and to purchase groceries for their \nfamilies. But we are in a different position this time around.\n  Last Friday the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified the \nAppropriations Committee that because the stimulus funds that existed 2 \nyears ago are not there any longer, that come October 1, if we shut \nthis government down, then we are also going to be\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\nshutting down food stamps--that is shutting down food stamps for 45 \nmillion Americans.\n  In my home State of Oregon, there are about one out of five \nOregonians who depend on food stamps to hold hunger at bay. We are \ncertainly talking about an incredible number of children among that \nnumber, so across the country, millions of children, millions more \nAmericans--45 million Americans. Yet here we are saying that it is all \nright to shut down food stamps and leave millions of Americans with the \nprospect of going hungry.\n  It causes me to reflect on Robert Kennedy's effort to take on hunger. \nHe was known back in 1967 to have visited children in Mississippi, and \nhe said the following:\n\n       I have seen children in the Delta area of Mississippi with \n     distended stomachs, whose faces are covered with sores from \n     starvation, and we haven't developed a policy so we can get \n     enough food so that they can live, so that their children, so \n     that their lives are not destroyed. I don't think that's \n     acceptable in the United States of America and I think we \n     need a change.\n\n  That is what Robert Kennedy said to our Nation. His advocacy had an \nimpact in two particular areas, and that is that we proceeded to put a \nlot more resources into fighting hunger and we rewrote the food stamp \nregulations to provide greater access for those at the lowest income \nlevels. The Food Stamp Program--or as it is now called, SNAP--has \nbecome the largest, most effective program in the United States in the \nfight against hunger.\n  Again, the USDA contacted us Friday of last week and said it looks \nlike they will have to shut down this program if there is a government \nshutdown. This did not happen 2 years ago, so this is new information. \nThey said they are going to work through the weekend to see if they can \nfind any way with an existing law to prevent this from happening. As of \nthis morning, they had been unable to find any legal pathway to extend \nthe Food Stamp Program should we be in a government shutdown.\n  In our country, the poverty threshold for a family of four is about \n$24,000. For a family of four, that translates to about $6,000 a \nperson. More than half of those who receive food stamps live in \nfamilies who are below 50 percent of that threshold or roughly $3,000 \nper year per individual in the family.\n  In my home State of Oregon, SNAP provides food benefits for about \n800,000 residents or, as I mentioned, one in five Oregonians. This will \nhave a widespread impact on hundreds of thousands of individuals in my \nhome State and for my colleagues, hundreds of thousands of individuals \nin their States--45 million across the country. The USDA tells us that \nthe timing for the recharging of the food stamp cards varies. Not \neveryone will be affected on October 1, but all of those 45 million \nwould be affected in the month of October. The majority of the SNAP \nrecipients in Oregon and nationwide are vulnerable populations. They \nare children. They are the disabled. They are the elderly. Can we not \ncome together in a responsible fashion to prevent sending millions of \nAmericans into a crisis over available food, millions of children \nacross our country in a crisis because they do not have food because of \nour inability to act responsibly?\n  The words Robert Kennedy used were that this should not happen in \nAmerica. Let me repeat that certainly I believe this should not happen \nin America. I cannot conceive of any moral argument that would justify \nleaving our children, our disabled, our elderly hungry because a few \npeople in this body want to make a political point over a social issue. \nThat is unacceptable.\n  I do a lot of townhalls back home in Oregon, one in every county \nevery year. I hear from folks who are worried over a lot of issues. \nThey are certainly worried about finding a good job. They are certainly \nworried about the cost of sending their children to college. They are \ncertainly worried about cuts to Head Start programs and the quality of \ntheir public schools. They are worried about the possibility of a \nsecure retirement. And now, because of the threats of partisan point-\nmaking here in the body of the Senate, they are going to have to worry \nabout whether they can put dinner on the table and feed their children. \nThat is wrong.\n  The American people are sick and tired of Congress manufacturing \ncrises like this. Let's move beyond this brinkmanship and this hostage \npolitics. Let's avert this shutdown. Let's carry out the \nresponsibilities to the people of the United States of America.\n  Pope Francis said in that initial quote I noted that he invited all \nof the institutions of the world to give voice to all those who suffer \nsilently from hunger. Little did he imagine that on the day he arrived \nhere in Washington, DC, this institution--the U.S. Senate--would be \ninvolved not only in not helping those who are hungry but plotting and \nplanning a shutdown of the government that will put millions of \nAmericans into a food crisis. Let's change that. Let's come together. \nLet's address a responsible plan for carrying the full funding of our \ngovernment forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, I want to thank the majority leader for \nbringing the Defense appropriations bill to the floor for a vote and \nremind everyone that the Senate Appropriations Committee has put \nforward 12 appropriations bills that adhere to the Republican budget \nand that reflect the priorities of the American people.\n  You have heard all year that we need to get back to regular order, \nand that means we need to bring up and debate each of these 12 bills \nindividually. It is clear after two votes that the Democratic \nobstructionism through the Defense appropriations bill will prevent us \nfrom funding our service men and women. My colleagues across the aisle \nare voting against supplying the military with the tools to stop ISIS. \nThey are voting against the much needed upgrades to our missile defense \nprogram. They are voting against increasing missile defense support to \nIsrael. They are voting against restoring readiness to our military.\n  The demands on our military are great. The threats we face today as a \nnation are numerous, complex, and may be the most dangerous in my \nlifetime. Those who also volunteer to defend our great Nation against \nthese threats rely on us to meet these obligations as Senators.\n  Congress is responsible for ensuring that American service men and \nwomen have the tools they need to do their jobs and remain safe. But \ntoday my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done our Nation \na great disservice. By failing to bring up the Defense appropriations \nbill, Democrats aren't letting us do our job. That is dangerous.\n  We need to return to regular order and vote on these appropriations \nbills so that the priorities of the American people can once and for \nall be restored.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Inspector General Vacancy at the VA\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee--headed by Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member \nCarper--had a very important hearing where we heard from whistleblowers \nfrom the VA, and then afterwards we heard from VA officials and \nrepresentatives from the inspector general's office. The issue of how \nwe treat those who have served the country is so critical to who we are \nas a nation. Yet, over the last year, we have learned of shocking \nfailures at the Department of Veterans Affairs, and today's testimony, \nunfortunately, was no different in terms of how whistleblowers were \nretaliated against at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Instead of a \nculture that encourages people to come forward when things go wrong, \npeople who come forward when things go wrong are treated badly and also \nface consequences as far as their employment, and that is wrong.\n  Over the last year, we have seen shocking failures, including \nveterans being denied care after being placed on secret wait lists, \nexperiencing extended delays in benefits, and endless wait times for \nrepeals, reviews, or action on claims.\n  Recently, we also learned that as of last year, the VA had 867,000 \npending\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nhealth care enrollment records. That is almost 1 million records \nwithout a final determination status--some from decades ago. Nearly \none-third of the veterans who had applied to the VA for care have now \nbeen reported as having died. Additionally, the VA staff has deleted \n10,000 transaction records, but the reasons are undocumented. These \nfailures are outrageous, and that word is used a lot around here, but \nthis truly does define what is happening in our VA--outrageous.\n  Our veterans, who have served and sacrificed so much for our country, \ndeserve the very best care and support we can give them. The VA has \nfallen short time and time again in meeting that goal.\n  The bipartisan VA reform bill, enacted last summer, represents an \nimportant step in increasing accountability and mismanagement at the \ndepartment, and also giving our veterans the choice of care in their \ncommunities rather than waiting in line. That is very important to my \nState, New Hampshire, where, unfortunately, we don't have a full-\nservice veterans hospital. There is so much more work to be done on \nthat front; however, we continue to hear about reports of bureaucratic \ndelays and failures at the VA, such as overprescribing opiates, bonuses \npaid to employees involved in serious misconduct, enrollment record \nmayhem, and inflated claims of VA employees being held accountable and \nfired. Unfortunately, we still can't get a number, even after all the \nwait-list scandals where veterans literally died while waiting for \ncare.\n  I have a few recent headlines about the VA. In the Chicago Tribune, \nJanuary 9, ``Veterans: VA hospital nicknamed `Candy Land' because \npainkillers given out freely.''\n  Arizona Republic, February 13, ``Whistle-blowers: VA still \nendangering suicidal vets.''\n  Washington Post, March 9, ``Veteran Affairs manager pokes fun at \nmental health issues with photo of elf begging for Xanax.''\n  Associated Press, April 9, ``Veterans hospital wait times haven't \nimproved.''\n  Stars and Stripes, April 13, ``Whistleblowers say retaliation \nunabated year into VA scandal.''\n  The Washington Post on May 14, ``Veterans Affairs improperly spent $6 \nbillion annually, senior official says.''\n  In light of all of the issues that have been raised with our VA, can \nyou imagine that we are in a place where there is no permanent \ninspector general who has been appointed by the President to serve in \nthat important watchdog position for the Veterans' Administration after \nall of the issues I just cited in this Chamber? There are many more \nissues that I didn't even have on this list.\n  The inspector general position at the Veterans' Administration has \nbeen vacant since December of 2013. That is 631 days--631 days that the \nPresident has failed to appoint someone to ensure that there is \ncritical oversight and transparency at the Veterans' Administration. In \nfact, we have just had acting individuals in that position. We have not \nhad a permanent watchdog in that position. In light of everything we \nhave been through, we have had 631 days without adequate \naccountability; 631 days without permanent oversight leadership; 631 \ndays without a permanent watchdog to investigate scandals that have \ntarnished the promises we made to our veterans which they earned by \ndefending our great Nation; 631 days without the President even \nsubmitting a nomination to fill this empty position. That is \nunacceptable.\n  We need the President to step up and appoint an inspector general to \nbe the watchdog for the Veterans' Administration so they can have a \ncontinuity of leadership. There is no more important oversight issue \nright now.\n  I have written the President, along with Members on both sides of the \naisle. We have repeatedly called on the President to make a nomination \nfor this inspector general position, and we know that--through the \nprocess--names of individuals who are qualified to serve in this \nposition have actually been submitted to the President's desk. Both \nsides of the aisle in this body agree on this issue. Our desire--on a \nbipartisan basis--is to make sure that those who have defended, served, \nand answered the call of duty for our Nation receive the very best care \nfor what they have done to defend our freedom. Yet, after all the \nscandals and all the issues and challenges that our veterans face, can \nyou imagine leaving this particular position open for 631 days?\n  I am, again, in this Chamber going to call on the President, and I \nknow that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, whom I have \nworked with on this issue, agree that it is time for the President of \nthe United States to nominate a qualified individual--he has had many \nnames submitted to him--to serve in this critical watchdog position as \nthe permanent inspector general for the VA with the full authority to \nconduct the investigations that need to be conducted on issues that \nhave been raised repeatedly about the Veterans' Administration.\n  What is clear from the testimony we heard today at the homeland \nsecurity committee hearing is that we have so much more work to do to \nensure accountability at the Veterans' Administration and to ensure \nthat our veterans get the very best of what they deserve and have \nearned by defending our Nation.\n  What is clear is that the IG council has done its job and nominated \nindividuals for the President to consider for this inspector general \nposition.\n  I am now calling on the President: Mr. President, please nominate a \nqualified individual to be a permanent VA inspector general in order to \nprotect our veterans.\n  Mr. President, 631 days is already way too long, and our veterans \nshould not have to wait a day longer to have this position filled. This \nimportant agency needs a watchdog that is there to serve them.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Puerto Rico\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today deeply concerned about the \ngrowing economic crisis in Puerto Rico, which threatens to destabilize \nthe island, and that we must step in and help our fellow American \ncitizens--but sometimes we forget that the 3.5 million people who live \nin Puerto Rico are American citizens--before a financial crisis becomes \na calamity.\n  I again urge, as I recently did in a letter to Secretary Lew, along \nwith seven Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, that the \nDepartment of the Treasury move beyond simply providing technical \nassistance and take a full-throated leadership role to resolve this \ncrisis immediately as we have done in previous financial crises. If we \ndo not act, the result could be a financial disorder that will, at the \nend of the day, be much more expensive, much more chaotic, and will, in \nboth the long and short term, cost Puerto Rico and the United States.\n  The fact is that a potential solution rests in the hands of the \nadministration, with Treasury and with HHS. As we said in the letter to \nSecretary Lew, the world is watching Puerto Rico, and we must ensure \nthat the United States does everything in its power to take strong, \nbold, and substantive action that stabilizes the situation and protects \nthe 3.5 million American citizens on the island and their families. \nTechnical assistance and advice from Treasury is all well and good, \nbut, in my view, it is just not enough.\n  Treasury needs to take an active role, and Congress needs to approve \nthe pending debt restructuring legislation I introduced with Senators \nBlumenthal, Schumer, and other Senate colleagues that would allow the \ngovernment of Puerto Rico to authorize its public utilities to rework \ntheir debts under chapter 9. That is in the best interests of both \nPuerto Rico and the mainland.\n  The fact of the matter is Puerto Rico would actually be running a \nsurplus--a surplus--if it did not have to make debt payments. Allowing \ngovernment-owned corporations to restructure their debts using a sound \nlegal process would give the island breathing room to make necessary \nreforms and would not cost U.S. taxpayers a dime. This could go a long \nway to promote the fairest and most efficient outcome.\n  The idea has been endorsed by the editorial boards of the Wall Street\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\nJournal, the Washington Post, Bloomberg View, the New York Times, the \nLos Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, and others. The bill is also \nsupported by the nonpartisan National Bankruptcy Conference and \nnumerous bankruptcy lawyers and judges.\n  Additionally, it is clear that the island's health care system is \nadding additional pressure to the overall financial situation, \naccounting for 20 percent of the island's economy and responsible for a \nthird of its overall debt burden. Sixty percent of Puerto Ricans living \non the island are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. And because of the \ndisparity in how these two health programs are funded relative to the \n50 States, the financial crisis is only exacerbated.\n  To help alleviate some of this pressure on the health care system, I \nhave introduced the Improving the Treatment of U.S. Territories Under \nFederal Health Programs Act of 2015 with Senators Schumer, Nelson, \nGillibrand, and Blumenthal. This legislation provides several policies \nthat will ensure Puerto Rico providers, both hospitals and physicians, \nare treated more equally to the States under the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms.\n  Just as importantly, this legislation ensures that beneficiaries on \nthe island are treated equally too. As citizens of the United States, \nit is imperative that Puerto Ricans be afforded the same access to \ncare, coverage, and health benefits as everyone else.\n  While I believe this legislation will go a long way toward addressing \nthe island's systemic health care issues, there are several steps that \nHHS can take immediately and without the need for congressional action. \nThey can change payment calculations under Medicare Advantage and \nMedicare's in-patient hospital rules to more accurately reflect the \ncosts and demographics on the island. By making necessary adjustments \nto certain key payment formulas, HHS could make the practice of \nmedicine a financially viable option in Puerto Rico and stem the tide \nof physicians leaving the island for the U.S. mainland and ensure that \nour fellow Americans living on the island are able to receive the care \nthey need and deserve. I urge not only Treasury Secretary Lew but HHS \nSecretary Burwell to do all they can to provide financial and health \ncare-related relief to Puerto Rico to help curb the island's financial \ncrisis.\n  Now, Governor Garcia Padilla's Working Group for the Fiscal and \nEconomic Recovery of Puerto Rico has also recently released a 5-year \nplan earlier this month. While I don't agree with everything included \nin the plan, it shows a determined and legitimate effort to confront \nthe economic crisis facing the island. Unfortunately, the current debt \nstructure and legal restraints threaten the effectiveness of these \nproposed reforms. Without providing some flexibility and room to \nmaneuver, all the difficult choices in the world won't be able to \nresolve the crisis.\n\n  I wish to make it, however, absolutely clear: I am not--I am not--\ncalling for a Federal bailout of Puerto Rico. But there is still much \nwe can and should do to restore solvency to the island that is home to \n3.5 million Americans. Our bond with these Americans who live on the \nisland has always been strong. Our relationship with Puerto Rico is \nlong and deep and extensive. With more than 5 million Puerto Ricans \nresiding in the United States--more than in Puerto Rico itself--we are \ninextricably tied.\n  Now, I should not need to remind this body that from the infancy of \nour Nation, the people of Puerto Rico have been there for us. Now we \nneed to be there for them. Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States \nin 1898 after the Spanish-American war. Less than two decades later, in \n1917, Congress passed the Jones Act, granting American citizenship to \nresidents of the island.\n  But even long before they were granted U.S. citizenship, Puerto \nRicans have had a long and proud history of fighting on the side of \nAmerica. As far back as 1777, Puerto Rican ports were used by U.S. \nships, enabling them to run British blockades and keep commerce \nflowing, which was so crucial to the war effort. It was Puerto Rican \nsoldiers who took up arms in the U.S. Civil War, defending Washington, \nDC, from attack and fought in the Battle of Fredericksburg. In World \nWar I, almost 20,000 Puerto Ricans were drafted into the U.S. Armed \nForces. Let's not forget about the 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the \nBorinqueneers, the segregated military unit composed almost entirely of \nsoldiers from Puerto Rico that played a prominent and crucial role in \nWorld War I, World War II, and the Korean war, one of the most highly \ndecorated regiments known in military history.\n  I am proud to say I have worked with Senator Blumenthal and others to \nmake sure that the heroic Borinqueneers, the only Active-Duty \nsegregated Latino military unit in the history of the United States and \nthe last segregated unit to be deactivated, received well-deserved and \nlong-overdue national recognition when we passed a bill last year \nawarding these courageous patriots with the Congressional Gold Medal--\nthe highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished \nachievements and contributions to the United States.\n  It is very easy to point our fingers at our brothers and sisters on \nthe island and fault Puerto Rico for carrying more than $70 billion in \ndebt. But I challenge my Senate colleagues to work with me on finding \nsolutions, to step up to our responsibility at the Federal level by \nseeking opportunities for Congress and the administration to correct \nsome of the inequities that have contributed to this crisis. I am \ntalking about the unequal Medicare and Medicaid funding that I \nreferenced earlier, the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the Supplemental \nSecurity Income program that aids the most vulnerable Americans, the \nexclusion of Puerto Rico from the child tax credit and earned income \ntax credit, which encourages low-income individuals to seek employment, \nand, as previously mentioned, the exclusion of Puerto Rico from chapter \n9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n  Now, more than ever, we need to be asking in Washington what steps \ncan be taken to manage this crisis. Unequal treatment at the Federal \nlevel is, whether we want to own up to it or not, a contributing factor \nto the current economic crisis. The lack of Federal support has \nencouraged heavy borrowing by the Puerto Rican government of many, many \nadministrations going back. We must do our part, both in Congress and \nthe administration, to address this crisis, and we must act now, with \nurgency.\n  I think the point is clear. As I said, we have a special, historic, \nunshakeable bond with Puerto Rico, and now is the time to strengthen \nthat bond. The time has come to prevent the worsening fiscal crisis in \nPuerto Rico. The time has come to help Puerto Rico, and we can do so \nsimply by giving them the wherewithal to help themselves through the \nBankruptcy Code, as we would any other similar entity, to have the \nwherewithal to have an orderly restructuring and to get their economic \nfuture back in shape.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, we are on the eve of yet another \ngovernment shutdown, yet another manufactured crisis. Two years ago it \nwas over defunding the Affordable Care Act. Today Republicans \nintroduced a continuing resolution that holds our country hostage over \nfunding for Planned Parenthood.\n  The 2013 shutdown of a couple years ago cost billions of dollars in \neconomic losses. We heard many stories of hardships caused by the \nshutdown, including small business owners who were suffering because \nour national parks closed, public safety workers protecting our country \nwithout pay, and Federal contractors left holding the bag for personnel \nand program costs. We cannot do this to our working families for the \nsecond time in 3 years. We cannot do this to our country.\n  Instead of funding the government, my colleagues across the aisle are \nusing threats of a shutdown to attack Planned Parenthood without any \nhard\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\nevidence of wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. Threatening to shut down \nthe government over an organization that annually provides 400,000 \ncervical cancer screenings, 500,000 breast exams, and 4.5 million tests \nand treatments for sexually transmitted diseases is completely uncalled \nfor.\n  Arguments that there are other providers that can fill the important \nand critical role of Planned Parenthood are not persuasive. According \nto the Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood serves more \ncontraceptive clients each year than any other similar provider, \nincluding federally qualified health centers. In more than 300 counties \nacross the country, safety net providers such as Planned Parenthood are \nthe providers of choice for nearly half of women. Furthermore, Planned \nParenthood is the sole safety net provider in nearly 100 of these \ncounties.\n  Planned Parenthood services cannot be easily replaced. In an attempt \nto defund Planned Parenthood, one State submitted a list of providers \nthey said could replace Planned Parenthood's critical women's health \ncare services. This list that the State provided included dentists, \nophthalmologists, radiologists, and nursing homes. Think about that. \nProviders are not widgets.\n  After a Federal judge called their bluff, the State cut their list \nfrom over 2,000 providers to just 29 providers who actually are able to \nprovide primary care services to women. Those 29 providers could not \npossibly absorb the thousands of patients Planned Parenthood served in \nthat State. Planned Parenthood has long been in the crosshairs of the \nanti-choice movement.\n  This recent attack on Planned Parenthood is based on heavily edited \nvideos by radical fringe groups. I refer my colleagues to a letter from \nPlanned Parenthood's Cecile Richards to House and Senate leadership \ndated August 27, 2015.\n  Instead of improving the lives of women by passing legislation \nraising the minimum wage, closing the gender pay gap or ensuring paid \nleave for all workers, my colleagues across the aisle continue to \nnarrowly focus on ways to further marginalize women. Instead of \nintroducing continuing resolutions that contain these kinds of poison \npills, such as defunding Planned Parenthood, we must pass clean \nlegislation that keeps our government funded, that provides needed and \ncritical services to the people of this country. I ask my colleagues to \njoin with me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a Kentucky \nState Police trooper who was tragically lost in the line of duty. \nTrooper Joseph Cameron Ponder, of Rineyville, was shot and killed while \npursuing a suspect on September 13. He was 31 years old.\n  Cameron Ponder was proud to be a Kentucky State trooper. ``He was \neager and he absolutely loved his job,'' is how a State police \nspokesman described him. He was also new to the job, having just \ngraduated in January of this year from the Kentucky State Police \nTraining Academy. He was stationed at the State police post in \nMayfield.\n  Before becoming a Kentucky State trooper, Cameron served in the U.S. \nNavy. He enlisted in September 2007, when he was 23 years old, and \nbecame a Navy diver. Over the next 6 years he was stationed in places \nas varied as Great Lakes, IL; Coronado, CA; Panama City, FL; and San \nDiego, CA.\n  During his Navy service he received several awards, medals and \ndecorations, including the Combat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct \nMedal, the Navy Expeditionary Medal, the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Expert Rifle \nMarksmanship Ribbon and the Expert Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon.\n  Cameron was discharged from the Navy in July 2013. He was a member of \nthe Church of Christ in Elizabethtown, KY. He was also a dedicated \nhunter and fisherman who enjoyed the outdoors.\n  Sadly, Trooper Ponder is the second trooper from the Mayfield post to \nbe killed in the line of duty this year. In June, Trooper Eric K. \nChrisman was killed in a vehicle crash. He also had served with the \nKentucky State Police for under a year.\n  Members of Trooper Ponder's family who are suffering from this loss \ninclude his father, Joseph Ponder; his mother, Brenda Tiffany, and her \nhusband Allan; his fiancee, Chrystal Coleman; his sister, Kelly Ponder; \nhis brothers, Damon Tiffany and Travis Tiffany; his grandmother, Erika \nShook; his niece, Mahlea Starks; and many other family members and \nfriends.\n  I am proud to share Trooper Ponder's story with my colleagues here in \nthe United States Senate. We're thinking of his family today as well as \nhis fellow officers of the Kentucky State Police. We are praying for \nthe loved ones he has left behind who are feeling this devastating \nloss.\n  We are honored by Trooper Ponder's service and his extraordinary \nsacrifice on behalf of his fellow Kentuckians. I hold the deepest \nadmiration and respect for Trooper Ponder and for every brave police \nofficer across the Bluegrass State. Law enforcement is both an \nhonorable profession and a dangerous one, and Kentucky is grateful they \nhave made a sacred pledge to protect and defend our communities and our \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6889-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6889-S6890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL MARTIN E. DEMPSEY\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I recognize and pay tribute to GEN \nMartin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for his \nlifetime of service to our country. His retirement marks more than 41 \nyears of selfless devotion to our military and our Nation. A leader of \nexceptional character and consequence, his humility, courage, and \nexpertise will be sorely missed.\n\n[[Page S6890]]\n\n  A New Jersey native and 1974 graduate of the United States Military \nAcademy, General Dempsey was well prepared to lead our Armed Forces \nthese last 4 years as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A career \narmor officer, he has commanded at every level, from platoon leader to \ncombatant commander, and his assignments have carried him and his \nfamily across the United States and around the world.\n  As a company grade officer, he served with the 2nd Cavalry in Europe \nand the 10th Cavalry at Fort Carson. Following troop command, he earned \nhis masters of arts in English from Duke University and was assigned to \nthe English Department at West Point. He subsequently earned additional \nadvanced degrees from the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College \nand the National War College.\n  In 1991, General Dempsey deployed with the 3rd Armored Division in \nsupport of Operation Desert Storm. He later commanded a battalion in \nGermany and then served as the Army's ``senior scout'' as the 67th \ncolonel of the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment--the Brave Rifles--before \nreporting to the joint staff as an assistant deputy director in the J-5 \nand later as a special assistant to the 14th Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff.\n  In 2003, General Dempsey commanded the 1st Armored Division in \nBaghdad and returned to Iraq in 2005 as the commanding general of the \nMulti-National Security Transition Command--Iraq. From 2007 to 2008, he \nwas the deputy commander and then acting commander of U.S. Central \nCommand, and from 2008 to 2011, he commanded U.S. Army Training and \nDoctrine Command.\n  Appointed to serve as the Army's 37th Chief of Staff, General Dempsey \nled his beloved Army a short 149 days before being tapped to serve as \nthe 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In that capacity and as \nthe Nation's highest-ranking military officer, he has served as the \nprincipal military adviser to the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe National Security Council, and this Congress these past 4 years.\n  General Dempsey's exceptional ability to coordinate and build \nconsensus among the office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint \nStaff, the services, and the combatant commands has served us well and \nensured those charged with civilian oversight of the military have \nreceived the best military advice possible to achieve our national \nobjectives. Additionally, he has built trust and strengthened relations \nwith both national and foreign leaders.\n  During a period of complex and rapid global change, coupled with the \nmilitary's exceptionally high operational tempo and unprecedented \nfiscal challenges, General Dempsey's decisive leadership enabled the \nsuccess of military operations around the world. He masterfully guided \nthe Joint Force to extraordinary execution of global responsibilities, \nfrom counterterrorism and crisis response, to supporting our allies, \nbuilding partner capacity, and humanitarian assistance. His efforts \nstrengthened key alliances, bolstered new partnerships, and more \nclosely integrated the military with the other instruments of our \nnational power against the many threats we face.\n  Because of those many threats, General Dempsey's tenure as Chairman \nhas been marked by significant transitions in military operations and \npersonnel. His exemplary stewardship helped reset our forces after the \nconclusion of major combat operations and has prepared them for an \nincreasingly dynamic and unpredictable security environment.\n  His leadership was critical during the transition of authority to the \nAfghan National Security Forces following Operation Enduring Freedom. \nAdditionally, in the fight against ISIL, his expert advice helped \nformulate the military component of a sustainable counter-ISIL \nstrategy. He also guided the military's work as part of the U.S. \ninteragency response to the Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa.\n  He guided the Joint Force to capitalize on the lessons learned over \nthese past 14 years fighting as a Joint team, undertaking reforms that \nhave driven ``jointness'' further into our military's capability \ndevelopment and operational planning. In addition, recognizing the \nshifting nature of the security environment and our ability to respond \nto it, General Dempsey led a paradigm shift in how we posture and \nemploy this Joint team around the world.\n  At the same time, the past few years have witnessed exponential \ngrowth of the cyber threat against our Nation, and, in response, \nGeneral Dempsey has deftly pushed the expansion of our cyber \ncapabilities. He has pressed hard for cyber legislation, championed the \nrapid development of our cyber forces, and implemented the Joint \nInformation Environment to optimize and better defend our military's \ninformation technology infrastructure. These initiatives will be \ncritical to the future security of our Nation.\n  As principal steward of the military profession, he renewed an \ninternal commitment to strengthen the profession of arms and \nreinvigorated education, training, and leader development. He managed \nhistoric decisions, including reforms to general and flag officer \nethics, Department-wide improvements in sexual assault prevention and \nresponse, expansion of service opportunities for women, and the \nextension of benefits to same-sex spouses of uniformed servicemembers \nand Department of Defense civilian employees. His stewardship set \nconditions to preserve the strength of the all-volunteer force and to \nensure servicemembers departing the military are successfully \nreintegrated back into their communities.\n  As he retires, General Dempsey should take great pride in his role in \nensuring our military remains the best supported, best trained, best \nequipped, and best led force on the planet. His contributions to our \nnational security are a testament to his remarkable leadership and \nselfless dedication. During trying times, under sometimes harsh \nscrutiny and with high national security stakes at hand, his steadfast \ncommitment to the readiness and welfare of Joint Force servicemembers \nand their families, as well as his exceptional support for commanders \nand their warfighting requirements, made significant and lasting \ncontributions to our Nation.\n  With over four decades of exemplary service to our Nation, General \nDempsey and his family deserve our most heartfelt gratitude and \nadmiration. He and Deanie have my very best wishes for a long, happy, \nand well-deserved retirement. Our Nation, our Joint Force, and our Army \nare all better for his leadership and distinguished service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6890-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6890-S6891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           OBSERVING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIETNAM WAR\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam \nwar, we reflect with reverence upon a generation that served with \nhonor, distinction, and selflessness. We pay tribute to the 9 million \nmen and women who wore our Nation's uniform during the Vietnam era, \nanswered our Nation's call to service, and advanced the sacred ideals \nof liberty and self-determination.\n  All gave some, and some gave all. Currently, the names of the more \nthan 58,000 patriots who gave their all are forever etched in black \ngranite on the Vietnam Memorial in our Nation's Capital. The names of \nthe nearly 1,800 Americans who remain unaccounted for are forever \netched in our hearts.\n  Nearly 350 patriots from Maine are listed among the killed or \nmissing. Among those names is U.S. Army SGT Donald Skidgel, a Medal of \nHonor recipient, born in my hometown of Caribou, ME, who served in \nVietnam and who gave his life saving the lives of others. On September \n14 of this year, Navy pilot LT Neil Taylor was finally laid to rest in \nhis hometown of Rangeley, ME, 50 years to the day after his aircraft \nwas shot down on his 68th mission and he was reported missing. They \nwere patriots in the best American tradition. We will never forget \nthem.\n  May the families of those who fell and of those unaccounted for find \npeace in knowing that the American people share their loss and grief. \nWe will always be grateful for the valor and sacrifice of their loved \nones. And we will never forget them.\n  From the founding of our Nation to today, the freedom we hold sacred \nhas been earned by our fellow citizens. Our Nation's history has been \nwritten by the men and women who serve, despite the sacrifices, with \ncourage and devotion. The men and women of the Vietnam era carried on \nthat tradition.\n\n[[Page S6891]]\n\nThey carry on another tradition that echoes throughout our history: \nAfter their military service was done, they returned home, quietly and \nmodestly, and continued to serve their communities.\n  The American people believe that supporting our troops doesn't stop \nonce they leave the military. Just as no member of our Armed Forces \nwould leave a comrade behind on the battlefield, we must not leave our \nveterans and their families behind on the battlefields of injury and \ndisease. We must be strong advocates for veterans' health care and be \nconcerned about the Vietnam veterans who were exposed to agent orange. \nWe must remain committed to ensuring that those veterans and their \nfamilies receive the care and support they have earned.\n  The men and women who served our Nation a half century ago upheld the \nhighest ideals of America and of the American Armed Forces. Our Vietnam \nveterans were then, and remain today, heroes who deserve our respect \nand our gratitude.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, this month marks the 50th anniversary of the \nintroduction of U.S. ground troops in the Vietnam war, and I would like \nto recognize our Vietnam era veterans who dedicated their strength and \nservice to defend freedom and democracy across the globe. In honor of \nthis anniversary, the Secretary of Defense coordinated various events \nto thank and honor all veterans of the Vietnam war. A well-deserved \nwelcome home ceremony will be held in Presque Isle, ME, on September \n26, 2015, to recognize and commemorate the lives of those who fought so \nbravely.\n  For nearly 20 years, the Vietnam war occupied the American collective \nconscience. American involvement initially focused on assisting French \nforces to counter the Vietminh communist revolution. However, in 1964 \nthe Gulf of Tonkin incident dramatically shifted American perspective, \nand on August 7, President Johnson drafted and Congress unanimously \napproved a resolution authorizing direct military intervention in \nVietnam.\n  Throughout the war, the United States deployed over 2.7 million \nservicemembers to Vietnam, and over 8 million Americans served in \nuniform during the Vietnam era. More than 58,200 Americans lost their \nlives and more than 150,000 were seriously wounded during the conflict. \nI would like to honor those brave Americans who sacrificed so much for \ntheir country. Their contributions to our Nation will never be \nforgotten.\n  Maine played a crucial role in the war effort. With one of the \nhighest percentages of veterans per capita in the nation, the Vietnam \nwar's legacy still resonates in Maine today. Close to 48,000 people \nfrom Maine served in Vietnam, and nearly 350 Maine servicemembers were \nkilled or went missing in action during the war. Our veterans' \nunwavering patriotism, courage, and resilience fully demonstrate the \nfortitude of American character and our Nation's commitment to \ndemocracy worldwide.\n  On this 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war, I would like to join the \nSecretary of Defense in recognizing the brave Americans who served \noverseas, as well as those on the homefront whose unrelenting support \nwas invaluable to those overseas. Our veterans have made countless \npersonal sacrifices in protection of our freedoms, and I am proud to \nhonor and thank them for their service to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6891-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BEING A TOLERANT AND ACCEPTING COUNTRY\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in recent weeks two of the leading \ncontenders to be President of the United States called into question \nthe devotion of American Muslims to this great country, and one even \noutrageously suggested that being Muslim precludes you from being \nPresident. I denounce this. It is in violation of Article VI of the \nConstitution and in violation of our County's basic principles.\n  Everyone that serves in public office from President to the Senate \nmust uphold the Constitution. Article VI of the Constitution explicitly \nstates:\n\n       All debts contracted and engagements entered into, before \n     the adoption of this Constitution, shall be as valid against \n     the United States under this Constitution, as under the \n     Confederation.\n       This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which \n     shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or \n     which shall be made, under the authority of the United \n     States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges \n     in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the \n     Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary \n     notwithstanding.\n       The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the \n     members of the several state legislatures, and all executive \n     and judicial officers, both of the United States and of the \n     several states, shall be bound by oath or affirmation, to \n     support this Constitution; but no religious test shall ever \n     be required as a qualification to any office or public trust \n     under the United States.\n\n  There are 3 million American Muslims in our country. They teach in \nour schools, they work in our hospitals, and they attend our \nuniversities. Their children play on the same playgrounds and go to the \nsame schools. They are able to do this because one of our founding \nprinciples on which our country was established was freedom of \nreligion. It is on that basis that the United States should strive to \nbe a tolerant and accepting country where differences are understood \nand diversity is celebrated. This is not the America some leading \ncandidates for President imagine. They are perpetuating an undercurrent \nof bigotry by suggesting that American Muslims can't be President \nbecause of their religious beliefs. Not only is this contrary to our \nAmerican values, it defies the U.S. Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6891-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6891-S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY BEHRENS\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the Wyoming Nurses Association is \nhonoring Casper nurse practitioner Mary Behrens with the 2015 Lifetime \nAchievement award. I am delighted to congratulate Mary on this \ntremendous honor.\n  Following in the footsteps of her mother, Mary pursued her passion \nfor service by completing her RN at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \nin 1964. She practiced as a nurse in Madison while her husband Jerry \nfinished his medical degree and residency. She remained in Madison as \nJerry served our Nation as a physician treating wounded soldiers in \nVietnam. In 1973, the couple moved to Casper, WY. Folks in Wyoming are \nfortunate that Mary chose to dedicate her career helping others in our \nState. She is truly an innovator, leader, and mentor for many nurses in \nWyoming across the Nation and around the world.\n  The list of Mary's accomplishments and awards is long. She was active \non the American Nurses Association board and is a board member of the \nUniversity of Wyoming's Friends of the Fay W. Whitney School of \nNursing. She is one of only three Wyoming nurses to be nationally \nrecognized as a fellow of the American Association of Nurse \nPractitioners, FAANP. Her leadership in this area is incredible.\n  In 2005 she was a member of the American delegation to the World \nHealth Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland, where she testified on the \nnational nursing shortage. In addition, through her involvement with \nthe Friendship Bridge program, Mary is credited with helping to \nestablish an education pathway for nurses in Vietnam. Her efforts to \ndevelop a modern baccalaureate curriculum have had a tremendous impact \non the global scope of nursing, particularly in Vietnam and neighboring \ncountries.\n  Mary's civic service is not at all limited to her profession. In \nfact, she has an established history as a public servant for both \nCasper and Wyoming. Mary served on the Casper city council and as mayor \nof Casper. She was also a Natrona county commissioner and a \nrepresentative in the Wyoming State Legislature. This experience, and \nher intense desire to make change, has made a profound impact on our \nState. Mary's extensive activity in shaping public policy truly stands \nalone, as few people possess such a wide breadth of policy knowledge, \nleadership skills, and passion for the nursing profession.\n  It is fitting that the Wyoming Nurses Association is honoring Mary \nBehrens with their most prestigious award. Countless patients and \nnursing students have benefitted from her leadership and care. The \nnursing profession is stronger because of Mary's enthusiastic advocacy.\n  Please join me in thanking Mary Behrens for her lifetime investment \nin nursing. Bobbi and I are truly fortunate to call her our friend.\n\n[[Page S6892]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6892-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TERRY BOSTON\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I would like to take this moment for \nthe Congress to note and honor the work of Terry Boston, president and \nCEO of PJM Interconnection, LLC.\n  It is most fitting that Terry Boston be recognized in the \nCongressional Record, for he has served countless Americans and played \na key role in ensuring adequate infrastructure to drive America's \neconomic development and our citizens' well-being throughout his \nprofessional life.\n  Since 2008, Terry Boston has served as president and chief executive \nofficer of PJM located in Valley Forge, PA. In this role, Terry \noversees the largest power grid in North America and the largest \nelectricity market in the world. Terry also is president of the \nAssociation of Edison Illuminating Companies, Inc., and immediate past \npresident of the GO 15, the association of the world's largest power \ngrid operators. Terry was recently elected to the National Academy of \nEngineering, one of the highest professional honors accorded an \nengineer. He is a member of the Board for the Electric Power Research \nInstitute.\n  Terry Boston is past chair of the North American Transmission Forum, \ndedicated to excellence in performance and sharing industry best \npractices. He also was one of the eight industry experts selected to \ndirect the North American Reliability Corporation investigation of the \nAugust 2003 Northeast/Midwest blackout.\n  Prior to joining PJM, Terry Boston was the executive vice president \nof the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Nation's largest public power \nprovider. In his 35 years at TVA, Terry directed divisions in \ntransmission and power operations, pricing, contracts and electric \nsystem reliability.\n  PJM employs over 600 people in Pennsylvania and performs a critical \nfunction by ``keeping the lights on'' 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nPJM helps to ensure the health and well-being of our citizens not just \nin my State but for over 51 million persons in all or portions of the \nStates of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, \nVirginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, \nIllinois, and the District of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, Terry Boston has been an excellent engineer and an \ninspirational leader in the electric industry.

He served more than 20 years as area vice president for \nthe Mississippi Association of Conservation Districts and more than 30 \nyears as a commissioner of the Lafayette County Soil and Water \nConservation District.

Margo's vision has grown MaineWorks \ninto an inclusive and empowering community for recent immigrants, low-\nincome laborers, past nonviolent offenders, military veterans, and \nother Mainers recovering from substance abuse.\n  Margo holds a BA in Psychology from Wheaton College and spent over 10 \nyears in New York City as a recruiter for Goldman Sachs's Investment \nBanking Division and as an international human resources consultant at \nHewitt. She subsequently returned to her home State of Maine, \ndetermined to channel her passion for economic and social development \ntowards the common good.\n  Margo's accomplishments at MaineWorks, however, extend beyond her \ninitial decision to found the company in 2010. Under her continued \nleadership, MaineWorks has received recognition across the State and \nnationwide. In 2014 and 2015, SCORE recognized MaineWorks as the most \nsuccessful innovative business in the State of Maine, and in 2014, \nMaineBiz Magazine named Margo as one of five women to watch. \nAdditionally, MaineWorks is featured on the Federal Minimum Wage \nCampaign's video and was recently certified as a B-corporation, a \ntestament to the company's commitment to transparency, social \ndevelopment, and environmental sustainability.\n  I would like to recognize and thank Margo for her ongoing commitment \nto the State of Maine.

                 \n      By Mr. WICKER (for himself, Mrs. Capito, Mr. King, Mr. Schatz, \n        Ms. Ayotte, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Barrasso):\n  S. 2067. A bill to establish EUREKA Prize Competitions to accelerate \ndiscovery and development of disease-modifying, preventive, or curative \ntreatments for Alzheimer's disease and related dementia, to encourage \nefforts to enhance detection and diagnosis of such diseases, or to \nenhance the quality and efficiency of care of individuals with such \ndiseases; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I am wearing purple today in honor of \nWorld Alzheimer's Month. As a matter of fact, yesterday, September 21, \nwas World Alzheimer's Day. So I have chosen today to introduce a bill \nthat I hope will lead to a major breakthrough in fighting this terrible \ndisease and treating and potentially curing Alzheimer's disease.\n  The legislation which I introduced this morning is called the EUREKA \nAct, which stands for Ensuring Useful Research Expenditures is Key for \nAlzheimer's--EUREKA.\n  I am taking this moment to briefly discuss the problem of Alzheimer's \nand to ask my colleagues to get behind this tripartisan legislation and \nsee if we can create some momentum to cure Alzheimer's disease in a \ndecade.\n  First of all, a little bit about awareness. As we all know, \nAlzheimer's is a 100-percent fatal disease. It affects some 36 million \npeople around the\n\n[[Page S6896]]\n\nglobe. More than 5 million Americans currently have Alzheimer's \ndisease. My mother died of Alzheimer's disease. I can tell you it is an \nincredibly personal trial for families who deal with loved ones \nsuffering and ultimately succumbing to this disease. So there is the \nhuman cost which so many of us have experienced and are experiencing.\n  There is also the cost in dollars and cents. Americans will spend \n$226 billion from our Treasury on Alzheimer's this year alone. The \ndisease puts an extraordinary burden on Medicare and Medicaid. As a \nmatter of fact, one in five Medicare dollars will be spent this year on \nsomeone with Alzheimer's. Think of what we could do to alleviate the \nsuffering our previous speaker was talking about if we didn't have to \nspend this $226 billion per year, if we didn't have to spend one in \nfive of our Medicare dollars on someone with Alzheimer's. Consider the \n2013 filing from the Rand Corporation. Direct costs of Alzheimer's \nexceed similar costs associated with cancer and heart disease combined.\n  According to Rush University, Alzheimer's is responsible for more \nthan 500,000 deaths each year.\n  Without a cure or a way to halt this disease, these numbers will \ncontinue to grow. By 2050 Alzheimer's is expected to cost $1.1 trillion \nper year. By then, Medicare and Medicaid could see a 500-percent \nincrease in Alzheimer's spending. So we have a problem in terms of \ndollars and cents, and we certainly have a problem in terms of the \nhardship it causes on families today.\n  Experts say we need $2 billion a year in public research if we are \ngoing to get to this goal of conquering Alzheimer's by 2025. We do the \nbest we can at the National Institutes of Health, but we spend only \n$586 million a year on Alzheimer's research. We need $2 billion a year. \nWe spend roughly a quarter of that amount each year, with very little \nprospect of getting it up to four times what we are spending now.\n  What is the solution? I believe the solution is to go to a concept \nthat has made America great for decades and even centuries, and that is \nthe American spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship and competition. \nWe create, we build, and we make a difference in people's lives through \ncompetition and innovation. So today I have introduced the EUREKA bill, \nwhich would establish a national prize for achieving benchmarks in \nfighting this disease. I want to make it clear that the EUREKA Act \nwould proceed on a parallel track with what is being done at NIH and \nthe Federal Government in terms of research. It wouldn't take a penny \naway from the research dollars currently spent on Alzheimer's and the \nfunds used to attack Alzheimer's in so many ways. It would be another \nroute for a breakthrough by establishing a competition to run parallel \nto the research being done.\n  We will need to research some milestones before we arrive at an \nAlzheimer's cure. This bill would create a system within the \ngovernment, with cooperation from NIH, to encourage public and private \ncollaboration to help us establish prizes for milestones reached to \nconquer Alzheimer's. Of course, we need to remember that prizes are \npaid only for success. If we don't meet the milestones, we won't have \nto expend the money.\n  My excellent staff and I have been working for months with some of \nthe leading experts in the United States on this concept, not the least \nof which is the XPRIZE Foundation, which has done such a good job in \nestablishing breakthroughs in other areas. So we have the support and \ncooperation of the XPRIZE Foundation. In addition, we have worked with \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration \nto get as much information as possible, and we think we have come up \nwith a way to have government-funded prizes to conquer this disease.\n  This is nothing new. The XPRIZE Foundation came along relatively \nrecently, but it was inspired by previous examples of success. In 1927 \nCharles Lindbergh won $25,000 for his Spirit of St. Louis aircraft in a \ncompetition to achieve the first nonstop flight between New York City \nand Paris. He received a prize for this accomplishment. Today aviation \nis a $300 billion industry. So prizes are not a new strategy. The \ngovernment already invests in countless areas, including health. As a \nmatter of fact, the America COMPETES Act gives Federal agencies the \nauthority to conduct prize-based challenges. NIH has already completed \ndozens of them. This builds on that success.\n  I envision that a panel would be established under this legislation \nto set benchmarks that would get us well along the road to conquering \nAlzheimer's. Successful, prize-worthy events would be measures such as \nidentifying an Alzheimer's biomarker, developing early-detection \ntechniques, or repurposing existing drugs for treatment. Milestones \nsuch as these would be established by a panel of experts. Think of what \ncould be achieved if people with expertise combine their skills inside \nand outside the government to end Alzheimer's. Think of the progress \nthat could be made toward ending human suffering.\n  My bill is S. 2067, the EUREKA Act, and it has received support from \nresearchers, including the MIND Center at the University of Mississippi \nin my home State, where we are doing innovative, groundbreaking \nachievements every day on Alzheimer's. Other organizations supporting \nthe EUREKA Act include the Alzheimer's Association, Us Against \nAlzheimer's, the XPRIZE Foundation, the Alzheimer's Foundation of \nAmerica, BrightFocus Foundation, Leaders Engaged on Alzheimer's \nDisease, otherwise known as LEAD, and Eli Lilly. All of these \norganizations and companies are supporting EUREKA.\n  We already have not bipartisan cosponsorship but tripartisan \ncosponsorship of this legislation because we have Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents already cosponsoring this EUREKA Act.\n  So I come to the floor today and ask my colleagues to talk to their \nhealth staff members. Look at this concept. Talk to us about the \nefforts we are engaged in, about the research we have done, about the \nlearned people who know what they are talking about and who have worked \nwith us to bring this bill where it is. I hope we can create some \nmomentum for this act soon. I hope we can attach it to legislation \nbefore the end of the year. I hope we can put this on the President's \ndesk sometime early in the year 2016.\n\n  EUREKA can be a game changer in fighting one of the most terrible and \nhorrible and expensive diseases we have. So I would urge my colleagues \nto look at this, to get back to me. I am going to aggressively be \ntalking to each of my colleagues and asking them to cosponsor this \nlegislation. I think we are onto something. I think we are getting \nvery, very near to achieving this goal of conquering Alzheimer's within \na decade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 2068. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include \nautomated fire sprinkler system retrofits as section 179 property and \nclassify certain automated fire sprinkler system retrofits as 15-year \nproperty for purposes of depreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fire Sprinkler \nIncentive Act. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Carper, in introducing this bipartisan bill.\n  Our bill would encourage commercial building owners to invest in \nlife-saving fire safety upgrades. While building codes require \nsprinklers in new commercial buildings, a great number of structures \nacross the U.S. were built and put in service before sprinklers were \nrequired. This is of significance in Maine, which has some of the \noldest housing stock in the country and which has experienced deadly \napartment building fires.\n  Maine has a large number of older, historic buildings--buildings that \ngenerally may not be required to have fire sprinklers. According to the \nMaine State Housing Authority, Maine has the sixth oldest housing stock \nin the country. In fact, many of the historic areas of Portland were \nbuilt following a devastating fire in 1866. This fire destroyed most of \nPortland's commercial buildings, many of its churches, and countless \nhomes.\n  Fire sprinklers are very effective at preventing deaths caused by \nfires. Small business building owners find it difficult, however, to \nfund adding retrofit sprinklers. Our bill would provide\n\n[[Page S6897]]\n\ntwo tax incentives to encourage building owners to make this \ninvestment.\n  Currently, commercial building owners must depreciate fire sprinkler \nretrofits over a lengthy 39-year period. The period for residential \nbuildings is 27 and a half years. This bill reclassifies fire sprinkler \nretrofits as 15-year depreciable property, thus allowing building \nowners to write off their costs more quickly. The bill also provides an \noption for certain small businesses to deduct the cost of the fire \nsystem upgrades immediately under Section 179 of the tax code. \nTogether, these proposals will provide a strong incentive for building \nowners to install fire sprinkler systems.\n  According to the National Fire Protection Association, in 2013, a \nfire department responded to a structure fire every 65 seconds, and \nfire claimed 9 lives every day. Just last October, five young adults \nwere killed when fire swept through a two apartment building near the \nUniversity of Southern Maine. In addition to these five, 20 other \npeople died in fires in Maine in 2014. Just last month, a fire killed \ntwo people in Old Town, ME. Sprinklers decrease the fire death rate by \nabout 80 percent and the average loss per home fire by about 70 \npercent.\n  This bill was originally drafted in response to the deadly nightclub \nfire in West Warwick, RI, in 2003. One hundred people died in that \nfire. The building did not have a fire sprinkler system. Let us work \ntogether to prevent another tragedy like this from happening. I invite \nmy colleagues to join Senator Carper and me in support of this \nbipartisan, common sense legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Congressional Fire Services\n\n\n                                                    Institute,\n\n                                               September 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins:  On behalf of the Congressional Fire \n     Services Institute (CFSI), I would like to express our thanks \n     and appreciation for sponsoring the Fire Sprinkler Incentive \n     Act. In 2002, CFSI's National Advisory Committee (NAC), a \n     coalition of 35 national fire and emergency service \n     organizations, unanimously approved a resolution expressing \n     the need for federal tax incentives to encourage the \n     installation of automatic fire sprinkler systems in \n     residential and commercial buildings. The introduction of the \n     Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act is an important step in \n     achieving this goal.\n       The cost of fire in America is enormous. According to the \n     National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 2014, there \n     were 1,298,000 fires reported in the United States, leading \n     to 3,275 civilian fire deaths, 15,775 civilian injuries, and \n     $11.6 billion in property damage. When you include the \n     indirect cost of fire, such as lost economic activity, the \n     cost is closer to $108 billion annually.\n       Studies by NFPA have concluded that buildings outfitted \n     with sprinklers reduce the death rate per fire by at least \n     57% and decrease the property damage by up to 68%. By \n     classifying the retrofit of an automatic fire sprinkler \n     system as an eligible property under Section 179 of the tax \n     code, the Fire Sprinkler Incentive Act will save lives by \n     allowing small and medium-sized businesses to deduct the cost \n     of sprinkler systems up to $125,000.00. The legislation would \n     also create a tax incentive for the retrofit of high-rise \n     buildings. In the United States alone, there are nearly \n     10,000 high-rise fires annually. These structures, when not \n     sprinklered, pose serious safety risks to both civilians and \n     firefighters.\n       It is an incontrovertible fact that fire sprinklers save \n     lives, including the lives of our firefighters. No \n     firefighter has ever died while fighting a fire in a fully \n     sprinklered structure. But unfortunately approximately 100 \n     firefighters die in the line of duty every year. We, as a \n     nation, owe it to our firefighters and their families to make \n     the profession as safe as possible. The Fire Sprinkler \n     Incentive Act will help us achieve that goal.\n       We strongly encourage all members of Congress to support \n     this important piece of legislation. Thank you for your \n     leadership on this issue, and best wishes on your continued \n     success and safety.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bill Webb,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 2069. A bill to amend the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of \n2009 to modify provisions relating to certain land exchanges in the Mt. \nHood Wilderness in the State of Oregon; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Mt. Hood Cooper \nSpur Land Exchange Clarification Act. This bill is a necessary step to \nensuring that the Cooper Spur land exchange on Mt. Hood proceeds as \nCongress originally intended when it passed as a part of the Omnibus \nPublic Lands Bill in 2009. I am pleased to introduce this bill with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley.\n  The Mt. Hood Cooper Spur land exchange was included in the Mt. Hood \nWilderness designation that passed 6 years ago as part of the Omnibus \nPublic Lands Act of 2009. The bill, which has now been law for over 6 \nyears, directed several land exchanges including the Cooper Spur land \nexchange.\n  The Cooper Spur land exchange required the Forest Service to transfer \napproximately 120 acres of Federal land to Mt. Hood Meadows in exchange \nfor approximately 770 acres of private land, with the goal of keeping \ndevelopment of Mt. Hood concentrated around the current development at \nGovernment Camp and ensuring the protection of the North side of the \nmountain. The swap was to be completed in 16 months. It is now 77 \nmonths later and the exchange has not moved forward. The delays have \nangered the public, endangered the environment, and have now spurred a \nlawsuit against the Forest Service.\n  The Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification Act would make \ntechnical corrections to the Original Cooper Spur land exchange \nprovisions in the Omnibus Public Lands Act to jumpstart the land \nexchange and keep the process moving forward so the exchange can \nfinally be completed, as originally intended.\n  I introduced the original Mt. Hood Wilderness proposal in 2004 and \nagain in 2006 and 2007 with my then-colleague Senator Gordon Smith of \nOregon. As the Wilderness proposal and associated land exchanges took \nshape, more than 1,700 constituents provided input on the proposal. It \nwas supported by members of the Oregon congressional delegation at the \ntime, then-Governor Kulongoski, the Bush administration, and over 100 \ncommunity groups. The Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land Exchange Clarification \nAct is supported by Mt. Hood Meadows, Friends of Hood River Valley, \nClackamas County, and Hood River County.\n  The Cooper Spur land exchange was an important part of the Mt. Hood \nWilderness designation to ensure the protection of the undeveloped \nNorth side of the mountain. In turn, the Mt. Hood Cooper Spur Land \nExchange Clarification Act is needed in order to ensure that the land \nexchange, a community-driven solution to the development challenges on \nMt. Hood, is finally completed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2069\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mount Hood Cooper Spur Land \n     Exchange Clarification Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 263\n\n       Whereas people in the United States are living longer, and \n     the cost of retirement is increasing significantly;\n       Whereas Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement \n     income for the great majority of the people of the United \n     States but was never intended by Congress to be the sole \n     source of retirement income for families;\n       Whereas recent data from the Employee Benefit Research \n     Institute indicates that, in the United States--\n       (1) only approximately \\2/3\\ of workers or the spouses of \n     the workers are saving for retirement; and\n       (2) the amount that workers have saved for retirement is \n     much less than the amount the workers need to adequately fund \n     their retirement years;\n       Whereas the financial literacy of workers in the United \n     States is important for the workers to understand the need to \n     save for retirement;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is a key component of overall \n     financial health and security during retirement years, and \n     the importance of financial literacy in planning for \n     retirement must be advocated;\n       Whereas many workers may not--\n       (1) be aware of the various options in saving for \n     retirement; or\n       (2) have focused on the importance of, and need for, saving \n     for retirement and successfully achieving retirement \n     security;\n       Whereas, although many employees have access through their \n     employers to defined benefit and defined contribution plans \n     to assist the employees in preparing for retirement, many of \n     the employees may not be taking advantage of those plans at \n     all or to the full extent allowed by Federal law;\n       Whereas saving for retirement is necessary even during \n     economic downturns or market declines, which makes continued \n     contributions all the more important;\n       Whereas all workers, including public and private sector \n     employees, employees of tax-exempt organizations, and self-\n     employed individuals, can benefit from developing personal \n     budgets and financial plans that include retirement savings \n     strategies that take advantage of tax-preferred retirement \n     savings vehicles;\n       Whereas effectively and sustainably withdrawing retirement \n     resources throughout the retirement years of an individual is \n     as important and crucial as saving and accumulating funds for \n     retirement; and\n       Whereas the week of October 18 through October 24, 2015 has \n     been designated as ``National Retirement Security Week'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Retirement \n     Security Week, including\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\n     raising public awareness of the importance of saving \n     adequately for retirement;\n       (2) acknowledges the need to raise public awareness of a \n     variety of tax-preferred retirement vehicles that are used by \n     many people in the United States but could be used by more; \n     and\n       (3) calls on States, localities, schools, universities, \n     nonprofit organizations, businesses, other entities, and the \n     people of the United States to observe National Retirement \n     Security Week with appropriate programs and activities, with \n     the goal of increasing the retirement savings and personal \n     financial literacy of all people in the United States, \n     thereby enhancing the retirement security of the people of \n     the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/22/senate-section/article/S6900-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 264--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 23, 2015, AS ``NATIONAL \n FALLS PREVENTION AWARENESS DAY'' TO RAISE AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGE THE \n                 PREVENTION OF FALLS AMONG OLDER ADULTS\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. McCaskill) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
