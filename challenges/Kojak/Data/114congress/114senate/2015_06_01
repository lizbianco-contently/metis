Mr. President, last night the Senate voted to advance \nthe House-passed FISA bill. We will have a vote on that legislation as \nsoon as we can. On our way there, we should take some commonsense steps \nto ensure the new system envisioned by that legislation--a system we \nwould soon have to rely upon to keep our country safe--will, in fact, \nactually work. The amendments filed last night would help do just that.\n  For example, one amendment would ensure that there is adequate time \nto build and test a system that doesn't yet exist. One amendment would \nensure that there is adequate time to build and test a system that \ndoesn't even exist yet. Another would require that once the new system \nis actually built, the Director of National Intelligence reviews it and \ncertifies that it actually works. I will say that again. The second \namendment would require that once the new system is actually built, the \nDirector of National Intelligence reviews the new system and certifies \nthat it will actually work. Amendment No. 3 would require simple \nnotification if the providers decide to change their data-retention \npolicies. It will just require them to notify us if the providers \ndecide to change their data-retention policies. Three amendments to \nimprove the bill.\n  These fixes are common sense, and whatever one thinks of the proposed \nnew system, there needs to be basic assurance that it will function as \nits proponents say it will. The Senate should adopt these basic \nsafeguards.\n  I had hoped to see committees working hard to advance bipartisan, \ncompromise FISA legislation this week, which is why I had offered \nseveral temporary extensions of the existing program to allow the space \nfor that to occur. But these proposed short-term extensions were either \nvoted down or objected to, including a very narrow extension of some of \nthe least controversial tools contained within the program that we are \nconsidering.\n  So this is where we are. It now falls on all of us to work diligently \nand responsibly to get the American people the best outcome that can be \nreasonably expected in this reality with which we are confronted. That \nis my commitment, and I know many of my colleagues share it as well.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner).

That family has had more than its \nshare of tragedy, but what it has produced is, in the case of Beau \nBiden, an extraordinary public servant who served his country not only \nby elected office but by serving in uniform as well.\n  Most of us in this Chamber know the Biden family. The dad and the now \nmom, Joe and Jill, are extraordinary human beings who have contributed \nso much. It is not necessarily easy to be in public service as long as \nthe Vice\n\n[[Page S3374]]\n\nPresident has been and still raise a family that is so extraordinarily \naccomplished and contributes so much. Then to have that eldest son \ntaken from him is like a dagger into our hearts.\n  So we grieve with the family. We grieve for them and with the Nation. \nI just wish to put that on the record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/senate-section/article/S3374-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL SECURITY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, we are here because the Senate is not \nfunctioning. We were here last night because the Senate is not \nfunctioning. Oh, it is functioning according to the rules, which say \nthat you have to go through this arcane procedure of cloture on the \nmotion to proceed and get 60 votes before you can ever get to the bill. \nOnce you get to the bill, then you file another motion for cloture. The \nSenate rules say that there are 30 hours that have to run unless, as \nhas been typical of Senate business, there is comity, there is \nunderstanding, and there is bipartisanship. But one Senator can \nwithhold unanimous consent, and that has been done--so the 30 hours.\n  Now, normally that may be standard procedure for the Senate, but it \nis getting in the way of our national security. At midnight last night \nthe law that allows our intelligence community to track the emails and \nthe phone calls of the terrorists evaporated. It won't be reenacted \nuntil sometime later this week because of the lack of unanimous \nconsent.\n  But this Senator from Florida is not putting it at the feet of just \nthe one Senator who is withholding the unanimous consent. This Senator \nfrom Florida is saying that this should have been planned on over a \nweek ago. This Senator is saying that we should have gone through the \nlaborious procedures--not assuming that we were going to have the votes \nlast night, not assuming that there was going to have comity and \nunanimous consent. This Senator thinks that we should have done this \nbecause of the urgency of national security.\n  It is interesting that this Senator from Florida comes to the floor \nwith mixed feelings. I voted for the Leahy bill, which is identical to \nthe House bill, but I did that because we didn't have any other choice. \nWhen I had another choice, I voted for Senator Burr's--the chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee--version, which was to continue \nexisting law. I did so because I clearly thought that was in the \ninterests of our national security.\n  But since that is not the prevailing vote of the Senate, we need to \nget on with it and pass the House bill. Then I would urge the chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, who is on the floor, that--down the \nline--the 6-month transitional period from the old law to the new law \nbe extended with a greater transition time to 12 or 18 months. I would \nfurther urge the chairman of the Intelligence Committee that as to a \nmajor flaw in the bill passed by the House, which we will eventually \npass this week, we add to it a requirement for a certain amount of time \nthat the telephone companies would have to keep those telephone \nbusiness records, so that if there is an urgency of national security \ngoing through the FISA Court, those records would be available to the \nintelligence community to trace the telephone calls of the terrorists. \nThat would be my recommendation, and I see the chairman nodding in \nsomewhat agreement.\n  I hope we will get on. I hope better hearts and minds will prevail \nand that we can collapse this period of darkness where there is no law \ngoverning emails, phone calls, cell phones, et cetera, as we try to \nprotect ourselves from the terrorists.\n  I would hope that this would be collapsed into a much shorter time \ninstead of having to wait until late Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday \nof this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 2048, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2048) to reform the authorities of the Federal \n     Government to require the production of certain business \n     records, conduct electronic surveillance, use pen registers \n     and trap and trace devices, and use other forms of \n     information gathering for foreign intelligence, \n     counterterrorism, and criminal purposes, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McConnell/Burr amendment No. 1449, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       McConnell amendment No. 1450 (to amendment No. 1449), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       McConnell amendment No. 1451 (to amendment No. 1450), \n     relating to appointment of amicus curiae.\n       McConnell/Burr amendment No. 1452 (to the language proposed \n     to be stricken by amendment No. 1449), of a perfecting \n     nature.\n       McConnell amendment No. 1453 (to amendment No. 1452), to \n     change the enactment date.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise while my good friend from Florida is \non the floor to say that I wish I could have a magic wand with which I \ncould collapse this time. But as he knows, under Senate rules, one \nMember can demand for the full 30 hours, and we are in a process like \nthat. My hope is that there will be accommodation as we go through this \nbecause I think most Members would like to resolve this.\n  Let me say specifically to his two points that there is a substitute \namendment that has the USA FREEDOM language with two additional pieces. \nThose two pieces are a 6-month notification to NSA by any telecom \ncompany that intends to change its retention program. As my good friend \nfrom Florida knows, in part, trying to move a bill is making sure we \nmove a bill that can be passed and accepted by the House of \nRepresentatives. Mandatory retention right now does not meet that \nthreshold. But I hope they will accept this requirement of notification \nof any change in their retention program, as well as a DNI \ncertification at the end of whatever the transition period is.\n  Now, there will be a first-degree and a second-degree amendment, in \naddition to that, made in order and germane. The first-degree amendment \nwill be to extend the transition period to 12 months. So we would go \nfrom 6 months--not to 2 years, as my colleague from Florida and I would \nprefer, and not to 18 but to 12. I think that is a happy spot for us to \nagree upon.\n\n  Then there will be a second-degree amendment to that to address some \nlanguage that is in the bill that makes it mandatory on the part of the \nJustice Department that they get a panel of amicus individuals. What we \nhave heard from the Justice Department and gotten a recommendation on \nis that that be voluntary on the part of the courts. We will second-\ndegree that first-degree amendment with that language provided to us by \nthe courts.\n  I would like to tell my colleague that by tomorrow afternoon, I hope, \nwe can have this complete and send it to the House, and by the time we \ngo to bed tomorrow night this might all be back in place.\n  I remind my colleagues that any law enforcement case that was in \nprogress is not affected by the suspension of the roving or ``lone-\nwolf'' provisions. They are grandfathered in so those investigations \ncan continue. But for the 48 hours we might be closed, it means they \nare going to delay the start of an investigation, if in fact they need \nthose two tools.\n  From the standpoint of the bulk data program, it means that is \nfrozen. It can't be queried for the period of time, but it hasn't gone \naway. Immediately, as we reinstitute the authorities in this program, \nthat additional data will be brought in and the process that NSA would \ngo through to query the data\n\n[[Page S3375]]\n\nwould, in fact, be available to the National Security Agency only--as \nis current law--once a FISA Court provides the authority for them to do \nit.\n  I think there are a lot of misstatements that have been made on this \nfloor. Let me just state for my colleagues what is collected. What is \nmetadata? It is a telephone number, it is a date, it is the time the \ncall was made, and it is the duration of the phone call.\n  Now, I am not sure how we have invaded anybody's privacy by getting a \ntelephone number that is deidentified. We don't know who it belongs to, \nand we would never know who it belongs to until it is turned over to \nlaw enforcement to investigate because it has now been connected to a \nknown foreign terrorist's telephone number.\n  Stop and think about this. The CFPB--a government agency--collects \nfinancial transactions on every American. There is nobody down here \ntrying to eliminate the CFPB. I would love to eliminate the CFPB \ntomorrow. But there is no outrage over it, and they collect a ton more \ninformation that is not deidentified. It is identified.\n  Every American has a discount card for their grocery store. You go in \nand you get a discount every time you use it. Your grocery store \ncollects 20 times the amount of data the NSA does--all identified with \nyou. There is a big difference between the NSA and your grocery store: \nWe don't sell your data at the NSA; your grocery store does.\n  Now, I am for outrage, but let's make it equal. Let's understand we \nare in a society where data is transferred automatically. The fact is, \nNo. 1, this is a program authorized by law, overseen by the Congress--\nHouse and Senate--and the executive branch at the White House. It is a \nprogram that has never had--never, never had--a privacy violation, not \none, in the time it has been in place.\n  Now, I am all for, if the American people say this is not a function \nwe believe government should be in--and I think that is what we have \nheard--and we are transferring this data over to the telecom companies, \nwhere no longer are there going to be a limited number of people who \ncan access that information. We are going to open it up to the telecom \ncompanies to search it in some way, shape or form. Whether they are \ntrained or untrained or how exactly they are going to do it, it is \ngoing to delay the amount of time it will take us to connect a dot to \nanother dot.\n  Mr. NELSON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, this is a good example of the chairman of \nthe intel committee, a Republican, and this Senator from Florida, a \nDemocrat and a former member of the intel committee, agreeing and being \nso frustrated--as was just exemplified by the Senator from North \nCarolina--that there is so much misunderstanding of what this \nlegislation does.\n  The fact is, as the chairman has just said, ``metadata''--a fancy \nterm--is nothing more than business records of the telephone company. A \ntelephone number is made to another telephone number on such and such a \ndate, at such and such a time, for such and such duration. That is all. \nWe don't know whom the call was from or to. It is when there is the \nsuspicion, through other things that are authorized by court order, \nthat the analyst can get in and open up as to what the content is in \norder to protect us.\n  Would the Senator from North Carolina agree there is so much \nmisunderstanding in the press, as has been reported, about how this is \nan invasion of privacy, as if the conversations were the ones that were \nbeing held by the National Security Agency? Would the Senator agree \nwith that statement?\n  Mr. BURR. I would agree exactly with that statement. The collection \nhas nothing to do with the content of a call. To do that would take an \ninvestigation into an individual and an additional court process that \nwould probably be pursued by the FBI, not the NSA, to look at the \ncontent.\n  I think when the American people see this thing dissected, in \nreality, they will see that my telephone number without my name isn't \nreally an intrusion, the time the call was made really isn't an \nintrusion, the duration of the call really isn't an intrusion, and now \nI know they are not collecting anything that was said, that there is no \ncontent in it and that this metadata base is only telephone numbers.\n  There is a legitimate question the American people ask: Why did we \ncreate this program? Well, it was created in the Department of Defense. \nIt was transferred over to the intelligence community. The purpose of \nit was in real time to be able to search or query a massive amount of \ndata.\n  A few weeks ago, we, the United States, went into Syria and we got a \nbad guy. And we got hard drives and we got telephones and we got a lot \nof SIM cards. Those telephone numbers now, hopefully--don't know but \nhopefully--we are testing them in the metadata base to see if those \nphones talked to anybody in the United States. Why? I think the \nAmerican people want us to know if terrorists are talking to somebody \nin this country. I think they really do want us to know that.\n  What we have tried to do since 9/11 is to structure something that \nlives within the law or a Presidential directive that gives us that \nhead start in identifying who that individual is. But we only do it \nthrough telephone numbers, the date of the call, and the length of the \ncall. We don't do it through listening to content.\n  That is why I think it is healthy for us to have this debate. I think \nmy good friend from Florida shares my frustration. We are changing a \nprogram that didn't have a problem and didn't need to be changed, and \nwe are accepting a lower threshold of our ability to intercept that \nindividual in the United States who might have the intention of \ncarrying out some type of an attack.\n  Now, I would only say this. I don't believe the threat level has \ndropped to a point where we can remove some of the tools. If anything, \nthe threat level has gotten higher, and one would think we would be \ntalking about an expansion of tools. But I accept the fact that this \ndebate has gotten to a point where a bulk data storage capacity within \nthe government is not going to be continued long term.\n  I would say to my good friend, who I think agrees with me, that \nalthough I believe 24 months is a safer transition period, hopefully \nour friends in the House will see 12 months as a good agreement between \nthe two bodies. That 12-month agreement I think would give me \nconfidence knowing we have taken care of the technology needed for the \ntelecoms to search in real time their numbers.\n  Now, make no mistake, this will be a delay from where we currently \nare. I can't get into the classified nature of how long it takes us to \nquery a database, given the way we do it, but there is no question this \nwill lengthen the amount of time it takes us to connect the dots. \nTherefore, for something that might be in an operational mode, we may \nor may not hit that. That is a concern. But this is certainly something \nwe can go back and look at as time goes on.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield.\n  Mr. BURR. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NELSON. Has the Senator heard many times from the press: Well, \nnobody has come forward and shown us one case in which the holding of \nthese telephone business bulk records has paid off. Has the Senator \nheard that statement by the press?\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator has heard that statement by the press and has \nheard it made by Members of this body.\n  Mr. NELSON. Has the Senator come to the conclusion that with regard \nto the holding of that data and the many cases that are classified, \nthat that data has protected this country from terrorists by virtue of \njust the example he gave of terrorist records apprehended in the raid \nin Syria a couple of weeks ago and that those telephone numbers may \nwell be like mining gold in finding other terrorists who want to hit \nus?\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator hits on a great point, and let me state it this \nway. Would any Member of the Intelligence Committee be on the floor \nbattling to keep this program, if, in fact, in our oversight capacity, \nwe had looked at a program that was absolutely worthless? Would we \nexpend any capital to do that? The answer is, no, we wouldn't.\n  We are down here battling on the floor, those of us either on the \ncommittee or who have been on the committee since 9/11, because we have \nseen the impact of this program. We know what it has enabled us to do \nand we\n\n[[Page S3376]]\n\nknow what happens when we get a trove of technology in our hands that \ngives us the ability to see whether it was tied to somebody--whether we \nknew about them or we didn't.\n  The fact is, when you have groups such as ISIL today, that are saying \non social media: Don't come to Syria, stay in the United States, stay \nin Europe, go buy a gun, here are 100 law enforcement officers, here \nare 100 military folks, that is how you can carry out the jihad, it \nmakes the use of the tool we are talking about even more important \nbecause no longer do we get to look at no-fly lists, no longer do we \nget to look at individuals who have traveled or who intend to travel to \nSyria. It is individuals who grew up in neighborhoods that we never \nworried about. And the only way we will be able to find out about them \nis if we connect the conversation they have had or just the fact that a \nconversation took place, and then law enforcement can begin to peel the \nonion back with the proper authorities--the proper court order--to \nbegin to look at whether this is a person we need to worry about.\n  The Senator from Florida is 100 percent correct that this is \ninvaluable to the overall defense of this country.\n  Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, and I \nwill conclude with this.\n  The American people need to understand there is so much agreement \nbehind the closed doors on the Intelligence Committee, as they are \ninvested with the oversight of what is going on in order to protect our \nblessed country. My plea now is we would get to the point that as the \nchairman has suggested, even by waiting until tomorrow, we can collapse \nthis time and get on to passing this by sending down some minor \nmodifications to the House that they can accept, then get it to the \nPresident so this important program that tries to protect us from \nterrorists can continue.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank my good friend from Florida for his willingness to \ncome to the floor and talk facts.\n  I see my good friend from Arizona here. Before I yield, let me just \nrestate what the Senator from Florida asked me, which was, geez, we \nneed a longer transition period and we need something addressed on the \ndata that is held.\n  I say for my colleagues that there will be three votes at some point. \nOne will be on a substitute amendment. It has the exact same language \nas the USA FREEDOM bill. It makes two changes to the USA FREEDOM bill. \nIt has a requirement that the telecoms notify the government 6 months \nin advance of any change in the retention program for their data, which \nI think is very reasonable. The second would be that it requires the \nDirector of National Intelligence to certify, on whatever the \ntransition date is, that the software that needs to be provided to the \ntelecoms has been provided so that search can go through.\n  In addition to that, there will be two other amendments. The first \nwill deal with expanding the transition period from the current 6 \nmonths in the USA FREEDOM bill to 12 months. Again, I would have \npreferred 24 months. We have settled on 12 months. The last thing is \nthat it would change the current amicus language in the bill to reflect \nsomething provided to us by the courts. It was the court's \nrecommendation that we change it. This would be easier to fit within a \nprogram that has a time sensitivity to it.\n  So as we go through the debate today, as we go through tomorrow, \nhopefully we will have three amendments that pass, and we can report \nthis bill out shortly after lunch tomorrow if everything works well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Bob Schieffer\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute today to CBS \nbroadcaster Bob Schieffer, who retired yesterday as the moderator of \nthe most watched Sunday news show, ``Face the Nation,'' after a career \nin journalism that lasted more than half a century. Bob reported from \nDallas that terrible weekend President Kennedy was assassinated. At \nthat time, he was with the Fort Worth Star Telegram. He was CBS's \nPentagon correspondent, congressional correspondent, White House \ncorrespondent, and chief Washington correspondent. He anchored the \n``CBS Evening News'' at a time of transition and turmoil at the \nnetwork. For 24 years he moderated ``Face the Nation,'' which became \nmore popular every year Bob ran the show. He tried to retire before, \nseveral times. CBS begged him to stay. That is an impressive run by \nanyone's standards, all the more so considering Bob is probably the \nmost respected and popular reporter in the country.\n  Familiarity might not always breed contempt, but it is certainly not \na guarantee of enduring public admiration--except in Bob's case. The \npublic's regard for Bob Schieffer never seemed to waver or even level \noff. He grew in stature the longer his career lasted. Not many of us \ncan say that. The secret to his success, I suspect, is pretty simple: \nAmericans just like Bob Schieffer. They like him a lot and trust him. \nThat is pretty rare in his profession, which, like ours, has fallen \nprecipitously in recent years in the esteem of the American people. I \nthink it is attributable to the personal and professional values he \nhonestly and seemingly effortlessly represented, old-fashioned values \nthat in this modern communications age make him stand out.\n  Bob is courteous and respectful to the people he reports on and \ninterviews. There are people in his profession who disdain that \napproach to journalism, but I doubt they will ever be as good at the \njob as Bob Schieffer was. He looked to get answers to questions the \npublic had a right and a need to have answered. He was dogged in \npursuit of those answers, and more often than not he succeeded. But he \nwasn't sarcastic or cynical. He wasn't rude. He didn't show off. He \ndidn't do ``gotcha'' journalism. He was fair, he was honest, and he was \nvery good at his job. He asked good questions, and he kept asking them \nuntil he got answers. He was determined to get at the truth not for the \nsake of one-upping you or embarrassing you but because that was a \njournalist's responsibility in a free society. If he caught someone \nbeing evasive or dishonest or pompous, he would persist long enough for \nthem to expose themselves. He didn't yell or talk over them or insult \nthem. He didn't need to.\n  I don't know how he votes. Most people in his profession have \npolitical views to the left of my party, and it wouldn't surprise me if \nBob does, too. Almost all reporters claim they keep their personal \nviews out of their reporting, but not many do it successfully, be they \nliberal or conservative. The best do, and Bob Schieffer is the best. I \nnever once felt I had been treated unfairly by him because he disagreed \nwith me. I think most Republicans Bob interviewed would say the same.\n  He moderated Presidential debates without receiving any criticism--or \nat least any deserved criticism--for loading his questions with his own \nviews or mediating exchanges between candidates to favor one over the \nother. He was the model of a successful moderator, intent on informing \nthe electorate, not drawing attention to himself. That is not to say he \ndidn't make an impression on his audience. He did. He impressed them, \nas he always did, with his fairness, his honesty, and his restraint.\n  It is no secret that I have made an occasional appearance on a Sunday \nmorning show. No doubt I have enjoyed those experiences more than some \nof my colleagues have enjoyed watching them. Some people might think I \nshould take up golf or find something else to do with my Sunday \nmornings. I may have to now that Bob has retired.\n  I have appeared on ``Face the Nation'' over 100 times--more than any \nother guest. I acknowledge there are viewers who would prefer to see \nsomeone else claim that distinction. Too bad. I have the record, and I \nthink I will have it for a while. I am kidding--sort of. But I am not \nkidding about my appreciation for Bob Schieffer and the opportunity he \ngave me and everyone who appeared on his show to communicate our views \non issues without a third party editing or misconstruing them and to \nhave those views tested by a capable, probing, and fair interviewer, \nwhich Bob Schieffer certainly was.\n\n[[Page S3377]]\n\n  He is something else, too, in addition to being a very good and very \nfair reporter. He is a good guy. And there are never enough of those \naround. I am going to miss spending the occasional Sunday morning with \nhim.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I gathered Saturday night in Springfield, \nIL, with my wife and a group of close friends at the retirement party \nof Ann Dougherty, who served me so well here in the Senate office and \nin the congressional office in Springfield. It was a great night with a \nlot of enjoyment. That was interrupted by the sad news of the passing \nof Beau Biden. One of my other staffers came up and said that Beau \nBiden had passed away here in Washington on Saturday evening.\n  Beau, of course, the oldest son of Vice President Joe Biden, had been \nsuffering from a serious cancer illness--brain cancer--for some period \nof time. Most of us knew there was something terribly wrong when we \napproached the Vice President about his son's illness, and Joe--the \nVice President--in very hushed terms would say, ``Pray for him.''\n  We knew he was in a life struggle, but the fact that he would lose \nhis life Saturday evening at age 46 is a personal and family tragedy. \nIt is a tragedy which is compounded by the extraordinary person Beau \nBiden was. This young, 46-year-old man had achieved so many things in \nlife. First and foremost, he had married Hallie--a wonderful marriage, \ntwo beautiful children. He was part of that expanded and warm Biden \nfamily.\n  He was known to most people around America by his introduction of his \nfather at the Democratic National Convention. It was not a customary \npolitical introduction; it was an introduction of love by a son who \ntruly loved his father. Beau Biden told the story of his mother's \nuntimely death in an auto accident with his sister and how he and his \nbrother Hunter had survived and drew closer to their father as they \ngrew up.\n  Jill Biden married Joe at a later date, and the family expanded. As \nyou watched this family in the world of politics, they were just \ndifferent. They were so close and loving of one another that you knew \nthere was an extraordinary bond there.\n  Beau Biden made his father proud and all of us proud in the \ncontributions he made, first as attorney general in Delaware and then \nin his service with the Delaware National Guard, actually being posted \noverseas in harm's way and earning a Bronze Star for the extraordinary \nservice he gave to our country. That is why his loss is felt on so many \ndifferent levels. This life was cut short--a life which could have led \nto so many great things in public service beyond his service to the \nState of Delaware. But, in a way, it is a moment to reflect on this \nfamily, this Biden family.\n  I have been in politics for a long time, and I have met a lot of \ngreat people in both political parties, extraordinary people. I have \nnever met someone quite like Vice President Joe Biden.\n  A friend of mine, a colleague from Illinois, Marty Russo, served in \nthe U.S. House of Representatives for several decades. He was a friend \nof Joe Biden's. When Marty Russo's son was diagnosed with leukemia, \nMarty Russo called Joe Biden, who was then a Senator from Delaware. Joe \nBiden not only called Marty Russo's son but continued to call and visit \nhim on a regular basis.\n  His empathy and caring for other people is so extraordinary. I don't \nknow that there is another person quite like him in public life. The \nonly one I can think of who rivaled him was Ted Kennedy, who had the \nsame empathy. And, as I reflect on it, both of them had in their lives \nexamples of personal tragedy and family tragedy, which I am sure made \nthem more sensitive to the losses and suffering of others.\n  Joe Biden is the kind of person who does things in politics that \nreally are so unusual in the level of compassion he shows. I can recall \none time a year or two ago when we were setting out on a trip together \nthat was canceled at the last minute. I called him and said: I am sorry \nwe can't go together. I had hoped during the course of that trip to ask \nyou to make a special phone call to the mother of one of my staffers \nwho was celebrating her 90th birthday.\n  She was the wife of a disabled World War II veteran who had raised a \nlarge Irish Catholic family, the Hoolihan family, and I wanted Joe \nBiden to wish her a happy birthday.\n  Well, we didn't make the trip and I didn't get a chance to hand him \nthe phone, but he took down the information, and as soon as he hung up \nthe phone from talking to me, he called her.\n  He was on the phone with her for 30 minutes, talking about her \nfamily, his family, and thanking her for making such a great \ncontribution to this country. It is the kind of person Joe Biden is and \nJill, his wife, the same. How many times in my life and in others has \nshe stepped forward to show a caring heart at a moment when it really, \nreally counted.\n  The loss of Beau Biden is the loss of a young man who was destined \nfor even greater things in public life, but it is another test of a \ngreat family, the Biden family, a test which I am sure they will pass \nand endure, not without a hole in their hearts for the loss of this \ngreat young man but with a growing strength that brings them together \nand inspires the rest of us to remember the real priorities in life--\nlove of family and love of those who need a caring heart at an \nimportant moment.\n\n\n                     Ukraine, Lithuania, and Poland\n\n  Mr. President, I just returned from a visit to Ukraine, Lithuania, \nand Poland this last week. I went there to assess the ongoing Russian \nthreat to our friends and NATO partners in Eastern Europe. What I saw \nwas uplifting but deeply disturbing.\n  Most urgently is the so-called Minsk II treaty agreement reached in \nFebruary between Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and France to bring an end \nto the fighting in Eastern Europe. This agreement was supposed to end \nthe bloodshed in Ukraine, allow for the return of prisoners, ensure a \npullback of heavy weapons, begin preparations for local elections, and \nreturn control of Ukraine's borders to the Ukraine.\n  I am sorry to report that this agreement has not lived up to its \npromise. The blame rests squarely, and not surprisingly, with the \ninvading forces of Russia. Not only does fighting continue in Ukraine \non a regular basis but Reuters recently reported that Russia is \namassing troops and hundreds of pieces of weaponry, including mobile \nrocket launchers, tanks and artillery at a makeshift base near the \nUkrainian border.\n  The equipment, along with Russian military personnel, had identifying \nmarks and insignia that the Russians tried to remove to try to hide \ntheir real culpability. At this point, perhaps the only people in the \nworld who do not believe Russia is behind the mayhem, human suffering, \nand displacement of innocent people in eastern Ukraine are the Russian \npeople who have been lied to over and over again about what is actually \ngoing on with this invasion of Ukraine.\n  President Putin has repeatedly lied to his own people about Russian \nsoldiers fighting in Ukraine. He has lied to them about what started \nthis conflict, and he has lied to them about the treatment of ethnic \nRussians outside of Russia's borders. Yet, as more and more Russian \nsoldiers have been killed in fighting, Putin has struggled to explain \nthis dangerous and cynical canard to the families of those killed in \nthe war.\n  Most recently, last week, he even went so far as to make it illegal \nin Russia to report war deaths--incredible.\n  Yet, while I was there--as if anyone needed proof--two Russian \nsoldiers were captured deep inside of eastern Ukraine. They had killed \nat least one Ukrainian soldier, and when it appeared they were about to \nbe caught--listen to this--when it appeared they were about to be \ncaptured by the\n\n[[Page S3378]]\n\nUkrainians, they were fired upon by their own Russian forces, an effort \nto kill them before they could be captured. These soldiers have \ndisclosed that they are in the Russian military and carried ample \nevidence on their persons to support the now obvious truth that Russia \nis squarely behind perpetuating this invasion and conflict.\n  Mr. Putin, if you are going to drag your country into war to \nperpetuate your own political power, you ought to at least have the \nhonesty to tell the Russian people the truth about that war, \nparticularly those families of Russian soldiers most affected by this \nconflict. Going back to the old Soviet playbook of lies and \ndisinformation is an insult to the Russian families whose young men are \nbeing sent into your war.\n  So it is clear the Minsk agreement is in jeopardy. It is critical \nthat the European Union now renew its sanctions in response to Russia's \nillegal aggression. We in the United States should continue to work \nwith our key NATO allies to ensure that Ukraine succeeds as a free \ndemocratic state and that NATO members are protected against Russian \nprovocations--more on that in a moment.\n  Not everything in Ukraine is negative. The new government coalition \nis working tirelessly to reform the nation and provide a model of free \nmarket democracy on Russia's borders. Perhaps that is why Putin is \ntrying so hard to undermine Ukraine. Decades of corruption, bribery, \ninefficiency, and bureaucracy are being tackled by this new government. \nSecurity services are being reformed. Ukrainians are starting to free \nthemselves from the stranglehold of dependence on Russian natural gas.\n  Keep in mind all of this is occurring while Russia has largely \ndestroyed a key industrial section in Ukraine. Try to imagine \nrebuilding a neglected and corrupted economy in the midst of fighting a \nwar against one of the world's superpowers, Russia, and losing key \nengines of a nation's economy. That is what the Ukrainians are up \nagainst. They have risked so much for a better future; one that is open \nand connected to the rest of the free world. Why this was and is such a \nthreat to Russia I will never fully understand.\n  I will say one thing that Mr. Putin did not count on. His invasion of \nUkraine has unified that country in a way that I could not have \nimagined even last year. You see, there was a question which direction \nUkraine would go, West or East. The people of Ukraine stopped the \nformer Prime Minister, Yanukovych, in his efforts to move toward Moscow \nbelieving that their future should be in the West, but there was \ndivided opinion even within Ukraine until Vladimir Putin invaded. At \nthat point, the people of Ukraine realized their future was in the \nWest. They looked to the West, to the European Union, to America, not \nonly for support in this conflict but for inspiration as to what their \nfuture may hold.\n  I was proud to see what our Nation has been doing in Ukraine. Under \nPresident Obama, we have provided significant nonlethal supplies and \nassistance to Ukraine and its military. In fact, we lead the world in \nsupporting Ukraine's efforts to revitalize their economy and to \nstrengthen their military. We have led that fight on establishing \nsanctions on Russia and making sure they are not lifted until Russia \nstops this invasion.\n  In the town of Lviv, in western Ukraine, we have 300 U.S. Army \npersonnel training Ukrainian National Guardsmen. I had the privilege of \nmeeting with our forces, our American forces, these trainers and the \ntrainees. I must say it was amazing.\n  Now, listen, some of these Ukrainian National Guardsmen whom we are \ntraining had just returned from battle in the eastern part of Ukraine. \nOne had been captured by the Russians for 5 days. They had been under \ngunfire and fighting in combat against the Russians and their skilled \nmilitary who are being sent into an area called the Donbass.\n  After they were relieved from that responsibility in the east, they \nwere brought back west to this training camp with America's best in \nterms of our Army leadership. It turns out the basic training these \nUkrainians should have had before they went into battle was never given \nto them. So now, coming back from battle, our soldiers were trying to \ngive them the basic training to make sure they could survive if sent to \nbattle again and bring home their comrades in the process. They were \ndeeply, deeply grateful for that training, and our men and women \nworking there to train them were so proud to be part of this effort. I \ncommend this effort. I thank the President for extending America's hand \nto help the Ukrainian military be trained so they can survive and repel \nthis Russian aggression.\n  I went on to Lithuania and Poland. It was also clear the Russian \nbullying and aggression is not limited to Ukraine. In both Lithuania \nand Poland, these frontline NATO partners face a steady stream of \nRussian vitriol and military threats. Russian planes recklessly buzz \nNATO airspace, Russian leaders make threats of capturing cities like \nVilnius, the capital of Lithuania, and dangerous missiles were moved \ninto the Russian region of Kaliningrad, bordering both Lithuania and \nPoland. All the while, a steady stream of sophisticated yet crude \nRussian propaganda flows from its state-run media services.\n  I happened to be in Berlin at an Aspen conference not that long ago--\njust a few months ago--when we were moving NATO equipment and forces in \na parade--a scheduled parade--of our military in NATO through Poland \nand the Baltics. There was a cable channel called RT, which stands for \nRussia Today, that was broadcasting what they called protesters \nprotesting the presence of NATO soldiers and equipment. RT reported \nthat these protesters were holding signs--and they showed small groups \nof them--saying, ``NATO, stop your invasion of the Baltics.''\n  Well, it turns out that was a phony. When I went there, I got the \nreal story. In every town these NATO forces went through with their \nequipment, they were welcomed like conquering heroes. Women were \nholding out flowers and candy, and children were applauding as they \nwent by, holding flags of Poland and of the United States. But RT, the \nRussia Today cable channel, was trying to twist the story and make it \nlook as if the U.S. presence there was resented, when in fact it was \nwelcomed.\n  The stakes here are very high. Putin is pumping Russian language \nincitement into areas of Europe where ethnic Russian populations live. \nHe is promoting a message of victimhood and trying to justify further \nbelligerence. What an insult to the talented and proud and outstanding \nRussian people.\n  I was pleased to see that the U.S. and NATO forces are maintaining \nregular rotations in these frontline nations. We are boosting our \nBaltic Air Patrol to protect the airspace and working with NATO allies \nto boost their own defenses.\n  One of the most amazing things in both Lithuania and Poland was the \nunequivocal request of the governments in those countries for the \nUnited States to have an even larger military presence in those \ncountries. They are worried. They want to make sure NATO is there if \nthey need it, and they think as long as the United States is there, \nthey have more confidence about their future.\n  I had to tell them we are having our budget issues here. We are not \ntalking about expanding U.S. military bases anywhere in the world at \nthis point. We are trying to maintain our own military. It was \nheartwarming to think that they still believe in the United States as \nthe one 911 number in the world that you want to call if you ever have \na challenge.\n  It is a dangerous and tragic state of affairs in this part of the \nworld. I was glad to see it firsthand and to reassure those leaders in \nPoland, Lithuania, and Ukraine that the United States shares their \nvalues and cares for their future.\n  What we have seen is an effort by Putin to undermine decades of \nsecurity arrangements in Europe while perpetuating an insulting image \nof victimhood. He has challenged the entire West and its democratic \nsystems. We cannot let him succeed, for Ukraine, for NATO, even for his \nown people. Despite our disagreements in Congress, I hope we can \ncontinue to provide strong funding for support to Ukraine and NATO.\n  I met with a group of eight members of the Parliament in Ukraine. \nTheir Parliament is called the Rada. Of these eight members, at least \nsix of them--maybe seven--were brand new to this business. They had \ncome out of the protests in the Maidan--which is a\n\n[[Page S3379]]\n\nlarge square in downtown Kiev, Ukraine--where the protesters had ousted \nthe former government, installed a new government, and risked their \nlives to do it. Some lost their lives in the process. There were so \nmany of those young people sitting across the table from me who 6 or 8 \nmonths ago had nothing to do with politics. They had jobs and they were \nartists and they were involved in their community, but they were so \ninspired by what they saw in the Maidan that they decided to run for \nParliament. Now these young people are tackling the toughest issues \nthat any government can tackle: ending the corruption, reforming their \ngovernment, saving their economy, fighting the Russians on the eastern \nborder.\n  It humbled me in a way. I have given so much of my life to Congress \nand the legislative process, and I thought how many times we find \nourselves tied up in knots, just as we are today, with little or \nnothing happening on this floor of the U.S. Senate when there are so \nmany challenges we face across this Nation. I thought about them, \nsitting in Kiev not knowing if tomorrow or the day after or a week \nafter they would have to face an invasion of the Russians coming across \ntheir country trying to capture it. Yet they have the courage and \ndetermination to press on, to try to build a better country for the \nfuture, inspired by their own people who took to the streets to reclaim \ntheir nation.\n  Well, I left with some inspiration on my own part. I hope to \nencourage this administration to show even more support for the \nUkrainians and to make it clear to our NATO allies that we will stand \nwith them, as we have for so many decades, in the pursuit of democratic \nvalues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). The Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise to address the bill before us, the \nUSA FREEDOM Act, and its predecessor, the PATRIOT Act. Before talking \nabout the specifics of those bills, I will try to address the \nhistorical context of what it is we are wrestling with and why it is so \nhard.\n  What we are really trying to do in this body this week is to balance \ntwo critical constitutional provisions. The first is in the preamble, \nwhich is to provide for the common defense and ensure domestic \ntranquility. That is a fundamental purpose of this government. It is a \nfundamental purpose of any government--to provide for the common \ndefense and ensure domestic tranquility. That is national security, and \nit is in the very core preamble to the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Of course, the other provisions are found in the Bill of Rights, \nparticularly in the Fourth Amendment, which talks about the rights of \nthe people to be secure in their persons and papers from unreasonable \nsearches and seizures. ``Unreasonable'' is a key word. The people who \ndrafted our Constitution were geniuses and every word counts. The word \nwas ``unreasonable.'' So there is no absolute right to privacy, just as \nthere is no absolute right to national security. We have to try to find \nthe right balance, and that is what we have to do year in and year out, \ndecade in and decade out, in relation to developments in technology and \ndevelopments in terms of the threats which we face. It is a calibration \nthat we have to continue to try to make.\n  Now, I have been concerned, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, about the retention of large quantities of telephone data by \nthe government. I think the program under which that data has been \nanalyzed is important, and I will talk about that in a few minutes. I \nshare the concern of many in this body who feel that simply having and \nretaining all of that information in government computers, even though \nit was hedged about with various protections and even though there were \nrequirements for how it was to be accessed--and the level of attention \nto the detail of that access was important--and there is no evidence \nthat it had ever been abused, was a danger to the liberty of our \ncountry. I feel the same as many of the Members of this body who have \nexpressed that concern. Therefore, the USA FREEDOM Act, which we have \nbefore us now, proposes to move to leave the data with the phone \ncompanies. Instead of the government collecting and having it in the \ngovernment's hands, the data will be in the phone companies. If it is \nnecessary to access that information for national security purposes, \nthe government will have to go through the process of going through the \nJustice Department and the court in order to get permission to access \nthat data.\n  Why shouldn't the government simply hold it? I am a subscriber to \nLord Acton's famous maxim that ``power tends to corrupt, and absolute \npower corrupts absolutely.''\n  While the current administration or the prior administration may have \nno inclination to misuse that data, we have no idea what may come in \nthe future, what pressures there may be, what political pressures there \nmay be. Therefore, it struck me as sensible to get it out of \ngovernment's hands.\n  The trouble I have had with the USA FREEDOM Act is that I felt it \nwent too far in the other direction because there was no requirement in \nthe bill, as it passed the House, that the phone companies retain and \nhold the data for any particular period of time. They now hold it, as a \nmatter of business practice, for 18 months to 2 years, which is all \nthat is necessary in order to have the data available for a national \nsecurity search if necessary. The problem is that there is no \nrequirement that they maintain that level of retention.\n  In fact, in an open hearing, one of the vice presidents of one of the \ncarriers said categorically: We will not accept a limitation on how \nlong we have to hold the data. I think that is a glaring weakness in \nthe USA FREEDOM Act, and, in fact, it led me to vote against the \nconsideration of the motion to proceed when it came up last week.\n  Today or tomorrow--whenever the timing works out--there will be a \nseries of amendments proposed by the Senator from North Carolina, the \nchair of the Intelligence Committee, designed to deal with several of \nthese technical but very important aspects of this program. One of \nthose amendments would require the carriers--if they decide to hold the \ndata for a shorter period of time--to notify the government, notify the \nCongress, and we could then make a decision as to whether we thought \nthat some additional required period of retention would be necessary in \norder to adequately protect our national security. Another amendment \nthat I understand is going to be proposed is that the transition period \nfrom the current program to the private carriers holding the data will \nbe extended from 6 months to 1 year, simply because this is a major, \nHerculean technical task to develop the software to be sure that this \ninformation will be available for national security purposes on a \ntimely basis.\n  Now, the final question, and the one we have been debating and \ndiscussing here is this: Is it an important program? Is it worth \nmaintaining? There has been a lot of argument that if you can't point \nto a specific plot that was specifically foiled by this narrow \nprovision, then we don't need it at all. I don't buy that. It is part \nof our national security toolkit.\n  It is interesting to talk about the history of this provision. It \ncame into being shortly after September 11, because a gap in our \nsecurity analysis ability was identified at that time, and that was \nthat we could not track phone connections--not content, and I will talk \nabout that in a minute--between the people who were preparing for the \nSeptember 11 attack. For that reason, the section 215 program was \ninvented.\n  I want to stop for just a moment and make clear to the American \npeople that this program does not collect or listen to or otherwise \nhave anything to do with the content of phone calls.\n  As I talked to people in Maine and they approached me about this, \nthey said: We don't want the government listening to all of our phone \ncalls. The answer is: They don't. This program does not convey and has \nnot conveyed any such authority. We are talking about a much more \nnarrow ability to determine whether a particular phone number called \nanother phone number, the duration and date of that phone call, and \nthat is it.\n  An example of its usefulness was at the Boston Marathon bombing. The \ntwo brothers perpetrated that horrendous attack in Boston in April of \n2013. This program allowed the authorities to check their phone numbers \nto see if they were in touch with other people in the country so they \ncould determine\n\n[[Page S3380]]\n\nwhether this was a nationwide plot or whether it was simply these two \nguys in Boston. That, I will submit, is an important and--some would \nsay--critical piece of information. It turned out that they were acting \non their own, but had there been connections with other similarly \ninclined people in the country at that time, that would have been \nimportant information for us to know, and that is the way this program \nis used.\n  Is it absolutely critical and indispensable in solving these cases? I \ndon't think anybody can argue that that is the case. Is it important \nand useful as a part of the national security toolkit? Yes, \nparticularly when the invasion of privacy, if you will, is so limited \nand really so narrowly defined. I liken it to a notebook that a police \nofficer carries at the scene of a crime. A detective goes to the scene \nof a crime, takes out his notebook, and writes some notes. If we said \nthat detectives can no longer carry notebooks, would it eliminate law \nenforcement's ability to solve crimes? No, but would it limit a tool \nthat was helpful to them in solving that crime or another crime? The \nanswer, I think, would be yes.\n  We should not take a tool away that is useful and important unless \nthere is some compelling argument on the other side. Since we are not \ntalking about the content of the phone conversations--we are simply \ntalking about which number called which other number, and it can only \nbe accessed through a process that involves the Justice Department and \nthen permission from the court--I think it is a program that is worthy \nof protection and useful to this country, and I think it is \nparticularly important now.\n  It is ironic that we are talking about, in effect, unilaterally \ndisarming to this extent at a time when the threat to this country has \nnever been greater and the nature of the threat is changing. September \n11 is what I would call terrorism 1.0, a plot that was hatched abroad. \nThe people who perpetrated it were smuggled into the country in various \nways. They had a specific target and a specific plot that they were \nworking on. That is terrorism 1.0, September 11. Terrorism 2.0 is a \nplot that is hatched abroad but communicated directly to people in the \nUnited States who are part of the jihadist group. But now we are on to \nterrorism 3.0, which is ISIS sending out what amounts to a terrorist \nAPB to no particular person but to anyone in this country who has been \nradicalized by themselves or by the Internet. There is no direct \nconnection between them and ISIS. It might be a Facebook post. That \nperson then takes up arms and tries to kill Americans, and that is what \ntheir intent is. That is the hardest situation for us to counteract, \nand that is a situation where this ability to track numbers calling \nnumbers can be extremely useful. In fact, it might be the only useful \ntool because we are not going to have the kind of specific plotting \nthat we have seen in the past.\n  This is the most dangerous threat that I think we face today. To \nthrow aside a protection or a safeguard that I believe passes \nconstitutional and legal muster and goes the extra mile to protect the \nprivacy rights of Americans by getting this data out of the hands of \nthe government and that is worthy of the support and the active work in \nthis Chamber to find that balance--the balance between the imperative, \nthe most solemn responsibility we have in this body, which is to \nprovide for the common defense and ensure domestic tranquility, and to \nprotect the safety and security of the people of this country in light \nof the constitutional limitations in the Bill of Rights that protect \nour individual liberties that make us who we are--we can do both \nthings. There is never going to be a final answer to this question. But \nwhat we have to do is just what we are doing this week, and that is to \nassess the threats, assess the technology developments, and try to find \nthe right calibration and the right balance that will allow us to meet \nthat most solemn of our responsibilities.\n  I look forward, hopefully, to the consideration of amendments later \neither today or tomorrow and look forward to what I hope will be a \nquick passage of this legislation in the next 24 to 48 hours so we can \nlook our constituents and the people of this country in the eyes and \nsay: We took the responsibility to protect your security seriously, and \nwe also took seriously your rights, your liberty, and your \nunderstanding that the government is not going to impinge unreasonably \nin any way in violation of the principles of this Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Senator from \nMaine, a committed member of the Committee on Intelligence, and one who \nhas been vitally involved in the oversight of section 215.\n  I think what has been left out of the debate is that 15 Members of \nthe U.S. Senate have actively carried out oversight. This is probably \none of the most looked at programs that exists within the jurisdiction \nof the Intelligence Committee. There are a couple more that probably \nget more constant attention, but this is not a program that is used \nthat frequently. I think that is the key point.\n  I wish to reiterate some of the issues Senator King brought up. We \nare not listening to people's phone calls. There is no content \ncollected.\n  This program expired last night at midnight. That means the database \ncannot be queried, regardless of if we find a terrorist telephone \nnumber. I think it is important to remind my colleagues and the \nAmerican people that this is all triggered by a nonterrorist number \noutside of the United States.\n  Now, in the case of the Tsarnaev brothers, we had the telephone \nnumber outside the country, and we wanted to see whether the connection \nhad been made, so there was direction in that case. But this is \ntriggered by not just going through the database and looking at who \nAmericans are calling and trying to figure something out, it is \ntriggered by a known foreign terrorist's telephone number, and we \nsearched to see whom they may have contacted in the United States.\n  Now, the FISA Court only allows this data to be queried when there is \na reasonable articulable suspicion--or RAS, as we call it--based on \nspecific facts; that the basis for the query is associated with a \nforeign terrorist or terrorist organization. If the NSA can't make that \ncase to the courts, that RAS is never authorized to go forward. The NSA \nis not searching through records to see whom ordinary Americans are \ncalling; they are only looking for the terrorist links based upon the \nconnection to a phone number known to be a terrorist phone number.\n  Now, my good friend, the Senator from Maine, spoke about the Boston \nbombings. Let me go back to some comments the Director of the FBI, \nDirector Mueller, made earlier last year. He testified in the House \nthat had the program been in place before September 11, 2001, those \nattacks might have been derailed. Why? Well, according to the Director \nof the FBI, before 9/11, the intelligence community lost track of al-\nMihdhar. Al-Mihdhar was one of the two who lived in San Diego, and he \nwas tied to a terrorist group in Yemen. We lost track of al-Mihdhar, \nbut we knew the terrorist organization in Yemen. So if we would have \nhad this program in place, we could have targeted the telephone numbers \nout of the cell in Yemen to see if they were contacting anybody in the \nUnited States--and they were contacting al-Mihdhar--and we could have \nput the connection together and found al-Mihdhar after we lost him in \nflight to the United States.\n  I think Director Mueller said we saw on 9/11 what happens when the \nright information is not put together. If this program had been in \nplace, then it could have provided the necessary link between the safe \nhouse in Yemen and al-Mihdhar in San Diego.\n  For those who claim this program served no purpose prior to 9/11, \nhere is the Director of the FBI saying it would have. Then we have the \nBoston Marathon bombing, and the program told us there was no terrorist \nlink.\n  Then we come to the 2009 New York City subway bombing plot. In early \nSeptember 2009, while monitoring the activities of an Al Qaeda \nterrorist group in Pakistan, NSA noted contact from an individual in \nthe United States who the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based \nNajibullah Zazi. Section 215 provided important lead information that \nhelped thwart this plot.\n  I wish to say this one more time to my colleagues: This program \nworks. It has worked. It has stopped attacks because we have been able \nto identify an\n\n[[Page S3381]]\n\nindividual before they carried out the attack.\n  Now, the threshold for my colleagues who say this program has not \nserved any useful purpose, meaning we have to have an attack to be able \nto prove we thwarted an attack--that is not why we have this program in \nplace. We are trying to get ahead of the terrorist act. In the case of \nthe subway bombings in New York, we did that in 2009.\n  There was a Chicago terrorist investigation in 2009. David Coleman \nHeadley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistan citizen, was \narrested by the FBI as he tried to depart Chicago O'Hare Airport to go \nto Europe. At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues, at \nthe behest of Al Qaeda, were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper \nthat published the unflattering cartoons of Prophet Mohammed. Section \n215 metadata analysis was used along with other FBI authorities to \ninvestigate Headley's overseas associates and their involvement in \nHeadley's activities.\n  I am not sure how it gets any clearer than this. We have an \nindividual who is radicalized, who intends to carry out an act, who has \noverseas connections that we never would have understood without \nsection 215. I think that as my good friend from Maine knows, when we \nconnect one dot, typically it leads to another dot and that leads to \nanother dot. To say to law enforcement, to say to our intelligence \ncommunity that we are not going to give you the tools to connect these \ndots is to basically stand up in front of the American people and say \nthat we are supposed to keep you safe, but we are not going to do that.\n  So I thank my good friend, the Senator from Maine, for his support.\n  I say to my colleagues, I hope we are going to be able to reinstitute \nthis program shortly after lunch tomorrow. Hopefully, we will be able \nto do it with three amendment votes and a final passage vote. One will \nbe a substitute to the full bill. It has all the USA FREEDOM Act \nlanguage, with two changes. It would require the telecom companies to \nprovide 6 months' notification of any change in the retention program \nof their company. That language was the suggestion of the Senator from \nMaine, and it works extremely well.\n  The second piece of the substitute amendment will deal with the \ncertification of the Director of National Intelligence that we have \nmade the technological changes necessary for the telecom companies to \nactually query that data they are holding.\n  There will be two additional amendments. The first one will be to \nchange the transition period from 6 months to 12 months, and I think \nthe Senator from Maine would agree with me that--I would like to see it \nlonger--anything longer than 6 months is beneficial as we talk about \nthe safety and security of the American people.\n  The last amendment is the change in the amicus language or the friend \nof the court language. I will get into that in a little while. The \ncurrent bill says the courts shall--``shall'' means they will do it. \nThe administrator of the court has provided us with language that they \nthink will allow the court the flexibility, when they need a friend of \nthe court, to solicit a friend of the court in FISA Court but not \nrequire them, with the word ``shall,'' to always have a friend of the \ncourt.\n  Again, I think, as my good friend from Maine knows, the process we go \nthrough in section 215 through the FISA Court in many cases is an \naccelerated process. Any delay can defeat the purpose of what we are \ndoing; that is, trying to be in front of an attack versus in the back \nof an attack. I say one last time for my colleagues, NSA, under the \nmetadata program, collects a few things: They collect the telephone \nnumber, they collect a date, they collect the duration of time that the \ncall took place. They don't get content. They don't get the person's \nname. They have no idea whose number it is. Were they to tie a domestic \nnumber to a foreign terrorist number, that then goes directly to the \nFBI because they say to the Bureau: We have a suspicious American \nbecause they have communicated with a terrorist, at which time it is \nout of the 215 program for the purposes of investigation of the \nindividual. If there was ever a need to find out whose telephone number \nit was or if there was a need to see content, that would be sought by \nthe FBI under an investigation through the normal court processes that \nare not part of the 215 program. Section 215 is limited to a telephone \nnumber, with no identifier for whose number it is, the collection of \nthe date, and the duration of the call.\n  I think the Senator from Maine would agree with me. I would just as \nsoon see the program stay at NSA, but that decision is a fait accompli. \nIt is going to transition out. We would just like to make sure we have \nenough time so this can seamlessly happen versus an artificial date of \n6 months and not knowing whether it can happen.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/senate-section/article/S3381-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3381-S3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN'S SAFETY ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n ALYCE SPOTTED BEAR AND WALTER SOBOLEFF COMMISSION ON NATIVE CHILDREN \n                                  ACT\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Native American \nChildren's Safety Act, S. 184. This legislation, which I have \nintroduced along with Senator Tester, is about one thing: making sure \nthat foster children in Native American communities are placed in safe \nhomes.\n  Without this legislation, there will continue to be inconsistent \nrules guiding the placement of Native American children in foster care. \nAt this time, Native American tribes and their tribal courts use \nprocedures and guidelines when placing a Native American child in a \nfoster home that vary significantly from tribe to tribe.\n  S. 184 addresses this problem by creating a transparent pathway for \nthe Federal Government and the tribes to partner together to establish \nsafety standards and policies to ensure the safety of Native American \nfoster care children. Moreover, this bill will strengthen the \ngovernance of the tribes and create safeguards for their foster care \nplacement programs and the individuals those programs serve.\n  The Native American Children's Safety Act specifically includes the \nfollowing reforms: It requires that all prospective foster care parents \nand adults living in the home undergo a background check prior to the \nplacement of a Native American foster child in that home; it requires \nthat background checks include checking for criminal activity as well \nas State and tribal child abuse and neglect registries; it requires \nadults who join the household after the foster care child has been \nplaced there also undergo background checks; and, it requires that \nfoster care homes undergo recertification periodically to ensure they \nremain safe for foster care children.\n  We worked on this legislation with the tribes, with the National \nIndian Child Welfare Association, with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nand the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for \nChildren and Families. The reforms are just commonsense measures \ndesigned to protect those Native American children who are in need of a \ngood, safe home. In fact, S. 184 has been endorsed by the National \nIndian Child Welfare Association as well as the Spirit Lake and\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\nTurtle Mountain tribes in my home State of North Dakota.\n  This bill has undergone many thoughtful efforts on the part of many \npeople and plenty of thoughtful consideration, and it has gone through \nregular order in the Senate. It passed unanimously out of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs on February 4, 2015. I am pleased this bill \nnow has passed the full Senate so these children can receive the \nprotection they deserve.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, I today can say that I am elated that \nthe Senate unanimously passed my legislation that would create a \ncommission on the status of Native American children.\n  This bipartisan bill, which was first introduced when I came to the \nSenate--in fact, it was my first bill--will study the challenges facing \nNative American kids, including poverty, crime, high unemployment, \nsubstance abuse, domestic violence, and dire economic opportunities, as \nwell as making recommendations on how to make sure Native American \nyouth receive the tools and educational resources they need to thrive.\n  This is not a new issue for me. This is an issue I worked on when I \nwas North Dakota's attorney general and I saw the challenges for so \nmany of our children living in Indian Country. I saw that sometimes \nthey are the most forgotten children in America. I fought for Native \nfamilies all during my time as North Dakota's attorney general, \npledging to improve the lives of Native American youth once I was \npositioned to do so.\n  So this is truly an important day for tribes and Native communities, \nas well as Native children and their families. But we can't stop the \nmomentum. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to uphold the Federal Government's trust responsibility \nto Indian tribes and to pass this bill, because standing up for Native \nchildren is an issue on which we should all agree.\n  The Commission on Native Children will work to identify complex \nchallenges faced by Native kids in North Dakota and across the United \nStates. The comprehensive and first-of-its-kind commission would \nconduct an intensive study on issues affecting Native American youth.\n  The 11-member commission will issue a report to provide \nrecommendations ensuring Native kids have access to sustainable \nwraparound systems, as well as the protection, economic resources, and \neducational tools necessary for success in both academia and in their \ncareers.\n  In addition to the Commission on Native Children, the subcommittee \nwill also provide advice in order to ensure that those in Washington \ndon't lose sight of these children.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have joined me in this effort, but I \nparticularly want to single out Senator Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. She \nhas been a cochampion and a copartner. She sees the same issues among \nAlaska Natives as I see among the Plains Indians in my State. And we \nhave named this bill after two great educational and spiritual leaders \nof our States.\n  In my case, my bill is named after Alyce Spotted Bear, former tribal \nchairwoman of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation in North Dakota. \nAlyce was a passionate advocate for Native children and a recognized \nleader in education. Unfortunately, she passed away much too soon, but \nI know her spirit is here in this bill.\n\n  I look forward to getting this bill passed in the House of \nRepresentatives. I look forward to the report, and I look forward to \nall of us pulling in the same direction to make sure all of our \nchildren are protected, all of our children are loved, and all of our \nchildren are given equal opportunity, including those children in \nNative American homes and those children in Indian Country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/senate-section/article/S3385-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3385-S3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   USA FREEDOM ACT OF 2015--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask the Senate's indulgence. I \nactually have three topics that I need to discuss here today. One topic \ninvolves the historic flooding that we have experienced in Texas and \nthe consequences of that, also the President's signing the Justice for \nVictims of Trafficking Act, and lastly, the bill that is before us on \nthe floor today, which is another tool in the toolbox of the national \nsecurity apparatus in this country to help keep Americans safe.\n\n\n                              Texas Floods\n\n  First, Mr. President, let me talk about the flooding and storm damage \nthat has affected Texas this last week or so. Over the course of a \nmonth, Texas has faced a deluge of storms and rain, and according to \nTexas A climatologists, May was the wettest month on record. Texas \nhas been in a drought for a number of years now, and we are glad to get \nthe rain, but we just wish that Mother Nature had spread it out over a \nlonger period of time. The National Weather Service reported yesterday \nthat in May Texas skies shed 37.3 trillion gallons of water, which \ntranslates into almost 8 inches of water covering the entire State--a \nstate more than 268,000 square miles large.\n  Unfortunately, this historic volume of water quickly turned into \ntragedy and massive destruction. Many Texans have experienced great \nloss. Some have lost their homes as the rivers came down without any \nwarning and washed their houses from their foundation. But, of course, \nlosing your home does not compare to the heartbreak of losing a loved \none, and tragically, at least 24 people have lost their lives in the \nfloods.\n  As usual, despite the direst of circumstances, the Texas spirit \nremains alive, and we see many volunteers continuing to dedicate their \ntime and efforts to lend a helping hand. In Wimberley, in central \nTexas, a town hit particularly hard by flooding and the overflowing \nBlanco River, a group of students and adults helped to organize a \nmakeshift market in the high school gym. This same group helped \nconsolidate and coordinate donations to give to those most in need. \nLocals in the town of about 2,500 people have come to refer to this as \nthe ``Wimberley Walmart.''\n  Fortunately, stories such as these of Texans helping one another are \nnot isolated--far from it, in fact. Communities across the State are \norganizing donation drives to help those who have lost all their \nmaterial possessions, and many individuals have selflessly risked their \nown lives to help rescue strangers from the floodwaters and the rubble. \nTo these volunteers, and to the many first responders who are working \ntirelessly, we all thank you from the bottom of our heart. During these \nhard times, you not only provided relief but you also provided perhaps \nsomething more important, and that is hope.\n  I spoke to several local officials over the last couple of days, \nincluding Nim Kidd, who is chief of the Texas Department of Emergency \nManagement. Nim is doing a terrific job in this very difficult \nposition, and he is performing like the experienced public servant that \nyou would come to expect, particularly in dealing with disasters such \nas this. Nim has said there is a lot of work to be done. He told me \nthat the rivers may not actually be within their banks for 2 more \nweeks, assuming that we don't get more rain.\n  This weekend, with recovery efforts in full swing and Texans \nbeginning the painstakingly slow process of answering the painful \nquestion of what now, several Texas rivers remain at flood stage in \nmore than 100 different locations. So as we start to recover, we are \nreminded that we need to remain vigilant.\n  I was encouraged to hear Nim's report that the assistance of FEMA and \nother Federal agencies has been making a big difference. He was highly \ncomplimentary of their contributions. FEMA, as just one example, has \nrapidly deployed resources to help assess the damage done in local \ncommunities, and we were both glad to see the President quickly grant \nGovernor Abbott's request for a major disaster declaration on Friday \nnight, which will help Texans get the resources they need. I promised \nNim and others I spoke to that I would continue to work with Governor \nAbbott and our State's congressional delegation to make sure that the \nFederal Government provides all the help Texans deserve during this \ndifficult time.\n  So, to those suffering today, I want to offer my deepest condolences \nand\n\n[[Page S3386]]\n\nprayers. We will continue to do everything we can here in Washington, \nin Austin, and in local communities that have been so severely \naffected, to give Texans the help they need. We have no time to lose in \ngetting these communities back on their feet. I know the people of \nTexas will continue to help their neighbors across the State during \ntheir time of need to ensure that each affected community will make the \nfullest and fastest recovery possible.\n\n\n                 Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act\n\n  Mr. President, on the second topic, on Friday, the President signed \ninto law the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. I know I speak for \nall those involved in the long journey on which this legislation has \nled us when I say that I am thrilled that we are able to mark this \nmilestone. This is a perfect example of Congress working together in a \nbipartisan way along with the President to try to do something to help \nthe most vulnerable people in our society--the victims of human \ntrafficking. This is an important day, as it shows to both the victims \nof human trafficking as well as to the predators who exploit them that \nCongress, on both sides of the Capitol and on both sides of the aisle, \ntakes this issue seriously.\n  I want to express my gratitude to the organizations and the people \nwho have helped get this done, lending countless hours and endless \nexpertise to this cause. Without their advocacy and their \ndetermination, this would not have been possible. I thank in particular \ngroups such as Rights4Girls, Shared Hope International, the National \nAssociation to Protect Children, the Coalition Against Trafficking \nWomen, and End Child Prostitution and Trafficking.\n  It is also important to remember whom this bill is for, and of \ncourse, it is for the victims--typically, a young girl between the ages \nof 12 and 14 who may have left home expecting some adventure or \nsomething else other than what they ultimately experienced. Many of \nthem find themselves victims of modern day slavery and victims of \nhabitual sexual abuse. This is for women such as Melissa Woodward, whom \nI have met. She is from the Dallas-Fort Worth area. At just 12 years \nold, Melissa was sold into the sex trade by a family member--as hard as \nthat is to conceive of. Her life became a prison. She was chained to a \nbed in a warehouse and endured regular beatings and was raped. She was \nforced to sexually serve between 5 and 30 men every day. Melissa said \nthat at one point she wished she was dead. As heartbreaking as her \nstory is--and it is heartbreaking--it is good to know that strong \npeople such as Melissa--along with the help we can give and others who \ncare for them can give and with those who can help them from living a \nlife of victimhood--can be transformed by their experience and regain a \nnew and productive life. So with this law we begin to provide for \npeople such as Melissa the help they need to heal, and, importantly, to \ntreat her and others as the victims they are and not as criminals. \nWhile I am thankful for what will be accomplished through this \nlegislation, my hope is that we continue to fight the scourge of human \ntrafficking using this law as the first step of many.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak about the effort to reauthorize the \ncritical provisions of the PATRIOT Act that expired at midnight last \nnight.\n  As others have observed, there has been a lot of misleading rhetoric \nand downright demagoguery about this topic. The issue is pretty \nstraightforward and simple. This is about how we use all of the tools \navailable to us to keep our Nation safe amidst pervasive and growing \nthreats, while at the same time preserving our essential liberties. \nThis is not about trading one for the other. This is about how we \nachieve the correct balance.\n  Despite our efforts last night, this Chamber was unable to come up \nwith even a short-term solution to ensure that the key provisions--\nincluding section 215--of the PATRIOT Act did not expire. We know that \nany single Senator could object to this extension that would allow us \nto continue our work without allowing this program to expire. \nUnfortunately, three of our colleagues chose to object to the \ncommonsense unanimous consent request to allow those temporary \nextensions while the Senate and the House continued their work.\n  It is important to remember that these provisions of the law were \ncreated after September 11 and were designed to equip those \ninvestigating terrorism with the basic tools used by ordinary law \nenforcement. Why in the world would we want to deny law enforcement the \ninvestigatory tools they need to keep America safe from terrorist \nattacks? That is what section 215 did and does and will do again once \nwe resurrect it.\n  Before it expired at midnight, these provisions helped our \nintelligence and law enforcement officials keep the country safe. As I \nthink about this, and in discussing it with Chairman Burr and others \nwho are very concerned about the safety and security of our country and \nwho are determined to protect the country by making sure that our \ncounterterrorism efforts maintain every available legal tool consistent \nwith our civil liberties, I think what has happened is we have fallen \nvictim again to the pre-9/11 mentality of considering counterterrorism \nefforts to be a law enforcement matter alone. Of course, the Fourth \nAmendment to the Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches \nand seizures, was designed primarily in a criminal law enforcement \ncontext to make sure that American citizens' privacy was protected. But \nwhat many of those who object to using these provisions fail to \nacknowledge is that our intelligence community has to be able to \ninvestigate and detect threats to the American homeland before they \noccur.\n  After 9/11, where almost 3,000 people lost their lives, there was \nplenty of time to do a criminal investigation and law enforcement \naction, but we had failed in our most essential obligation, which is to \ndetect these threats ahead of time and to prevent them from ever \noccurring.\n  Importantly, as we discussed the week before last, section 215 in \nparticular included vigorous oversight measures. It is important for \npeople to understand that the executive branch--in other words, the \nWhite House--and the legislative branch, which is both Houses of \nCongress, and the courts are all very much engaged in the vigorous \noversight of these tools used to protect the American people. By taking \nthis tool away from those investigating the constant threat stream to \nAmerican citizens, we have unfortunately given terrorists an advantage \nright here in our own backyard.\n  As we have reiterated over and over that these threats to our \nhomeland are real and they are growing. Why in the world would we take \ntime to gamble with our national security?\n  Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said that our country has \nentered ``a new phase in the global terrorism threat'' as the so-called \nIslamic State or ISIL continues to encourage people right here at home \nto take up the cause of global jihad. Perhaps, to me, the best and most \nconcrete examples are events such as what happened in Garland, TX, just \na few weeks ago, when two people who had been communicating overseas \nwith representatives of the Islamic State were incited to take up arms \nagainst their fellow citizens here in the United States of America. Why \nin the world would we want to deny our law enforcement and intelligence \nauthorities lawful tools available to them to be able to identify \npeople plotting threats against the homeland and to prevent those \nthreats from actually being carried out?\n  Thank goodness, due to the vigilance of local police and other law \nenforcement authorities, what could have been a bloodbath in Garland, \nTX, was averted. Why in the world would we want to take away a tool \navailable to our intelligence and law enforcement authorities and raise \nthe risk that an attack here in the homeland be successful rather than \nthwarted?\n  This is not just something that happened in Garland. A few weeks ago, \nFBI Director James Comey described the widespread nature of the \nthreats--so widespread, in fact, that he said all 56 field divisions of \nthe FBI have opened inquiries regarding suspected cases of homegrown \nterrorism. So let me repeat. Every FBI field division in the country is \ncurrently investigating at least one suspected case of homegrown \nterrorism.\n\n  As my colleagues must know, we do not have to go very far to find \nother examples like the one I mentioned that\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nmanifested itself in Garland. We read about examples regularly. Just 2 \nweeks ago, also in my home State of Texas, the FBI arrested a man who \nhad reportedly pledged his allegiance to the leader of ISIL. According \nto the FBI, he is but one of hundreds of ISIL sympathizers here in the \nUnited States, which ought to alarm all of us, ought to be a call to \nvigilance and to make sure we maintain every available legal tool \nconsistent with civil liberties to protect our citizens.\n  So I think it is obvious that section 215 and the two \nnoncontroversial national security provisions at issue should not have \nbeen allowed to expire, but unfortunately they were, and now it is our \nresponsibility to fill that gap by passing this legislation and taking \nup the important amendments, which will actually strengthen the House \nbill.\n  We know our country and our people are the target of terrorists \nagain, and we need to do everything we can to stop them. Well, my \ninitial preference was to extend these portions of the PATRIOT Act for \na short period of time so we could begin the debate and discuss the \nnext best move to address these issues without giving the terrorist any \nadvantage by handicapping the men and women committed to protecting our \nhomeland.\n  At a time when the threats to our country are increasing, we should \nbe enabling our intelligence officials and law enforcement with the \ntools they need and not stripping them of the authorities they require \nin order to protect us. Clearly a full extension of section 215, which \nwas easily extended in 2011, is not possible at this time. But the last \nthing any one of us should do is allow this program to continue to \nremain dark.\n  I encourage our colleagues to join me in quickly working together to \nreauthorize these critical provisions. Every day we allow these \nauthorities to remain expired, our intelligence officials are forced to \nact with one hand tied behind their back.\n  We plan to make minor improvements to the House-passed bill, and I \nthink they make a lot of sense, things such as actually getting a \ncertification by the Director of National Intelligence and this plan to \nlet the telecoms continue to hold this information and then, after a \ncourt order is provided, allow that search. But certainly we should \nwant to know whether this actually will work in a way that is \nconsistent with our national security.\n  So, essentially, the House provisions are the base bill here, but I \nthink Chairman Burr and others on the Intelligence Committee have \nrecommended some very positive, commonsense improvements which will \nmake this bill better. Working together, the Senate and the House, I \nthink we can make sure these necessary authorities are restored.\n  As elected representatives of the American people, it is our duty to \nmake sure the balance between physical safety and civil liberties is \nstruck. We will do that again. We can do that responsibly by extending \nthese authorities and coming together to find a long-term solution that \nkeeps these invaluable tools in place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the majority whip for his comments \nand for his support of the extension of 215 and for what I think are \nsome very reasonable changes to it. Some of what the Senator from Texas \nsaid took me back to some of the hearings I know the Presiding Officer \nwas in where intelligence officials were asked about this transition. \nThey were asked very simply ``Will it work?'' and the answer they gave \nwas ``I think so.'' To an institution such as Congress, where our No. 1 \nresponsibility is the defense of the country, ``I think so'' is not the \nanswer on which you base the change of a program. Therefore, that is \nwhy there is a debate in Washington right now--now in the Senate, soon \nto be with the House--as to whether 6 months is sufficient time to be \nable to address it.\n  I know the Presiding Officer of the Senate heard individuals from the \nJustice Department say: Well, if this does not work, we will get back \nto you on changes.\n  One of the reasons this tool is in place is because we identified \nshortcomings in our capability to identify terrorists post-9/11.\n  Let me revert back--and I hate to go to history, but on 9/11, as the \nmajority whip said, there was the loss of almost 3,000 lives, American \nand international lives. Washington, New York--could have been this \nbuilding had some brave passengers not found out what they were up to \nand stopped them.\n  I remember those days and weeks and months right after 9/11 as a \nmember of the House Intelligence Committee. There are not many of us \nleft who were here. I think only 40 percent of the Senate was here on \n9/11. What were the questions that went through our minds? Who did \nthis? Why did they do it? How wide was the plan to attack us? We had to \nstart from a dead stop and try to figure out the answer to all of those \nquestions. It is amazing that in a very short period of time we were \nable to construct tools that made sure that America would never be \nfaced with questions such as those again and that if we were, it would \nbe a very short period of time, not weeks and months and in some cases \nyears to connect the dots and try to figure out how to keep this from \nhappening again. Section 215 was one of the tools that was created as a \nresult of 9/11.\n  I revert back to the Director of the FBI, who said last year that had \nsection 215 been in place prior to September 11, the likelihood is that \nwe could have connected the dots between a known terrorist we lost \ntrack of by the name of Al Mihdhar, who traveled from Kuala Lumpur to \nSan Diego before we had a no-fly list, who communicated via cell phone \nwith a terrorist cell operating out of Yemen--we had the numbers out of \nYemen; we just did not have the number of Al Mihdhar. Had 215 been in \nplace, we could have tested the terrorist cell phones against the \ndatabase we had. The FBI Director's own words: We probably would have \nstopped that component of 9/11.\n  Al Mihdhar and his roommate, I believe, were the two who flew the \nplane into the Pentagon. Would it have captured everybody? Possibly \nnot. Would identifying two individuals incorporated in a cell inside \nthe United States have allowed the FBI to work through traditional \nmeans of investigation and find the rest of that cell, those planes \ndirected--two planes toward New York and that fourth plane directed to \nthe Capitol? Maybe. Maybe it would have.\n  Maybe when are you trying to stop something, it is good, but when you \nare talking about eliminating something, ``I think we can do it'' does \nnot meet my test. That is why one of the amendments I will ask my \ncolleagues to vote on is an amendment to make the transition period not \n6 months but 12 months. It is to make sure we have allowed the NSA a \nsufficient amount of time to technologically prepare the telephone \ncompanies to be able to search their data in a timeframe that we need \nto get in front of an attack versus in back of an attack.\n  It is very simple: If it happens in front, it is intelligence. If it \nhappens in back, it is an investigation. It is a legal investigation. \nIt has already happened. We are trying to make sure we stay in front.\n  I would like to take a moment to go over some myths about the PATRIOT \nAct.\n  Here is myth No. 9: The President put in place two panels--a review \npanel and another one called the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight \nBoard--and, interestingly, both panels told him the same thing: that \nwhat he was doing was illegal.\n  Fact: President Obama's review panel never opined on the legality of \nthe metadata program. It said the question of the program's legality \nunder the Fourth Amendment ``is not before us,'' and it is not the \nreview panel's job to resolve these questions of whether the program \nwas statutorily authorized.\n  Myth. Fact.\n  Myth No. 8: The national security letter is similar to what we fought \nthe Revolution over.\n  I am not a lawyer, but given what we have been faced with since \nSeptember 11, I think it would have been easier to go to law school \nthan to try to figure out some of these things. The national security \nletter, despite its ominous-sounding name, is nothing more than an \nadministrative subpoena. It has the authority equivalent to the \nauthority postal inspectors employ to investigate mail fraud or IRS \nagents use to investigate tax fraud. Postal inspectors and\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nIRS agents do not need judicial authorization to issue an \nadministrative subpoena. Our Framers would likely be embarrassed if the \npost office had more authority to investigate postal fraud than the \nFederal Government had to protect us from terrorism.\n  Before 215, the FBI would issue a national security letter that gave \nthem expansive investigatory tools. Now, they could not do it in a \ntimely fashion, but eventually they could not only get to a search of \ntelephone numbers, they could search financial records, and they could \nsearch anything about an individual.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that what we are talking about in section \n215, the metadata program--we have never identified an American. All we \nhave is a pool of telephone numbers with no person's name attached to \nthem, and we collect the date the call was made, the duration of the \ncall, and the telephone number that it talked to. The only time that \ninformation can be queried is when we have a foreign telephone number \nthat we know to be the telephone number of a terrorist. Where we were \nbefore was much more expansive with a national security letter, but it \nwas not timely, and if you want to be in front of an act, you have to \nbe timely. That is how 215 was created.\n  Myth No. 7: NSA collects your address book, buddy lists, call \nrecords, et cetera, and then they put them into a data--I think the \nprogram is called SNAC--they put it all into this data program and they \ndevelop a network of who you are and who your friends are.\n  Myth.\n  Here is fact: SNAC is the National Security Agency Systems and \nNetwork Attack Center, which, among other things, publishes a \nconfiguration guide to assist entities in protecting their networks \nfrom intrusion. Its work could not be further from the allegation made.\n  Myth No. 6: Executive Order 12333 has no congressional oversight.\n  Boy, that is a strange one to the Intelligence Committee, which \nspends a lot of time on oversight of 12333. It is simply wrong. S. Res. \n400 of the 94th Congress created the Select Committee on Intelligence. \nCRS--the Congressional Research Service--points out that the President \nhas a statutory responsibility to ``ensure that the intelligence \ncommittees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence \nactivities of the United States.'' The committee routinely receives \nreports on such matters, including reports on NSA activities under \nExecutive Order 12333. It is a part of the committee's mandate that we \ndo successful oversight, and it is a requirement of any President that \nthey make sure their administration fully cooperates and reports to \nboth the Senate select committee and the House select committee.\n  Myth No. 5: The President started this program by himself. He did not \ntell us about it. Maybe one or two people knew about it.\n  Again, that is factually incorrect. Every Senator was put on notice \nof the program's existence in 2010 and again in 2011. My gosh, it has \nbeen a national--international debate over the last several weeks.\n  Myth No. 4: The PATRIOT Act goes from probable cause, which is what \nthe Constitution had, to articulable suspicion, down to relevance.\n  This statement conflates issues. Articulable suspicion and relevance \nare not two different standards for the same thing. They both must be \npresent--both must be present--in the metadata program.\n\n  FISA, as amended by section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, allows the \ngovernment to seek a court order requiring the production of ``tangible \nthings'' upon a statement--articulation--of facts showing ``there are \nreasonable grounds to believe'' those things are ``relevant'' to an \nauthorized investigation. This allows the government to seek call \nrecords from telecommunications companies. Then, when those records \nhave been compiled into a database, that database can only be queried \nupon a reasonable articulable suspicion that the number to be queried \nis associated with a particular foreign terrorist organization.\n  We keep getting back to this, and of all the conversations that are \nhad on this floor about intrusion into privacy--one, let me state the \nobvious fact again. It is hard for me to believe we have invaded \nanyone's privacy when we have done nothing but grab a telephone number \nand we have no earthly idea to whom it belongs. And the only reason we \nwould be concerned with that telephone number is if we pull a foreign \nterrorist telephone number and we search it and find somebody in \nAmerica they have talked to. That is it. That is the entirety of the \nprogram, and it is all predicated on the fact that we don't search \nany--we don't query any data unless we have a foreign terrorist \ntelephone number known, and that is what triggers the program to begin \nto meet the threshold of the court for a query of the information.\n  Myth No. 3: The FISA Court has somewhat become a rubberstamp for the \ngovernment.\n  First, if that characterization is correct, then the Federal criminal \nwiretap process is even more of a rubberstamp for the government. The \napproval rate for title III criminal wiretaps is higher than the \napproval rate for FISA applications.\n  Second, this claim does a disservice to the practice of the FISA \nCourt, where there is often a back-and-forth between the government as \napplicant and the court. Again, this is not unlike the criminal wiretap \nprocess. The government often proposes to make an application before \nmaking its final application. The chief judge of the FISA Court has \nsaid it returns or demands modifications on these proposed applications \n25 percent of the time. In this respect, the high approval rate of FISA \napplications does not ``reflect the fact that many applications are \naltered prior to final submission or even withheld from final \nsubmission entirely, often after an indication that a judge would not \napprove them'' because it had not met the threshold.\n  Third, the government has every interest in self-selecting only \nmeritorious applications to bring to the court. The government is a \nrepeat player at the FISA Court. It has a well-earned reputation as a \nbroker of candor before the court, and there would be significant \nreputational costs to bringing nonmeritorious applications to the \ncourt.\n  Let me sort of put in layman's terms what that is. The current \nwiretap standard--equivalent to going to a FISA Court--approves at a \n25-percent higher rate than the FISA Court. And the FISA Court is the \ncourt that expedites time-sensitive investigations and time-sensitive \nintelligence requests.\n  Myth No. 2: The problem in the FISA Court is that when they take you \nto this court, it is secret.\n  True, it is secret, but so are any other judicial hearings where \nclassified information is before to the court, and that court shuts \ndown and goes into a nonpublic setting, just the way this institution \ndoes. We will do it as we get into the appropriations bills, and when \nwe get into classified, sensitive appropriations, these doors will \nshut, the Gallery will be cleared, the TVs will be cut off, and we will \ndo our business on secret, classified information.\n  It is only realistic to believe that the court--especially the court \nthat hears the most sensitive cases--would only hear those cases in \nsecret because the cases cannot be presented in public.\n  The last, No. 1: The bulk collection of all Americans' phone records \nall of the time is a direct violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n  The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches. A search \noccurs when the government intrudes upon ``a reasonable expectation of \nprivacy.'' The Supreme Court has noted ``that a person has no \nlegitimate expectation of privacy in information he voluntarily turns \nover to third parties.''\n  The Court has also squarely determined that a person does not have a \nFourth Amendment-protected privacy interest in the numbers he dialed on \nhis phone. Telephone companies keep call records for billing purposes. \nWhen the government obtains those records from a third-party \ntelecommunications provider, a search has not taken place for \nconstitutional purposes, and therefore a warrant is not required.\n  This program has been approved over 40 times by the FISA Court to \nexist. The program was instituted by the executive branch. The \nexecutive branch could end the program today. Why don't they? They \ndon't because this program is effective. This program has thwarted \nattacks here and abroad.\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\n  I know individuals have come on the floor and they have said: There \nis absolutely nothing that shows that section 215 has contributed to \nthe safety of America.\n  I can only say that they are factually challenged in that. You would \nnot have the majority of the Intelligence Committee on floor lobbying \nfor this program to continue in its current form. Now we know that is \nnot going to happen, so we are trying to reach a modification of the \ncurrent language so, in fact, we have a greater comfort level that the \nintelligence community can be in front of attacks and not behind them.\n  I remind my colleagues that hopefully tomorrow afternoon we will be \nat a point where we are ready to vote on amendments. There will be \nthree amendments to the USA FREEDOM Act.\n  The first one will be a full substitute. It will take all the \nidentical language of USA FREEDOM with two changes:\n  One, it will require the telephone companies to notify the U.S. \nGovernment 6 months in advance of any change they make in their \nretention policy of the data, the telephone numbers. I think it is a \nvery reasonable request that they give us 6 months' notice if, in fact, \nthey are going to reduce the amount of time they keep that data.\n  The second piece is that we direct the Director of National \nIntelligence to certify at the end of the transition period that we can \nsuccessfully make the transition and that the technology is in place at \nthe telephone companies, provided by the government, that they can \nquery those numbers--in other words, that they can search it and take a \nforeign terrorist telephone number and figure out whether they talked \nto an American.\n  In addition to that substitute amendment, there will be two \nadditional amendments.\n  The first one will take the transition period that is currently 6 \nmonths in the bill and will simply make it 12 months. If I had my \npreference, it would be 24 months, but I think this is a fair \ncompromise. And my hope is that, matched with the certification of the \nDNI, we will be prepared to transfer this data but to continue the \nprogram in a seamless fashion, although it will add some time--yet to \nbe determined--to how quickly we can make the identification of any \nconnection of dots.\n  The second amendment very specifically will be addressing the amicus \nprovision in the USA FREEDOM Act. I am going to talk about amicus a \nlittle later, but let me just say for my colleagues that in the USA \nFREEDOM Act, in numerous places, it says that the courts shall provide \na friend of the court.\n  I am not a lawyer, but my understanding from those who are lawyers is \nthat ``shall'' is an indication of ``you must.'' The courts have told \nus that will be cumbersome and difficult and delay the ability of this \nprocess to move forward. So the courts have provided for us language \nthat changes it to where the FISA Court can access a friend of the \ncourt when they feel it is necessary but not be required to have a \nfriend of the court regardless of what their determination is.\n  We will talk about that over the next just shy of a day, but it is my \nhope to all the Members that all three of these amendments can be dealt \nwith before 24 hours is up and that passage of the USA FREEDOM Act as \namended by the Senate can be passed to the House for quick action by \nthe U.S. House and hopefully by the end of business tomorrow can be \nsigned by the President and these very important programs can be back \nin place.\n  I would make one last note--that I am sure Americans find it \ntroubling that this program is going to be suspended for roughly 48 \nhours. In the case of investigations that are currently underway, they \nare grandfathered and the ``lone wolf'' and roving wiretap can still be \nused, but new investigations have to wait for the reauthorization of \nthis bill. From the standpoint of the metadata program, last night at 8 \no'clock it could no longer be queried, and it won't be able to be \nqueried until this is reauthorized.\n  There is time sensitivity on us passing this, just as there is time \nsensitivity in getting the language of this bill correct so that, in \nfact, we can query it, we can connect the dots, and we can get in front \nof an attack prior to the attack happening.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to spend the next 24 hours \nunderstanding what is in the USA FREEDOM Act. Look at the amendments. \nThey are reasonable. They don't blow up this piece of legislation. They \nprovide us the assurance that we can make this transition and that \nafter we make the transition, the program will still work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support all three amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it is time to get the job done on \nFISA. It is time to get the job done.\n  From the beginning of this debate, I had aimed to give Senators a \nchance to advance bipartisan compromise legislation through the regular \norder. That is why I offered extension proposals that sought to create \nthe space needed to do that. But as we all know, by now, every effort \nto temporarily extend important counterterrorism tools--even \nnoncontroversial ones--was either voted down or objected to.\n  So here is where we are. We find ourselves in a circumstance where \nimportant tools have already lapsed. We need to work quickly to remedy \nthis situation. Everyone has had ample opportunity to say their piece \nat this point. Now is the time for action.\n  That is why, in just a moment, I will ask for unanimous consent to \nallow the Senate to consider cloture on the House-passed FISA bill, \nalong with amendments to improve it, today--not tomorrow but today.\n  There is no point in letting another day lapse when the endgame is \nclear to absolutely everyone--we know how this is going to end--when we \nhave seen such a robust debate already, a big debate, not only in the \nSenate but across the country, and when the need to act expeditiously \ncould not be more apparent.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6 p.m. today, the \nSenate vote on the pending cloture motion on H.R. 2048, the U.S. \nFREEDOM Act, and that if cloture is invoked, that all postcloture time \nbe yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the pending \namendments under the regular order; that upon disposition of the \namendments, the bill be read a third time, as amended, if amended, and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if \namended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would be \nhappy to agree to dispensing with the time and having a vote at the \nsoonest possibility, if we were allowed to accommodate amendments for \nthose of us who object to the bill. I think the bill would be made much \nbetter with amendments. If we can come to an arrangement to allow \namendments to be voted on, I would be happy to allow my consent. But at \nthis point, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, without consent to speed things up, \nthe cloture vote will occur an hour after the Senate convenes tomorrow, \non Tuesday. Therefore, Senators should expect the cloture vote at 11 \na.m. tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, before the recess, there was an attempt to \ntry to bring finality before this bill expired. At that time, I reached \nout to my friend and colleague from Kentucky, Senator Paul, and offered \nhim my assurance, as manager of the bill, that we would take up his \namendments. But as the President of the Senate knows, if any one \nSenator objects to a vote, then a vote does not happen. I consented at \nthat time that I would initiate a tabling of his amendment so that \nthere could actually be a vote. There has been every attempt to try to \naccommodate amendments. I think that given the short time that we are\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\ndealing with, where we are trying to make sure that the expiration of \nthese needed tools is as limited as we can, the leader is exactly \nright. You cannot go outside of the processes that were already \ntriggered prior to this.\n  I think we have made every attempt to try to accommodate the current \nSenate rules, but unfortunately, there were objections to that as we \ndeparted town over a week ago, and we are where we are.\n  For my colleagues' sake, let me restate where we are. We have had the \nexpiration as of midnight last night of section 215. Section 215 has \nmany pieces to it, but there are three that are highlighted. One is the \n``lone wolf'' provision, an individual who has no direct tie to a \nterrorist organization but could be radicalized in some type of \ncommunication, and ``lone wolf'' provides us the ability to target them \nwithout a direct association to a terrorist group. And roving wiretaps \nare the ability to target an individual and not a specific phone.\n  These two are noncontentious, and there was a request by unanimous \nconsent yesterday before the expiration to extend those two pieces. \nThere was an objection. The Senate operates by rules. When one Senator \nobjects, everything stops. For that reason, those two provisions \nexpired last night.\n  Let me say for the benefit of my colleagues and for the American \npeople that any investigation that was currently under way as of 12 \no'clock last night can continue to use those two tools. What is \naffected while we are in this expiration period is that you cannot open \na new investigation and use those two tools to investigate that \nindividual. So we are limited on anything that might have opened since \n12:01 this morning.\n  My hope is that the Senate will dispose of all of the 215 provisions \nby 3 o'clock tomorrow. We can turn the faucet back on, and law \nenforcement can use those two tools.\n  But the third piece has been the focus of contention in the Senate \nand in the country, and it deals with a program called the metadata \nprogram. It is a scary word. Let me explain what the metadata program \nis.\n  The NSA receives from telephone companies a telephone number with no \nidentity whatsoever. We refer to it as a deidentified number. They put \nall of that into one big database. The purpose of it is that when we \nfind a known terrorist outside of the country and we have his telephone \nnumber, then we want the ability to query or search that big database \nto see if that known terrorist talked to anybody in the United States. \nWe actually have to go to court--to the FISA Court--to get permission, \nand we have to have articulate, reasonable suspicion that there is a \nconnection, that that known terrorist's telephone number can be tested \nagainst this database. We collect the telephone number, we collect the \ndate the call was made, and we collect the duration of time of the \ncall. There is absolutely zero--zero--content. There is zero \nidentifier. There is not a person's name to it. People have questioned \nwhether the program is legal. It is legal because the Supreme Court has \nsaid that when we turn over our data to a third party, we have no \nreason to believe there is a privacy protection. Therefore, when we get \nthat telephone number from a telephone company, we throw it into a \npool, and the only person who should ever be worried is somebody who is \nin that pool that actually carried on a conversation with a terrorist. \nAnd if we connect those two dots--a person in America and a known \nterrorist abroad--and they communicate, then it is immediately turned \nover to the FBI for an investigation. It is a person of suspicion. We \nturn it over to law enforcement. Law enforcement then goes through \nwhatever court procedures they need to do to investigate that \nindividual.\n  That is the metadata program. That is the contentious thing that has \nbogged this institution down to where we have let it expire--in most \ncases because people have suggested it is something other than what I \nhave just described.\n  I have read a lot of the myths. Let me just go back through some of \nthem again. I think it is important.\n  Myth No. 1: The NSA listens to Americans' phone calls and tracks \ntheir movement.\n  The NSA does not and cannot indiscriminately listen to Americans' \nphone calls, read their emails or track their movement. The NSA is not \ntargeting or conducting surveillance of Americans. Under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court--FISA Court--order, the only \ninformation acquired by the government from telephone companies is the \ntime of call, the length of call, and the phone number involved in the \ncall. The government does not listen to the call. It does not acquire \nthe personal information of the caller or the person who is called, \nwhich is obtained only through a separate legal process including, if \nnecessary, a warrant based on probable cause, which is the highest \nstandard that the judicial system has.\n  Frankly, there is more information available in a U.S. phonebook than \nwhat the NSA puts in the metadata base. There is more privacy \ninformation that Americans share with their grocery store when they use \ntheir discount card to get groceries. There is more data that is \ncollected at the CFPB on the American people than the NSA ever dreamed \nabout, but there is nobody down here trying to eliminate the CFPB, \nalthough I would love to do it tomorrow. But the fact is, if this is \nabout privacy, how can we intrude on anybody's privacy when we do not \nknow who the individuals are of the phone numbers that we have? And \nthere is the fact that the Supreme Court has said that when you \nrelinquish that information to your phone company, you have no right of \nprivacy.\n  Myth No. 2: The NSA program is illegal.\n  There have been some who have come to the floor and said that. The \nSupreme Court held in Smith v. Maryland and in U.S. v. Miller that \nthere is no reasonable expectation of privacy in telephone call \nrecords, such as those obtained under section 215. Those records are \nnot protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n  Under the current 215 program, the judges of the FISA Court must \napprove any request by the FBI to obtain information from the telephone \ncompanies. Congress has reauthorized the PATRIOT Act seven times. The \nFISA Court reviews the act in an application every 90 days, and the \nFISA Court has approved the reauthorization of those 90-day extensions \nover 41 times.\n  This is not a car on cruise control. This is a program that every 90 \ndays the court looks at and assesses whether for another 90 days we \nhave the right to run the program. Put on top of that, the \ncongressional oversight of the program is probably the second-most or \nthird-most looked at program by the Senate and House Intelligence \nCommittees of any program within our intelligence community.\n  Myth No. 3: The NSA dragnet repeatedly abuses government authority.\n  The government does not acquire content or personal information of \nAmericans under the section 215 program. The names linked to the \ntelephone numbers are not available unless the government obtains \nauthorization through a separate legal process, including, if \nnecessary, a warrant based on probable cause.\n  Careful oversight of the program reveals no pattern of government \nabuse whatsoever. In fact, after more than a decade, critics cannot \ncite a single case of intentional abuse associated with FISA \nauthorities. That is a far cry from the debate that we have listened to \nand, I might say, that has been covered on some of the national media.\n  Myth No. 4: The government stopped only one plot using section 215.\n  For anybody that was listening earlier to me, I described four \nspecific things that I can talk about in public. There were four plots. \nA plot is something that you get to before an act is done.\n  We even talked about the Tsarnaev brothers, who committed a violent \nact that killed and maimed a number of people in the Boston Marathon. \nWe had the ability because we had a foreign telephone number that we \nthought was tied to the Tsarnaevs, and even after the fact, we were \nable to go back and use 215 to see if there was a foreign nexus to an \nact that had already been committed. In this case, we could not find \nthat nexus, but we had the tools available so that law enforcement \ncould responsibly look at the American people and say we have done \neverything to make sure that there are not additional participants in \nthis act who\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nmight carry it out at the next marathon or the next race or the next \nfestival. That is what our ability is supposed to be if, in fact, our \noath of office as a Member of Congress is to defend the country, number \none.\n  Myth No. 5: The FISA Court is a rubberstamp.\n  Despite all the claims that the FISA Court approves 99 percent of the \ngovernment's applications, the FISA Court often returns or demands \nmodifications to about 25 percent of the applications before they are \neven filed with the court. According to the FISA Court chief judge, the \n99-percent figure does not reflect--does not reflect--the fact that \nmany applications are altered prior to the final submission or even \nwithheld from final submission entirely, often after an indication that \na judge would not approve them.\n  Let me put this in perspective. Twenty-five percent more of the \nwiretap applications are approved than of FISA. I mean, that says \nenough right there. In comparison to Federal court documents which \ninclude wiretap applications as instructed, of the 13,593 wiretap \napplications filed from 2008 to 2012, the Federal district court \napproved 99.6.\n  The only reason that FISA is at 99 percent is because when the \ngovernment sees that they are not going to be approved, they withdraw \nthe application. That seldom happens in wiretap applications.\n  Myth No. 6: There is no oversight of the NSA.\n  The NSA conducts these programs under the strict oversight of three \nbranches of government, including a judicial process overseen by \nSenate-confirmed judges appointed to the FISA Court and a chief judge \nof the United States. Republicans and Democrats in Congress together \nreview, audit, and authorize all activities under FISA. There are few \nissues that garner more oversight attention by congressional \nIntelligence Committees than this program, as well as the \nresponsibilities imposed on the executive branch to make sure that the \nFederal agencies in a timely fashion share all information with the \nselect committees in the Senate and the House for the purposes of \noversight of our intelligence community. Now, some have suggested that \nbecause the Director of the NSA says we think we can do this, we should \njust trust them. Please understand that the reason we are having this \ndebate is because some have suggested that the NSA cannot be trusted.\n  Once again, I will state for my colleagues that we are going to do \neverything we can to wrap this up by 3 p.m. tomorrow. The debate about \nwhether the data is going to transfer from the metadata program at NSA \nto the telephone companies has been decided. It will transfer. Over the \nnext 24 hours, we will attempt to take up the USA FREEDOM Act--the \nexact language that was passed by the House--with a substitute \namendment that embraces all of the House language with the exception of \ntwo issues. We will make two changes. One of the changes will require \nthe telephone companies to provide a 6-month notice of any change in \ntheir data retention policy. In other words, if one telephone company \nhas an 18-month retention program currently in place and they decide \nthey are only going to hold the data for 12 months, they have to notify \nthe Federal Government 6 months in advance of that change.\n  The second change will require the Director of National Intelligence \nto certify that on the transition date, that the government has \nprovided the technology for the telephone companies to be able to \nsearch the data in a timely fashion for us to stay in front of attacks.\n  In addition to that substitute amendment, which I hope my colleagues \nwill support because there are minimal changes, there will be two \namendments to the bill.\n  The first amendment will change the transition period from 6 months \nto 12 months. So when the Director of the NSA says ``I think we can do \nit in 6 months,'' to the Intelligence Committee, ``I think we can do \nit'' is not a good answer. So what we are asking is that we go from 6 \nmonths to 12 months so we can make sure the technology is in place for \nthis program to continue.\n  The last piece is a change in the amicus language of the bill or the \nfriend-of-the-court language in the bill. The bill itself uses the \nwords that the courts shall--which means must--have a friend of the \ncourt, and that is not needed in all cases. If that is applied to all \ncases, it will put in place a very cumbersome and untimely process.\n  When we are dealing with trying to get in front of an attack and \ndealing with individuals who are linked to known terrorists abroad, we \nwant to have a way to query that data, to search that data as quickly \nas we possibly can with the approval of the court. So what we have done \nis taken language that has already passed out of the Intelligence \nCommittee and has been signed off by the courts that changes ``shall'' \nto ``must.'' It basically says that the court has the opportunity, \nanytime they need a friend of the court's advice, to turn to it and to \nget it, but it doesn't require that they have a panel set up that \nautomatically sits in on every consideration, because a judge doesn't \nalways need that.\n  As the Presiding Officer of the Senate knows, the FISA Court operates \nin secret, which is another criticism of many people. Well, I don't \nwant to share any secrets, but sometimes the Senate operates in secret. \nMost of the time, the Intelligence Committee operates in secret. \nBelieve it or not, some titans of the courts in our country operate in \nsecret. They have the authority to do it anytime there is secret or \nclassified information that can't be shared publicly.\n  Well, that is all the FISA Court does. That is the reason it is in \nsecret. It is not because we don't want the American people to know \nthat there is a FISA Court or that there is an application or a \ndecision made by the FISA Court, but everything the FISA Court takes up \nis secret or classified, so it has to be done in secret, just like some \nof the budgets and some of the authorizations we do in the Senate that \nare classified. We shut these doors, we empty the Gallery, we cut off \nthe TV, we hash out our differences, we come together, and we have a \npiece of legislation that only those people who are cleared can read. \nThat is part of functioning. And part of functioning from a standpoint \nof getting in front of terrorism is to make sure the tools are in place \nto allow not only intelligence but law enforcement to do their job.\n  I think when the American people understand how simple this program \nis--we take the telephone numbers, we take the date the call was made, \nwe take the duration of the call, and if it connects to a known foreign \nterrorist number, then we turn it over to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation and they go to court to figure out whether this is an \nindividual they need to look at. It is no longer a part of the \nintelligence community. It is a valuable tool. It has helped us to \nthwart attacks in the past. My hope is that after we get through with \nbusiness tomorrow at about 3 p.m., that this will continue to be a \nuseful tool.\n  I urge my colleagues to expeditiously consider not only the base \nlanguage but the substitute and both amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak about where we are as \nwe debate the various aspects of the USA FREEDOM Act. However, before I \nproceed with my statement on the current issue before the Senate, I \nreally wish to note the very sad passing of our Vice President's son, \nBeau Biden, who passed away at age 46 of brain cancer.\n  Of course, the world knows this now because of the news announcement. \nStanding on the Senate floor, where I served with the Vice President \nwhen he was a U.S. Senator, I just personally want to express my \ncondolences to him on behalf of myself, his friend in the U.S. Senate \nand his colleague on so many issues, as well as the people of Maryland.\n  Once the news broke over the weekend, many people asked me in my home \nState: Did you know him? Had you ever met him? There is just a general \noutpouring of sadness for his family, his wife, his two children, and, \nof\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\ncourse, the Vice President and his stepmother Jill. So, Mr. Vice \nPresident, if you have the opportunity to listen, know that the U.S. \nSenate is sending our thoughts and our prayers to you during this \ndifficult time.\n  Madam President, I wish to speak now about where we are in terms of \nour parliamentary situation. Once again, here we are in the Senate \nwhere, when all is said and done, more is getting said than is getting \ndone. I am a very strong proponent of the oath I took to defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies. By that I mean \nwe have to be able to protect this country. We need to have a sense of \nurgency about it.\n  I am not only disappointed, I am deeply, deeply, deeply frustrated \nthat the key authorities of the PATRIOT Act expired last night, when we \nhad a path forward on legislation that would be constitutionally sound, \nwould be legal, and would be authorized. But what did we do? We got \nourselves into a parliamentary quagmire with the filibuster of one \nindividual, which now has left us exposed in the world's eyes.\n  Major authorities were given to our intelligence community to be able \nto pursue the surveillance of potential terrorists, and they have \nexpired. Those authorities included ``lone wolf,'' the roving wiretap, \nand some other aspects involving surveillance, and we have just let \nthem expire at midnight. Right now, I hope we do what we can to pass \nthe USA FREEDOM Act without delay. We need to get these authorities \nrestored. Do we need reform? Absolutely. But let's not delay. Let's get \nit going.\n  Others are going to speak later on today on the merits of the USA \nFREEDOM Act. I believe it is our best opportunity to protect the \nNation, while balancing privacy and constitutionally approved \nsurveillance. I do support reforming the PATRIOT Act, but I don't \nsupport unilateral disarmament. I don't want to throw the PATRIOT Act \naway. I don't want to throw away our ability to place potential \nterrorists under surveillance. I don't want to give in under the guise \nof some false pretense about privacy where we say, Well, gee, I worry \nabout my privacy, so the terrorists don't need to worry about us being \nable to pursue them.\n  Our Nation needs to know that when bad guys with predatory intent are \nplotting against the United States of America, we are going to know \nabout it and we are going to stop it. We are going to know about it \nbecause we have the legal authority to track them, put them under \nsurveillance, and we are going to stop them before they do very bad \nthings to our country.\n  The purpose of my comments today is to stand up not only for the \nability to have a law but also for the men and women who are working \nfor the intel agencies--for the people who work at the National \nSecurity Agency in my own State, the FBI, and other agencies within our \nintel community who are essential to protecting our country against \nterrorist attacks, whether it is a ``lone wolf'' or State-sponsored \nterrorism.\n  These dedicated, patriotic, intelligence professionals want to \noperate under a rule of law. They want to operate under a rule of law \nthat is constitutional, that is legal, and that is authorized by the \nU.S. Congress. They are ready to do their job, but they are wondering \nwhen we are going to do our job.\n  Congress needs to pass a bill, as promptly as it can, that is \nconstitutional, legal, and authorized.\n  We on the Intelligence Committee have worked long and hard on such a \nlegislative framework. We have cooperated with members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, including Senators Grassley of Iowa and Leahy of Vermont, \nwho have also worked on this. We worked together putting our best ideas \nforward, doing the targeted reform that was essential, not pursuing \nunilateral disarmament, and we now have legislation called the USA \nFREEDOM Act. Is it a perfect bill? No, it is not perfect, but it is \nconstitutional. If we pass it, it will be legal, and it will be \nauthorized.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a military veteran and I support her \nfor her service. The Presiding Officer knows what it is like when \npeople try to trash America.\n  Ever since Eric Snowden made his allegations, the wrong people have \nbeen vilified. The men and women of our intelligence agencies have been \nvilified as if they were the enemy or the bad guys.\n  I have the great honor to be able to represent the men and women who \nwork at the National Security Agency and some other key intelligence \nagencies located in my State. They work a 36-hour day. Many times they \nhave worked a 10-day week. When others have been eating turkey or \nacting like turkeys, they were on their job, doing their job, trying to \nprotect America.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, these people who work for the National \nSecurity Agency, for the FBI, and other intelligence agencies are \npatriots. They are deserving of our respect, and one way to respect \nthem is to pass the law under which they can then operate in a way that \nis again appropriate. At times, these men and women, ever since Eric \nSnowden, have been wrongly vilified by those who don't bother to inform \nthemselves about national security structures and the vital functions \nthey perform. Good one-liners and snarky comments have been the order \nof the day.\n  Now, the National Security Agency is located in my State, but I am \nnot here because it is in my State. I am here because it is located in \nthe United States of America. Thousands of men and women serve in \nsilence without public accolades, protecting us from cyber attacks, \nagainst terrorist attacks, as well as supporting our war fighters. I \nwish the Presiding Officer would have the opportunity to come with me \nto meet them sometime. They are linguists. They are Ph.D.s. the \nNational Security Agency is the largest employer of mathematicians in \nAmerica. They are the cyber geeks. Many of them are whiz kids. They are \nthe treasured human capital of this Nation. If they had chosen to go to \nwork in dot-com agencies, they would have stock options and time off \nand financial rewards far beyond what government service can offer. We \nneed to be able to support them, again, by providing them with the \nlegal authority necessary.\n  Remember, that section 215 is such a small aspect of what these \nintelligence agencies do as they stand sentry in cyber space protecting \nus. People act as though that is all NSA does. They haven't even \nbothered to educate themselves as to the legality and constitutionality \nof where we are.\n  Now, let's say where we are and let's say where we have been. Much \nhas been said about the PATRIOT Act. It has been sharply criticized. \nThere has been no doubt that it does require reform. That is why the \nCongress, in its wisdom, when it passed the bill right after 9/11, put \nin the safeguard of periodic sunsets so we could take a breather and \nreexamine the law to make sure what we did was appropriate and \nnecessary.\n  Congress did pass the PATRIOT Act so the men and women at the \nintelligence agencies worked under what they thought was the rule of \nlaw that Congress supported. President George Bush also told us and his \nlegal advisors told us that it was constitutional, so people believed \nit. Those men and women at the intelligence agencies thought they were \nworking under legislation that was constitutional, legal, and \nauthorized because we passed it. Well, now others say it wasn't. Others \neven want to filibuster about it. They want to quote the Founding \nFathers. Well, I don't know about the Founding Fathers, but I know what \nthe ``founding mothers'' would have said. The ``founding mothers'' \nwould have said get off the dime and let's pass this legislation.\n  We do need good intelligence in a world of ISIL, al-Nusra Front, and \nAl Qaeda. NSA is one of our key agencies on the frontline of defense, \nand the people of the National Security Agency make up the frontline. \nAs they looked at audits, checks and balances, and oversight, there was \nno evidence ever of any abuse of inappropriate surveillance on American \ncitizens. We need to know that and we need to recognize that. Those \nemployees thought they were implementing a law, but some in the media--\nand even some in this body--have made them feel as though they were the \nwrongdoers. I find this insulting and demeaning.\n  The morale at the National Security Agency was devastated for a long \ntime. People were vilified, families were harassed for even working at \nthe NSA,\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nand, in some instances, I heard even their children were bullied in \nschool. This isn't the way it should be. They thought they were \npatriots working for America. When the actions of our own government \nhave placed these workers where they feel under attack--they were \nattacked by sequester and they felt under attack by a government \nshutdown because many of them were civilian employees at DOD--they were \nnot paid--and now Congress's failure to reform national security has \nfurther then said: We can take our time. What you are doing is \nimportant, but we have to talk some more.\n  Gee, we have to talk some more. What do you mean we have to talk some \nmore? The only person in the Chamber is my very distinguished \ncolleague, the distinguished colleague from Indiana, whom I work with \nin such a wonderfully cooperative way on the Intelligence Committee. \nYou know we are not bipartisan, we are nonpartisan for the good of the \ncountry.\n  Where is everybody who wanted to speak? Do we see 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 \nSenators lined up waiting to speak? No. We have to kill time. I don't \nwant to kill time. I am afraid Americans will be killed. We have to get \non this legislation and we have to get our act together and we have to \npass it. I want the people to know we cannot let them down by our \nfailure to act and to act promptly.\n  I come to the floor to say let's pass the USA FREEDOM Act and let's \ndo it as soon as we can. I know a vote has been set for 11 o'clock \ntomorrow. That means that it will be almost 35 or 36 hours since the \nauthorities expired, and then it has to go over to the House. So let's \nmove it and let's keep our country safe and let's get our self-respect \nback.\n  For those who looked at our country, there were three attitudes \ntoward America: One was great respect for who we are, our rule of law; \nthe other was our fear, because we were once the arsenal of democracy; \nand, third, the yearning to be in a country that worked under a \nConstitution, a Congress that worked to solve the problems of our \nNation. Can we get back to that? I know the Presiding Officer wants to \nget back to that. I know my colleague here wants to be part of that.\n  Let's get back together, where shoulder to shoulder we shoulder our \nresponsibilities, pass the legislation we need to, protect our country, \nrespect the men and women who work there, and say to any foe in the \nworld that the United States of America stands united and is willing to \nprotect us, and to the men and women who work for us in national \nsecurity, we will support you by passing legislation promptly that is \nconstitutional, legal, and authorized.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from \nMaryland, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It is obvious \nthis is a bipartisan effort in dealing with the security of the \nAmerican people. The Senator from Maryland is not from my party. \nTogether, we serve on the Intelligence Committee. We have served \nhundreds of hours on that committee together doing everything we can to \nprovide our country with the opportunity to protect Americans from \nharm.\n  The threat to Americans today has never been greater. We are dealing \nwith fires raging in the Middle East and terrorist groups forming as we \nspeak, targeting the United States and Americans, and inspiring \nAmericans to take up arms against their fellow citizens for whatever \njihadist cause they are using as the basis for the brutality that is \nspreading throughout the Middle East and that can happen here if they \nrespond to these inspirational social media requests from organizations \nsuch as ISIS, Al Qaeda, and many others.\n  I understand Americans' frustrations and concerns about their civil \nliberties and privacy. Those concerns have been bolstered by acts of \ngovernment that can hardly be explained. Look at what has taken place \nwith the IRS. Talk about targeting people, invading their privacy and \ncivil rights and using the organization of government for political \npurposes is outrageous. Of course, people are up in arms about all of \nthis, the debacle of Benghazi and Fast and Furious and on and on over \nthe years. One can go into what has happened to instill distrust in the \nminds of the American people.\n  When a program such as this comes along and, unfortunately, the \nAmerican people are told by Members of this Congress falsehoods as to \nwhat this program is and what it isn't, it just feeds the narrative \nthat Washington is in their bedroom, Washington is in their home, it is \nin their phone, it is listening to their calls--Washington is \nmonitoring everything they do--their locations.\n  This simply is not true. We have an organization and tools put in \nplace with that organization, the National Security Agency, following \nthe tragic events of 9/11 that the American people insisted on putting \nin place. Let's use the tools that we can to try to prevent another 9/\n11 from happening, to try to identify terrorist attacks before they \nhappen, not to clean up after they happen.\n  The frustration for those of us on the Intelligence Committee is we \nare not able to come down and refute statements that are false that are \nmade here without breaching our oath not to release classified \ninformation. We have had briefings with all of our Members. Some don't \nchoose to attend, and therefore their narrative continues without any \nability to publicly challenge what is being said. It has been said on \nthis floor that Big Government is listening to everyone's phone calls. \nThat is patently false.\n  First of all, it is impossible. There are trillions of phone calls \nmade every day throughout the world. The calculation is that it would \ntake 330 million employees sitting there monitoring Americans' phone \ncalls to be able to listen to everyone's phone calls. It is an \nimpossibility, No. 1.\n  No. 2, it is guaranteed that this is not happening because the \nauthorities given to the National Security Agency prevent that from \nhappening. There are layers and layers of attorneys and others who \noversee this process, including those of us in the Intelligence \nCommittees in the Senate and the House, the Justice Department, and the \nexecutive branch. All three branches of government are so concerned \nthat this program could potentially be abused that the oversight is \nsuch that it would take a monumental conspiracy, involving hundreds and \nhundreds of people, to all agree that, yes, let's do this and breach \nthe law.\n  If what has been said on this floor about the nature of this program \nwas correct, I would be the first to line up and say I am here to \ndefend the liberties that are being abused by the government. I \nguarantee to my constituents that this is a high priority for me, that \nI do not support anything that would violate their civil rights or \nviolate their privacy. That is true of those of us on the Intelligence \nCommittee, whether we are a Democrat or Republican.\n  We have heard today from Senator King, who is on the committee. We \nhave heard from Senator Mikulski of Maryland, who spoke. We heard from \nSenator Nelson, who was formerly on the committee on the Democratic \nside. On the Republican side, our leader of the committee, Senator \nBurr, has laid out in great detail how this works.\n  The tragedy is that in being forced to describe what the program is \nand what it isn't, we have had to declassify information. Guess who is \nlistening.\n  I hope a lot of the American people are listening because they need \nto understand that much of what they have heard is simply a falsity. It \nis factually incorrect.\n  I am not going to go into why this has happened, why some Members \nchoose to say things like--and I am stating what has been said on this \nfloor--``Big Government is looking at every American's records, all \nAmericans' phone records all the time. They have said the NSA collects \nAmericans' contacts from address books, buddy lists, calling records, \nphone records, emails, and do we want to live in a world where the \ngovernment has us under constant surveillance?''\n  None of us want to live in that kind of world. That is why we live in \nAmerica. That is why America is what it is. This is not Stasi Germany. \nThis is not a Communist regime. This is not a totalitarian society. We \nwould not allow that here. Our Constitution guarantees privacy and we \ncherish that privacy and we protect that privacy. But to\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\ncome down to this floor and make statements such as those is \nirresponsible, and it is a narrative that is just not the case.\n  Poor Ben Franklin has been dragged into this because the quote that \nhas been attributed to Franklin that should drive our decision on this \npoint was: ``Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a \nlittle temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.''\n  I agree with that, but the key word here is ``essential.'' This \nmatter has come before the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has \nsaid that what the NSA is doing in storing phone numbers only--not \nnames, not collecting information--is not essential to liberty. They \nhave declared it as a necessary, effective tool that is open. The only \ninformation that is in your phone record is the date of the call, the \nnumber called, the duration, and the time of the call--nothing more \nthan that.\n  Why is this done? It is done so that when we determine the phone \nnumber of a known terrorist in a foreign country, we can go into that \nhaystack of phone numbers and say, Was that phone number connected to a \nphone number held by someone in America?\n  In fact, the former Director of the CIA said that we likely would \nhave prevented 9/11 because we now know that a phone number in America \nwas connected to a phone number of a terrorist group--Al Qaeda--and we \ncould have taken that information to the FISA Court or to a court and \ngotten permission to check into that to see if that was leading to some \nkind of terror attacks.\n  It doesn't take much to recall the images of what happened on 9/11, \nwhere we were, what horror we stood and watched coming over the \nairwaves, and the tragedy and the loss of life that took place, \nchanging the face of America.\n  So it is important that we tell the American people what it is and \nwhat it isn't. It is important that Members take responsibility to \nunderstand this is an issue that rises above politics. This is an issue \nthat cannot be used and should not be used for political gain, whether \nit is monetary gain or whether it is feeding a base of support that \nresponds to the scare tactics of America listening to all of your \ncalls, Big Government in all of your business.\n  This is too important an issue. This is about the safety of America. \nThis is about preventing us from terrorist attacks. The threat is real, \nand it is more real than it has been in a long, long time.\n  So I talked yesterday about the existing program, what it was and \nwhat it isn't. It has been talked about by my colleagues on the floor. \nWe have moved to a point where we have to choose between the better of \ntwo bad choices.\n  One choice is that we eliminate the program. One of our Members in \nthe Senate has publicly indicated that is what he wants to do. He \nclaims it is unconstitutional. Unfortunately, he doesn't have the \nsupport of the Supreme Court that has dealt with this issue, nor the \nconstitutional lawyers. That is a case that just simply cannot be made \nbecause it doesn't impede on anyone's liberty.\n  Again, I would say, if it did impede on Americans' liberty, I would \nbe the first in line to state that and to fight against it. But it is a \nsolution to something that is not a problem.\n  But secondly, because one individual would not grant even the \nshortest of extensions, even an extension on two noncontroversial parts \nof this program that no one has challenged, to allow that to go forward \nso that we could keep something in place to address a potential threat \nthat could happen--even that was denied us last evening as the clock \nwas ticking toward midnight, and the program expired. Someone who is so \ndetermined to eliminate this entire program, who has misrepresented \nthis program to the American people, so determined to stay with his \nnarrative that he would not even allow an hour, not even allow a day, \nnot even allow minutes for us to try to reconcile the differences here \nwith the House of Representatives--and those differences are pretty \nsmall.\n  Senator Burr has been in negotiations with the House and with Members \nof the Senate relative to some changes and modifications in the USA \nFREEDOM Act, which was supported by a significant bipartisan majority \nin the House of Representatives. I think that is a step in the right \ndirection. It does not solve all of the problems. My concern with the \nFREEDOM Act is a concern of many; that is, the act has some major \nflaws, some of which I thought were fatal. But I have to measure that \nagainst nothing.\n  Thanks to the procedural maneuvering by one Member here, we have been \nleft with only two choices. The Senate majority leader laid those out \nwith some clarity yesterday and today. The choices are completely \neliminate the program, go completely dark, take away this tool, and put \nAmericans more at risk--thanks very much, but it is over and try \nsomething else--or a provision that has been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives that moves collection of the phone numbers from NSA to \nthe telephone companies. The problem with the bill is that it does not \nmandate that movement. It is a voluntary act that the phone companies \nare most likely not going to want to adhere to, primarily because they \nnow have to set up a situation where they potentially could be liable \nfor breaches of the people who are overseeing their program.\n  There are 1,400 telephone companies in the United States. Many of \nthem are small. But to move this program, which has six layers of \noversight at NSA, which has the oversight of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee and the House Intelligence Committee, which has the oversight \nof the Department of Justice and the administration, and which has the \noversight of the Federal intelligence court called FISA--all of that \nsecurity oversight--to make sure there is no breach will now get \ntransferred over to up to 1,400 telephone companies.\n  The people who oversee this program--it is a very small number at NSA \nwho operate this program--have had intensive background checks and \nsecurity clearances. They have proven their commitment to make sure--to \ndo everything possible not to abuse this program. There has never been \na documented case, never one case of an abuse of this program--again, a \nsolution to something that is not a problem.\n  All of a sudden, now we will have dozens, if not hundreds, if not \nmore than 1,000 phone companies all putting their own programs in \nplace. This is not something they would like to do, No. 1, because it \nis going to be very costly, and, No. 2, they cannot guarantee that \nevery one of their people is going to have the same kind of background \ncheck and security check NSA has. They will not have the oversight of \nthe Intelligence Committees, of the Justice Department, of the \nexecutive branch.\n  We are trusting a private entity to do the kinds of things that \nmultiple agencies do. And you can just count on probably some breaches \nof security there as people want to use the capability to abuse that \nprogram for whatever reason--maybe checking up on their wife or their \ngirlfriend or their business partner or who knows for what possible \nreasons they could use it. So it really does not add privacy \nprotections; it detracts from privacy protections.\n  Secondly, the retention of records is voluntary. Now, if we have some \namendments that are passed by this body and accepted by the House, we \nwill get notification if a company does not want to retain those \nrecords. But there is no retention authority granted here to us to \nensure that those companies will keep any phone numbers, and then the \ncapability of the program will be significantly reduced.\n  We are having to look at a very sophisticated program that the NSA \nsays: We are not sure it is going to work. We are not sure if this \nprocess that the FREEDOM Act requires to replace what we have now is \ngoing to be effective.\n  It is going to take many months to determine if that is the case. So \nit is an untested program that we are putting a bet on that this is \ngoing to work. It would be nice to know we had something in place we \ncan easily replace this with. So we are going from the known to the \nunknown. We are making a bet that this is going to be more effective \nand provide more privacy for the American people. It is a diminishment \nand a significant degradation of the current program. It will not be as \neffective as the program that is currently in place. Nevertheless, we \nhave\n\n[[Page S3395]]\n\nto weigh this against nothing. That is the position we have been put in \nbecause one Senator would not allow an extension of time for us to have \na more lengthy debate and reasonable negotiation in consultation with \nthe House of Representatives to arrive at something that will give us \nmore assurance that we have a program in place that does not breach \nprivacy but allows us to detect potential terrorist attacks and stop \nthose attacks before they take place.\n  Having had to go through all of this and raise these kinds of issues \nhere and talk about a fellow colleague is not fun. It is not something \nI hoped I would ever have to do. But I could not stand by and watch a \nprogram that is helping protect American people from known terrorist \nthreats and let their safety be jeopardized by falsehoods that are \nbeing said about what this program is and is not.\n  It looks like we are coming together on something that is far from \nwhat we need, that is going to significantly degrade our capability, \nbut it is the only choice that we have. We are going to have to weigh \nthat decision. Is something that is far less better than nothing? \nUltimately, given the fact that these threats have never been greater, \nsomething--even if it is not what we now have--something is better than \nnothing.\n  But we have been put in this situation unnecessarily by \nmisrepresentations and a public that has not been informed. It is not \ntheir fault. We have not been able to because so much of this has been \nclassified. Now, much of it is. Our adversaries, the terrorist groups, \nknow a lot about the program they did not know about before. Thanks to \nEdward Snowden and thanks to some misrepresentations, we are left with \nthe devil's bargain, and that is to choose the best of the worst.\n  We will talk this through today. We will have a vote tomorrow. In my \nmind, it is absolutely essential that the modifications that are being \nmade, that are being presented--I will not go into depth about those. \nIt has already been talked about here. It is essential that those be \npassed by this body. It is, of course, essential that the House accept \nthem. I know a lot of negotiation has gone on back and forth, and it \nwill continue. But it is the only way to keep a program in place. Even \nas degraded as it is, even as compromised as it is, it is the only way \nto keep a program in place.\n  So I will be supporting those tweaks, those changes, even though I \nthink they are far short of what we need to do to fix the issue that \nwas rushed through the House without much deliberation. But to make it \nstronger, to put it in a better position, I will support those. If \nthose amendments can be passed, then I will reluctantly choose to vote \nfor something that is better than nothing, as degraded as it is, in \norder to keep this program as one of the essential tools--one of many--\nas we collect information, keep that in place.\n  I know my colleague from Ohio has been seeking the floor for some \ntime. I apologize for taking too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Blumenthal be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Condolences to the Biden Family\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, first, I want to offer my deepest \nsympathy and condolences to Vice President Biden and the entire Biden \nfamily. The Vice President has been met with more personal tragedy than \nany person should have to endure in any lifetime. He has faced it all \nwith remarkable grace. He has persevered to accomplish so much good for \nhis family, for his State, and now for his country. We are all indebted \nto him for that. I know he and Jill and the whole family are in our \nthoughts and prayers today.\n\n\n                           Export-Import Bank\n\n  Madam President, turning to the business before the Senate this \nmonth--business that should be in front of the Senate this month--the \nSenate banking committee will hold two hearings beginning tomorrow on \nthe Export-Import Bank. It is urgent that the Senate move to \nreauthorize the Ex-Im Bank before the charter expires on June 30.\n  Frankly, I find it both curious and alarming and also troubling that \nwe seem to be doing this over and over. We do a transportation bill \nonly for a few weeks or a few months. We do the Ex-Im Bank for only a \nfew weeks or a few months. When we act that way, it is wasteful, it is \nalarming to many, and it makes it almost impossible for companies and \nState departments of transportation and State development agencies to \nplan. It means that far too many companies simply cannot attract the \ninvestment they need because of the uncertainty.\n  When I hear people complain in this body about the uncertainty of \ngovernment and of government acting, and then it is those same people \nwho so often block the Export-Import Bank, who want to stumble along \nfor a few weeks of reauthorization or block a transportation bill--that \nclearly undermines the ability for our economy to grow and clearly \nundermines and erodes any kind of investment and planning we should be \ndoing.\n  In today's global economy, we should provide American businesses with \npredictability and support to sell their products around the globe. \nThis should not be controversial. Like the Transportation bill, the \nExport-Import Bank--at least it used to be this way--there was almost \nunanimity. There was consensus. For instance, in 2006 the Export-Import \nBank was passed by unanimous consent. For those obviously not \nnecessarily conversant with Senate-speak, unanimous consent means \nnobody comes to the floor and objects. That means unanimous. It means \nthat we move together as one to try to do something which obviously \nadds to our GDP, helps our workers, and helps our community.\n  In places such as Columbia and in Mahoning County in Ohio, in places \nsuch as Dayton and Toledo, I know what globalization has done for our \neconomy. I know that when we can do some things like the Export-Import \nBank and a long-term transportation bill and actual planning, it helps \nthe economy grow.\n  I know what the plant closings in those communities have meant to \nplaces such as Mansfield and Gallopolis and Lima and Hamilton. When a \nplant closes, it not just hurts that family or the employee, it hurts \nthe business, it hurts the community, and it hurts the local hardware \nstore and everybody else.\n  We know the Ex-Im Bank supports thousands of businesses, large and \nsmall, and hundreds of thousands of American jobs. According to the Ex-\nIm Bank's estimates, it supported $27 billion in exports and 160,000 \nAmerican jobs. It is supporting $250 million in deals in just Ohio \nalone, my State, 60 percent of which went to small business.\n  Opponents who like to talk about corporate welfare--the same people \nwho by and large vote for trade agreements and tax cuts for the wealthy \nand trickle-down economics--those same people say this is corporate \nwelfare.\n  No, really, it isn't. Our government actually makes money on this, \nand it is aimed primarily at small businesses. The Ex-Im Bank fills \ngaps in private export plans. It charges fees, and it charges interest \non loan rate-related transactions. The Ex-Im Bank covers its operating \ncosts and its loan costs. Last year, Ex-Im returned $600-plus million \nto our Treasury. So it doesn't cost taxpayers; it actually brings money \nto our country--money that otherwise might go to foreign imports. If we \ndon't have a big enough trade deficit, this would make it worse.\n  We know that our competitors have their own export-import banks. \nThere are some 60 of these around the world. Why should we unilaterally \ndisarm and put our manufacturers and exporters at a competitive \ndisadvantage? That is what we will do if the Bank's authorization \nexpires at the end of this month. We need to give our companies, our \nbusinesses, and our workers the same leg up as they compete around the \nworld. This should be about as obvious as it gets.\n  Leader McConnell is committed to giving us a vote on Ex-Im \nreauthorization before it expires. I hope that he\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\ncan manage it better than he managed the PATRIOT Act, FISA, the most \nrecent issue, the NSA, which has been in front of the Senate, and \nbetter than he managed the trade bill that pushed all of this into this \nweek and, as Senator Coats said rightly, caused this law to expire, \nwhich was a mistake.\n  We should be planning here better. We should be coming together on \nissues where we can come together. We could have come together earlier \non NSA. We could have come together earlier on trade a little bit \nbetter. We can certainly come together on a transportation bill and an \nEx-Im Bank bill.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House to act to reauthorize the Bank. \nSupporting U.S. exports should be a cause we all get behind. We have \nseen too many issues come out of this Senate with bipartisan support, \nonly to watch them die a partisan death in the House. We can't let that \nhappen with the Export-Import Bank.\n  Once again, I hope my colleagues will join in pressing our \ncounterparts in the House to get this done. We need to do it. The House \nneeds to do it. We need to provide American workers the support they \nneed to sell our products around the globe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I feel my speaking at this moment is \nappropriate because much of what I have to say follows logically from \nthe last words of the Presiding Officer when he spoke recently on the \nUSA FREEDOM Act because I agree with the Presiding Officer when he said \nwe need a bill. We need to move forward and approve reforms and changes \nin the law that are contained in the USA FREEDOM Act. We may be in \ndisagreement about some of the specifics. We may be in contention about \nthe extent of the changes made. But there is a general consensus that \nthis decade-and-a-half old law is in some need of revision.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act contains many important and genuinely worthwhile \nchanges in the rules that will apply as the United States helps to \nprotect our security but also to safeguard and preserve essential \nrights and liberties. That is the balance which needs to be struck. It \nis a difficult balance in a democracy, one of the most difficult in an \narea where secrecy has to be maintained because surveillance is more \nuseful if it is done in secret, but at the same time, rights need to be \nprotected in an open society that prides itself on transparent and \naccessible courts.\n  Changes in the rules are welcome, such as the end to the present \nsystem of bulk collection of phone data. We may disagree on that point. \nChanges in the rules that I support may not be supported by many of my \ncolleagues. I believe the USA FREEDOM Act goes in the right direction \non bulk collection of phone data by ending the current practice in its \npresent form.\n  What brings me to the floor is not so much a discussion about the \nrules as the method of enforcing those rules and implementing and \nassuring that they are faithfully executed, which is the role and the \nresponsibility of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the \nfirst instance. There are means of appeal from that court, but, as with \nmany courts in our system, that one is likely to be the end destination \non most issues, particularly since it operates in secret.\n  The USA FREEDOM Act goes in the right direction by making it more \ntransparent and requiring the disclosure of significant decisions and \nopinions when it is appropriate to do so and under circumstances that \nin no way should involve compromising our national security--striking, \nagain, a good balance.\n  But this Court, we have to recognize, is an anomaly in an open, \ndemocratic system. Its secrecy makes it an anomaly. It works in secret, \nit hears arguments in secret, and it issues opinions in secret. Its \ndecisions are almost never reviewable. It is, unlike most of our \ninstitutions, opaque and unaccountable--understandably so because it \ndeals with classified, sensitive information, protecting our national \nsecurity against threats that cannot be disclosed when they are \nthwarted in many instances. The success of actions resulting from the \nFISA Court are most valuable when they are known to most American \npeople.\n  So this court is special. It is different. But let's not forget that \nif we were to say to the Founders of this country that there will be a \ncourt that works in secret, has hearings in secret, issues opinions \nthat are kept secret, and its decisions will have sweeping consequences \nin constitutional rights and liberties, they would say: That sounds a \nlot like the courts that were abhorrent to us, so much so that we \nrebelled against the Crown, who said in the Star Chamber, in courts \nthat England had at the time, that there was no need for two sides to \nbe represented or for openness. Secret, one-sided courts were one of \nthe reasons we rebelled. Men and women laid their lives on the line. \nThey lost their homes, treasures, families, and paid a price for open \nand democratic institutions.\n  So we should be careful about this anomalous court. It may be \nnecessary, but we should try to make it work better, and we have.\n  Transparency in the issuance of opinions is very much a step in the \nright direction where the issues are significant and the transparency \nof those decisions is consistent with our security at the moment. There \nmay be a delay, but we should remember that the bulk collection of \nphone data, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said \nwas illegal, persisted for so many years because the decision itself \nwas never made known to the American people.\n  There is another reform that I think is equally if not more \nsignificant. Courts that are secret and one-sided are likely to be less \naccessible not only because they are secret but because they are one-\nsided. So as a part of this reform, I have worked hard and proposed, in \nfact, for the first time a bill that would create an adversarial \nprocess--two sides represented before the court.\n  A bill that I sponsored in 2013 to reform the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court was joined by 18 cosponsors. I thanked them for \ntheir support, both sides of the aisle. The basic structures that I \nproposed are reflected in the USA FREEDOM Act today.\n  Colleagues worked with me--and have since--on formulating that bill \nand in arriving at this moment where the central goals would be \naccomplished by section 401 of the USA FREEDOM Act, which provides for \nthe appointment of individuals to serve as amicus curiae--friends of \nthe court--in cases involving a novel or significant interpretation of \nthe law.\n  That provision would be egregiously undercut--in fact, gutted--by \nMcConnell amendment No. 1451 because it would prevent these lawyers--\nthe amicus curiae who would be selected by the court--from obtaining \nthe information and taking the actions they need to advance and protect \nthe strongest and most accurate legal arguments, and that is really \neviscerating the effectiveness of this provision as a protection. It is \na protection of our rights and liberties because these amicus curiae \nwould be public advocates protecting public constitutional rights, and \nthey would help safeguard essential liberties not just for the \nindividuals who might be subjects of surveillance, whether it be by \nwiretap or by other means, but for all of us, because the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court is a court. Its decisions have the \nforce of law. Its members are article III judges selected to be on that \ncourt, sworn to uphold the law, both constitutional law and statutory \nlaw.\n  So this provision, in my view, is fundamental to the court as a \nmatter of concept and constitutional integrity. That integrity is \nimportant because it is a court, but it is also important to the trust \nand confidence the people have in this institution.\n  I was a law clerk to the U.S. Supreme Court--specifically to Justice \nBlackmun--and I well recall one of the Justices saying to me: You know, \nwe don't have armies; we don't have police forces; we don't have even \nthe ability to hold press conferences. What we have is our credibility \nand the trust and confidence of the American people.\n  That is so fundamental to the courts of this Nation that consist of \njudges appointed for life, without any real direct accountability, as \nwe can be held to through the election process.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has taken a hit in public\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\ntrust and confidence. There is a question about whether the American \npeople will continue to have trust and confidence and whether that \nsense of legitimacy and credibility will continue. The best way to \nensure it is, is to make the court's process as effective as possible \nnot just in the way it operates but in the way it is seen and perceived \nto operate, the way the American people know it should operate, and the \nway they can be assured that their rights are protected before the \ncourt by an advocate, an amicus curiae who will protect those rights of \nprivacy and liberty that are integral to our Constitution--and the \nreason why the Founders rebelled against the English.\n  But there is another reason an advocate presenting the side opposing \nthe government is important to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nCourt; that is, everybody makes better decisions when they hear both \nsides of the argument. Judges testified at our hearings in the \nJudiciary Committee about the importance of hearing both sides of the \nargument, whether it is a routine contract case or a criminal trial--\nwhere, by the way, often a judge's worst nightmare is to have the \ndefendant represent himself because the judge is deprived, and so is \nthe jury, of an effective argument on the other side of the government. \nAnd so, too, here we were told again and again and again by the \njudicial officers who testified before our committee--and I have heard \nit again and again and again as I have litigated over the last 40 \nyears--that judges and courts work best when they hear both sides.\n  I have no doubt the judges of the FISA Court believe as strongly in \nconstitutional rights and implementation of the Constitution as anyone \nin this body, including myself. I have no doubt government litigators \nwho appear before the court representing the intelligence agencies \nseeking warrants or other actions and approval by the court have a \ncommitment no less than anybody in the United States Senate, including \nmyself, to those essential values and ideals. But courts are \ncontentious. They are places where people argue, where sides--different \nsides--are represented with different views of complex questions, and \nthese issues before the court are extraordinarily complex. They also \ninvolve technology that is fast changing and often difficult to explain \nand comprehend and is easily minimized in the consequences that may \nflow from approval of them.\n  So the USA FREEDOM Act would provide for, in effect, a panel of \nadvocates and experts with proper security clearances that the court \ncan call upon to give independent, informed opinions and advocacy in \ncases involving a novel or significant interpretation of law, not in \nevery case, not every argument but where there is, for example, the \nissue of whether the statute authorizes the bulk collection of phone \nrecords.\n  I tend to think the outcome would have been different in that case if \nthe court had been given the opposing side of the argument, the \nargument that eventually prevailed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSecond Circuit by a unanimous bench.\n  So the court really deserves this expertise. It deserves the other \nside and it deserves to hear both sides of the argument. Just to \nclarify, those two sides of the argument should not be in any way given \nso as to detract from the time necessary. If it is an urgency, the \nwarrant should be issued and the arguments heard later, just as they \nare in criminal court. When there is an exigency of time--and I have \ndone it myself as a prosecutor--the government's lawyer should go to \nthe judge, be given approval for whatever is necessary to protect the \npublic or gain access to records that may be destroyed or otherwise \nsafeguard security, public safety, and that should be the rule here \ntoo.\n  Now, in the normal criminal setting, at some point, a significant \nissue of law is going to be litigated if the evidence is ever used, and \nthat is the basic principle here too. If there is a novel or \nsignificant issue of law, it should be litigated at some point, and \nthat is where the amicus curiae would be involved. Security clearance \nis essential, timing is important, and there should be no compromise to \nour national security in the court hearing the argument that the \nadvocate may present on the other side. It can only make for better \ndecisions. In fact, it will benefit all of our rights.\n  These provisions were written in consultation with the Department of \nJustice attorneys who advocate before the FISA Court. They are \nsupported by the Attorney General and the National Director of \nIntelligence. They reflect the balance and compromise that appear \nthroughout the USA FREEDOM Act. Amendment No. 1451 would upset this \nbalance. It would strike the current provisions providing for the \nappointment of a panel of amicus curiae--the provisions that represent \na carefully crafted balance--and it would compromise those provisions \nin a way that need not be done because this balance has the support of \nnumerous stakeholders, from civil liberties groups to the intelligence \ncommunity, and it would replace this balance, this institution, with an \nineffective, far less valuable advocate.\n  There is no need to water down and undercut and eviscerate the role \nof the independent experts by removing requirements for the court to \nappoint a panel of experts to be on call, for the experts to receive \nbriefings on relevant issues, and significantly to provide those \nexperts with access to relevant information. Those provisions are \nunnecessary and unwise and, therefore, I oppose strongly amendment No. \n1451 because it does unnecessarily and unwisely weaken the role of \nthese experts and amicus curiae.\n  Equally important, amendment No. 1451 would limit access and \nsignificantly restrict the experts in their going to legal precedents, \npetitions, motions or other materials that are crucial to making a \nwell-reasoned argument. It would restrict their access unnecessarily \nand unwisely; thereby, endangering those rights and liberties the \npublic advocates are there to protect. It would also restrict their \nability to consult with one another and share insights they may have \ngained from related cases as government attorneys are currently able to \ndo.\n  By undercutting these essential abilities and authorities, this \namendment would hamstring any independence, both in reality and in \nperception; thereby, also undercutting the trust and confidence this \nact is designed to bolster and sustain.\n  In short, I know many people of good conscience may disagree over the \nbest way to reform this law. I accept and I welcome that fact. I \nwelcome also my colleagues' recognition that an amicus curiae procedure \nin some form would benefit this court, but I urge my colleagues to \nreject an amendment that would lessen its constructive and beneficial \nimpact.\n  We have already delayed long enough. This amendment would not only \nweaken the bill, it would exacerbate the delay by sending this bill \nback to the House. We all want to avoid a very potentially troubling \ndelay in approving this measure. I have been dismayed by the divisions \nand delays that have prevented us from finally approving the USA \nFREEDOM Act before the existing law expires. We should move now. We \nshould act decisively. We should adopt the USA FREEDOM Act without \namendment No. 1451, which would simply further erode the trust and \nconfidence, the legitimacy, and credibility of the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this amendment, \npassing the USA FREEDOM Act in its current form, avoiding the delay of \nsending it back to the House and then potentially having it come back \nto the Senate, so we can tell the American people we are protecting the \nstrongest, greatest country in the history of the world from some of \nthe most pernicious and perilous terrorist forces ever in the world's \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold his request, we \nmay have a Member who would like to seek the floor.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I will withhold my request, and I will just add, \nwhile we are waiting for my colleague to take the floor, that I want to \njoin a number of my colleagues and speak on another matter.\n\n\n                         Remembering Beau Biden\n\n  Mr. President, I join many of my colleagues in our feelings and \nexpressing deep sadness on the loss of Beau Biden, one of our Nation's \ngreatest public servants, one whom I was privileged to\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\njoin in serving with as attorney general--he as the attorney general of \nDelaware and I of Connecticut.\n  I knew Beau Biden well and, in fact, sat next to him at many of our \nmeetings of the National Association of Attorneys General. There was no \none I met as attorney general who was more dedicated to the rule of \nlaw, to protecting people from threats to public safety, and respecting \ntheir rights and liberties in doing so.\n  His loss is really a loss to our Nation as well as to the Vice \nPresident's family and my heart and prayers go out to them. I know how \ndeeply the Vice President loved Beau Biden and how much, as a dad, his \ndeath will unspeakably and unimaginably affect him.\n  So, again, I want to express, on behalf of Cynthia and myself, our \nthoughts and prayers which are with the Vice President and his family \nat this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n   Artifacts to Honor North Dakota Soldiers Who Lost Their Lives in \n                                Vietnam\n\n  Ms. HEITKAMP. Mr. President, since March, I have been speaking on the \nSenate floor about the 198 North Dakotans who died while serving in the \nVietnam war. But today I want to talk about something a little \ndifferent. I want to talk about projects that were made by the Bismarck \nHigh School juniors in commemoration of these servicemen who gave the \nultimate sacrifice in Vietnam.\n  Three Bismarck High teachers, Laura Forde, Sara Rinas, and Allison \nWendle, are working with their history and English class students to \nresearch the lives and deaths of North Dakota's fallen servicemen in \nVietnam. I am partnering with these high school students to learn about \nand to honor these men.\n  In addition to conducting research, contacting families, and writing \nessays about these North Dakotans who died in Vietnam, the Bismarck \nHigh students took this information and created artifacts to further \nhonor these men. It is their goal to place these artifacts by the \nsoldiers' names at the Vietnam Memorial wall when these students come \nto Washington, DC, this fall.\n  Over 150 students worked in groups or individually to create some \ntruly amazing artifacts. It was difficult to single out a few to share \nwith you today on the Senate floor but know that the artifacts I \ndescribe today are truly examples of this wonderful project that has \nconnected these young students with the stories and the families of the \nyoung men who gave their lives for our country almost 50 years ago.\n  The first artifact I will show you is for John Lundin.\n  McKenzie Rittel, Emily Schmid, Brittany Hawkinson, and Shelby \nWittenberg are Bismarck High School juniors who reached out to John \nLundin's son and daughter-in-law, Ray and Cheri Lundin. The girls \nlearned that John wanted to be a farmer after completing his Army \nservice and painted a farm scene on the scoop of a shovel. On the \nshovel's handle, they wrote John's dates of birth and death in purple \nto represent his Purple Heart Medal. Also on the handle, they painted a \nBronze Star and a Silver Star--medals that John earned while in \nservice.\n  John's family worked with the students to commemorate John's service. \nThey mailed the students soil from the Kansas land where John intended \nto farm and a small John Deere tractor. The students placed the Kansas \nsoil in a jar with North Dakota soil and put the tractor on the lid.\n  If it works out, John's son and daughter-in-law may try to join the \nstudents in visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in November to \nplace these artifacts by John's name.\n  Hunter Lauer and Kyra Wetzel paired up to research the life and death \nof Roy Wagner, who was a student at Bismarck High School about 50 years \nbefore them.\n  In high school, Roy was a lineman on the football team and wore No. \n62. Hunter and Kyra decorated a Bismarck High School football jersey \nwith Roy's last name and wrote his dates of birth, deployment, and \ndeath in the numeral ``6'' and the medals received for his service and \nsacrifice in the numeral ``2.'' Hunter and Kyra compared Roy's football \nposition as a guard to his Army position on the battlefield protecting \nhis comrades and his friends.\n  Hoping that his tribute to Navy seaman Mitchell Hansey will last a \nlong time, Bismarck High School student Logan Mollman decided to carve \nMitchell's name into a piece of wood. Learning that Mitchell served on \nthe Navy APL 30 barge during his entire tour, Logan hand-carved the \nfull APL 30 emblem into the wood and then protected the project with a \ncoat of lacquer. The emblem consists of the Stars and Stripes on the \nleft, three bars on the right, and an apple in the middle for APL, or \nAuxiliary Personnel Lighter. Logan is looking forward to the placement \nof his project in honor of Mitchell at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \nwall.\n  Ashley Erickson, Kaleb Conitz, and Sam Stewart are the three students \nwho researched the life and death of Marine Corps Capt. Ernest \nBartolina.\n  Ernest was flying a Chinook helicopter on a medevac mission when his \nhelicopter was shot down and he was killed. To honor him, the students \nplaced a small Purple Heart Medal on a model Chinook helicopter. They \ndecorated the board that holds the helicopter with music notes, because \nErnest played the French horn, and with the Marine Corps and Purple \nFoxes emblems to represent that he belonged to the HMM-364 Squadron.\n  Kadon Freeman also created an artifact to commemorate the life of \nErnest Bartolina. Kadon drew Ernest's Chinook medevac helicopter and a \njungle setting of Vietnam. In the helicopter, he incorporated photos of \nmen who served in Vietnam, stating:\n\n       The reason I made this CH-46 collage of soldiers in Vietnam \n     was to represent Ernest Bartolina and the fallen heroes of \n     the war with the medevac which he died in. I think that this \n     is a good representation of him because he volunteered to be \n     in the war.\n\n  Bismarck High School student Shaydee Pretends Eagle and PFC Roger \nAlberts are both from the Spirit Lake Sioux Reservation in North \nDakota. It is this connection that led Shaydee to research Roger's life \nand decide to make by hand a ``God's eye'' for a lost son of the Sioux \nTribe. She hand-wove the yarn of her God's eye in red and yellow. She \nhand-beaded ``37E,'' the panel location of Roger's name on the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial wall, in black and white. These four colors are the \ncolors of the medicine wheel--very important colors to the Native \nAmerican culture.\n  Let me read what Shaydee said in her own words about honoring Private \nFirst Class Alberts:\n\n       I decided to make a God's Eye because as Native Americans, \n     we believe that everything belongs to the Creator; the land, \n     the animals, the food we eat, and ourselves. We believe that \n     this life on earth is only temporary. We believe we were put \n     here to grow, love and learn, and then we return home. Our \n     culture has made most Natives artists. Some of the things we \n     do consist of bead work, feather work, quill work, cloth \n     work, buckskin work, painting and dentalium work. All is made \n     by hand, which means whatever we decide to make, we put our \n     mind, heart, and time into. Our elders say, ``always do \n     things with a good heart,'' because the energy and vibes we \n     have at the time stay with whatever we are making, which is \n     why I hope I put my best into the God's Eye.\n\n  Taylor Anderson, Austin Wentz, and Miriah Leier are 11th graders who \ncreated a large F4D Phantom plane to leave at the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial wall in honor of Air Force Lt. Col. Wendell Keller.\n  The students contacted Wendell's family, who shared mementos and \nphotos of Wendell and told them about Wendell's life, the 1969 plane \ncrash, and the 2012 identification of his remains. The family even \nmailed the students items recovered from Wendell's crash site, \nincluding pieces of a zipper and air tube.\n  Taylor, Austin, and Miriah built and decorated the plane with images \nof Wendell and the medals he was awarded in recognition of his \nextraordinary service. The students named the plane the Carol II, in \nhonor of Wendell's wife.\n  Brenna Gilje and Courtney Hirvela learned that CPT Thomas Alderson \nwas a multisport athlete and lettered in tennis, basketball, and track \nwhen he was a student at Grand Forks Central High School.\n  Brenna and Courtney contacted the school to obtain the school letters \nand had a dog tag made with Tom's information on it. In their report, \nthese girls noted:\n\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n\n       This letter represents Alderson's high school years and it \n     can easily be related to a lot of teenage boys today. The \n     letter with the dog tag shows how quickly he had to grow up \n     and mature in such a short amount of time. As Alderson joined \n     the military, he turned in his letter, along with his \n     childhood, for a dog tag.\n\n  When McKayla Boehm began her project, she looked at different \nsoldiers' names to find the right person to research. She noticed one \nof the killed-in-action had the same last name as hers, and she started \nto look into the soldier's family tree and her own family tree. McKayla \nfound that Army SGT Richard Boehm was a cousin to her grandfather. \nMcKayla decided to draw a family tree to show how she was related to \nSergeant Boehm. This connection made the project that much more \nmeaningful to McKayla. She had no idea she was related to a soldier who \nwas killed in action in Vietnam.\n  McKayla added some information about Richard by his name on her \nfamily tree and wrote a note to him, thanking him for his service and \nexpressing her desire that he were still with us so she could have \ngotten to know him. This project also emphasized for McKayla the \nimportance of appreciating family and friends because you never know \nwhen the people who are closest to you may be taken away.\n  Nicole Holmgren, Tiffani Friesz, Brandi Bieber, and Georgia Marion \nlooked for Gerald ``Gerry'' Klein's family members and spoke on the \nphone with Gerry's brother Bob.\n  Bob told the students about Gerry's life growing up in rural North \nDakota, about being the oldest of five kids and working on the family \nfarm. In fact, Bob explained to the girls that Gerry made the farm his \npriority, choosing to spend all of his free time there.\n  The four students created a farm complete with grass, tractors, \nrocks, and farm animals to represent the place where Gerry felt \nhappiest--on the farm where he planned to return and make his life with \nhis fiancee after serving in the Army.\n  Jaycee Walter and Kambri Schaner decorated a fishing hat to \ncommemorate Thomas Welker, a staff sergeant who served in Vietnam in \nthe Army.\n  The students learned that prior to being drafted, Thomas enjoyed \nspending his free time fishing with his young family. On the fishing \nhat, Jaycee and Kambri wrote Thomas' name and dates of birth and death. \nOn eight fishing lures they hung from the hat, they wrote the names of \nThomas' family members and the awards he received during his service to \nour country.\n  Bailee McEvers, Teagan McIntyre, Shandi Taix and Maisie Patzner \nfilled a fishing tackle box with items that were important to Michael \nMeyhoff who served in the Army during the Vietnam war.\n  These four students communicated with Michael's family, who described \nMichael's interest in baseball, rock collecting, hunting, and fishing. \nThe students filled the tackle box with a baseball, rocks, shotgun \nshells, and fishing lures to represent his hobbies. They also decorated \nthe box with pictures of Michael and the baseball field in Center, ND, \nthat is named after him.\n  Finally, the final photo I will show you today is of a young man who \nwas impacted in a very meaningful way in his research. Zach Bohlin is a \ntalented student who carved a piece of wood into the shape of North \nDakota. Zach added a peace sign, the soldier's name, and then expressed \nhis own feelings about the sacrifice made by the Vietnam soldier he \nresearched.\n  I would like to share the beautiful sentiment expressed by Zach \nthrough his project at Bismarck High School.\n\n     The empty chair,\n     The absence of one voice in the air.\n     Emotions take over with fear.\n     You're all I can't hear.\n     Damn the opinions of the world,\n     It's only filled with selfish words.\n     Scream and never be heard,\n     Keep quiet, carry on Sir.\n     Bring with you your heartfelt rhymes,\n     From the uncharted waters of your mind.\n     Take your wounded skin and fly,\n     It takes true love to sacrifice your life.\n\n  This project has meant so much to the families of the soldiers who \nhave been researched. This project has meant so much to these young \nstudents who are connected in a way where, without these three great \nteachers, they would never have been connected to those who were killed \nin action in Vietnam. They would never have appreciated the sacrifice, \nand, in many ways, these soldiers would never be remembered.\n  I can't say how proud I am, as their Senator, of the wonderful \nstudents of Bismarck High School and the great teachers who have taken \non this project. It has meant so much to me, it has meant so much to \nthe families, and I think it has really meant so much to so many of the \nVietnam veterans of my State who are still with us, who see this period \nof commemoration--as dictated by the President--as an important time to \nheal the wounds of Vietnam.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                       Commending Senator Graham\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I understand that the majority leader \nis on his way here to close out the Senate very shortly. I want to take \n1 minute to recognize a significant milestone in the life of one of our \ncolleagues here on the floor. That colleague is our friend Senator \nLindsey Graham, and that milestone is his retirement from the U.S. Air \nForce and Reserve, which he has served for more than 30 years. I think \nthat 30 years of service--particularly 30 years of service overlapping \nwith the responsibilities of being a U.S. Senator--is something that is \nworth a kind word.\n  The quality of Senator Graham's service was impeccable. He has been \nawarded the Bronze Star Medal for his service. He has been recognized \nfor his loyalty to the Air Force by being appointed to the U.S. Air \nForce Academy Board of Visitors. Clearly, his contribution to the U.S. \nAir Force has been real. But I think Senator Graham would also be the \nfirst one to say that he believes the U.S. Air Force made more of a \ncontribution to him than he did to the U.S. Air Force. I think that is \none of the reasons he was such a good U.S. Air Force and Reserve \nofficer, and it is also one of the reasons that we have such affection \nfor him here in the Senate.\n  I have to say that I disagree with Senator Graham about a great \nnumber of things. He is a very, very conservative Member of the Senate. \nBut we get to know one another in this body. I like Senator Graham. I \nrespect Senator Graham, and I am pleased to come to the floor today to \ncommend Senator Graham for what must be a somewhat emotional milestone \nas he steps down from the uniform that he has now worn for more than 30 \nyears for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Friday, May 8, I had the honor of \npaying tribute to a dear friend, John Heyburn, who passed away on April \n29 after a long illness.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I gave during the \ncelebration of his life at St. Francis in the Fields Episcopal Church \nin Harrods Creek, KY, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             [May 8, 2015]\n\n               Leader McConnell's Eulogy of John Heyburn\n\n       We lost John just a few days ago, but it's been a long \n     goodbye.\n       And so Martha, as we celebrate John this morning, we honor \n     you too.\n       Because through it all, you were his most faithful \n     companion, his fiercest advocate, and a cherished lifeline to \n     those of us who loved him dearly.\n       And we're grateful.\n       Scripture tells us that heaven is a city. And I like to \n     think that even in life John\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\n     would have appreciated the comparison. He loved this city and \n     all that it meant to him--the connection it gave him to \n     family and the father he so admired--the opportunity it gave \n     him to help so many others over the years as a mentor, a \n     friend, a neighbor, and as a wise and patient jurist.\n       John just loved being with people--and we loved being with \n     him. He was a man who was full of life and vigor and a \n     boundless curiosity about the world around him and the people \n     who filled it.\n       Above all, though, he was good.\n       They say that politics is a contact sport, which is true. I \n     confess I enjoy it. But it's also true that politics carries \n     temptations for all us who are involved in it. Most of us \n     struggle with those temptations, and some occasionally cross \n     the line. Not John.\n       John Heyburn had as much integrity as anyone I have ever \n     known. As a young man, he dreamed of being a politician. But \n     what he really wanted, I think, was to play a part in shaping \n     events--to leave a mark on his country, his city, his \n     community . . . to live not just for himself but for others.\n       Like so many other great men, he found his heart's ambition \n     in an unexpected place: in the courtroom he came to love, in \n     his marriage with Martha, and in the sons he cherished. And \n     in these last few years, he showed his greatness in another \n     unexpected way. It was in his heroic struggle against a \n     terrible illness that he inspired us most with his optimism \n     and his athlete's spirit. He let us accompany him on the \n     journey, and we we're the better for it.\n       To borrow the words of another U.S. Senator, John taught us \n     how to live and he taught us how to die.\n       We will miss his hearty laugh, his kind eyes, his \n     thoughtful presence. But as we say our final goodbye to this \n     good man, we are comforted by the thought that he is now in \n     the heavenly city, where we are told that every tear will be \n     wiped away, full of vigor and new life.\n       And we are consoled to think that John Heyburn has finally \n     heard those words he longed to hear: ``Well done, good and \n     faithful servant, enter your master's joy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/senate-section/article/S3400-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3400-S3401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING GEORGE HALEY\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I recently paid tribute to \nGeorge Haley, a distinguished Tennessean and distinguished American who \ndied at the age of 89 on May 13.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article ``George Haley, the Giant \nWho Never Quit,'' by Bankole Thompson, published in the Michigan \nChronicle and a copy of a resolution passed by the Kansas Senate \nhonoring George Haley be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Michigan Chronicle, May 18, 2015]\n\n                 George Haley, The Giant Who Never Quit\n\n                         (By Bankole Thompson)\n\n       Malcolm X, in ``The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to \n     Alex Haley,'' described by Time magazine as one of the 10 \n     best non-fiction books of the century, told Alex Haley to \n     remind his younger brother, George Haley, not to forget that \n     it was because of Malcolm and others raising hell in the \n     streets as fighters for racial democracy that George was able \n     to make it in Kansas where he became the first Black state \n     senator in 1964.\n       Eight years ago in the basement of his Silver Spring home \n     in Maryland, I asked George what he thought of Malcolm's \n     remarks about him in that seminal book. He looked at me and \n     laughed and called it ``a rather interesting distinction.'' I \n     smiled back and we continued looking over materials he wanted \n     to share with me including letters Alex wrote to him as he \n     traveled around the country and the world. From the \n     correspondences I deduced that he was Alex's secret weapon.\n       Last week, George Haley, the man known to many as \n     ``Ambassador Haley'' died May 13 at his home at the age of 89 \n     following an illness. No man has had a bigger impact on my \n     life growing up than George Haley. He was an accomplished \n     lawyer, a United States Ambassador, a veteran of the U.S. Air \n     Force, a son of the South, a family man, a Morehouse man, a \n     thinker of the Black experience and a person who did not \n     allow Jim Crow to subdue him when he became the second Black \n     to earn a law degree at the University of Arkansas. As he \n     would explain later, he was living in a basement and would go \n     upstairs to take his classes. He would go on to serve six \n     U.S. presidents.\n       I met George when I was a teenager looking to explore the \n     possibilities of the world and how to better myself living in \n     a fatherless home. Being raised by a grandmother who was \n     doing her best, I had the good fortune one day of meeting \n     Ambassador Haley, who instantly took interest in me. He \n     treasured my grandmother and congratulated her on many \n     occasions for her efforts in raising a Black boy. Not knowing \n     what the future would hold for me as a teenager because I did \n     not have the typical structure of parental support, George \n     entered my life, enamored by my germinating skills as a \n     budding writer. As a mentor, he told me the world was my \n     oyster and shared stories of his life with me.\n       One day, during one of my regular visits to his office, he \n     started asking pointed questions about the unexplained \n     absence of my dad. I told him the stories my grandmother \n     shared with me about my father not being at home. He looked \n     at me closely, tense and upset. He shook his head and told me \n     never to feel bad about that because ``the man upstairs'' was \n     in control. He was not an absent father. He was a present \n     father who loved and always talked about his kids.\n       No doubt, having someone of his stature say that to a lad \n     who was at a crucial stage in life was reassuring. Many young \n     men today, especially Black boys, need the confidence and \n     support of accomplished men who have crossed every Rubicon \n     with grace and dignity, to tell them that their world is not \n     going to fall apart and support them in ensuring that they \n     too can be meaningfully and productively engaged and become \n     change makers.\n       We developed a father-son relationship. He told me about \n     Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays, the former president of Morehouse \n     College and the man who mentored him and Dr. Martin Luther \n     King Jr. and others. His favorite phrase from Dr. Mays that \n     he left me with was, ``The man who out thinks you, rules \n     you.''\n       He talked about the need for critical thinkers in the Black \n     community, and said we owed it to ourselves to provide an \n     atmosphere that would illuminate the brilliance of Black boys \n     and allow them to grow into manhood and find a sense of \n     achievement.\n       He talked about the responsibilities of writers having the \n     ability and power to narrate and shape history. Black writers \n     in particular, he believed, should never fail to articulate \n     the Black experience and tell stories that often could \n     otherwise go missing. He referenced many times the book \n     ``Roots,'' written by Alex and how it impacted the world. I \n     still kept a copy of ``Roots'' in my study which he \n     autographed for me as a birthday gift. We discussed on \n     numerous times the importance of preserving a bibliography of \n     Black writers of the last century.\n       As a Morehouse graduate of the class of 1949, the same time \n     Dr. King was at Morehouse, he believed in the philosophy of \n     Dr. Mays and what he did in training and preparing \n     generations of Black men like him and others at Morehouse who \n     would go on to change the world and better their communities.\n       George Haley was a first-rate gentleman of the era before \n     and after Jim Crow. In 1963, Alex Haley wrote in Readers \n     Digest, ``George Haley: The Man Who Wouldn't Quit,'' an \n     article that chronicled the persistent racial humiliation he \n     underwent at the University of Arkansas.\n       ``The first day of school, he went quickly to his basement \n     room, put his sandwich on the table, and headed upstairs for \n     class. He found himself moving through wave upon wave of \n     White faces that all mirrored the same emotions--shock, \n     disbelief, then choking, inarticulate rage. The lecture room \n     was buzzing with conversation, but as he stepped through the \n     door there was silence. He looked for his seat. It was on the \n     side between the other students and the instructor. When the \n     lecture began, he tried desperately to concentrate on what \n     the professor was saying, but the hate in that room seeped \n     into his conscience and obliterated thought. On the second \n     day, he was greeted with open taunts and threats: ``You, \n     nigger, what are you doing here?'' ``Hey, nigger, go back to \n     Africa.'' He tried not to hear, to walk with an even pace, \n     with dignity,'' Alex wrote about George in a piece that was a \n     classic exhibit of the Jim Crow era.\n       When Dr. King appeared at Kansas State University (KSU) in \n     January of 1968, George came with him. Decades later, the \n     university would invite him to return in 2011 to hear the \n     rediscovered recordings of King's remarks. What was also \n     discovered was another piece of history: After King's \n     assassination, a handwritten note with George's name on it \n     was found in his coat pocket.\n       In 2010, during one of his shuttle visits to Michigan, he \n     asked me to meet him for lunch at the Westin Hotel in \n     Southfield. There I asked him about the note found in King's \n     jacket. He said he was happy the new information would allow \n     the university to do more around race and justice and went on \n     to explain how it happened.\n       King scribbled down names of individuals, including George, \n     that he needed to recognize before speaking at KSU. George \n     and three other university officials, including then KSU \n     President McCain, had chartered a plane to pick King up in \n     Manhattan, Kansas so he could come speak at the university.\n       George Haley believed in education and his life was shaped \n     by seminal events. When he came out of law school, he joined \n     the law firm of Stevens Jackson in Kansas, which provided \n     work in the Brown v. Board of Education case in Topeka.\n       I treasured his mentorship. I cherished the father figure \n     he was to me. I was honored to have known and spent a \n     significant amount of time with him. I accompanied him to \n     events he wanted me to be at.\n       For instance, when his close friend Simeon Booker, whose \n     groundbreaking coverage of the Emmett Till murder trial made \n     him one of the most iconic Black journalists of all time, \n     celebrated his 50 years as Washington Bureau chief for Jet \n     magazine, George asked me to accompany him to the \n     celebration. The event was a Who's Who of the Black writers \n     world.\n       His lasting impact on me would never wane with passage of \n     time.\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\n       Before he became ill, I always expected an interrogating \n     call from him at the office in a sagely voice wanting to know \n     what the latest update was with me, especially if he didn't \n     hear from me for a month or two. If his call went to voice \n     mail, our receptionist Pauline Leatherwood, would leave a \n     note to say that George Haley called from Maryland.\n       When my son was born he was excited. He sent a Christmas \n     gift for him every year. It was always predictable--something \n     to keep him warm in the winter. We talked about fatherhood \n     and the challenges and opportunities that come with such \n     responsibility, highlighted in Dr. Curtis Ivery's book \n     ``Black Fatherhood: Reclaiming Our Legacy.''\n       He would remind me sometimes of the first day we met and \n     the impression I made on him, and how life, often punctuated \n     by challenges, has a way of taking us to places unthinkable.\n       George Williford Boyce Haley, born in Henning, Tennessee, \n     will be missed by his wife, Doris Haley, a retired \n     Washington, D.C. educator, and his children attorney Anne-\n     Haley Brown, who works in the Los Angeles City Attorney's \n     Office, and son David Haley, a Kansas state senator and his \n     beloved grandchildren.\n       When I think about George Haley's demise, I think about the \n     adage that, ``Those who have lived a good life do not fear \n     death, but meet it calmly, and even long for it in the face \n     of great suffering. But those who do not have a peaceful \n     conscience dread death as though life means nothing but \n     physical torment. The challenge is to live our life so that \n     we will be prepared for death when it comes.''\n       George Haley lived a full life and he will continue to live \n     on in the lives of those he helped and mentored.\n       He was a man of mark, and the giant who never quit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 1707\n\nA Resolution recognizing 50 years of black state senators in Kansas and \n  honoring George W.

After serving in World War \n     II in the U.S. Air Force, George Haley attended Morehouse \n     College with fellow student Martin Luther King, Jr. and \n     became one of the first African-Americans to graduate from \n     the University of Arkansas School of Law. George Williford \n     Boyce Haley, a Republican Kansas City attorney and resident \n     of Wyandotte County, and Democrat Curtis McClinton, Sr., a \n     realtor from Wichita and member of the Kansas House of \n     Representatives, were both elected to the Kansas Senate in \n     the general election held in November, 1964. Haley was \n     officially accorded first-elected status because his district \n     number, 11, numerically preceded McClinton's district number, \n     26. Haley's last name alphabetically precedes McClinton's and \n     Wyandotte County election officials reported election results \n     to the Secretary of State's office before Sedgwick County \n     election officials reported results; and\n       Whereas, Haley joined the firm of Stevens, Jackson and \n     Davis in Kansas City, Kansas, who provided legal assistance \n     in the landmark civil rights case, Brown v. Board of \n     Education in Topeka, Kansas. Haley then served as Deputy City \n     Attorney in Kansas City, Kansas; and\n       Whereas, In the Kansas Legislature, Senator George Haley \n     was an advocate for personal liberties and social equity, and \n     a visionary for inclusion. He was often not supported by \n     fellow members of the Kansas Senate, including members from \n     his own political party. A noted example of putting \n     principles above partisan or popular politics was his near-\n     solo support for fair and equal housing; and\n       Whereas, Haley went on to serve in six United States \n     presidential administrations. He served as Chief Counsel of \n     the Federal Transportation Administration under President \n     Nixon, Associate Director for the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission at the U.S. Information Agency and \n     General Counsel and Congressional Liaison under President \n     Ford, Senior Advisor to the U.S. delegation of the United \n     Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \n     under President Reagan, Chairman of the Postal Rate \n     Commission under President George H.W. Bush and, under \n     President Clinton, as the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of \n     The Gambia in West Africa, from whence Haley's forefather \n     Kuntah Kinteh was brought to America; and\n       Whereas, Haley now lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, with \n     his wife of 60 years, Doris; and\n       Whereas, Over the last 50 years, beginning with George W. \n     Haley, only eight other black people have served in the \n     Kansas State Senate: Curtis R.

Dr. Salome Raheim has served in this leadership \nposition for 7 exemplary years, and she will return as a faculty member \nduring July of this year.\n  Dr. Raheim has dedicated her career to advancing diversity and \ncultural competence across the board in areas from higher education to \nhealth and human services. During her time as dean, she has established \nnumerous initiatives that have strengthened her department and \ncontributed immensely to the future success of her students. Her \ntireless efforts and contributions as dean will be remembered fondly \nand will be missed by many.\n  Under Dr. Raheim's leadership, the school has developed a campus-wide \nJust Community initiative, which advocates for a safer, more diverse \ncommunity that is both equal and inclusive. The school has also \nexpanded engagement between private and public agencies, in order to \nbetter provide for local communities and underrepresented populations. \nDr. Raheim has also aided in fostering international partnerships with \nuniversities in Germany and Armenia, to the West Indies and Jamaica. \nAll of these efforts have been a part in the overall establishment of \nthis department as a nationally-recognized faculty of experts.\n  As the first African-American woman to hold a deanship at UConn, and \nas a nationally recognized leader in the field of social work \neducation, Dr. Raheim has undoubtedly left her mark on the UConn School \nof Social Work.\n  My wife Cynthia and I are honored to celebrate Dr. Raheim's \nachievements, and we wish her all the best as she begins the next \nchapter of her life.

Mr. President, New Hampshire's capital city, \nConcord, is celebrating its 250th anniversary this year. To be exact, \nthis is the anniversary of the city's being rechristened as Concord in \nrecognition of a peaceful agreement that resolved a boundary dispute \nwith the adjacent town of Bow in 1765.\n  The city's beginnings go back to 1725, when the Province of \nMassachusetts Bay established the area as the Plantation of Penacook, \nborrowing an Abenaki Native American word meaning ``crooked place,'' \nwhich refers to the serpentine bends of the Merrimack River just east \nof the city. Since 1808, when Concord became our capital city, it has \nbeen the civic and cultural heart of the Granite State. Along with its \ncentral place in New Hampshire geography and history, Concord has \nretained the friendliness and charm of a classic New England community.\n  In a sense, it was in Concord that the United States of America was \nborn as a constitutional republic. In June 21, 1788, in the city's Old \nNorth Meeting House, deputies from across the State approved the new \nfederal constitution. And because New Hampshire was the decisive ninth \nof the original 13 States to approve the document, the Constitution was \ndeclared ratified and became the law of the land.\n  Likewise, it was men from Concord who were in the forefront of \ndefending the Constitution during the Civil War. Following the \nbombardment of Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for 75,000 troops. \nIn Concord, a recruiting\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\nstation was set up near the Statehouse, and 50 volunteers enlisted by \nthe end of the first day. The first to volunteer was Concord police \nconstable Edward Sturtevant, who 20 months later made the ultimate \nsacrifice at the Battle of Fredericksburg. It is said that the First \nNew Hampshire Volunteer Regiment, mustered in Concord, was the first \nfully equipped regiment of volunteers to go to the front in 1861. \nToday, prominently displayed in the State capitol building in Concord, \nare the tattered, bloodstained regimental flags carried by Granite \nState soldiers at Bull Run, Antietam, Gettysburg, and other Civil War \nbattlefields.\n  The magnificent gold-domed Statehouse, at the center of Main Street, \nwas completed in 1819, and is the oldest State capitol in which both \nhouses of the legislature meet in their original chambers. The house of \nrepresentatives consists of 400 members and is the third largest \nlegislative body in the English-speaking world, exceeded only by the \nU.S. House and the British House of Commons.\n  For two centuries, Concord has been a commercial center and \ntransportation hub, connected first by canal and later by railway and \nhighway with Boston. In the first half of the 19th century, the city's \nAbbot Downing carriage manufacturer was known worldwide for its Concord \nStagecoach, famed as ``the coach that won the West.''\n  Since the late 1800s and continuing today, the city has been famous \nfor its granite quarries. The local granite type, Concord granite, is \nprized for its fine texture and absence of discoloring oxides and \nminerals. It has been used in the construction of countless Civil War \nmonuments, the Library of Congress, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the \nPentagon, including portions of the Pentagon lost on 9/11.\n  Concord has been home to many people of renown, including Franklin \nPierce, our Nation's 14th President. As a former public school teacher, \nmy personal hero is Christa McAuliffe, a Concord High School social \nstudies teacher who was selected by NASA from more than 11,000 \napplicants to become the first teacher in space. Tragically, she \nperished aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger, but she is memorialized \nin Concord at the Christa McAuliffe School and the McAuliffe-Shephard \nDiscover Center.\n  From my 6 years as Governor, I can testify that Concord's greatest \nassets are the everyday people of the city, who are unfailingly \ngracious and friendly. And, though I am far from objective, I think \nthat Concord's Main Street is one of the very best in New England. It \ntakes its character not only from the historic architecture, but also \nfrom the stores, cafes, and restaurants--places where people know your \nname, and where the small business owners are right there, every day.\n  Concord is marking its 250th anniversary, this year, with multiple \nevents and festivities, including a week-long celebration in August. \nAnd the city is also looking to the future, with an ambitious project \nto renew the city's center. Mayor Jim Bouley and the people of Concord \nare determined to preserve the historic character and charm of \ndowntown, while also creating a 21st century Main Street. I salute \ntheir city's rich past and present, and I look forward to joining in \nthe anniversary celebrations in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/01/senate-section/article/S3402-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING DISTRICT DONUTS.SLIDERS.BREWS.\n\n Mr. VITTER.
