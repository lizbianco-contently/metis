Mr. President, all Americans face deadlines. Ask any \nstudent or any working professional, and they will tell you they have \nto meet deadlines to be successful. It is part of life.\n  Senate Republicans, though, seem to reject the idea of finishing work \non time. Instead, the Republican leader has repeatedly taken the Senate \nto the brink. Already the first few months of this year, Republicans \nhave botched deadlines for funding the Department of Homeland Security, \nthe Federal Intelligence Surveillance Court--that was a real debacle--\nand, most recently, the Export-Import Bank, which is now out of \nbusiness.\n  There were 165,000 people working as a result of the Bank who now--if \nnot gone and looking for employment, they will have to do it very soon \nbecause the Republicans are boasting they were able to kill this \nbusiness-oriented program that has been successful all over the world, \nallowing us to export things that we would not have been able to had \nthat law not been in effect. As a result of our not doing things, other \ncountries--China and other countries--are now picking up the slack \nwhere Ex-Im Bank worked before. There is a lot of business being lost \nfor the American people, and it is very unfortunate because, again, \nRepublicans are not meeting deadlines.\n  Every one of those crises is accompanied by consequences that hurt \nour country: lost productivity, a volatile stock market, and lapses in \nnational security. Every time Republicans miss a deadline who gets hurt \nworse than anyone else? The middle class does and our Nation is less \nsafe.\n  Now, I realize we have another vitally important, time-sensitive \nmatter that requires the Senate's attention as soon as possible. At the \nend of this month, our Nation is faced with a looming expiration and \ninsolvency of the highway trust fund. With 64,000 structurally \ndeficient bridges and billions of dollars needed for construction \nprojects across America--really, trillions of dollars. We have an \ninfrastructure deficit in this country of about $3 trillion, and 64,000 \nbridges are structurally deficient. It is irresponsible for Republicans \nto be content to let the authorization of the highway program lapse or \nmaybe they will come up with another solution like they have in the \npast, 33 separate short-term extensions of the highway bill.\n  And now I understand that the chairman of the Finance Committee is \nworking on another short-term extension. How really insensitive to the \nneeds of the American people. There are some States that can't do \nconstruction work on highways in the wintertime. It is cold. But that \ndoesn't seem to matter. These short-term extensions are what has become \npart of the Republican mantra.\n  There is also an urgent need to reach a bipartisan budget agreement. \nIn less than 3 months, unless we act, the government will shut down. To \navoid that, we will need a budget agreement between two parties. That \nis going to take time and a lot of work, but to this point, the \ndeadline seems to be meaningless to my Republican colleagues. They are \ndoing nothing, not a conversation about it, and they led the charge in \nthe past about how phony the overseas contingency funding was to pay \nthe bills of this country, but now they seem to embrace it. But I guess \ntheir theory is--why not put off until tomorrow what you can do today? \nI don't understand why what we have around here is, putting off until \ntomorrow everything that should be done today.\n  There is no need to wait until the end of July to address our \nNation's roads, bridges, and rails. That is what we are doing. There is \nno need to wait until September to come to a sensible agreement funding \nour government, but that is what they are doing.\n  Democrats are ready to work with Republicans on these two issues--and \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/senate-section/article/S4660-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DEADLINES PASSED\n\n  Mr. REID.

It is irresponsible for Republicans \nto be content to let the authorization of the highway program lapse or \nmaybe they will come up with another solution like they have in the \npast, 33 separate short-term extensions of the highway bill.\n  And now I understand that the chairman of the Finance Committee is \nworking on another short-term extension. How really insensitive to the \nneeds of the American people. There are some States that can't do \nconstruction work on highways in the wintertime. It is cold. But that \ndoesn't seem to matter. These short-term extensions are what has become \npart of the Republican mantra.\n  There is also an urgent need to reach a bipartisan budget agreement. \nIn less than 3 months, unless we act, the government will shut down. To \navoid that, we will need a budget agreement between two parties. That \nis going to take time and a lot of work, but to this point, the \ndeadline seems to be meaningless to my Republican colleagues. They are \ndoing nothing, not a conversation about it, and they led the charge in \nthe past about how phony the overseas contingency funding was to pay \nthe bills of this country, but now they seem to embrace it. But I guess \ntheir theory is--why not put off until tomorrow what you can do today? \nI don't understand why what we have around here is, putting off until \ntomorrow everything that should be done today.\n  There is no need to wait until the end of July to address our \nNation's roads, bridges, and rails. That is what we are doing. There is \nno need to wait until September to come to a sensible agreement funding \nour government, but that is what they are doing.\n  Democrats are ready to work with Republicans on these two issues--and \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S4660-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4660-S4661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could gain the attention of the \nDemocratic leader for just a moment, before he leaves the floor. In a \nfew moments, the Senator from Washington and I will make our opening \nstatements on our proposed committee legislation to fix No Child Left \nBehind, but before we do that, I want to first express my appreciation \nto the majority leader for his putting it on the floor, bringing it up. \nI know the majority leader has a variety of other options, and he is \ngiving us a chance to take our bill, which we will be describing in a \nfew minutes, and put it on the floor.\n  I also want to acknowledge and thank the Democratic leader because he \nhas allowed the bill to come to the floor without delay so that we can \nmove to the bill and allow Senators to begin to vote on it. We hope to \nbegin having those votes tomorrow morning.\n  We have a good example of cooperation here with the majority leader \nbringing the bill to the floor, a unanimous bill by the committee. \nSenator Murray, a member of the Democratic leadership, played a major \nrole in the legislation. In fact, it was her advice that I took which \ncaused us I think to have success in the committee by presenting a \nbipartisan bill. But I specifically want to thank Senator Reid for his \nattitude on the bill. I think that will create the environment in which \nwe will have to frankly work through some contentious issues. This is \nnot an issue-free piece of legislation. We are 7 years overdue. It \nshould have been passed in the last two Congresses. But we have made a \ngood start.\n  I thank both leaders for giving Senator Murray and me a chance to try \nto work in the next few days with other Senators to continue the \namendment process, allow Senators to have their say, get a result, and \nwork with the House to send a bill to the President that he is willing \nto sign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Tennessee is an expert in \neducation. Not only was he the Governor of the great State of \nTennessee, he was also the Secretary of Education. He knows education. \nAnd he has a good partner to work with, Patty Murray. The senior \nSenator from Washington is a legislator first class, and the work they \nhave done as leaders of this important committee has been very, very \ngood.\n  I appreciate the kind words of my friend from Tennessee, but this is \nan example of what I talked about a few minutes ago. We are not \ntreating Republicans the way they have treated us. I repeat, every \npiece of legislation I brought to the floor we had to file a motion to \nproceed on--with extremely rare exception, everything. We wasted months \ngoing through this senseless 2 days, 30 hours, and on and on with all \nthe time spent on this. It was an effort to embarrass President Obama, \nand they did their best to do that. But as cynical as it was, it helped \nthem in the 2014 elections, and I acknowledge that, and that is too \nbad. But it is too bad we had to go through all that because it has \nreally hurt the country.\n  I say to my friend, I have great respect for this man from Tennessee. \nHe is a good legislator, and I look forward to moving forward on this \nimportant piece of legislation involving elementary and secondary \neducation. We have to do a better job, and I think there are no two \nbetter qualified people than the two managers of this bill to \naccomplish that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader. Senator \nMurray and I will make our opening statements, but I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we begin debate today on a bill to fix \nthe problems with No Child Left Behind, the Federal law that has been \ncausing confusion and anxiety in 100,000 public schools in our country.\n  This week, Newsweek magazine called this the ``law that everyone \nwants to fix.'' There is a broad consensus about that, and, remarkably, \nthere is a broad consensus about how to fix it. This is the consensus: \nthat we should continue the law's important measurements of students' \nacademic progress but restore to States, school districts, classroom \nteachers, and parents the responsibility for deciding what to do about \nthe results of those tests. In my view, this change should produce \nfewer tests and more appropriate ways to measure student achievement. \nWe believe this is the most effective path toward higher standards, \nbetter teaching, and real accountability.\n  Our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--the Senate's \neducation committee--obviously believes that too. The committee \nreported the bill unanimously. Senator McConnell, the majority leader, \nnoted earlier that committee has on it some of the Senate's most \nliberal Democrats and several of the Senate's most conservative \nRepublicans. It was a surprise to many people that the committee \nreported it unanimously. But the committee understood that this was a \nproblem we needed to solve and that we had a fair and open process, \neveryone had a chance to participate, and that the bill was good enough \nto come to the floor, where we could continue to work on it.\n  Not only is there a consensus about how to fix it within the U.S. \nSenate committee on education, there is outside of the Senate. This \nbipartisan bill, which has come to the Senate floor, has been supported \nby teachers, by school boards, by school superintendents, by chief \nState school officers, and by Governors.\n  The Presiding Officer is a former Governor, as am I. Both of us would \nhave to go back a long time to remember something that was supported as \nenthusiastically by both the National\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\nGovernors Association and the major teachers unions, but this \nbipartisan proposal is.\n  Earlier I thanked the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for putting \nthe bill on the floor. That may seem like a small matter for those not \ninvolved in the Senate, but it is a big matter. He has a pretty big \nlist of bipartisan legislation that is important to this country's \nfuture, and he could have chosen any of those to bring to the floor. \nBut he saw the importance of education to our country and that we not \nonly need a strong national defense, but we need to be strong at home.\n  So we are going to be dealing with legislation that affects 100,000 \npublic schools, 50 million children, 3\\1/2\\ million teachers. It may \nnot be big news every day in Washington, DC, but it sure is in \nNashville, TN, in Maryville, TN, in Washington State, and in North \nDakota.\n  If you go home, you hear quite a bit about Common Core. You hear \nquite a bit about the national school board. You hear quite a bit about \nwhether the standards we have for our children are enough to help them \nget a job and to help them succeed in the world we have. So I thank the \nmajority leader for putting it on the floor.\n  As I said before, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. He has \nallowed the bill to come to the floor as rapidly as it could. There \nhave been no delaying tactics whatsoever. We didn't have to have a \nmotion to proceed and a cloture vote. I am grateful for that because \nthat means we can work with other Senators and put this bill into shape \nand give more people a chance to have their say on behalf of their \nconstituents at home.\n  I want to give my special thanks at the outset--and I probably will \nagain during this debate more than once--to the Senator from Washington \nState, Mrs. Patty Murray. She is a good partner to have in this, and I \nam glad I took her advice in dealing with this bill. I knew we had a \nproblem because we tried in the last two Congresses to solve this \nproblem, and we absolutely failed. We are 7 years overdue. But Senator \nMurray made the suggestion that she and I try to work together to \ncreate a bipartisan product that we could present to the committee and \nthen work from that. I took that advice, and it turned out to be \nexcellent advice. Her ability to be a forceful advocate for her \npositions but at the same time command respect within her caucus and \namong people around the country who know her and to make this work is a \nprincipal reason, if not the main reason, we had a unanimous report \nfrom the education committee. So I am grateful to her for that.\n  If you are a busy parent of one of the 50 million children attending \npublic school today, you may not know your child has been going to \nschool for the last 7 years under a broken and expired Federal \neducation law. You may not know that the U.S. Department of Education \nis practically running your child's school, if you live in one of 42 \nStates operating under waivers. You may have heard your child's teacher \ncomplain about how little flexibility he or she has to help your child \nand to innovate in the classroom, and you have probably seen your \nchild's frustration at the number of tests he or she is taking.\n  You have no doubt heard of the frustration of other parents and \nteachers about Common Core, the academic standard most States have \nadopted. In 2009, the Department of Education created a $4.4 billion \npot of money that States competed for. This was called Race to the Top. \nStates got extra points for adopting Common Core. Race to the Top \ncaused 30 States plus Washington, DC, to adopt Common Core so they \ncould include that in their application.\n  Then along came the phenomenon of waivers, because we in Congress had \nfailed to act since 2007. The original No Child Left Behind bill passed \nin 2001 became unworkable. It established a goal that by 2014 all of \nour children in 100,000 public schools would be proficient in math and \nscience. We got to 2014--or were getting there--and the children \nweren't proficient. So all the schools--almost all our public schools--\nwere labeled as failing. So to avoid that bizarre result the Secretary \nissued waivers. But at the same time he issued some requirements about \nwhat you had to do to get a waiver if you were the State of North \nDakota or Tennessee or some other State.\n  So you are likely to have heard from teachers and school board \nmembers frustrated about the narrow definitions from Washington about \nexactly how to evaluate teachers and what to do about low performing \nschools. Those requirements came with the waivers.\n  You may be frustrated that your child doesn't have more options for \nschool than the nearest public school. I believe this bill will end \nmany of those frustrations. It will restore responsibility to States \nfor deciding what academic standards to use and will restore \nresponsibility to teachers to do what they do best, and that is to help \nyour child learn what they need to know and be able to do.\n  It will stop the trend of taking too many tests by restoring to \nStates the responsibility for deciding how to use Federal test scores \nin measuring school achievement. It will help States expand and \nreplicate their best charter schools so more parents will have a choice \nof schools.\n  The Senate education committee adopted 29 amendments during its \ndebate on the bill. Already Senator Murray and I are working with \nDemocratic and Republican Senators on adopting a large number of other \namendments. In fact, I will have a substitute amendment for our bill to \noffer a little later this afternoon that will include a number of those \namendments, and we expect there to be a robust discussion and debate \nand votes on the Senate floor.\n  Now, just for some context about the debate we are having, when we \ntalk about fixing No Child Left Behind, here is what we are talking \nabout. We are talking about reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. We are talking about the spending in that act of about \n$23 billion, which the Federal Government distributes to States through \nthe law's nine titles. The biggest title is what we call title I. It \nspends about $14.5 billion specifically to help low-income students.\n  Now, the $23 billion that is spent through this bill we are debating \nis a lot of money, but it is only about 4 percent of the total amount \nthis Nation spends each year on kindergarten through 12th grade public \neducation. The Federal Government contributes another 4 or 5 percent to \nK-through-12 education through various programs. But the rest of the \nmoney, about 90 percent, comes from State and local governments.\n  Why No Child Left Behind must be fixed: The problems have been \ncreated by a combination of Presidential action--but let us not forget \nour own responsibility and our own fault for this problem. That is \ncalled congressional inaction. So it is the combination of Presidential \naction and congressional inaction that has led us to a situation where \nwe have a bill described by a major news magazine as ``the education \nlaw that everybody wants to fix.''\n  It started in 2001, when President George W. Bush and Congress \nenacted a bill called No Child Left Behind, which requires a total of \n17 tests between reading and math and science during a child's \nelementary and secondary education. The results of these tests must be \ndisaggregated and reported according to race, ethnicity, gender, \ndisability, and other measures so parents, teachers, and the community \ncan see which children are being left behind.\n  In other words, a typical third grader would have two tests, one in \nreading and one in math. Each test should last about 2 hours. Then that \ntest for that school would be reported to the public, and you would \nbreak it down according to the groups I just mentioned, and we could \nsee if any group of children in any community is being left behind.\n  That wasn't all the law did. The law also created Federal standards--\ncreated here in Washington--for whether a school is succeeding or \nfailing, what a State or school district must do about that failure, \nand whether a teacher was highly qualified to teach in a classroom. \nThose are Washington, DC, definitions.\n  If fixing No Child Left Behind were a standardized test, Congress \nwould have earned a failing grade for each of the last 7 years because \nNo Child Left Behind expired in 2007. We have been unable to agree on \nhow to reauthorize it. As a result, the law's original requirements \nstayed in place and gradually became unworkable. As I mentioned \nearlier, this would have caused all of\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nAmerica's public schools--almost all of them--to be classified as \nfailing schools under the terms of the law.\n  The reason for that was the law set up as a goal that by 2014 all \nchildren would be proficient in reading and mathematics. That sounded \nlike a fair enough goal to have when you are looking at it from 2001. \nBut the closer we got to 2014--even by some of the lowest and easiest \ndefinitions of proficiencies established by States--it was clear that \nmost children and most schools wouldn't reach that goal. So President \nObama's Education Secretary offered waivers from the terms of the law, \nand today 42 States operate their public schools under the terms of \nthose waivers from the original provisions of No Child Left Behind.\n  But instead of just saying yes or no, here is a waiver, each of those \nwaivers contains some requirements. The Secretary really had the State \nover a barrel. He said: If you want a waiver from these unworkable \nprovisions, you are going to have to do a few things. One is to adopt \ncertain academic standards. That turned out to be, in most cases, \nCommon Core. One was to take prescribed steps to help failing schools. \nAnother was to evaluate teachers in a defined way.\n  There was so much new Federal control of local schools over the last \nseveral years that this has produced a backlash against Common Core \nacademic standards, a backlash against teacher evaluation, and against \ntests in general. Governors and chief State school officers complain \nabout Federal overreach. Infuriated teachers say the U.S. Department of \nEducation has become a national human resources department or, in \neffect, a national school board.\n  This doesn't just come from Republicans. This comes from Democratic \nchief State school officers who have come to my office and who have \ncome to Senator Murray's office and have said: Please give us more \nflexibility. We are with the children. We are in our States. We think \nwe know what to do.\n  They say it in different ways maybe if they are Republicans or \nDemocrats, but they all basically have said the same thing, which is \nwhy we have this consensus, at least so far on how to fix this \nlegislation, this law that everybody wants to fix.\n  So what is this remarkable consensus on how to fix the law? Here are \nnine things the bill does. No. 1, it strengthens State and local \ncontrol. The bill gives responsibility for creating what we call \naccountability systems to States. Now, ``accountability systems'' \nsimply means who is in charge of making sure the job gets done. Well, \nthat goes to States, working with school districts, with teachers and \nwith others to make sure all students are learning and preparing for \nsuccess. The accountability systems will be State designed. They will \nmeet minimum Federal parameters, including ensuring that all students \nand subgroups of students are included in the accountability system.\n  Disaggregating student achievement data--those are the tests I talked \nabout earlier. In establishing challenging academic standards for all \nstudents, the Federal Government is prohibited from determining or \napproving State standards. So if you are in Alaska, Tennessee or \nWashington, the Federal Government says if you want the Federal money, \nyou have to have challenging standards and you have to have a test of \nthose standards. But those are your standards, and those are your \ntests. You need to publicize them so the world can know how kids in \nschools are doing, but the Secretary in Washington is specifically \nprohibited by this proposal of ours from determining or approving those \nstandards.\n  No. 2, our legislation would end the Common Core mandate. The bill \naffirms that States may decide for themselves what academic standards \nthey will adopt without interference from Washington, DC.\n  I mentioned a little earlier how the $4.4 billion pot of money caused \nas many as 30 States to immediately say: Yes, we will adopt Common \nCore. Now, maybe they were going to do it anyway, and we can talk about \nthat more in just a minute, but that is what it did.\n  The Federal Government may not, under our proposal, mandate or \nincentivize States to adopt or maintain any particular set of \nstandards, including Common Core. States will be free to decide what \nacademic standards they will maintain in their States. If they want \nCommon Core, they can have Common Core. If they want half of Common \nCore, they can have half of it. If they want uncommon core, States can \nhave that. They simply have to have standards, and the Secretary is \nprohibited from telling them what those standards are.\n  No. 3, the bill would end the Secretary's waivers. The waiver \nprovision was a small part of the original bill in 2001. I doubt if \nthose who passed it ever expected it would be used the way it has been \nused by the current Secretary. The bill prohibits the Secretary, \nthough, from mandating additional requirements for States or school \ndistricts seeking waivers from Federal law.\n  In other words, if I come as Governor of Tennessee to the Secretary \nof Education and say: I would like to have a waiver. He can say yes or \nhe can say no, but he can't say: Well, you can get a waiver if you will \nevaluate teachers this way, adopt these standards, and fix these \nperforming schools in that way. That is up to the State. The bill \nlimits the Secretary's authority to disapprove a waiver request as \nwell.\n\n  No. 4, the bill maintains important information for parents, \nteachers, and communities. No issue has stirred as much controversy in \nour discussion as testing. No Child Left Behind required students to \ntake 17 standardized tests over the course of their kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade education, and it attached high stakes for schools, \nschool districts, and States to the results. As we studied the problem, \nas we listened to teachers and Governors and people of both political \nparties, it became obvious to us that it wasn't so much those 17 \nfederally required tests but the stakes attached to them.\n  A third grader, for example, is required to take only one test in \nmath and one test in reading. The testimony of the Denver school \nsuperintendent was that each of those tests takes about 2 hours. If you \ntake two tests in the third grade and two in the fourth grade--and \nthose are the tests that are publicized so people can tell whether the \nschool is succeeding or the child is succeeding or children are being \nleft behind--that is not very much time out of the school year. But the \naccountability system for what to do about the test results contributed \nto the exploding number of State and local tests. Many of them were \ngiven to prepare students for the high-stakes Federal tests.\n  Our proposal maintains the federally required two annual tests in \nreading and math in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school, as well \nas science tests given three times between grades 3 and 12.\n  These important measures of student achievement need to be reported \npublicly so parents can know how their child is performing. It is \nimportant the results be disaggregated so we know if any particular \ngroup of students is being ignored or left behind. It can also help \nteachers support students who are struggling to meet State standards.\n  We have included in our proposal before the Senate an amendment from \nSenator Collins and Senator Sanders for a pilot program which would \nallow States additional flexibility to experiment with innovative \nassessment systems--meaning tests--that might replace the kind of \nstandardize tests used today. It is important to point out that the \nFederal requirement isn't for a particular test. It simply says the \nState has to have one and the State has to publicize it in a special \nway.\n  No. 5, our proposal ends Federal test-based accountability. We \ndiscovered that the problem is the Federal Government's accountability \nsystem for what to do about the results of these tests, which has \ncontributed to the exploding number of State and local tests. Said \nanother way, it is the ``made in Washington'' decision about what a \nqualified teacher is, how to evaluate a teacher, and what is adequate \nyearly progress in a school. All of that is what seems to have caused \nthe exploding number of tests we have heard about so much.\n  To give an example, in testimony it was said to us that Fort Myers, \nFL, had 183 tests for children in the kindergarten through 12th grade \ncareer of a child. We know only 17 of those are Federal tests under No \nChild Left Behind. So where are the rest of the tests coming from? They \nare State and local\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\ntests. Once the spotlight was shown on Fort Myers, FL, and their 183 \ntests, it became clear it wasn't No Child Left Behind causing that--or \nat least it wasn't Federal tests but State and local tests that were \ncausing this. Then the number of tests quickly went down.\n  Because of this, our proposal ends the high-stakes Federal test-based \naccountability system of No Child Left Behind and restores the \naccountability system to State and local responsibility to hold schools \nand teachers accountable.\n  Teachers are in the assessment business. They said to us: Look, there \nare many different types of tests and assessments. We do this all the \ntime. We have pop quizzes, we have end-of-the-year tests, we have \nstandardized tests, we have multiple choice tests, and we have open-\nended questions. We need to be deciding what those assessments should \nbe, and we need to be deciding what weight each of those has in \ndeciding how this child is doing or how this school is doing or how \nthis group of children are doing. So they don't really object to having \na standardized test as one of the measurements. What they object to is \nhaving a single standardized test--set in Washington, DC--count for so \nmuch and to pretend that here we can make a decision about what may be \ngoing on in native schools in Alaska or the mountains of Tennessee or \nschools in Harlem.\n  States must include these standardized tests in their accountability \nsystem, but States will determine the weight of these tests. States \nwill also be required to include graduation rates, another measure of \nacademic success for elementary schools, English proficiency for \nEnglish learners, and one other State-determined measure of school \nsuccess or student support.\n  States may also include other measures of student and school \nperformance in their accountability systems in order to provide \nteachers, parents, and other stakeholders with a more accurate \ndetermination of school performance.\n  State accountability systems must meet limited Federal guidelines, \nincluding challenging academic standards for all students, but the \nFederal Government is prohibited in this proposal from determining or \napproving State standards. So whether a State adopts common core or any \nother academic standard is entirely the State's decision.\n  This transfer of responsibility for determining what to do about the \nresults of tests is why we believe our proposal will result in fewer \nand more appropriate testing for children.\n  There are three more things that our proposal does. No. 6, it \nstrengthens the charter school program. The bill provides grants to \nState entities and charter management organizations to start new \ncharter schools and to replicate or expand high-quality charter \nschools, including by developing facilities, preparing and hiring \nteachers, and providing transportation. It also provides incentives for \nStates to adopt stronger charter school authorizing practices, \nincreases charter school transparency so we can know what is going on, \nand improves community engagement in the operation of charter schools.\n  Charter schools are public schools. I remember in 1992, when I was \nEducation Secretary, the last thing I did was that I wrote a letter to \nall the school superintendents in the country in all the different \nschool districts--I guess there are 14,000 or 15,000--and asked them to \nconsider creating in their school district one of the new start-from-\nscratch schools that had been created in the State of Minnesota by the \nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor government. There were 10 of them, and they \ncalled them charter schools. Those were the first 10 charter schools.\n  There are 6,700 charter schools today. About 6 percent of all public \nschool students go to charter schools. Charter schools, in my view, are \nnothing more than public schools in which teachers have the freedom to \ngive children what those children need, and parents have the freedom to \nchoose the school that their child attends. I think any teacher would \nmuch prefer to have that sort of arrangement and that sort of freedom--\nfreedom from State regulations, freedom from Federal regulations, \nfreedom from some union rules--so they can provide for the children who \ncome to that school and who choose to go to that school the kind of \neducation those children deserve.\n  No. 7, our proposal would help States fix the lowest performing \nschools. The bill includes Federal grants to States and school \ndistricts to help improve low-performing schools identified by State \naccountability systems. School districts will be responsible for \ndesigning evidence-based interventions for low-performing schools with \ntechnical assistance from the States. The Federal Government is \nprohibited from mandating, prescribing or defining the specific steps \nschool districts and States must take to improve these schools.\n  Why would one do that? Let me give an example of what goes on today. \nUnder the waiver requirements, if you have a low-performing school, you \nhave to identify a certain number. That is prescribed by Washington. \nThen you have six ways you can fix the school. I insisted a couple of \nyears ago that we add a seventh. Showing my old Governor biases, I \nsaid: Let's allow a State to come up with a seventh way of improving a \nlow-performing school, and that would be whatever the Governor thinks \nwould be the best way to do it. That was adopted by the Congress. About \n12 months later, out came a regulation from the U.S. Department of \nEducation defining, limiting, and explaining what a Governor could do \nabout it.\n  The whole purpose of the exercise was to get rid of that sort of \ninstruction from here and to recognize that Governors themselves might \nfeel like their principal responsibility might be to improve a low-\nperforming schools. I always did when I was there. And I, with all \nrespect, didn't really need advice from Washington, DC, about how to do \nit.\n  No. 8, it helps States support teachers. The bill provides resources \nto States and school districts to implement activities to support \nteachers, principals, and other educators, including through high-\nquality induction programs for new teachers and ongoing rigorous \nprofessional development opportunities. The bill allows--but doesn't \nrequire--States to develop and implement teacher evaluation systems.\n  I know I am using some of my own experiences here, but that is how I \nhave learned. I believe that teacher evaluation is the holy grail of \npublic education. Parents are more important than teachers, but I have \nyet to figure out how to pass a better parents law.\n  Most of the evidence we know about shows that the single most \nimportant way to help a child succeed is to put that child in the \npresence of a really exceptional teacher. So in 1984, Tennessee became \nthe first State to pay teachers more for teaching well. That included a \n1\\1/2\\-year brawl with the National Education Association, which \nobjected to it.\n  President Reagan was President then. He came to Tennessee not to tell \nus to do it and not with any Federal dollars but just to say this is \nimportant to do and this is good to do. That helped me greatly in \npassing it in the legislature, which was Democratic at the time, and \nthis kind of leadership began the process across the country that has \nspread--the evaluation of teachers--to identify the better teachers, to \nencourage them, to reward them, and to try to keep them in the teaching \nprofession.\n  It was assumed when I came here that because I was so involved in \nteacher evaluation, I would want to come to Washington and say: OK, now \neverybody has to do what Tennessee did. But I have done just the \nreverse. The last thing we needed in Tennessee when we were trying to \ndo teacher evaluation in a fair way was Washington looking over our \nshoulder, making it more difficult and complicated.\n  Evaluating good teachers, particularly rewarding outstanding \nteaching, is not easy to do. It sounds simple, but it is hard. It needs \nsomething teachers can buy into that may be different in Alaska and \nTennessee and Washington, and it needs to respect what the \ncircumstances are in each place. The goal is to reward outstanding \nteachers and make teaching more professional and to recognize that \nexcellent teachers of math have great opportunities at IBM or some \nother company. I want to encourage that. This does that, but it doesn't \nmandate it from Washington.\n  No. 9, finally, this helps States improve the fragmentation of early \nchildhood programs. I suspect we will hear a\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nlot about this from Senator Murray because we heard a great deal about \nit in the committee from her. She is a preschool teacher. Her mother \nwas as well. I think one of the things Senator Murray learned as a \npreschool teacher was how to work well with others, which is what 5-\nyear-olds learn. She is a passionate advocate for early childhood \neducation--more than we have in this bill. But we have an important \nstep forward in this bill, in my opinion, that Senator Murray and \nSenator Isakson offered as an amendment. It was approved by the \ncommittee.\n  It will provide competitive planning grants to help States expand \nquality early childhood education by addressing the fragmentation of \nspending of Federal dollars currently through early childhood education \nprograms. We spend about $8 billion on Head Start. We spend about \nanother $6 billion or $7 billion on child development block grants. \nThat total amount of money is as much money as we spend in the entire \ntitle I program for kindergarten through the 12th grade. We spend \nanother $8 billion or $10 billion throughout different parts of the \nFederal Government for early childhood education. Then there is State \nfunding for early childhood education. Then there is local funding. \nThen there is private funding.\n  For example, the testimony from the superintendent of education from \nLouisiana was that, as much as more money, what would help create more \neducational opportunities for children ages 2, 3, and 4, is for States \nand local governments to be able to spend the money we are already \nspending more effectively. He said: There are too many silos. You can't \nuse the Head Start money in conjunction with this money or that money \nor in conjunction with this money. This proposal in our bill would be a \nstep toward helping States use Federal dollars more effectively in \nearly childhood education.\n\n  Finally, I said earlier that if fixing No Child Left Behind was a \nstandardized test, Congress would have earned a failing grade for the \nlast 7 years. In each of the last two Congresses, the Senate committee \nthat Senator Murray and I head produced bills to fix No Child Left \nBehind. But these bills divided our committee along party lines. Even \nso, two Congresses ago, Senator Enzi, Senator Kirk, and I voted with \nthe Democratic majority to report a bill out of committee so that the \nfull Senate could act.\n  In the last Congress, the committee majority passed a partisan bill \nwithout any Republican votes, but I committed to support Chairman \nHarkin in taking the bill to the floor if there would be an open \namendment process.\n  Unfortunately, these bills never reached the floor. We needed, \nobviously, to do something different, which is where Senator Murray's \nleadership became so important. She suggested the way that we \nproceeded, which allowed us to create a bridge across the partisan \ndivide so that we could recommend to the full committee a bipartisan \nsolution upon which they could build and upon which the full Senate \ncould build.\n  I accepted her suggestion, and I have repeatedly thanked her for it. \nShe and I have listened carefully to our Senate colleagues, to \nteachers, principals, Governors, chief State school officers, students \nand parents, and to the business and civil rights communities, and we \nhave listened to each other. I am grateful that the majority leader has \nput the bill on the floor and that the Democratic leader has allowed it \nto come to the floor expeditiously.\n  Senators with amendments will have a chance to have a vote on those \namendments. Already in our Senate education committee, we considered 58 \namendments, and we have adopted 29. We have had a fair and open \nprocess, which I believe is the main reason the committee vote was \nunanimous.\n  I would like to say this: Senator Murray and I have exercised \nrestraint. Neither of us has insisted on forcing into the bill every \nproposal about which we feel strongly. We know that to get a result we \nhave to achieve consensus. We know that in the Senate, ``consensus'' \nmeans at least 60 votes. We know that if we succeed here, we will have \nto deal with our friends in the House of Representatives. After that, \nif we want a result, which we do, we want the President's signature. We \nwant to fix No Child Left Behind--not just make a political statement.\n  The only major objection to this bill that I have heard is one from \nsome groups that believe the path to higher standards, the path to \nbetter teaching, and the path to real accountability is through \nWashington, DC, instead of State by State.\n  I would like to offer three reasons why I think this is wrong and why \nI believe our consensus to restore decisions to those closest to the \nchildren is right.\n  No. 1, States are better prepared today to set higher standards, to \nevaluate teachers, to develop good assessments, and to develop good \naccountability systems than they were when No Child Left Behind passed \nin 2001. President Bush and President Obama can take some credit for \nthat and should.\n  No. 2, the national school board--as I call it--which has been \ncreated over the last 10 years as we move more and more responsibility \nfrom States to Washington, DC, has created a backlash. It has made it \nharder to have higher standards. It has made it harder to evaluate \nteachers. It has showed conclusively that the better path to higher \nstandards, better teaching, and accountability is through the States \nand not through Washington.\n  No. 3, most Americans understand that you don't get wiser and more \ncaring simply by getting on a plane and flying to Washington. In fact, \nthe people closer to the children are usually better equipped to make \ndecisions about their well-being.\n  I have, principally because of age, a long view of this whole \nprocess. States are better prepared today than they used to be. I was \nGovernor when Terrel Bell, President Reagan's Education Secretary in \n1983, issued ``A Nation at Risk,'' saying that our schools were in such \na shape that if a foreign country had done that to our country, we \nwould have considered it an act of war.\n  I worked together with other Governors--the Governors who were \nelected adjacent to me, especially Governor Clinton, Governor Riley, \nand Governor Graham--and the National Governors Association. In 1985 \nand 1986, Governor Clinton and I caused all of the Governors to work on \nsomething we called ``Time for Results'' to begin to move State by \nState toward more achievement for our students. Then in 1989, President \nGeorge H. W. Bush called the Governors together to a summit and set \nnational education goals.\n  That never happened before in our country. It may sound like an easy \nthing to do, to say let's have goals of all children being proficient \nin math, science, English, history, and geography. But just to pick \nthose subjects was a controversial topic. Just to spend that time on it \nwas a great step forward.\n  Then ``America 2000'' in 1991 and 1992, when I was Education \nSecretary, was the way to reach the goals. That is where we began to \nsee this debate again. Is the best way to do it State by State, \ncommunity by community or is the best way to do it through Washington, \nDC? President George H. W. Bush believed the best way to do it was \nState by State, community by community. He advocated voluntary national \nstandards, but they were voluntary. He advocated voluntary national \ntests, but they were voluntary. He advocated accountability systems, \nbut they were voluntary as well. He advocated more choices for parents \nof low-income children and an expansion of charter schools.\n  What the Governors have done since that time is worked together State \nby State to create our standards, better tests, and better \naccountability systems. The Governors have also agreed that States \nwould take the so-called NAEP test, the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, which is a sample test. Not all students take it. \nBut it keeps the Governor of Tennessee from setting a low standard, \nwhich we once did so we looked good when we achieved that standard. Now \nwe can know whether Alaska and Tennessee are really comparable because \nthat test is public and we take it.\n  The second point I made about this was about the backlash. It may \nseem counterintuitive to say that it is harder to create higher \nstandards because of the Common Core debate, but you would understand \nit pretty well if you ran for the Senate in a Republican primary or \neven in a general election,\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nwhich I did last year. Common Core was an issue both in the primary and \nin the general election. What I said was this: Wait a minute; I think \nWashington should stay entirely out of it. But people were so upset \nwith Common Core, not really so much because of what is in it but \nbecause Washington was requiring it or at least it seemed to them that \nit was Washington taking over local schools.\n  The truth of the matter was that Common Core began with Bill Bennett, \na former Education Secretary and a leading conservative, when he was \nhead of the National Endowment for the Humanities here in Washington, \nDC. He sponsored research by E.D. Hirsch in Virginia, who wanted to put \nmore rigor in academic curriculum.\n  When the first President Bush called the Governors together and said \nwe want to set these high goals and Governors begin to talk about what \nthe standards for the proposed goals are, Governors began to work \ntogether on something called Achieve. There were some who said: Let's \nhave Washington do it.\n\n  But the Governor said: No, you stay out of it; we will do it \ntogether.\n  It was out of this that the Common Core academic standards came \ntogether. It was basically a bunch of conservative Governors working \ntogether to add rigor to the system. But what spoiled it was that \nWashington's involvement in it in the 1990s created this enormous \nbacklash and now Governors are backpedaling. At a time when, for \nexample, in our State we have advanced manufacturing coming in and \nworkers need to know a lot in order to get a job, we are arguing about \nwhether to have high standards because of the backlash against Common \nCore. We need to get Washington out of the Common Core debate and let \nTennessee and every other State make their own decisions about what \ntheir academic standards should be. Then, if you don't like what your \nchild is learning, you can go talk to your Governor or your legislature \nand they have 100 percent of the authority to decide whether that is \ngood or whether that is bad.\n  Then there is teacher evaluation. As I said, I spent a lot of time on \nthat in the 1980s and since. It is hard to do. It is hard enough to do \nwithout adding a new element, and the new element is the highly \nprescriptive method that is defined from Washington about how to do a \nteacher evaluation. That produced a backlash.\n  Teachers unions are up in arms. When they are up in arms, that makes \nit harder to put in a teacher evaluation system. If you believe, as I \ndo, that high standards and teacher evaluation are the underpinnings of \na great education system and are the way that you help children learn \nwhat they need to know and are able to do, you do not want to create a \nbacklash to those efforts by insisting on prescriptive definitions from \nWashington, DC.\n  Finally, it is a strange idea, as I mentioned earlier as well, to \nsuggest that those of us who fly from Knoxville to Washington--or \nSenator Murray flies a long way each week and goes all the way to the \nWest Coast and back, but almost all of us go home almost every \nweekend--get that much smarter and that much wiser on the plane flying \nhere. I may get a little less smart and a little less wise on the plane \nflight here. It doesn't help me to know any more about what is going on \nin the Tennessee mountains or the native areas of Alaska or in eastern \nWashington State by being here in Washington, DC.\n  We spend 4 percent of the Nation's education dollars through this \nbill we are debating today. I think we have a right to ask: How are \nthese children doing? Take a test, report the results, and let us see \nif children are being left behind. But we shouldn't presume then to \nsay: Here then is what you ought to do about it. We are going to decide \nwho is succeeding, who is failing, what the right way to fix that is. \nWe can't do that with 50 million children, 100,000 schools, and 3.5 \nmillion teachers. All those are better done by men and women who are \ncloser to the children.\n  One of the most eloquent statements of what I just said came from \nCarol Burris, New York's 2013 High School Principal of the Year. She \nwrote us after we began work on our proposal and put it online and this \nis what she said:\n\n       Remember that the American public school system was built \n     on the belief that local communities cherish their children \n     and have the right and responsibility, within sensible \n     limits, to determine how they are schooled.\n       While the federal government has a very special role in \n     ensuring that our students do not experience discrimination \n     based on who they are or what their disability might be, \n     Congress is not a National School Board.\n\n  That is the principal of the year in New York State saying that.\n  She went on to say:\n\n       Although our locally elected school boards may not be \n     perfect, they represent one of the purest forms of democracy \n     that we have. Bad ideas in the small do damage in the small \n     and are easily corrected. Bad ideas at the federal level \n     result in massive failure and are far harder to fix.\n\n  That is advice from the New York Principal of the Year. In other \nwords, our well-intentioned guidance from Washington is usually not as \neffective as a decision made in the home, classroom, and community by \nthose closest to the children.\n  What we heard over and over from Democrats as well as Republicans was \nthat while continuing measurements of academic progress are important \nin holding schools and teachers accountable, we should respect the \njudgments of those closest to the children and leave to them most \ndecisions about how to help 3.4 million teachers help 50 million \nchildren in 100,000 public schools.\n  A little humility on our part is an important part of the recipe for \na successful fix of No Child Left Behind. I look forward to this \ndebate. I particularly look forward to fixing this law that everybody \nseems to agree has to be fixed, and that most people seem to agree on \nhow to fix it.\n  If Senators were in a classroom, none of us would expect to receive a \npassing grade for unfinished work. Seven years is long enough to \ncontinue fixing No Child Left Behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Booker, follow my remarks on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since our Nation's founding, the idea of \na strong public education for every child has been a part of the fabric \nof America because when all students have the chance to learn, we \nstrengthen our future workforce, our country grows stronger, and we \nempower the next generation of Americans to lead the world. A good \neducation can provide a ticket to the middle class, so improving \neducation is an important part of what it means to grow our economy \nfrom the middle out, not from the top down.\n  Today marks the first day of debate on our bipartisan bill to \nstrengthen our education system by reauthorizing the Nation's K-12 \neducation law, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA. \nThis work is a chance to recommit ourselves to the promise of a quality \neducation. For every child, it is an opportunity to finally fix the \ncurrent law, No Child Left Behind.\n  I have been very proud to partner with the senior Senator from \nTennessee throughout this process, and I commend Chairman Alexander for \nworking with me to create this bipartisan bill and for passing the \nEvery Child Achieves Act through the education committee with unanimous \nsupport.\n  I think it is important at the onset to discuss why we need to fix \nthe current law. I also would like to lay out what we accomplished in \nthe Every Child Achieves Act and go through how I think we can best \nstrengthen this bill and pass it through the Senate with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I wish to acknowledge my committee members as well. This bill is \nbetter thanks to their hard work and commitment to their priorities and \ntheir communities.\n  Nearly everyone agrees that No Child Left Behind is badly broken. For \none, the current law required States to set standards for schools but \nthen didn't give the schools the resources they needed to meet those \nstandards. Second, across the country we are still seeing inequality in \neducation, where some schools simply don't offer the same opportunities \nas others, and some\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nschools still have very large achievement gaps.\n  I have seen firsthand how this law is not working for my home State \nof Washington. No Child Left Behind has become so unworkable that the \nObama administration began issuing waivers to exempt States from the \nlaw's requirements. Washington State had received a waiver but lost it \nlast year, and now most of the schools in my State are categorized as \nfailing.\n  A few months back, I stood here on the Senate floor and told the \nstory of a mom from Shoreline, WA. Her name is Lillian. Last year her \nson was going into the fourth grade in the same school district where I \nonce served as a school board member. Lillian's son had a learning \ndisability. With the help of teachers and specialists at his elementary \nschool, he showed great signs of progress. But then Lillian got a \nletter in the mail 2 weeks before school started, and that letter \ndescribed her son's school as failing. That left her worried about the \nkind of education her son was getting, and she said it gave her a wave \nof uncertainty over the coming school year.\n  I have traveled around Washington State over the past decade and I \nhave heard from a lot of my constituents, from teachers in the \nclassrooms, to moms at the grocery stores, to tech company CEOs. They \nall have the same message: We need to fix the No Child Left Behind law. \nI was very glad that earlier this year we got to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to find common ground to do just that, and I remain convinced \nthat the only way to advance a bill to fix this broken law is with a \nbipartisan approach. Students, teachers, and parents are counting on us \nto do this, and now it is time to take the next step as we debate the \nEvery Child Achieves Act here on the Senate floor.\n  This bill is a strong step in the right direction to finally fixing \nNo Child Left Behind and making sure all of our students have access to \na high-quality public education. It addresses the high-stakes testing. \nI have heard from parent after parent, teacher after teacher in \nWashington State that students are taking too many tests. The current \nlaw overemphasized test scores to measure how students are doing in \nschool. Our bill will give flexibility to States to use multiple \nmeasures--not just a single test score--to determine how well a school \nis performing. The bill will create a pilot program for States to \ndesign new assessments, and that will provide our States with a lot of \nflexibility for innovation. Those steps will reduce the pressure on our \nstudents, our teachers, and our parents so they can focus less on test \nprep and more on learning.\n  The bill eliminates the one-size-fits-all provisions of No Child Left \nBehind that have been so damaging to our schools districts. Instead, \nthe bill allows our communities, parents, and teachers to work together \nto improve schools and to ensure that every child receives a well-\nrounded education.\n  The bill maintains Federal protections to help students graduate from \nhigh school college- and career-ready. The bill also requires States to \nidentify schools that do need improvement.\n  When the education committee debated the bill, I was also proud, as \nthe Senator from Tennessee mentioned, to work on a bipartisan amendment \nwith Senator Isakson to expand and improve early learning programs. As \na former preschool teacher, I have seen the kind of transformation \nearly learning can inspire in a child, so I am proud that this bill \nwill help us expand access to high-quality early childhood education so \nmore of our kids can start kindergarten ready to learn.\n  There are a few key ways that I want to continue to improve this \nbill. First of all, I believe we should strengthen the accountability \nrequirements in the bill. Too many schools have failed too many of our \nchildren for too many years. When we don't hold the schools and States \naccountable for educating every child, it is the kids from our low-\nincome backgrounds, kids with disabilities, kids who are learning \nEnglish, and kids of color who too often do fall through the cracks. \nBefore No Child Left Behind, it was easy for schools to overlook the \nperformance of these vulnerable groups of students. Before 2002, as \nlong as the school's overall performance was OK, it didn't matter if \nstudents of color or students from low-income backgrounds struggled to \nmake progress year after year. The overall average of all students \nallowed achievement gaps to be swept under the rug even as some \nstudents fell further and further behind. We cannot go back to those \ndays, and we can't backtrack on holding our schools accountable for \nhelping all of our students learn.\n  States should still be required to identify the schools that are \nstruggling the most so they can get the help and resources they need to \nimprove. States need to identify the schools where some groups of \nstudents aren't making enough progress. These schools should get the \nsupport and locally designed interventions they need to better serve \ntheir students. Let's remember that holding States accountable for all \nstudents will only work if schools get the resources they need to \npromote students' success.\n  Unfortunately, some schools simply don't provide the same educational \nopportunities as others. Oftentimes students of color don't even have \nthe option to take an AP course or use up-to-date technology in the \nclassroom. African-American and Latino students are significantly less \nlikely to attend a high school that offers advanced math or art \nclasses, and, on average, kids from low-income neighborhoods don't have \naccess to qualified and experienced teachers like students from \nwealthier neighborhoods often do. A ZIP Code should never determine a \nstudent's academic success. We need to make sure all students have \nequitable resources.\n  In the 1800s, Horace Mann, who is often called the father of American \neducation, worked to make it universal and free for all. He famously \nsaid: ``Education . . . is the great equalizer.'' I believe that is \ntrue but only if we continue to hold ourselves accountable for \nproviding educational opportunities to all students. The Every Child \nAchieves Act takes some very important steps to do that. As we debate \nthis bill, I hope we can build on the progress and continue to move in \nthe right direction.\n  I do believe there are important ways we should be able to work \ntogether to improve the bill, but there are other ideas out there that \nmay derail any chance of passing this bill and fixing No Child Left \nBehind. I know some of my Republican colleagues are interested in \nmaking title I funding ``portable.'' That name sounds innocuous enough, \nbut that proposal would allow funds to be taken away from schools that \nneed the help the most, and it would defy the original purpose of our \nFederal K-12 education law. ESEA was meant to help level the playing \nfield for students growing up in poverty. Efforts to backtrack on our \ncountry's commitment to target funds to the highest needs schools and \ninstead give funding away to our more affluent schools is a nonstarter.\n  Others are interested in voucherizing the public school system. That \nwould undermine the basic goals of public education by allowing funding \ndesignated for the most average students to flow out of the public \nschool system and into mostly unaccountable private schools. Vouchers \nare unacceptable to me and would jeopardize our bipartisan work.\n  I am looking forward to our debate to make this bill even better. \nHalf a century ago President Lyndon Johnson directed Congress to \nimprove education for our Nation's students. In January of 1965, in \nwhat would be just months before signing the original ESEA into law, \nPresident Johnson said that when it comes to education, ``nothing \nmatters more to the future of our country,'' and that remains true \ntoday. The future of our country hinges on our students' ability to one \nday lead the world, and a high-quality education for every student is \none of the best investments our country can make to ensure we have \nbroad-based and long-term economic growth.\n  Finishing this process we are working on today and getting a bill \nsigned into law isn't going to be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. \nBut students, parents, teachers, and communities across our country, \nincluding in my home State of Washington, are looking to us here in \nCongress to fix this broken law. We cannot let them down.\n  We need to work across the aisle to help our students and our schools \nand our teachers get some much needed relief from No Child Left Behind. \nWe need to give our States flexibility while strengthening \naccountability and\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nresource equity. We need to work together to reaffirm our Nation's \ncommitment to ensuring that all students have access to a quality \neducation regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much \nmoney their parents make. By doing so, we will help our Nation grow \nstronger for generations to come.\n  I again thank the Senator from Tennessee for his tremendous \nleadership in getting us to this point and for working with us to make \nsure we get this bill to the President and signed into law so that we \ncan all go home and say we fixed a badly broken law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I rise \ntoday with the understanding that I have been a Senator for just a \nshort while--about 19 months--and with the knowledge that I stand in a \nbody full of champions for our Nation's kids. I am proud of the \nconversations I have had on both sides of the political aisle and see \nthe earnestness and hard work to ensure that America is a place where \nall children can thrive.\n  I wish to give a special thanks to Senators Alexander and Murray, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee. They have \nworked tirelessly in an effort to expand educational opportunities for \nchildren, and I have no doubt that they have already made lasting \ncontributions to the lives of our children. In addition to that, they \nhave taken a flawed legislative reality in No Child Left Behind and \nhave already made significant strides in improving it. It should be \napplauded. They have done good work. In a nation that has been overcome \nwith test craziness, they lowered those ridiculous bars and barriers \nthat are being put up at the local level to achieving high education.\n  I am proud to see a bipartisan consensus forming to correct the ills \nof No Child Left Behind which have been foisted upon school districts \nall over our country and which have made the quest for educational \nexcellence more difficult, not easier or more empowering.\n  I say all of that, but I must also say that I am here because there \nis an enormous amount of work still to do. This body must confront the \ndark places in our country where the ideals of the American educational \nsystem and where the dream of this country of equal access to \nopportunity is being failed. We have work to do. There is a moral \nurgency in this country, and that is what I am worried about today.\n  It is deeply disconcerting to me that I cannot stand in the well of \nthe Senate before you today and say that a child born in any ZIP Code \nin America will have access to a quality education and an equal shot in \nthis Nation at learning the skills they need to make the most out of \ntheir lives, to contribute to our country, and to live their American \ndream.\n  It is troubling that I cannot stand here in the well of this \nauspicious body and say that we are leading our peers around the globe \nwhen it comes to the number of our kids--percentage of the population--\nwho graduate from high school ready to succeed as part of the global \neconomy.\n  It is shameful and ignominious that I cannot stand here today and say \nthat we are doing everything we can to ensure that all of our students \ncan succeed and that we are holding those schools that are performing \nthe worst in our Nation--those schools that often deal with the poorest \nof our country, the most marginalized of our country--that we are doing \neverything we can to serve them.\n  There should be standards to which we hold ourselves accountable. For \nthis Senator, it is this America where children are still struggling \nfor the basic foundations of our ideals that concerns me.\n  It was back in 1967 at Stanford University--my alma mater--that \nMartin Luther King stood and gave a speech about the other America. \nSadly, we are a nation that still reflects these words from decades \nago. He talked about a great America where children have quality \nschools, quality housing, and opportunities to succeed. That is the \nmajority of our Nation. It makes us all proud and honored to serve this \ncountry that is an example to the globe of what is possible in a \nvibrant and strong democracy. But in that speech, Martin Luther King \nalso talks about the other America. It is in this America, he said, \nthat people are poor by the millions. ``They find themselves perishing \non a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material \nprosperity,'' King said.\n  He said:\n\n       In a sense, the greatest tragedy of this other America is \n     what it does to little children. Little children in this \n     other America are forced to grow up with clouds of \n     inferiority forming every day in their little mental skies. \n     And as we look at this other America, we see it as an arena \n     of blasted hopes and shattered dreams.\n\n  He details this other America by saying that ``many people of various \nbackgrounds live in this other America. Some are Mexican-Americans, \nsome are Puerto Ricans, some are Indians.'' Millions of them are White. \n``But probably the largest group in this other America in proportion to \nits size in the population is the American Negro.''\n  We are moving now on education legislation, but let's tell the truth \nof what is happening in this other America--that there is still a dark \nunderside where lack of achievement and lack of opportunity in this \nother America must be addressed.\n  I have visited schools all over New Jersey. We are a State that is \nthe envy of America in the quality of our schools. We have reached \nheights of educational attainment, and New Jersey youngsters go to \ngreat, prestigious universities all over our State and our country. I \nam proud that we are one of the greatest education States in America. \nBut I also know that even New Jersey has some schools--particularly in \nvulnerable places of high poverty--that fail to serve the genius of our \nchildren.\n  I have also had the privilege to travel our Nation, having been \ninvited to speak in cities from coast to coast, and, like New Jersey, I \nsee signs of hope and signs of promise. I see kids going to schools in \nthe toughest neighborhoods, but those schools are more than schools-\nthey are cathedrals of learning that serve their genius. Yet I am still \ntold by parents from New Jersey and in our Nation, who look me in the \neye and know their schools are failing their kids--they don't need \nreports from any government body to let them know their kids are not \ngetting the education they deserve and to know the even more painful \ntruth that their children, should they not get the education they \ndeserve, will have options for themselves that are lost and constricted \nin this greatly global economy we have.\n  I worry that if we put legislation forward which does not keep those \nchildren in the center of our hearts and our minds, the consequences of \ndashing those dreams are great for our Nation.\n  When I was a child, I heard this poem by Langston Hughes:\n\n     What happens to a dream deferred?\n     Does it dry up\n     like a raisin in the sun?\n     Or fester like a sore--\n     And then run?\n     Does it stink like rotten meat?\n     Or crust and sugar over--\n     like a syrupy sweet?\n     Maybe it just sags\n     like a heavy load.\n     Or does it explode?\n\n  In our country, people who are in environments with schools that fail \nthe genius of our kids witness the disastrous manifestation of that \nfailure on a daily basis. We now know that in America, a young Black \nboy who does not graduate from high school has a 70 percent chance, \nwithout that diploma, of ending up in jail by his midthirties. We now \nknow that in our prisons in this Nation, 67 percent of inmates are high \nschool dropouts. We know that the national average spent for a student \nin our country is $12,643. Yet, somehow we allow funds to drain from \nthe National treasure that are the kids in our schools, by spending \nalmost $29,000, on average, to keep one person behind bars in federal \nprison.\n  If we deny poor children a quality education, there will be \ndisastrous consequences. We now know that in our Nation, if you are \nborn in poverty, you have a 9-percent chance of going to college. I \nwill repeat that. If you are born in poverty, you have a 9-percent \nchance of going to college and graduating. This is unacceptable.\n  We cannot design legislation in this body that does not stand up to \nthis reality. Indeed, the legislation we are\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\npassing now has its roots in its initial focus on the disadvantaged.\n  Fifty years ago this past April, President Lyndon B. Johnson sat in \nfront of what once was a one-room schoolhouse in Texas, next to a woman \nnamed Kate Deadrich Loney, and signed into law the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. It had a purpose to it. It had a mission.\n  Sitting next to his former teacher and in front of his former school, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the law and said that this law \n``represents a major commitment of the federal government to quality \nand equality in the schooling that we offer our young people. By \npassing this bill, we bridge the gap between helplessness and hope for \nmore than five million educationally deprived children.''\n  That is not all he mentioned, but he specifically focused on those \ndisadvantaged children--those 5 million in our Nation--who were not \ngetting access to the American ideal, the American dream. Their dream \nwas to be deferred or stolen or denied.\n  Today in America, 6 percent of high schools fail to graduate one-\nthird of their students. We must do better by them. It is this issue in \nour country that we have to recognize.\n  As stated in President Johnson's words, the Federal Government's role \nin education has been that of a bridge between helplessness and hope, \none that identifies the needs of the underserved and the most \nvulnerable students and the schools that are not serving them. Since \n1965, the Federal Government has done a good job of playing a critical \nrole in advancing equality and greater educational opportunity so that \nmore children are included. The creation of Pell grants, title IX, and \nthe first Education for All Handicapped Children Act are great strides \nour Nation has taken in being that bridge from helplessness to hope.\n  The reauthorization of the critical legislation that first \nestablished that ``bridge'' has taken different forms over the past 50 \nyears. In certain instances, as in the case of No Child Left Behind, it \ntook a step too far. That is why this Senator praises Senator Alexander \nand Senator Murray for beginning to correct the inadequacies and \ndeficiencies and harm that bill has done.\n  When it comes to reauthorization of the ESEA, we cannot allow for an \noverly prescriptive No Child Left Behind bill. We cannot afford to go \nback to that era. We must change. However, we cannot allow the pendulum \nto swing so far that we abdicate our responsibility to make sure every \nstudent--to make sure the students in that other America are being \nserved by a quality school.\n  It is not overly prescriptive to ask schools that are failing to \ngraduate a large share of their students to do something differently. \nIt is not overly prescriptive to ask schools--these 6 percent of our \nschools that are dropout factories in our Nation--to make changes to \nhonor the children, their beauty, their dignity, and their potential. \nAnd it is certainly not asking too much that we who are putting \nhundreds of millions of dollars from the Federal Government into a \nsystem--that there is some accountability for these dropout factors.\n  This body should be a steward of taxpayer dollars. Congress has a \nrole when it comes to the investments we make in housing, when it comes \nto the investments we make in infrastructure, and when it comes to \ndefense dollars, to make sure these dollars are serving the purpose to \nwhich they are extended--to make sure these investments produce returns \nfor taxpayers. Today, the Federal Government and this body still have \nthat critical role to play when it comes to making sure all American \nchildren have access to a quality education.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. Too many of our children are still \nstuck in failing schools--schools that are so bad that they put \nthousands of children into that world where they do not have a chance \nat a college education or even getting a high school degree. The \nstudents succeeding in our country's quality schools will have the \nopportunity to become the next generation of teachers, mayors, police, \nfirefighters, doctors, and Senators. They will lead the globe. This is \nwhat I am proud of as an American. The students in our country's \nfailing schools deserve to have that same opportunity.\n  I know this from traveling our country and traveling our State: that \nprodigy isn't bounded by geography and that genius is equally \ndistributed in our country. Talent is as concentrated in one ZIP Code \nas it is in another. There are as many geniuses in Camden as there are \nin Princeton. The next Einstein or Gates or Hemingway is as likely to \nbe growing up in Newark as they are in the Upper East Side of \nManhattan. I have seen schools flourish in poor neighborhoods. I have \nseen great schools meet incredible challenges and succeed in educating \nour kids. We know it is possible, and we should expect better than we \nare seeing now.\n  Our moral test is whether we will be able to attain success \neverywhere it might be found, whether we will be able to nurture the \ngenius in all of our kids. We owe it to every child in America to \nensure that every door is open for them to demand better. We need to \ndemand better for our kids. We need to keep them front and center as we \nconsider this bill on the floor.\n\n  I want to conclude by saying that we cannot succeed as a nation, in \nan increasingly global competitive environment, if we leave genius on \nthe sidelines. Our educational determination to help those children is \nnot simply about them, it is about us. It is about whether we will get \nthe full bounty of the strength and potential of our Nation or if we \nwill cast many aside into those dark places, into that other America.\n  We cannot now be damned by the self-defeating stakes of low \nexpectations for ourselves and all of our children. Kids who languish \nin this other America because of a lack of compassion and support and \ninvestment cannot afford to have less accountability for their success.\n  I know as we debate this bill there will be resistance to the idea \nthat those failing most, those stuck in dropout factories, those in the \nother America don't deserve levels of accountability. But I know that \nif we focus on those children, to keep them at the center of our \nthoughts, as was done by President Johnson when this bill originated, I \nknow we can be the America we want to be, a nation that when our \nchildren put their hands on their hearts and say those words, ``liberty \nand justice for all,'' that they are real, indeed, for all children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2089\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I call up the Alexander-Murray \nsubstitute amendment No. 2089.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2089.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n           Work in the Senate and Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last week I had a chance to travel the \nState of Texas. Of course, the Presiding Officer can imagine, I had a \nchance to move around the State to listen to what people were saying \nand, frankly, to tell them what it is we have done on their behalf in \nthe Senate so far this year. By and large, I heard that folks are happy \nto see the Senate back to work, under new management, and getting \nthings done that they elected us to do.\n  I spent a good amount of time out in West Texas and in the panhandle \nand had a chance to speak to a number of farmers and ranchers in that \npart of the State. They are, frankly, very pleased to hear that they \nwill soon have access to new markets in Asia now that the trade \npromotion authority bill has been passed and is the law of the land, \nand we are currently in the final stages of negotiating the Trans-\nPacific Partnership.\n  The trade promotion authority, of course, passed last month and was\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nsigned by the President, and it represents a true bipartisan \naccomplishment between Congress and the President. While it is true \nthat I disagree with the President more often than I agree with him, in \nthis case we can both agree that opening new markets for our farmers, \nranchers, and our small business people is good for our States and good \nfor the country.\n  Getting Texas beef, cattle, cotton, and other goods to new markets \ntranslates into better jobs, better wages, and a better economic \nclimate for hard-working Texans. But of course passing the trade \npromotion authority legislation is just one example of what this \nChamber has accomplished so far this year. Under new leadership, the \nSenate has made tremendous progress from what this Senate used to be. \nWe have seen the return to regular order, functioning as a deliberate \nbody that considers a wide range of legislation to benefit the everyday \nlives of the American people.\n  I think pointing out that we voted on more than 130 amendments, \ncompared to just the 15 that were voted on last year, is a great \nindicator that this Chamber is actually back working the way it should. \nThe good news is, whether you are in the majority or the minority, \neveryone is getting a chance to participate in this process, and \nregular voting on amendments brought by any of our Members is now \ntypical and not the exception to the rule.\n  I mention we passed the trade legislation, but overall the Senate has \npassed more than 40 bipartisan bills. We have seen 22 of those already \nsigned into law by President Obama. So the American people let their \nvoices be heard last November 4. They sent us here to do their work. \nThis week, we will take up another important piece of legislation. We \nwill take up an education bill that will ultimately give school \ndistricts in Texas and across the country more flexibility and more \npower to make the best choices for their students.\n  I know the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee--the committee of jurisdiction in education matters, has \nworked hard under the leadership of Chairman Alexander and Ranking \nMember Murray. They brought this bill to the floor with a unanimous \nvote in the committee. So I and others look forward to an open \namendment process and a vigorous debate over our Nation's education \npriorities and the important role the States play and local control \nplays in making sure all students have access to educational \nopportunities.\n  Later this week, we will likely have a chance to reconcile the \nlanguage between the House and the Senate version of the Defense \nauthorization bill, a bill that will help equip our Armed Forces with \nthe resources and give them the authorities they need to keep our \ncountry safe. Of course, the Senate will also continue discussions on \nhow to responsibly address the challenges facing the highway trust fund \nand find a way forward for our transportation networks.\n  I remain optimistic that this Chamber can ultimately take up \nappropriations bills that are needed to fund our troops on the \nbattlefield and care for our veterans upon their return. Last month, \nour Democratic friends laid out a strategy, something they called the \nfilibuster summer, saying unless they get 100 percent of what they \nwant, that they are not going to allow the Senate to proceed to \nconsider these appropriations bills.\n  Well, I would like to just remind them there is a lot of work we have \nto do that needs to be done, and if we could just get back in the \nspirit of this bipartisan cooperation, everybody can let their voice be \nheard and their vote will count, but pure partisanship will not get the \njob done. The many Texans I spoke to back home want this spirit of \ndiligent, focused work to continue. They certainly want to see us \nprovide the resources to our troops that they need to carry out their \nmission. So while we have a strong track record so far in the 114th \nCongress, we still have a lot of work to do. I hope my friends across \nthe aisle will continue to work with us on behalf of the people who \nsent us here.\n  Separately, I know my colleagues and I are anxiously awaiting the \nnews of the final outcome of Secretary Kerry's ongoing negotiations \nregarding Iran and its nuclear aspirations. As we all know, earlier \nthis year, Congress passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which \nguarantees that Congress, on behalf of the American people, will have \ntime to study, scrutinize, debate, and then ultimately vote on whether \nwe approve or disapprove of the negotiated deal between Secretary Kerry \nand the administration and Tehran.\n  If the President reaches a deal with Iran by Thursday, then Congress \nwill have up to 30 days to review it and then to vote on whether to \napprove it. As I have said all along, I have grave concerns about how \nthe President has been negotiating with one of our foremost \nadversaries, a country that constantly threatens the American people \nand our allies and has done nothing to garner our trust or respect.\n  The broad outlines of the deal--of the potential deal--we have seen \nreported in the press don't look particularly promising. It seems to \nget actually worse by the day. So I strongly encourage the President \nand Secretary Kerry to remember that if you want a deal badly enough, \nthat is exactly what you are going to get is a bad deal. So ``any deal \nat any cost'' is not the mantra of the American people who are \nunderstandably very wary of any agreement with Iran.\n  But, fortunately, the Senate has proved we will not stand by and \nwatch the President as he makes far-reaching agreements without the \nconsent of the American people through their elected representatives. \nSo I look forward to working with my colleagues to give very careful \nscrutiny, certainly the sort of scrutiny this proposed deal deserves, \nto make sure our country's best interests are protected. If this deal \ndoes not protect our national security and the security of the region \nand our allies, Congress may have no other choice than to vote it down \nby passing a resolution of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment I have filed to the Every Child Achieves Act that will be \nbrought up, I believe, later today. In the spirit of my friend the \nSenator from Texas I am glad he has joined me on this amendment. I know \nas we get into this terribly important education bill, I want to \ncommend Senator Alexander, Senator Murray for their leadership in \nbringing it to the floor and trying to wrestle through the right \nbalance of between Federal, State, and local partnerships in education. \nI look forward to being a part of that debate.\n  While we will spend hours on the floor of the Senate debating issues \naround accountability and assessment, terribly important issues, there \nis one issue I believe all of us in this body can agree upon, to make \ncertain we ensure that all dollars that are spent on education are \nspent appropriately and in an efficient way and that most of those \ndollars end up in the classroom.\n  This was a conversation I started when I was Governor of Virginia. \nWhen I looked around at the Commonwealth of Virginia, where we spend \nclose to $9 billion a year on public education, I realized that many of \nthe same debates we are having in the Chamber we were having in \nVirginia at that time. But again, one area where there was complete \nagreement was to make sure those dollars spent on education were spent \nefficiently.\n  Too often school divisions, quite honestly, didn't know how to spend \nusing best practices in terms of bus routes, energy usage, back-office \nstaffing. How do you make sure you can take best practices around--I \nmentioned this was being done in Virginia, from around the State--and \nmake sure those dollars were better spent, more efficiently, in the \nclassroom.\n  Well, we looked around the country and we actually found a program in \nTexas--again, why I am so grateful my friend the Senator from Texas, \nMr. Cornyn, has joined me on this amendment. We put in place a program \nto bring better accountability to our school divisions.\n  As I mentioned, too many school divisions don't have the ability to \nassess whether they are spending operational funds in the smartest way. \nMy amendment helps school districts figure out how to be thoughtful \nabout their operations budget, which again allows them to put more \nmoney back into their\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nclassrooms. I mentioned this was an initiative I started as Governor \nback in 2003 in Virginia.\n  I mentioned as well that Virginia was spending a combined $9 billion \nin local, State, and Federal support for public schools. I felt it was \nvery important we make sure that as much of those resources were spent \nin classroom instruction and not in back-office administrative \nfunctions. So, in Virginia, we asked our Department of Planning and \nBudget to design a school efficiency review program. Our public school \ndivisions actually volunteered--a local school superintendent actually \nvolunteered to work with the State Department of Education. It took \nsome level of trust, but they volunteered to undergo a review of their \nnoninstructional functions, things like human resources, purchasing, \nfacilities, transportation, and food service.\n  So we launched this program, and over a decade reviews have been \nconducted in 41 localities around the Commonwealth, in rural, suburban, \nand urban districts. Over the course of the history of this program, \nVirginia's program has identified $45 million in annual potential \nsavings. In Virginia, each review cost an average of about $110,000 and \nproduced an average annual savings of $1.1 million, a return in \ninvestment of nearly 9-to-1, a return that allowed these dollars to be \nmore valuably spent on instruction.\n\n  These reviews recommend commonsense steps: software programs to \nimprove bus transportation routes, enterprise-wide facilities \nmanagement, best practices in purchasing and personnel, and smart, \nresponsible steps to conserve limited resources and direct those \nsavings into the classroom.\n  As I mentioned, we initially borrowed this concept from Texas. Since \nthat time, additional States, including Oklahoma, Minnesota, New York, \nKansas, and Arizona, have implemented similar programs.\n  This commonsense best practice should be available to school \ndistricts nationwide. That is why I am proud, along with Senator \nCornyn, to offer an amendment that will allow States to use their title \nIX consolidated administrative funds to pay for fiscal support teams. \nThis proposal will empower localities with the information they need to \nbetter allocate limited resources so they get a maximum impact in the \nclassroom. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport it. I believe this amendment will be brought up later by either \nSenator Murray or Senator Alexander, and I look forward to its \nconsideration tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 1709 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements of Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today as the Senate begins its \nconsideration of the Every Child Achieves Act under the leadership of \nChairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray--two great leaders who \nhave done a great job on this bill. The HELP Committee, under their \nleadership, has produced a truly bipartisan effort to find solutions to \nthe seemingly intractable problems facing our educational system. I \ncommend our distinguished chairman and ranking member for their \nleadership and their commitment to prioritizing concrete results over \npartisan grandstanding.\n  While the nature of compromise means that this bill may not be \nperfect in each Senator's eyes, it represents an opportunity for \nmeaningful reform for America's schools, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its swift passage.\n  Ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education is a \ntop priority shared by all Republicans and Democrats alike. In 2001, I \njoined 86 of my colleagues in supporting No Child Left Behind to \naddress the shortcomings of our educational system. Despite the best of \nintentions, No Child Left Behind fell short of true success. Its \ntesting requirements hamper learning by compelling students to take \ntest after test to satisfy the law's various requirements. Its focus on \nmetrics incentivizes schools to report higher graduation rates even if \nthat means pushing out failing students unprepared for the working \nworld. Because of these and other unintended consequences, of course, \nthe current law is in desperate need of reform.\n  With the Every Child Achieves Act, Congress now has an opportunity to \ncorrect the shortcomings of No Child Left Behind. Instead of setting \nartificial and unattainable requirements, the new legislation allows \nStates to set their own standards for success. It defers to local \nleaders to formulate goals that are realistic and effective for their \ndistricts. It puts parents and teachers in the driver's seat, not \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  For years, States have sought relief from burdensome Federal mandates \nin education, and many States find themselves in untenable positions \nthanks to Federal law. For example, my home State of Utah has struggled \nin the past few years with an impossible decision--either ask for a \ncontinuation of Department of Education waiver mandates or fall back on \nunattainable No Child Left Behind requirements and risk losing crucial \nFederal funding all together.\n  Under this new bill, States will continue to develop their own \nstandards and will establish their own accountability systems linked to \nthese standards. States will also be able to say what they want their \naccountability systems to measure and will be able to determine how \nwell their students are doing based on a variety of important metrics. \nMaintaining the Federal requirement for statewide annual testing is \nnecessary to ensure transparency on school performance and to set a bar \nby which States can measure themselves in a comparable fashion.\n  My colleagues and I were able to make significant improvements to \nthis legislation through the committee and the committee's process. I \nwas especially pleased to see two amendments I care deeply about \nadopted by voice vote during the committee markup: the Innovative \nTechnology Expands Children's Horizons--or I-TECH--Program and the \nEducation Innovation and Research Program.\n  Senator Baldwin and I worked closely to develop I-TECH to ensure that \ntechnology in the classroom is coupled with teacher support to give \nstudents access to a wide range of personalized learning opportunities. \nBy intertwining technology and traditional teaching methods, we can \ntailor each student's educational journey to his or her individual \nneeds and learning style to boost achievement.\n  With the Education Innovation and Research Program, Senator Bennet \nand I created a flexible funding stream that would allow schools, \ndistricts, nonprofits, and small businesses to develop proposals based \non the specific needs of students and the community. Funding for that \nprogram will be awarded based on an initial evidence-based proposal, \nwith continued funding tied to demonstrated successful outcomes flowing \nfrom the project. It is time we start looking at new ways of investing \nin education, much like we do in other realms. Money should not be tied \nto what the U.S. Senate or the Federal Department of Education thinks \nis a good prescriptive idea. It should be tied to local innovation and \nclear outcomes.\n\n  Senator Bennet and I have expounded on that idea by pushing for Pay \nfor Success Initiatives in the underlying bill, as well as in the \namendment process on the floor. Pay for Success allows the government \nto pay only for programs that actually achieve meaningful results. I \nhave offered an amendment to allow funding from the early childhood \nprogram to be used in this manner.\n  My home State of Utah has the first-ever Pay for Success Program \ndesigned to expand access to early childhood\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\neducation for at-risk children. The Utah High Quality Preschool Program \ndelivers a high-impact, targeted curriculum that increases school \nreadiness and academic performance among 3- and 4-year-olds. As \nchildren enter kindergarten better prepared, fewer students will need \nto use special education and remedial services in kindergarten through \n12th grade, allowing schools and States to save money. We should build \non this success and empower other States to do the same.\n  In addition to these cost-saving programs, technology will also \nimprove the quality of education in our country, but advancements in \ntechnology must come side-by-side with a conversation on how best to \nprotect our children's privacy. Education technology is a multibillion \ndollar industry, and it is important to balance the needs for \ninnovation and expansion in schools with reasonable privacy safeguards.\n  To that end, I joined with the senior Senator from Massachusetts in \nfiling an amendment to this legislation to create a structured \ncommission to study important aspects of the convoluted world of \nstudent privacy. The primary law governing this realm--the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act--was last updated in 2001. Since \nCongress last acted in this area, there have been significant changes \nin the way student information is stored and how outside parties use \nthat information. These changes have led to the introduction of \nnumerous proposals to update this outdated law.\n  The amendment Senator Markey and I have introduced strengthens \nstudent privacy by requiring a commission to report to Congress on the \ncurrent mechanisms for transparency, parental involvement, research \nusage, and third-party vendor usage of student information. The \nCommission will also be tasked with providing suggestions for \nimprovement. This process will allow privacy experts, parents, school \nleaders, and the technology industry to provide us with a clear \nconsensus on how best to protect personal data while not hampering \ndevelopment in schools or access to the important data we garner from \naggregated student information.\n  In addition to protecting student privacy, I have introduced another \namendment crucial to ensuring success in all schools nationwide. The \nEvery Child Achieves Act asks States to identify low-performing schools \nand to allow localities to intervene in these schools. One of the \ngreatest tools Congress could give localities in this process would be \nthe power to renegotiate contracts and to reallocate money and policies \nin more effective ways. Under my amendment, many failing schools would \nbe permitted to ask relief from contracts from vendors and unions, \namong others. These schools would also be able to renegotiate the terms \nof these contracts.\n  Currently, school funding is trapped in a cobweb of unwieldy and \ncomplicated vendor contracts and collective bargaining agreements. Old, \nautomatically renewing contracts with janitorial services, \ntransportation vendors, teachers unions, and testing companies \nrepresent massive locked-in expenditures. Education leaders need \nflexibility to enable failing schools to get a fresh start--the same \nopportunity available to successful charter and private schools. Right \nnow, local leaders' budgets and staffing decisions are largely shaped \nby forces beyond their control. My amendment will encourage more \ncommonsense change from the Federal level to empower localities to act \nin the best interest of the students they serve.\n  The bill we are now considering will make significant improvements to \nthe quality of education in this country and the ability of our \nstudents to compete in a global economy once they enter the workforce. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support these efforts, and I again \nexpress my congratulations and my support to the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member on this committee, Senator Alexander and Senator \nMurray, who have done a really good job in the best interests of \nchildren all over this society.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nremarks and his contribution to the committee's legislation. He is a \nformer chairman of the Senate's education committee--we call it the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--and his contributions \nin this legislation on early childhood education and other matters are \nawfully important, and I thank him for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, let me just state that this legislation \nbefore us is of vital national importance, and I would like to commend \nChairman Alexander and Senator Murray for their commitment to an open \nand inclusive debate. They and their staffs have been unfailingly \nresponsive, helpful, and thoughtful throughout the process. I was a \nlong-standing member of the education committee, having served on the \nEducation and Labor Committee in the other body, and on the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee for 14 years in this body. And \nI have had the privilege of working with my colleagues over the last \ntwo reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  So, again, I must commend Senators Alexander and Murray for the \nextraordinary work they have done and also my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse, who has been a major contributor to this effort. I am \nhopeful and confident, because of the leadership of Senators Alexander \nand Murray, that we will reach a strong bipartisan outcome on this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with the committee \non issues that are very important. The fair and equitable access to the \ncore resources for learning, access to effective school library \nprograms, professional development for teachers and principals, family \nengagement, and environmental education are all topics I think are \ncritical, and I am very appreciative my colleagues also thought they \nwere important and gave them very thorough and very fair consideration.\n  I am convinced, if you provide the resources, if you support teachers \nand principals and you engage families, students will thrive. This \nlegislation reflects that perspective, and I appreciate that very much.\n  Our challenges and our responsibilities are to create and support \nlearning environments that enable young people to hone their talents, \ndiscover their skills, and pursue their passions. In some respects, \neducation is about finding a child's talent--letting them find their \ntalent. If you do that, then stand back, they will do wonderful things \nfor themselves, their communities, and this Nation.\n  In fact, our Nation is very much dependent upon education to achieve \nour noblest ideals. As we create educational opportunities for all, we \nfulfill the basic aspiration of this country. While we know we still \nhave work to do, I am very pleased at the work that has been done so \nfar by the committee.\n  We are closing the gaps in high school graduation between minority \nand other students--majority students--but college education gaps are \nwidening, and that is something that must be addressed. The debate we \nbegin today is vital because the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nis not just about elementary schools and high schools, it is about \npreparing young people for what comes next--for college, postsecondary \neducation, for careers, and for contributions to their communities. We \nhave to start at the beginning to get it right in the middle and in the \nend. Again, Senators Alexander and Murray have brought this \nperspective, this bipartisan approach, and I commend them for it.\n  This bill is an improvement over current law. The Every Child \nAchieves Act maintains the critical transparency and high expectations \nfor all students that were the hallmarks of the No Child Left Behind \nAct. It does so while updating the parts of the law that have become \nunworkable and counterproductive, such as the overly prescriptive \napproach to school improvement and corrective action.\n  I am pleased the Every Child Achieves Act continues Federal support \nin key areas for building strong and successful schools, including \ninvestments in literacy and school library programs, for professional \ndevelopment to strengthen educator effectiveness, and family engagement \nin education. From the beginning, access\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nto effective school library programs was a critical part of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. The results from a recent \nNational Center for Education Statistics survey shows there are still \ngaps in access to school libraries.\n  Effective school library programs are essential supports for \neducational success. Multiple education and literacy studies have \nproduced clear evidence that school libraries staffed by qualified \nlibrarians have a positive impact on student achievement.\n  Now, Senator Cochran and I introduced the Strengthening Kids' \nInterest in Learning and Libraries--SKILLS--Act to ensure that school \nlibraries continue to be a part of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. The Every Child Achieves Act recognizes this need by \nincluding an authorization to provide funds to high-need school \ndistricts to support effective school library programs.\n  Soon we will be voting on an amendment that Senator Cochran and I are \noffering to further integrate school library programs into the core \nElementary and Secondary Education Act formula grant programs. I \nencourage all our colleagues to vote yes on this bipartisan amendment \nthat will support student learning.\n  I am also pleased that the Every Child Achieves Act recognizes the \nimportance of ensuring that disadvantaged children have access to books \nin their homes from a very early age. Literacy skills are the \nfoundation for success in school and in life. Developing and building \nthese skills begins at home, with parents as the first teachers.\n  Senator Grassley and I introduced the Prescribe A Book Act to help \naddress this issue, and the Every Child Achieves Act includes some key \nprovisions from this legislation.\n  We also know teachers and principals are two of the most important \nin-school factors related to school achievement. It is essential that \nteachers, principals, and other educators have a comprehensive system \nthat supports their professional growth and development starting on day \none and continuing throughout their careers.\n  Senator Casey and I introduced the Better Education Support and \nTraining Act to create such a system. Once again, I am extraordinarily \npleased that the Every Child Achieves Act includes many of the \nprovisions of that legislation, particularly the focus on equitable \naccess to experienced and effective educators.\n  I remain concerned, however, that the failure to define an \n``inexperienced teacher'' will mask inequities and will limit the \nusefulness of the reporting for parents and communities. I hope we can \nclarify this issue as we proceed forward.\n  Family engagement is another critical area this bill addresses. I \nhope we will be able to strengthen these provisions by increasing the \nresources that school districts dedicate to meaningful, evidence-based \nfamily engagement activities and by providing a statewide system of \ntechnical assistance that supports these efforts.\n  I have been working with Senators Coons and Bennet on amendments that \nmake these additions to the bill based on the Family Engagement and \nEducation Act that I introduced with Senators Coons and Whitehouse in \nthe past two Congresses.\n  Most fundamental to the question of whether we move closer to \nachieving our ideals for educational equity and excellence is \nresources. The grand bargain of the No Child Left Behind Act was \ngreater accountability coupled with greater resources. We have fallen \nshort on accountability for resources. The authorized level for title I \nfor fiscal year 2007 was $25 billion. That is in the No Child Left \nBehind Act. Today, we are nowhere near that level--at only $14.4 \nbillion.\n  We need to be just as concerned about opportunity gaps as we are \nabout achievement gaps, and that is why the first bill I introduced \nthis Congress was the Core Opportunity Resources for Equity and \nExcellence--CORE--Act to establish an accountability mechanism for \nresource equity. We must look to hold our educational system \naccountable for both results and for resources.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act includes some of what I proposed in the \nCORE Act by bringing some long-overdue transparency to resource equity, \nrequiring States to report on key measures of school quality beyond \nstudent achievement on statewide assessments, including student access \nto experienced and effective educators, access to rigorous and advanced \ncourse work, availability of career and technical educational \nopportunities, and safe and healthy school learning environments.\n  However, transparency alone is not enough. I am pleased to be working \nwith Senators Kirk, Baldwin, and Brown on the opportunity dashboard of \ncore resources amendment, which will add further provisions from the \nCORE Act; namely, some accountability for action on disparities in \naccess to critical educational resources.\n  With more than one in five school-aged children living in families in \npoverty and roughly half of our public school students eligible for \nfree or reduced-price lunches, we cannot afford nor should we tolerate \na public education system that fails to provide resources and \nopportunities for the children who need them the most.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray for bringing \nthis bill before us so thoughtfully, so carefully, and with so much \neffort and expertise, and their staffs also. I hope we can work \ntogether on this amendment to improve an already excellent bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I simply wish to acknowledge the \ncontributions of the Senator from Rhode Island. He may not officially \nbe on the committee, but he stays actively interested in all of the \neducation issues. He has made important contributions to the pending \nlegislation in support of libraries, and we are working with him on a \nnumber of matters, including risk sharing and higher education. So I \nthank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership and his \ncontinued interest in better schools and better colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n       Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on S. 474, the \nProtecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act.\n  This is a bipartisan bill that Senator Joe Manchin and I introduced \nsome time ago. We have been working on this for a while now, and we \nintend to offer this legislation as an amendment to the pending \nlegislation, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  This is a commonsense bill, designed simply to protect children from \nchild molesters and predators--predators who infiltrate our schools \nbecause they know that is where the kids are.\n  The vast overwhelming majority of school employees, we all know, are \npeople who care very much about kids. It would never occur to them in a \nmillion years to do anything to harm the children in their care. But \nthe fact is there are pedophiles in our society--there are predators in \nour society--and they do in fact look to find opportunities where they \nwill find their prey. So we need protections against these people as \nthey try to infiltrate our schools. These are protections I have been \nfighting for, for some time now, and I am not going to stop until we \nget this done.\n  There are lots of reasons to have this fight. For me, as for so many \npeople, it is personal. I have three young children. They are 15, 13, \nand 5 years old. When I send my kids to school in the morning and watch \nmy children get on the schoolbus, I have every right to know I am \nsending my children somewhere where they can be safe, where they can be \ncared for, where they can be in the safest possible environment, and \nevery other parent deserves that too--every parent across Pennsylvania, \nevery parent across America.\n  Unfortunately, too many children and too many families have \ndiscovered this is not always the case. The horrific story which \nbrought my attention to this cause and my passion for this was the \nstory about a little boy named Jeremy Bell.\n  The story begins in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. One of the \nschoolteachers was molesting boys. He was a serial pedophile. He raped \na boy. The school officials discovered what was going on. They brought \nit to the attention of law enforcement, but law enforcement authorities \nnever had\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nenough strong evidence to make a successful criminal case. The school \ndecided they would dismiss the teacher for sexually abusing students. \nBut, appallingly, the school also helped this teacher get a new job in \nWest Virginia, where he became a teacher, in part because he got a \nletter of recommendation from the school that knew he was preying on \ntheir students. But they wanted him to be someone else's problem, so \nthey gave him a letter of recommendation.\n  He went to a new school in a nearby State. Eventually, he became a \nprincipal. Along the way, of course, he continued his ways, culminating \nin the rape and murder of a 12-year-old boy named Jeremy Bell. Justice \ndid finally catch up with that monster. He is now in jail serving a \nlife sentence for the murder of Jeremy Bell, but for Jeremy Bell that \njustice came too late.\n  We would like to think this is a bizarre and isolated event that \ncould never happen again. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Last \nyear alone, there were 459 school employees arrested across America for \nsexual misconduct with the children they are supposed to be taking care \nof--459--and those were the ones where there was enough of a case that \nthe arrest was actually made. It is more than one per day. Twenty-six \nof them were in my State of Pennsylvania.\n  Sadly, we are halfway through 2015 now, and we are doing even worse. \nIn the first half of 2015, there have been 265 such arrests. We are on \npace to have well over 500 school employees across America arrested for \nsexual misconduct with the children they are supposed to be taking care \nof.\n  Every single one of these stories has a terrible tragedy at the \ncenter: a little girl whose sexual abuse began at age 10 and only ended \nwhen at 17 years old she found herself pregnant with the teacher's \nchild, a teacher's aide who raped a young, mentally disabled boy in his \ncare, a kindergarten teacher who kept a child in during recess, then \nforced her to perform sexual acts on him.\n  This is hard stuff to talk about, but that doesn't make it go away. I \nthink we need to confront it, and the cases are too many to ignore.\n  Senator Manchin and I decided it is time for Congress to act, to do \nsomething to make it more difficult for these predators to carry out \nthese appalling acts, so we introduced the Protecting Students Act. It \nhas two important goals, two protections, designed to prevent convicted \nsex offenders from infiltrating our country's schools. The first is a \nstandard background check process that will catch those who have been \nconvicted. The second feature in our legislation would end this \nterrible practice we saw in the Jeremy Bell case--the practice of a \nschool knowingly helping a child molester find employment in a new \nschool, a practice called passing the trash.\n  Now, both of these provisions, both of these ideas have very broad \nbipartisan support. The House of Representatives unanimously passed a \nbill including both protections last Congress, and just last fall \nCongress voted 523 to 1--both Houses combined voted unanimously, with \nonly one dissenting voice--for even more expansive background check \nlanguage enacted in the Child Care Development Block Grant that we all \nvoted for, 523 to 1.\n  In addition, Senator Manchin's and my legislation, the Protecting \nStudents Act, has been endorsed by numerous organizations in various \ncategories.\n  First, child protection groups: National Children's Alliance, which \noversees the Nation's Children's Advocacy Centers, the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against \nRape, the Children's Defense Fund, the Pennsylvania Partnerships for \nChildren. Law enforcement organizations overwhelmingly support our \nlegislation: the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association. Prosecutors support \nSenator Manchin's and my bill. The Association of Prosecuting Attorneys \nand the National District Attorneys Association have both endorsed the \nbill. The medical professionals at the American Academy of Pediatrics \nand the Pennsylvania School Board Association, they all have endorsed \nthis legislation, and they have said it has two essential features, two \nways in which we would be protecting our kids.\n  The first is the criminal background check. Let me be clear. Every \nState in the Union performs some kind of background check already. That \nis true. That is a fact. The problem is that many of them are woefully \ninadequate. For instance, several States fail to check all the school \nworkers. They check teachers, for instance, but not nonteachers, and \nothers will check certain criminal databases, but they won't check \nothers, and so they miss convictions.\n  Our legislation, Protecting Students Act, requires that if a school \nwants to accept Federal funds, it has to perform background checks on \nall adult workers who have unsupervised access to children. That would \nbe both new hires and existing employees.\n  Many States have only recently adopted background check policies. \nMany employees were hired before they put the background check policies \nin place, so many of these employees were never subject to a background \ncheck.\n  Consider the case of 64-year-old William Vahey, who taught for \ndecades across America and across the globe at some of the world's most \nelite schools. He would give his young students Oreo cookies laced with \nnarcotics. While the boys slept, the teacher molested them and \nphotographed them. Scores of children were sexually abused. This \nteacher had been convicted for sexual abuse of children in California \nwhen he was in his twenties, but he was hired before many States had \nbackground check requirements, and therefore he was grandfathered into \nthe system. The Protecting Students Act ensures that convicted sex \noffenders like William Vahey will be discovered and they will not be \nhired.\n  It also would include contractors. There are 12 States that don't \nrequire background checks for contractors at all. This fact recently \ngave Montana parents a rude awakening.\n  An audit of Montana's busdrivers found that 123 drivers had criminal \nhistories, including 1 driver whose conviction landed him on the Sexual \nand Violent Offender Registry and 1 with an outstanding arrest warrant.\n  Running checks is really only helpful if the checks are thorough \nenough to find all convictions. So our legislation would require the \nfour major databases to be checked: the FBI fingerprint check in the \nNational Crime Information Center database, the National Sex Offender \nRegistry, the State criminal registry, and State child abuse and \nneglect registries. These background check requirements constitute the \nfirst part of our bill. As I said, this was passed unanimously in the \nHouse. I wouldn't think this would be controversial.\n  The second part of our bill is equally important, and that is the \npart which precludes passing the trash. It addresses the terrible acts \nthat led to and made it possible for little Jeremy Bell to be raped and \nmurdered. What this provision says is that if a school wishes to \nreceive Federal funds, the school may not knowingly help a child \nmolester obtain a new teaching job. I would think this would not be \ncontroversial. The practice, as I alluded to before, has become so \ncommon, sadly, that it has its own moniker. It is called passing the \ntrash. It has become all too prevalent.\n\n  I see that the Senator from Tennessee would like to address the body.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I will.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the purpose of allowing me consent to take up \nseveral amendments, including Senator Toomey's amendment, which he has \nworked on so hard for a long period of time and he and I have \ndiscussed? This will take about 60 seconds, if he permits this. Senator \nMurray is here.\n  I thank the Senator for his indulgence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be offered by \nthe two bill managers or their designees in the following order: \nFischer, No. 2079; Peters, No. 2095; Rounds, No. 2078; Reed, No. 2085; \nand Warner, No. 2086.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2079 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On behalf of Senator Fischer, I call up amendment No. \n2079 and ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number.\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am claiming my time. I want to thank \nSenator Alexander for the sincere effort we have been engaged in for \nsome time to find our common ground on this. I appreciate his \nconstructive efforts. I know they are continuing, and I hope we will be \nable to reach an agreement on this. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n       Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\n\n  I was talking about the second part of our legislation. The first \npart is requiring background check standards that would actually work. \nThe second part is a provision that would forbid this terrible practice \nknown as passing the trash. When we hear the idea that a school, a \nprincipal, a superintendent or a school district would knowingly and \nwillfully recommend for hire a known predator, it strikes us as so \nmorally repulsive that we think this couldn't really seriously happen \nexcept in the most bizarre and unusual circumstances. I wish that were \nthe case. It is not the case. The fact is it happens.\n  Let me give you an example. In February, WUSA News 9 reported some \nreally shocking news on the public school system of Montgomery County, \nMaryland. Since 2011, 21 Montgomery County public school workers have \nbeen investigated for child sexual abuse or exploitation. The news \nstation learned that the Montgomery County school system ``keeps a \n`confidential database' of personnel who demonstrate `inappropriate or \nsuspicious behavior' toward children--a watch list of suspected abusers \nwho are working in area schools.''\n  WUSA 9 learned that the school system has a record of passing the \ntrash. For example, elementary school teacher Daniel Picca abused \nchildren for 17 years. The school system knew. What did they do? The \nteacher was punished. You know what his punishment was? It was to \nassign him to another school again and again--17 years of passing a \nknown child molester from one elementary school to another.\n  This is appalling. This has to stop. It has to stop now. The Federal \nGovernment can play a role in stopping it. Frankly, only the Federal \nGovernment can play a role because sometimes the passing the trash \noccurs across State lines, as in the case of Jeremy Bell.\n  Or, for example, more recently, a Las Vegas, NV, kindergarten teacher \nwas arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her with a \nsexually transmitted disease. That same teacher had molested six \nchildren, all fourth and fifth graders, several years before while \nworking as a teacher in Los Angeles, CA. The Los Angeles school \ndistrict knew about these allegations. In fact, in 2009 the school \ndistrict recommended settling a lawsuit--a suit that alleged that the \nteacher had molested the children. The school district wanted to \nsettle.\n  When this teacher came across the State lines to Nevada to work, the \nNevada school district specifically asked if there had been any \ncriminal concerns regarding the teacher. The Los Angeles school direct \nnot only hid the truth, not only hid what they knew about this \nmolester, but it provided three references for the teacher.\n  For those folks who suggest that States can solve this problem on \ntheir own, I have a question: What in the world can Nevada do about the \nbehavior that is occurring in California? Since when can the laws of \none State reach into and be enforced in another State?\n  I know the answer. It can't. It doesn't work. The only way to deal \nwith this cross-border abuse, this horrendous abuse of kids, is with \nFederal legislation.\n  The Toomey-Manchin bill that we are going to be offering as an \namendment to this underlying legislation has a simple proposition: If a \nschool district wants to take Federal tax dollars, it can't use that \nmoney to hire convicted sexual offenders of kids.\n  Is that really unreasonable? Is that really too much to ask? To \naccomplish that, the school district has to perform a criminal \nbackground check on those workers who have unsupervised access to \nchildren. The school district must prevent passing the trash. That has \nto be illegal. It has to be illegal to knowingly and willfully \nrecommend for hire a pedophile who is molesting children. There is no \none who can stand here and tell me these protections against child \nsexual predators are not urgently needed--not when more than one person \nis being arrested every day across America for committing sexual crimes \nagainst children and the rate at which these people are being arrested \nis accelerating.\n  What is more urgent than that? The Protecting Students Act has \noverwhelming bipartisan support. As I said earlier, the House passed \nthis legislation unanimously last Congress--unanimously. How many \nthings can pass the House unanimously? This did. The entire Congress, \nthe House and Senate together, adopted that virtually identical \nbackground check requirements be imposed for kids at daycares, younger \nchildren, by a vote of 523 to 1.\n  We have already vetted this. We have already been down this road. \nThis body and the House have expressed their support for this. I would \nremind my colleagues that the Protecting Students Act has been endorsed \nby many, many groups. I rattled off several of them: Child protection \ngroups, law enforcement groups, prosecutors, the medical professionals \nat the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Pennsylvania School \nBoard Association. The Toomey-Manchin proposal is the only proposal \nthat is endorsed by these groups.\n  We know there are going to be alternatives. There are going to be \nside-by-sides. Those alternatives do not have the endorsements of these \norganizations, for reasons that we may need to elaborate on later.\n  Finally, there are 459 arrests--more than one a day. Every single one \nof those represents a tragedy--a childhood that has been shattered, a \nfamily that has been torn by grief, by self-blame, by betrayal. The \nnumbers aren't staying the same. The numbers are growing. The problem \nis getting worse.\n  How many more arrests do we need before the Senate decides that it is \ntime that we do our part to protect these kids? Children of America \nhave waited long enough, and I say no more waiting--no more passing \nchild molesters into new schools so they can find new victims, no more \ndefenseless children such as Jeremy Bell falling victim to a known \nchild predator, no more excuses for not enacting a bill that the House \nof Representatives has passed unanimously over a year ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting Students from Sexual \nand Violent Predators Act and to vote aye when I offer it as an \namendment this week.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2094 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Madam President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment in order to \ncall up amendment No. 2094.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2094 to amendment No. 2089.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Kara Farnandez Stoll\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, we are finally, finally going to \nvote on the nomination of Kara Farnandez Stoll to serve as a judge on \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. She is \nsuperbly qualified, and once confirmed, she will be the first woman of \ncolor to serve on the Federal Circuit.\n  She has the strong endorsement of the non-partisan Hispanic National \nBar Association as well as from the Federal Circuit Bar Association, \nand the American Intellectual Property Law Association. In its letter \nof support to the Judiciary Committee, the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, HNBA, wrote that their due diligence has confirmed that \nMs. Farnandez Stoll ``maintains the highest ethical and professional \nstandards. She is also competent and hardworking. Her litigation \nexperience, commitment to public service, and temperament make her an \nideal candidate for a court appointment.'' I could not agree more. So \nwhy did it take so long for the Republican leadership to schedule a \nconfirmation vote for this uncontroversial, highly qualified, and \nhistoric nominee?\n  The President nominated Ms. Farnandez Stoll last year--nearly 8 \nmonths ago. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported her \nnomination to the full Senate more than 2 months ago. There is no good \nreason why her confirmation vote has been stalled over and over again.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority's treatment of Ms. Farnandez \nStoll's nomination is more pattern than aberration. Six months into \nthis new Republican-led Congress that was supposed to move forward on \nthings and the Senate has only confirmed a handful of judges. In fact, \nit has been more than 6 weeks since a vote was even scheduled by the \nmajority leader for a single judicial nominee. This glacial pace of \nconfirmations is a dereliction of the Senate's constitutional duty to \nprovide advice and consent on judicial nominees. Many are concerned \nthat such treatment threatens the functioning of our independent \njudiciary.\n  We have 11 other consensus judicial nominations pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar in addition to Ms. Farnandez Stoll. No one can \ncredibly claim that the majority's slow pace in scheduling confirmation \nvotes is due to a lack of nominees. This group includes another nominee \nwho has received the strong support of the HNBA--Armando Bonilla--one \nof five pending nominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, CFC. Like \nMs. Farnandez Stoll, Mr. Bonilla's confirmation will be an historic \nmilestone--when confirmed he will be the first Hispanic judge to hold a \nseat on the CFC.\n  In less than 48 hours, the Judiciary Committee is expected to report \nout another HNBA-endorsed nominee, Luis Felipe Restrepo, who will fill \na judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit. Judge Restrepo was unanimously confirmed 2 years ago by the \nSenate to serve as a district court judge in Pennsylvania. I have heard \nno objection to his nomination, yet it took 7 months just to get him a \nhearing. Once confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic \njudge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second \nHispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit.\n  If Senate Republicans had an issue with any of the pending nominees \nor if they sought time to debate them on the floor, some of the delay \nmight be understandable. But no Senator has spoken in opposition to any \nof the pending nominees. In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreported all 11 of them by voice vote. Instead of receiving timely \nconsideration of their nominations, however, these uncontroversial \nnominees have not been treated fairly by the Senate majority.\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\n  There is a different way to lead. In the last 2 years of George W. \nBush's term, Democrats came into the majority. Some thought we would \nslow up his judges. We did not. I served as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee during those last 2 years of President George W. Bush's \nadministration and we confirmed 68 district and circuit court judges \nduring that time. In fact, by this time in the seventh year of the Bush \nadministration, the Democratically controlled Senate had confirmed 21 \njudges--including 18 district and 3 circuit court judges. Compare that \nto this seventh year of the Obama administration under Republican \ncontrol, in which the Senate has thus far confirmed just four district \ncourt judges this year. Just four. Now this is outrageous. It hurts. It \npoliticizes the Federal bench. It hurts the rules of law in this \ncountry.\n  So under a Democratic majority with a Republican President, we \nconfirmed five times more judges than the Senate Republican majority \nhas allowed under their control of the Senate for a Democratic \nPresident. The disparity of treatment is clear, and it is wrong. \nIncidentally, that is the same way we did it when Democrats took over \ncontrol of the Senate during the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nterm. We moved judges at a much faster pace than anything Republicans \nhave allowed us to do under President Obama. This is wrong. This is \npetty partisanship that hurts our independent judiciary. We are not \nasking for anything special but we are saying it would be nice if \nRepublicans treated Democrats the same way we treated them.\n  We should also not forget the rising number of judicial vacancies in \nour Federal courts. At the start of this Congress, there were 44 \nvacancies, including 12 vacancies deemed ``judicial emergencies'' by \nthe nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. That number \nhas climbed to 63 vacancies, including 27 ``judicial emergency'' \nvacancies on our district and circuit courts. The vast majority of \nthese vacancies are concentrated in States with at least one Republican \nhome State Senator. Of particularly concern are four circuit court \n``judicial emergency'' vacancies: two in Texas, one in Alabama, and one \nin Kentucky. Each vacancy has been left open for well over a year, \nincluding one in Texas that has remained vacant for almost 3 years.\n  All Senators know that it is our constitutional duty to provide \nadvice and consent on judicial nominees. When it comes to filling \nvacancies on the Federal courts in our State, we have unique insight \ninto our States' legal communities to share with the President before \nhe makes a nomination. Americans expect us to do our jobs and in the \nSenate that includes ensuring their access to the Federal courts. I \nurge all Senators to work with the President to fill the growing number \nof judicial vacancies in their States.\n  We will at least make some small progress today as we finally take up \nMs. Farnandez Stoll's nomination. Her extensive experience on issues \nthat come before the Federal Circuit will serve the court well. She is \ncurrently a partner at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett and \nDunner, a law firm specializing in intellectual property law. Ms. \nFarnandez Stoll also teaches as an adjunct professor at George Mason \nUniversity Law School. Before practicing law, Ms. Farnandez Stoll was a \npatent examiner in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Ms. Farnandez \nStoll received her B.S. in electrical engineering from Michigan State \nUniversity in 1991 and her J.D. from Georgetown University Law School \nin 1997. Upon graduating from law school, she served as a law clerk to \nFederal Circuit Judge Alvin Schall. I trust that her background and the \nreputation she has earned in the legal community will serve her well as \nshe begins this new chapter.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  S4678, July 7, 2015, in the middle column, the following \nlanguage appears: . . . law, Ms. Fernandez Stoll wa . . .\n  \n  Record has been corrected to read: . . . law, Ms. Farnandez \nStoll was . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I congratulate Ms. Farnandez Stoll on what I expect will be her \nsuccessful, albeit long overdue, confirmation.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1177, which the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1177) to reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 to ensure that every child \n     achieves.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if I could gain the attention of the \nDemocratic leader for just a moment, before he leaves the floor. In a \nfew moments, the Senator from Washington and I will make our opening \nstatements on our proposed committee legislation to fix No Child Left \nBehind, but before we do that, I want to first express my appreciation \nto the majority leader for his putting it on the floor, bringing it up. \nI know the majority leader has a variety of other options, and he is \ngiving us a chance to take our bill, which we will be describing in a \nfew minutes, and put it on the floor.\n  I also want to acknowledge and thank the Democratic leader because he \nhas allowed the bill to come to the floor without delay so that we can \nmove to the bill and allow Senators to begin to vote on it. We hope to \nbegin having those votes tomorrow morning.\n  We have a good example of cooperation here with the majority leader \nbringing the bill to the floor, a unanimous bill by the committee. \nSenator Murray, a member of the Democratic leadership, played a major \nrole in the legislation. In fact, it was her advice that I took which \ncaused us I think to have success in the committee by presenting a \nbipartisan bill. But I specifically want to thank Senator Reid for his \nattitude on the bill. I think that will create the environment in which \nwe will have to frankly work through some contentious issues. This is \nnot an issue-free piece of legislation. We are 7 years overdue. It \nshould have been passed in the last two Congresses. But we have made a \ngood start.\n  I thank both leaders for giving Senator Murray and me a chance to try \nto work in the next few days with other Senators to continue the \namendment process, allow Senators to have their say, get a result, and \nwork with the House to send a bill to the President that he is willing \nto sign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Tennessee is an expert in \neducation. Not only was he the Governor of the great State of \nTennessee, he was also the Secretary of Education. He knows education. \nAnd he has a good partner to work with, Patty Murray. The senior \nSenator from Washington is a legislator first class, and the work they \nhave done as leaders of this important committee has been very, very \ngood.\n  I appreciate the kind words of my friend from Tennessee, but this is \nan example of what I talked about a few minutes ago. We are not \ntreating Republicans the way they have treated us. I repeat, every \npiece of legislation I brought to the floor we had to file a motion to \nproceed on--with extremely rare exception, everything. We wasted months \ngoing through this senseless 2 days, 30 hours, and on and on with all \nthe time spent on this. It was an effort to embarrass President Obama, \nand they did their best to do that. But as cynical as it was, it helped \nthem in the 2014 elections, and I acknowledge that, and that is too \nbad. But it is too bad we had to go through all that because it has \nreally hurt the country.\n  I say to my friend, I have great respect for this man from Tennessee. \nHe is a good legislator, and I look forward to moving forward on this \nimportant piece of legislation involving elementary and secondary \neducation. We have to do a better job, and I think there are no two \nbetter qualified people than the two managers of this bill to \naccomplish that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader. Senator \nMurray and I will make our opening statements, but I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we begin debate today on a bill to fix \nthe problems with No Child Left Behind, the Federal law that has been \ncausing confusion and anxiety in 100,000 public schools in our country.\n  This week, Newsweek magazine called this the ``law that everyone \nwants to fix.'' There is a broad consensus about that, and, remarkably, \nthere is a broad consensus about how to fix it. This is the consensus: \nthat we should continue the law's important measurements of students' \nacademic progress but restore to States, school districts, classroom \nteachers, and parents the responsibility for deciding what to do about \nthe results of those tests. In my view, this change should produce \nfewer tests and more appropriate ways to measure student achievement. \nWe believe this is the most effective path toward higher standards, \nbetter teaching, and real accountability.\n  Our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--the Senate's \neducation committee--obviously believes that too. The committee \nreported the bill unanimously. Senator McConnell, the majority leader, \nnoted earlier that committee has on it some of the Senate's most \nliberal Democrats and several of the Senate's most conservative \nRepublicans. It was a surprise to many people that the committee \nreported it unanimously. But the committee understood that this was a \nproblem we needed to solve and that we had a fair and open process, \neveryone had a chance to participate, and that the bill was good enough \nto come to the floor, where we could continue to work on it.\n  Not only is there a consensus about how to fix it within the U.S. \nSenate committee on education, there is outside of the Senate. This \nbipartisan bill, which has come to the Senate floor, has been supported \nby teachers, by school boards, by school superintendents, by chief \nState school officers, and by Governors.\n  The Presiding Officer is a former Governor, as am I. Both of us would \nhave to go back a long time to remember something that was supported as \nenthusiastically by both the National\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\nGovernors Association and the major teachers unions, but this \nbipartisan proposal is.\n  Earlier I thanked the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for putting \nthe bill on the floor. That may seem like a small matter for those not \ninvolved in the Senate, but it is a big matter. He has a pretty big \nlist of bipartisan legislation that is important to this country's \nfuture, and he could have chosen any of those to bring to the floor. \nBut he saw the importance of education to our country and that we not \nonly need a strong national defense, but we need to be strong at home.\n  So we are going to be dealing with legislation that affects 100,000 \npublic schools, 50 million children, 3\\1/2\\ million teachers. It may \nnot be big news every day in Washington, DC, but it sure is in \nNashville, TN, in Maryville, TN, in Washington State, and in North \nDakota.\n  If you go home, you hear quite a bit about Common Core. You hear \nquite a bit about the national school board. You hear quite a bit about \nwhether the standards we have for our children are enough to help them \nget a job and to help them succeed in the world we have. So I thank the \nmajority leader for putting it on the floor.\n  As I said before, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Reid. He has \nallowed the bill to come to the floor as rapidly as it could. There \nhave been no delaying tactics whatsoever. We didn't have to have a \nmotion to proceed and a cloture vote. I am grateful for that because \nthat means we can work with other Senators and put this bill into shape \nand give more people a chance to have their say on behalf of their \nconstituents at home.\n  I want to give my special thanks at the outset--and I probably will \nagain during this debate more than once--to the Senator from Washington \nState, Mrs. Patty Murray. She is a good partner to have in this, and I \nam glad I took her advice in dealing with this bill. I knew we had a \nproblem because we tried in the last two Congresses to solve this \nproblem, and we absolutely failed. We are 7 years overdue. But Senator \nMurray made the suggestion that she and I try to work together to \ncreate a bipartisan product that we could present to the committee and \nthen work from that. I took that advice, and it turned out to be \nexcellent advice. Her ability to be a forceful advocate for her \npositions but at the same time command respect within her caucus and \namong people around the country who know her and to make this work is a \nprincipal reason, if not the main reason, we had a unanimous report \nfrom the education committee. So I am grateful to her for that.\n  If you are a busy parent of one of the 50 million children attending \npublic school today, you may not know your child has been going to \nschool for the last 7 years under a broken and expired Federal \neducation law. You may not know that the U.S. Department of Education \nis practically running your child's school, if you live in one of 42 \nStates operating under waivers. You may have heard your child's teacher \ncomplain about how little flexibility he or she has to help your child \nand to innovate in the classroom, and you have probably seen your \nchild's frustration at the number of tests he or she is taking.\n  You have no doubt heard of the frustration of other parents and \nteachers about Common Core, the academic standard most States have \nadopted. In 2009, the Department of Education created a $4.4 billion \npot of money that States competed for. This was called Race to the Top. \nStates got extra points for adopting Common Core. Race to the Top \ncaused 30 States plus Washington, DC, to adopt Common Core so they \ncould include that in their application.\n  Then along came the phenomenon of waivers, because we in Congress had \nfailed to act since 2007. The original No Child Left Behind bill passed \nin 2001 became unworkable. It established a goal that by 2014 all of \nour children in 100,000 public schools would be proficient in math and \nscience. We got to 2014--or were getting there--and the children \nweren't proficient. So all the schools--almost all our public schools--\nwere labeled as failing. So to avoid that bizarre result the Secretary \nissued waivers. But at the same time he issued some requirements about \nwhat you had to do to get a waiver if you were the State of North \nDakota or Tennessee or some other State.\n  So you are likely to have heard from teachers and school board \nmembers frustrated about the narrow definitions from Washington about \nexactly how to evaluate teachers and what to do about low performing \nschools. Those requirements came with the waivers.\n  You may be frustrated that your child doesn't have more options for \nschool than the nearest public school. I believe this bill will end \nmany of those frustrations. It will restore responsibility to States \nfor deciding what academic standards to use and will restore \nresponsibility to teachers to do what they do best, and that is to help \nyour child learn what they need to know and be able to do.\n  It will stop the trend of taking too many tests by restoring to \nStates the responsibility for deciding how to use Federal test scores \nin measuring school achievement. It will help States expand and \nreplicate their best charter schools so more parents will have a choice \nof schools.\n  The Senate education committee adopted 29 amendments during its \ndebate on the bill. Already Senator Murray and I are working with \nDemocratic and Republican Senators on adopting a large number of other \namendments. In fact, I will have a substitute amendment for our bill to \noffer a little later this afternoon that will include a number of those \namendments, and we expect there to be a robust discussion and debate \nand votes on the Senate floor.\n  Now, just for some context about the debate we are having, when we \ntalk about fixing No Child Left Behind, here is what we are talking \nabout. We are talking about reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. We are talking about the spending in that act of about \n$23 billion, which the Federal Government distributes to States through \nthe law's nine titles. The biggest title is what we call title I. It \nspends about $14.5 billion specifically to help low-income students.\n  Now, the $23 billion that is spent through this bill we are debating \nis a lot of money, but it is only about 4 percent of the total amount \nthis Nation spends each year on kindergarten through 12th grade public \neducation. The Federal Government contributes another 4 or 5 percent to \nK-through-12 education through various programs. But the rest of the \nmoney, about 90 percent, comes from State and local governments.\n  Why No Child Left Behind must be fixed: The problems have been \ncreated by a combination of Presidential action--but let us not forget \nour own responsibility and our own fault for this problem. That is \ncalled congressional inaction. So it is the combination of Presidential \naction and congressional inaction that has led us to a situation where \nwe have a bill described by a major news magazine as ``the education \nlaw that everybody wants to fix.''\n  It started in 2001, when President George W. Bush and Congress \nenacted a bill called No Child Left Behind, which requires a total of \n17 tests between reading and math and science during a child's \nelementary and secondary education. The results of these tests must be \ndisaggregated and reported according to race, ethnicity, gender, \ndisability, and other measures so parents, teachers, and the community \ncan see which children are being left behind.\n  In other words, a typical third grader would have two tests, one in \nreading and one in math. Each test should last about 2 hours. Then that \ntest for that school would be reported to the public, and you would \nbreak it down according to the groups I just mentioned, and we could \nsee if any group of children in any community is being left behind.\n  That wasn't all the law did. The law also created Federal standards--\ncreated here in Washington--for whether a school is succeeding or \nfailing, what a State or school district must do about that failure, \nand whether a teacher was highly qualified to teach in a classroom. \nThose are Washington, DC, definitions.\n  If fixing No Child Left Behind were a standardized test, Congress \nwould have earned a failing grade for each of the last 7 years because \nNo Child Left Behind expired in 2007. We have been unable to agree on \nhow to reauthorize it. As a result, the law's original requirements \nstayed in place and gradually became unworkable. As I mentioned \nearlier, this would have caused all of\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nAmerica's public schools--almost all of them--to be classified as \nfailing schools under the terms of the law.\n  The reason for that was the law set up as a goal that by 2014 all \nchildren would be proficient in reading and mathematics. That sounded \nlike a fair enough goal to have when you are looking at it from 2001. \nBut the closer we got to 2014--even by some of the lowest and easiest \ndefinitions of proficiencies established by States--it was clear that \nmost children and most schools wouldn't reach that goal. So President \nObama's Education Secretary offered waivers from the terms of the law, \nand today 42 States operate their public schools under the terms of \nthose waivers from the original provisions of No Child Left Behind.\n  But instead of just saying yes or no, here is a waiver, each of those \nwaivers contains some requirements. The Secretary really had the State \nover a barrel. He said: If you want a waiver from these unworkable \nprovisions, you are going to have to do a few things. One is to adopt \ncertain academic standards. That turned out to be, in most cases, \nCommon Core. One was to take prescribed steps to help failing schools. \nAnother was to evaluate teachers in a defined way.\n  There was so much new Federal control of local schools over the last \nseveral years that this has produced a backlash against Common Core \nacademic standards, a backlash against teacher evaluation, and against \ntests in general. Governors and chief State school officers complain \nabout Federal overreach. Infuriated teachers say the U.S. Department of \nEducation has become a national human resources department or, in \neffect, a national school board.\n  This doesn't just come from Republicans. This comes from Democratic \nchief State school officers who have come to my office and who have \ncome to Senator Murray's office and have said: Please give us more \nflexibility. We are with the children. We are in our States. We think \nwe know what to do.\n  They say it in different ways maybe if they are Republicans or \nDemocrats, but they all basically have said the same thing, which is \nwhy we have this consensus, at least so far on how to fix this \nlegislation, this law that everybody wants to fix.\n  So what is this remarkable consensus on how to fix the law? Here are \nnine things the bill does. No. 1, it strengthens State and local \ncontrol. The bill gives responsibility for creating what we call \naccountability systems to States. Now, ``accountability systems'' \nsimply means who is in charge of making sure the job gets done. Well, \nthat goes to States, working with school districts, with teachers and \nwith others to make sure all students are learning and preparing for \nsuccess. The accountability systems will be State designed. They will \nmeet minimum Federal parameters, including ensuring that all students \nand subgroups of students are included in the accountability system.\n  Disaggregating student achievement data--those are the tests I talked \nabout earlier. In establishing challenging academic standards for all \nstudents, the Federal Government is prohibited from determining or \napproving State standards. So if you are in Alaska, Tennessee or \nWashington, the Federal Government says if you want the Federal money, \nyou have to have challenging standards and you have to have a test of \nthose standards. But those are your standards, and those are your \ntests. You need to publicize them so the world can know how kids in \nschools are doing, but the Secretary in Washington is specifically \nprohibited by this proposal of ours from determining or approving those \nstandards.\n  No. 2, our legislation would end the Common Core mandate. The bill \naffirms that States may decide for themselves what academic standards \nthey will adopt without interference from Washington, DC.\n  I mentioned a little earlier how the $4.4 billion pot of money caused \nas many as 30 States to immediately say: Yes, we will adopt Common \nCore. Now, maybe they were going to do it anyway, and we can talk about \nthat more in just a minute, but that is what it did.\n  The Federal Government may not, under our proposal, mandate or \nincentivize States to adopt or maintain any particular set of \nstandards, including Common Core. States will be free to decide what \nacademic standards they will maintain in their States. If they want \nCommon Core, they can have Common Core. If they want half of Common \nCore, they can have half of it. If they want uncommon core, States can \nhave that. They simply have to have standards, and the Secretary is \nprohibited from telling them what those standards are.\n  No. 3, the bill would end the Secretary's waivers. The waiver \nprovision was a small part of the original bill in 2001. I doubt if \nthose who passed it ever expected it would be used the way it has been \nused by the current Secretary. The bill prohibits the Secretary, \nthough, from mandating additional requirements for States or school \ndistricts seeking waivers from Federal law.\n  In other words, if I come as Governor of Tennessee to the Secretary \nof Education and say: I would like to have a waiver. He can say yes or \nhe can say no, but he can't say: Well, you can get a waiver if you will \nevaluate teachers this way, adopt these standards, and fix these \nperforming schools in that way. That is up to the State. The bill \nlimits the Secretary's authority to disapprove a waiver request as \nwell.\n\n  No. 4, the bill maintains important information for parents, \nteachers, and communities. No issue has stirred as much controversy in \nour discussion as testing. No Child Left Behind required students to \ntake 17 standardized tests over the course of their kindergarten \nthrough 12th grade education, and it attached high stakes for schools, \nschool districts, and States to the results. As we studied the problem, \nas we listened to teachers and Governors and people of both political \nparties, it became obvious to us that it wasn't so much those 17 \nfederally required tests but the stakes attached to them.\n  A third grader, for example, is required to take only one test in \nmath and one test in reading. The testimony of the Denver school \nsuperintendent was that each of those tests takes about 2 hours. If you \ntake two tests in the third grade and two in the fourth grade--and \nthose are the tests that are publicized so people can tell whether the \nschool is succeeding or the child is succeeding or children are being \nleft behind--that is not very much time out of the school year. But the \naccountability system for what to do about the test results contributed \nto the exploding number of State and local tests. Many of them were \ngiven to prepare students for the high-stakes Federal tests.\n  Our proposal maintains the federally required two annual tests in \nreading and math in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school, as well \nas science tests given three times between grades 3 and 12.\n  These important measures of student achievement need to be reported \npublicly so parents can know how their child is performing. It is \nimportant the results be disaggregated so we know if any particular \ngroup of students is being ignored or left behind. It can also help \nteachers support students who are struggling to meet State standards.\n  We have included in our proposal before the Senate an amendment from \nSenator Collins and Senator Sanders for a pilot program which would \nallow States additional flexibility to experiment with innovative \nassessment systems--meaning tests--that might replace the kind of \nstandardize tests used today. It is important to point out that the \nFederal requirement isn't for a particular test. It simply says the \nState has to have one and the State has to publicize it in a special \nway.\n  No. 5, our proposal ends Federal test-based accountability. We \ndiscovered that the problem is the Federal Government's accountability \nsystem for what to do about the results of these tests, which has \ncontributed to the exploding number of State and local tests. Said \nanother way, it is the ``made in Washington'' decision about what a \nqualified teacher is, how to evaluate a teacher, and what is adequate \nyearly progress in a school. All of that is what seems to have caused \nthe exploding number of tests we have heard about so much.\n  To give an example, in testimony it was said to us that Fort Myers, \nFL, had 183 tests for children in the kindergarten through 12th grade \ncareer of a child. We know only 17 of those are Federal tests under No \nChild Left Behind. So where are the rest of the tests coming from? They \nare State and local\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\ntests. Once the spotlight was shown on Fort Myers, FL, and their 183 \ntests, it became clear it wasn't No Child Left Behind causing that--or \nat least it wasn't Federal tests but State and local tests that were \ncausing this. Then the number of tests quickly went down.\n  Because of this, our proposal ends the high-stakes Federal test-based \naccountability system of No Child Left Behind and restores the \naccountability system to State and local responsibility to hold schools \nand teachers accountable.\n  Teachers are in the assessment business. They said to us: Look, there \nare many different types of tests and assessments. We do this all the \ntime. We have pop quizzes, we have end-of-the-year tests, we have \nstandardized tests, we have multiple choice tests, and we have open-\nended questions. We need to be deciding what those assessments should \nbe, and we need to be deciding what weight each of those has in \ndeciding how this child is doing or how this school is doing or how \nthis group of children are doing. So they don't really object to having \na standardized test as one of the measurements. What they object to is \nhaving a single standardized test--set in Washington, DC--count for so \nmuch and to pretend that here we can make a decision about what may be \ngoing on in native schools in Alaska or the mountains of Tennessee or \nschools in Harlem.\n  States must include these standardized tests in their accountability \nsystem, but States will determine the weight of these tests. States \nwill also be required to include graduation rates, another measure of \nacademic success for elementary schools, English proficiency for \nEnglish learners, and one other State-determined measure of school \nsuccess or student support.\n  States may also include other measures of student and school \nperformance in their accountability systems in order to provide \nteachers, parents, and other stakeholders with a more accurate \ndetermination of school performance.\n  State accountability systems must meet limited Federal guidelines, \nincluding challenging academic standards for all students, but the \nFederal Government is prohibited in this proposal from determining or \napproving State standards. So whether a State adopts common core or any \nother academic standard is entirely the State's decision.\n  This transfer of responsibility for determining what to do about the \nresults of tests is why we believe our proposal will result in fewer \nand more appropriate testing for children.\n  There are three more things that our proposal does. No. 6, it \nstrengthens the charter school program. The bill provides grants to \nState entities and charter management organizations to start new \ncharter schools and to replicate or expand high-quality charter \nschools, including by developing facilities, preparing and hiring \nteachers, and providing transportation. It also provides incentives for \nStates to adopt stronger charter school authorizing practices, \nincreases charter school transparency so we can know what is going on, \nand improves community engagement in the operation of charter schools.\n  Charter schools are public schools. I remember in 1992, when I was \nEducation Secretary, the last thing I did was that I wrote a letter to \nall the school superintendents in the country in all the different \nschool districts--I guess there are 14,000 or 15,000--and asked them to \nconsider creating in their school district one of the new start-from-\nscratch schools that had been created in the State of Minnesota by the \nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor government. There were 10 of them, and they \ncalled them charter schools. Those were the first 10 charter schools.\n  There are 6,700 charter schools today. About 6 percent of all public \nschool students go to charter schools. Charter schools, in my view, are \nnothing more than public schools in which teachers have the freedom to \ngive children what those children need, and parents have the freedom to \nchoose the school that their child attends. I think any teacher would \nmuch prefer to have that sort of arrangement and that sort of freedom--\nfreedom from State regulations, freedom from Federal regulations, \nfreedom from some union rules--so they can provide for the children who \ncome to that school and who choose to go to that school the kind of \neducation those children deserve.\n  No. 7, our proposal would help States fix the lowest performing \nschools. The bill includes Federal grants to States and school \ndistricts to help improve low-performing schools identified by State \naccountability systems. School districts will be responsible for \ndesigning evidence-based interventions for low-performing schools with \ntechnical assistance from the States. The Federal Government is \nprohibited from mandating, prescribing or defining the specific steps \nschool districts and States must take to improve these schools.\n  Why would one do that? Let me give an example of what goes on today. \nUnder the waiver requirements, if you have a low-performing school, you \nhave to identify a certain number. That is prescribed by Washington. \nThen you have six ways you can fix the school. I insisted a couple of \nyears ago that we add a seventh. Showing my old Governor biases, I \nsaid: Let's allow a State to come up with a seventh way of improving a \nlow-performing school, and that would be whatever the Governor thinks \nwould be the best way to do it. That was adopted by the Congress. About \n12 months later, out came a regulation from the U.S. Department of \nEducation defining, limiting, and explaining what a Governor could do \nabout it.\n  The whole purpose of the exercise was to get rid of that sort of \ninstruction from here and to recognize that Governors themselves might \nfeel like their principal responsibility might be to improve a low-\nperforming schools. I always did when I was there. And I, with all \nrespect, didn't really need advice from Washington, DC, about how to do \nit.\n  No. 8, it helps States support teachers. The bill provides resources \nto States and school districts to implement activities to support \nteachers, principals, and other educators, including through high-\nquality induction programs for new teachers and ongoing rigorous \nprofessional development opportunities. The bill allows--but doesn't \nrequire--States to develop and implement teacher evaluation systems.\n  I know I am using some of my own experiences here, but that is how I \nhave learned. I believe that teacher evaluation is the holy grail of \npublic education. Parents are more important than teachers, but I have \nyet to figure out how to pass a better parents law.\n  Most of the evidence we know about shows that the single most \nimportant way to help a child succeed is to put that child in the \npresence of a really exceptional teacher. So in 1984, Tennessee became \nthe first State to pay teachers more for teaching well. That included a \n1\\1/2\\-year brawl with the National Education Association, which \nobjected to it.\n  President Reagan was President then. He came to Tennessee not to tell \nus to do it and not with any Federal dollars but just to say this is \nimportant to do and this is good to do. That helped me greatly in \npassing it in the legislature, which was Democratic at the time, and \nthis kind of leadership began the process across the country that has \nspread--the evaluation of teachers--to identify the better teachers, to \nencourage them, to reward them, and to try to keep them in the teaching \nprofession.\n  It was assumed when I came here that because I was so involved in \nteacher evaluation, I would want to come to Washington and say: OK, now \neverybody has to do what Tennessee did. But I have done just the \nreverse. The last thing we needed in Tennessee when we were trying to \ndo teacher evaluation in a fair way was Washington looking over our \nshoulder, making it more difficult and complicated.\n  Evaluating good teachers, particularly rewarding outstanding \nteaching, is not easy to do. It sounds simple, but it is hard. It needs \nsomething teachers can buy into that may be different in Alaska and \nTennessee and Washington, and it needs to respect what the \ncircumstances are in each place. The goal is to reward outstanding \nteachers and make teaching more professional and to recognize that \nexcellent teachers of math have great opportunities at IBM or some \nother company. I want to encourage that. This does that, but it doesn't \nmandate it from Washington.\n  No. 9, finally, this helps States improve the fragmentation of early \nchildhood programs. I suspect we will hear a\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nlot about this from Senator Murray because we heard a great deal about \nit in the committee from her. She is a preschool teacher. Her mother \nwas as well. I think one of the things Senator Murray learned as a \npreschool teacher was how to work well with others, which is what 5-\nyear-olds learn. She is a passionate advocate for early childhood \neducation--more than we have in this bill. But we have an important \nstep forward in this bill, in my opinion, that Senator Murray and \nSenator Isakson offered as an amendment. It was approved by the \ncommittee.\n  It will provide competitive planning grants to help States expand \nquality early childhood education by addressing the fragmentation of \nspending of Federal dollars currently through early childhood education \nprograms. We spend about $8 billion on Head Start. We spend about \nanother $6 billion or $7 billion on child development block grants. \nThat total amount of money is as much money as we spend in the entire \ntitle I program for kindergarten through the 12th grade. We spend \nanother $8 billion or $10 billion throughout different parts of the \nFederal Government for early childhood education. Then there is State \nfunding for early childhood education. Then there is local funding. \nThen there is private funding.\n  For example, the testimony from the superintendent of education from \nLouisiana was that, as much as more money, what would help create more \neducational opportunities for children ages 2, 3, and 4, is for States \nand local governments to be able to spend the money we are already \nspending more effectively. He said: There are too many silos. You can't \nuse the Head Start money in conjunction with this money or that money \nor in conjunction with this money. This proposal in our bill would be a \nstep toward helping States use Federal dollars more effectively in \nearly childhood education.\n\n  Finally, I said earlier that if fixing No Child Left Behind was a \nstandardized test, Congress would have earned a failing grade for the \nlast 7 years. In each of the last two Congresses, the Senate committee \nthat Senator Murray and I head produced bills to fix No Child Left \nBehind. But these bills divided our committee along party lines. Even \nso, two Congresses ago, Senator Enzi, Senator Kirk, and I voted with \nthe Democratic majority to report a bill out of committee so that the \nfull Senate could act.\n  In the last Congress, the committee majority passed a partisan bill \nwithout any Republican votes, but I committed to support Chairman \nHarkin in taking the bill to the floor if there would be an open \namendment process.\n  Unfortunately, these bills never reached the floor. We needed, \nobviously, to do something different, which is where Senator Murray's \nleadership became so important. She suggested the way that we \nproceeded, which allowed us to create a bridge across the partisan \ndivide so that we could recommend to the full committee a bipartisan \nsolution upon which they could build and upon which the full Senate \ncould build.\n  I accepted her suggestion, and I have repeatedly thanked her for it. \nShe and I have listened carefully to our Senate colleagues, to \nteachers, principals, Governors, chief State school officers, students \nand parents, and to the business and civil rights communities, and we \nhave listened to each other. I am grateful that the majority leader has \nput the bill on the floor and that the Democratic leader has allowed it \nto come to the floor expeditiously.\n  Senators with amendments will have a chance to have a vote on those \namendments. Already in our Senate education committee, we considered 58 \namendments, and we have adopted 29. We have had a fair and open \nprocess, which I believe is the main reason the committee vote was \nunanimous.\n  I would like to say this: Senator Murray and I have exercised \nrestraint. Neither of us has insisted on forcing into the bill every \nproposal about which we feel strongly. We know that to get a result we \nhave to achieve consensus. We know that in the Senate, ``consensus'' \nmeans at least 60 votes. We know that if we succeed here, we will have \nto deal with our friends in the House of Representatives. After that, \nif we want a result, which we do, we want the President's signature. We \nwant to fix No Child Left Behind--not just make a political statement.\n  The only major objection to this bill that I have heard is one from \nsome groups that believe the path to higher standards, the path to \nbetter teaching, and the path to real accountability is through \nWashington, DC, instead of State by State.\n  I would like to offer three reasons why I think this is wrong and why \nI believe our consensus to restore decisions to those closest to the \nchildren is right.\n  No. 1, States are better prepared today to set higher standards, to \nevaluate teachers, to develop good assessments, and to develop good \naccountability systems than they were when No Child Left Behind passed \nin 2001. President Bush and President Obama can take some credit for \nthat and should.\n  No. 2, the national school board--as I call it--which has been \ncreated over the last 10 years as we move more and more responsibility \nfrom States to Washington, DC, has created a backlash. It has made it \nharder to have higher standards. It has made it harder to evaluate \nteachers. It has showed conclusively that the better path to higher \nstandards, better teaching, and accountability is through the States \nand not through Washington.\n  No. 3, most Americans understand that you don't get wiser and more \ncaring simply by getting on a plane and flying to Washington. In fact, \nthe people closer to the children are usually better equipped to make \ndecisions about their well-being.\n  I have, principally because of age, a long view of this whole \nprocess. States are better prepared today than they used to be. I was \nGovernor when Terrel Bell, President Reagan's Education Secretary in \n1983, issued ``A Nation at Risk,'' saying that our schools were in such \na shape that if a foreign country had done that to our country, we \nwould have considered it an act of war.\n  I worked together with other Governors--the Governors who were \nelected adjacent to me, especially Governor Clinton, Governor Riley, \nand Governor Graham--and the National Governors Association. In 1985 \nand 1986, Governor Clinton and I caused all of the Governors to work on \nsomething we called ``Time for Results'' to begin to move State by \nState toward more achievement for our students. Then in 1989, President \nGeorge H. W. Bush called the Governors together to a summit and set \nnational education goals.\n  That never happened before in our country. It may sound like an easy \nthing to do, to say let's have goals of all children being proficient \nin math, science, English, history, and geography. But just to pick \nthose subjects was a controversial topic. Just to spend that time on it \nwas a great step forward.\n  Then ``America 2000'' in 1991 and 1992, when I was Education \nSecretary, was the way to reach the goals. That is where we began to \nsee this debate again. Is the best way to do it State by State, \ncommunity by community or is the best way to do it through Washington, \nDC? President George H. W. Bush believed the best way to do it was \nState by State, community by community. He advocated voluntary national \nstandards, but they were voluntary. He advocated voluntary national \ntests, but they were voluntary. He advocated accountability systems, \nbut they were voluntary as well. He advocated more choices for parents \nof low-income children and an expansion of charter schools.\n  What the Governors have done since that time is worked together State \nby State to create our standards, better tests, and better \naccountability systems. The Governors have also agreed that States \nwould take the so-called NAEP test, the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, which is a sample test. Not all students take it. \nBut it keeps the Governor of Tennessee from setting a low standard, \nwhich we once did so we looked good when we achieved that standard. Now \nwe can know whether Alaska and Tennessee are really comparable because \nthat test is public and we take it.\n  The second point I made about this was about the backlash. It may \nseem counterintuitive to say that it is harder to create higher \nstandards because of the Common Core debate, but you would understand \nit pretty well if you ran for the Senate in a Republican primary or \neven in a general election,\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nwhich I did last year. Common Core was an issue both in the primary and \nin the general election. What I said was this: Wait a minute; I think \nWashington should stay entirely out of it. But people were so upset \nwith Common Core, not really so much because of what is in it but \nbecause Washington was requiring it or at least it seemed to them that \nit was Washington taking over local schools.\n  The truth of the matter was that Common Core began with Bill Bennett, \na former Education Secretary and a leading conservative, when he was \nhead of the National Endowment for the Humanities here in Washington, \nDC. He sponsored research by E.D. Hirsch in Virginia, who wanted to put \nmore rigor in academic curriculum.\n  When the first President Bush called the Governors together and said \nwe want to set these high goals and Governors begin to talk about what \nthe standards for the proposed goals are, Governors began to work \ntogether on something called Achieve. There were some who said: Let's \nhave Washington do it.\n\n  But the Governor said: No, you stay out of it; we will do it \ntogether.\n  It was out of this that the Common Core academic standards came \ntogether. It was basically a bunch of conservative Governors working \ntogether to add rigor to the system. But what spoiled it was that \nWashington's involvement in it in the 1990s created this enormous \nbacklash and now Governors are backpedaling. At a time when, for \nexample, in our State we have advanced manufacturing coming in and \nworkers need to know a lot in order to get a job, we are arguing about \nwhether to have high standards because of the backlash against Common \nCore. We need to get Washington out of the Common Core debate and let \nTennessee and every other State make their own decisions about what \ntheir academic standards should be. Then, if you don't like what your \nchild is learning, you can go talk to your Governor or your legislature \nand they have 100 percent of the authority to decide whether that is \ngood or whether that is bad.\n  Then there is teacher evaluation. As I said, I spent a lot of time on \nthat in the 1980s and since. It is hard to do. It is hard enough to do \nwithout adding a new element, and the new element is the highly \nprescriptive method that is defined from Washington about how to do a \nteacher evaluation. That produced a backlash.\n  Teachers unions are up in arms. When they are up in arms, that makes \nit harder to put in a teacher evaluation system. If you believe, as I \ndo, that high standards and teacher evaluation are the underpinnings of \na great education system and are the way that you help children learn \nwhat they need to know and are able to do, you do not want to create a \nbacklash to those efforts by insisting on prescriptive definitions from \nWashington, DC.\n  Finally, it is a strange idea, as I mentioned earlier as well, to \nsuggest that those of us who fly from Knoxville to Washington--or \nSenator Murray flies a long way each week and goes all the way to the \nWest Coast and back, but almost all of us go home almost every \nweekend--get that much smarter and that much wiser on the plane flying \nhere. I may get a little less smart and a little less wise on the plane \nflight here. It doesn't help me to know any more about what is going on \nin the Tennessee mountains or the native areas of Alaska or in eastern \nWashington State by being here in Washington, DC.\n  We spend 4 percent of the Nation's education dollars through this \nbill we are debating today. I think we have a right to ask: How are \nthese children doing? Take a test, report the results, and let us see \nif children are being left behind. But we shouldn't presume then to \nsay: Here then is what you ought to do about it. We are going to decide \nwho is succeeding, who is failing, what the right way to fix that is. \nWe can't do that with 50 million children, 100,000 schools, and 3.5 \nmillion teachers. All those are better done by men and women who are \ncloser to the children.\n  One of the most eloquent statements of what I just said came from \nCarol Burris, New York's 2013 High School Principal of the Year. She \nwrote us after we began work on our proposal and put it online and this \nis what she said:\n\n       Remember that the American public school system was built \n     on the belief that local communities cherish their children \n     and have the right and responsibility, within sensible \n     limits, to determine how they are schooled.\n       While the federal government has a very special role in \n     ensuring that our students do not experience discrimination \n     based on who they are or what their disability might be, \n     Congress is not a National School Board.\n\n  That is the principal of the year in New York State saying that.\n  She went on to say:\n\n       Although our locally elected school boards may not be \n     perfect, they represent one of the purest forms of democracy \n     that we have. Bad ideas in the small do damage in the small \n     and are easily corrected. Bad ideas at the federal level \n     result in massive failure and are far harder to fix.\n\n  That is advice from the New York Principal of the Year. In other \nwords, our well-intentioned guidance from Washington is usually not as \neffective as a decision made in the home, classroom, and community by \nthose closest to the children.\n  What we heard over and over from Democrats as well as Republicans was \nthat while continuing measurements of academic progress are important \nin holding schools and teachers accountable, we should respect the \njudgments of those closest to the children and leave to them most \ndecisions about how to help 3.4 million teachers help 50 million \nchildren in 100,000 public schools.\n  A little humility on our part is an important part of the recipe for \na successful fix of No Child Left Behind. I look forward to this \ndebate. I particularly look forward to fixing this law that everybody \nseems to agree has to be fixed, and that most people seem to agree on \nhow to fix it.\n  If Senators were in a classroom, none of us would expect to receive a \npassing grade for unfinished work. Seven years is long enough to \ncontinue fixing No Child Left Behind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Booker, follow my remarks on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since our Nation's founding, the idea of \na strong public education for every child has been a part of the fabric \nof America because when all students have the chance to learn, we \nstrengthen our future workforce, our country grows stronger, and we \nempower the next generation of Americans to lead the world. A good \neducation can provide a ticket to the middle class, so improving \neducation is an important part of what it means to grow our economy \nfrom the middle out, not from the top down.\n  Today marks the first day of debate on our bipartisan bill to \nstrengthen our education system by reauthorizing the Nation's K-12 \neducation law, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA. \nThis work is a chance to recommit ourselves to the promise of a quality \neducation. For every child, it is an opportunity to finally fix the \ncurrent law, No Child Left Behind.\n  I have been very proud to partner with the senior Senator from \nTennessee throughout this process, and I commend Chairman Alexander for \nworking with me to create this bipartisan bill and for passing the \nEvery Child Achieves Act through the education committee with unanimous \nsupport.\n  I think it is important at the onset to discuss why we need to fix \nthe current law. I also would like to lay out what we accomplished in \nthe Every Child Achieves Act and go through how I think we can best \nstrengthen this bill and pass it through the Senate with bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I wish to acknowledge my committee members as well. This bill is \nbetter thanks to their hard work and commitment to their priorities and \ntheir communities.\n  Nearly everyone agrees that No Child Left Behind is badly broken. For \none, the current law required States to set standards for schools but \nthen didn't give the schools the resources they needed to meet those \nstandards. Second, across the country we are still seeing inequality in \neducation, where some schools simply don't offer the same opportunities \nas others, and some\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nschools still have very large achievement gaps.\n  I have seen firsthand how this law is not working for my home State \nof Washington. No Child Left Behind has become so unworkable that the \nObama administration began issuing waivers to exempt States from the \nlaw's requirements. Washington State had received a waiver but lost it \nlast year, and now most of the schools in my State are categorized as \nfailing.\n  A few months back, I stood here on the Senate floor and told the \nstory of a mom from Shoreline, WA. Her name is Lillian. Last year her \nson was going into the fourth grade in the same school district where I \nonce served as a school board member. Lillian's son had a learning \ndisability. With the help of teachers and specialists at his elementary \nschool, he showed great signs of progress. But then Lillian got a \nletter in the mail 2 weeks before school started, and that letter \ndescribed her son's school as failing. That left her worried about the \nkind of education her son was getting, and she said it gave her a wave \nof uncertainty over the coming school year.\n  I have traveled around Washington State over the past decade and I \nhave heard from a lot of my constituents, from teachers in the \nclassrooms, to moms at the grocery stores, to tech company CEOs. They \nall have the same message: We need to fix the No Child Left Behind law. \nI was very glad that earlier this year we got to work on a bipartisan \nbasis to find common ground to do just that, and I remain convinced \nthat the only way to advance a bill to fix this broken law is with a \nbipartisan approach. Students, teachers, and parents are counting on us \nto do this, and now it is time to take the next step as we debate the \nEvery Child Achieves Act here on the Senate floor.\n  This bill is a strong step in the right direction to finally fixing \nNo Child Left Behind and making sure all of our students have access to \na high-quality public education. It addresses the high-stakes testing. \nI have heard from parent after parent, teacher after teacher in \nWashington State that students are taking too many tests. The current \nlaw overemphasized test scores to measure how students are doing in \nschool. Our bill will give flexibility to States to use multiple \nmeasures--not just a single test score--to determine how well a school \nis performing. The bill will create a pilot program for States to \ndesign new assessments, and that will provide our States with a lot of \nflexibility for innovation. Those steps will reduce the pressure on our \nstudents, our teachers, and our parents so they can focus less on test \nprep and more on learning.\n  The bill eliminates the one-size-fits-all provisions of No Child Left \nBehind that have been so damaging to our schools districts. Instead, \nthe bill allows our communities, parents, and teachers to work together \nto improve schools and to ensure that every child receives a well-\nrounded education.\n  The bill maintains Federal protections to help students graduate from \nhigh school college- and career-ready. The bill also requires States to \nidentify schools that do need improvement.\n  When the education committee debated the bill, I was also proud, as \nthe Senator from Tennessee mentioned, to work on a bipartisan amendment \nwith Senator Isakson to expand and improve early learning programs. As \na former preschool teacher, I have seen the kind of transformation \nearly learning can inspire in a child, so I am proud that this bill \nwill help us expand access to high-quality early childhood education so \nmore of our kids can start kindergarten ready to learn.\n  There are a few key ways that I want to continue to improve this \nbill. First of all, I believe we should strengthen the accountability \nrequirements in the bill. Too many schools have failed too many of our \nchildren for too many years. When we don't hold the schools and States \naccountable for educating every child, it is the kids from our low-\nincome backgrounds, kids with disabilities, kids who are learning \nEnglish, and kids of color who too often do fall through the cracks. \nBefore No Child Left Behind, it was easy for schools to overlook the \nperformance of these vulnerable groups of students. Before 2002, as \nlong as the school's overall performance was OK, it didn't matter if \nstudents of color or students from low-income backgrounds struggled to \nmake progress year after year. The overall average of all students \nallowed achievement gaps to be swept under the rug even as some \nstudents fell further and further behind. We cannot go back to those \ndays, and we can't backtrack on holding our schools accountable for \nhelping all of our students learn.\n  States should still be required to identify the schools that are \nstruggling the most so they can get the help and resources they need to \nimprove. States need to identify the schools where some groups of \nstudents aren't making enough progress. These schools should get the \nsupport and locally designed interventions they need to better serve \ntheir students. Let's remember that holding States accountable for all \nstudents will only work if schools get the resources they need to \npromote students' success.\n  Unfortunately, some schools simply don't provide the same educational \nopportunities as others. Oftentimes students of color don't even have \nthe option to take an AP course or use up-to-date technology in the \nclassroom. African-American and Latino students are significantly less \nlikely to attend a high school that offers advanced math or art \nclasses, and, on average, kids from low-income neighborhoods don't have \naccess to qualified and experienced teachers like students from \nwealthier neighborhoods often do. A ZIP Code should never determine a \nstudent's academic success. We need to make sure all students have \nequitable resources.\n  In the 1800s, Horace Mann, who is often called the father of American \neducation, worked to make it universal and free for all. He famously \nsaid: ``Education . . . is the great equalizer.'' I believe that is \ntrue but only if we continue to hold ourselves accountable for \nproviding educational opportunities to all students. The Every Child \nAchieves Act takes some very important steps to do that. As we debate \nthis bill, I hope we can build on the progress and continue to move in \nthe right direction.\n  I do believe there are important ways we should be able to work \ntogether to improve the bill, but there are other ideas out there that \nmay derail any chance of passing this bill and fixing No Child Left \nBehind. I know some of my Republican colleagues are interested in \nmaking title I funding ``portable.'' That name sounds innocuous enough, \nbut that proposal would allow funds to be taken away from schools that \nneed the help the most, and it would defy the original purpose of our \nFederal K-12 education law. ESEA was meant to help level the playing \nfield for students growing up in poverty. Efforts to backtrack on our \ncountry's commitment to target funds to the highest needs schools and \ninstead give funding away to our more affluent schools is a nonstarter.\n  Others are interested in voucherizing the public school system. That \nwould undermine the basic goals of public education by allowing funding \ndesignated for the most average students to flow out of the public \nschool system and into mostly unaccountable private schools. Vouchers \nare unacceptable to me and would jeopardize our bipartisan work.\n  I am looking forward to our debate to make this bill even better. \nHalf a century ago President Lyndon Johnson directed Congress to \nimprove education for our Nation's students. In January of 1965, in \nwhat would be just months before signing the original ESEA into law, \nPresident Johnson said that when it comes to education, ``nothing \nmatters more to the future of our country,'' and that remains true \ntoday. The future of our country hinges on our students' ability to one \nday lead the world, and a high-quality education for every student is \none of the best investments our country can make to ensure we have \nbroad-based and long-term economic growth.\n  Finishing this process we are working on today and getting a bill \nsigned into law isn't going to be easy. Nothing in Congress ever is. \nBut students, parents, teachers, and communities across our country, \nincluding in my home State of Washington, are looking to us here in \nCongress to fix this broken law. We cannot let them down.\n  We need to work across the aisle to help our students and our schools \nand our teachers get some much needed relief from No Child Left Behind. \nWe need to give our States flexibility while strengthening \naccountability and\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nresource equity. We need to work together to reaffirm our Nation's \ncommitment to ensuring that all students have access to a quality \neducation regardless of where they live or how they learn or how much \nmoney their parents make. By doing so, we will help our Nation grow \nstronger for generations to come.\n  I again thank the Senator from Tennessee for his tremendous \nleadership in getting us to this point and for working with us to make \nsure we get this bill to the President and signed into law so that we \ncan all go home and say we fixed a badly broken law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I rise \ntoday with the understanding that I have been a Senator for just a \nshort while--about 19 months--and with the knowledge that I stand in a \nbody full of champions for our Nation's kids. I am proud of the \nconversations I have had on both sides of the political aisle and see \nthe earnestness and hard work to ensure that America is a place where \nall children can thrive.\n  I wish to give a special thanks to Senators Alexander and Murray, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Senate HELP Committee. They have \nworked tirelessly in an effort to expand educational opportunities for \nchildren, and I have no doubt that they have already made lasting \ncontributions to the lives of our children. In addition to that, they \nhave taken a flawed legislative reality in No Child Left Behind and \nhave already made significant strides in improving it. It should be \napplauded. They have done good work. In a nation that has been overcome \nwith test craziness, they lowered those ridiculous bars and barriers \nthat are being put up at the local level to achieving high education.\n  I am proud to see a bipartisan consensus forming to correct the ills \nof No Child Left Behind which have been foisted upon school districts \nall over our country and which have made the quest for educational \nexcellence more difficult, not easier or more empowering.\n  I say all of that, but I must also say that I am here because there \nis an enormous amount of work still to do. This body must confront the \ndark places in our country where the ideals of the American educational \nsystem and where the dream of this country of equal access to \nopportunity is being failed. We have work to do. There is a moral \nurgency in this country, and that is what I am worried about today.\n  It is deeply disconcerting to me that I cannot stand in the well of \nthe Senate before you today and say that a child born in any ZIP Code \nin America will have access to a quality education and an equal shot in \nthis Nation at learning the skills they need to make the most out of \ntheir lives, to contribute to our country, and to live their American \ndream.\n  It is troubling that I cannot stand here in the well of this \nauspicious body and say that we are leading our peers around the globe \nwhen it comes to the number of our kids--percentage of the population--\nwho graduate from high school ready to succeed as part of the global \neconomy.\n  It is shameful and ignominious that I cannot stand here today and say \nthat we are doing everything we can to ensure that all of our students \ncan succeed and that we are holding those schools that are performing \nthe worst in our Nation--those schools that often deal with the poorest \nof our country, the most marginalized of our country--that we are doing \neverything we can to serve them.\n  There should be standards to which we hold ourselves accountable. For \nthis Senator, it is this America where children are still struggling \nfor the basic foundations of our ideals that concerns me.\n  It was back in 1967 at Stanford University--my alma mater--that \nMartin Luther King stood and gave a speech about the other America. \nSadly, we are a nation that still reflects these words from decades \nago. He talked about a great America where children have quality \nschools, quality housing, and opportunities to succeed. That is the \nmajority of our Nation. It makes us all proud and honored to serve this \ncountry that is an example to the globe of what is possible in a \nvibrant and strong democracy. But in that speech, Martin Luther King \nalso talks about the other America. It is in this America, he said, \nthat people are poor by the millions. ``They find themselves perishing \non a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material \nprosperity,'' King said.\n  He said:\n\n       In a sense, the greatest tragedy of this other America is \n     what it does to little children. Little children in this \n     other America are forced to grow up with clouds of \n     inferiority forming every day in their little mental skies. \n     And as we look at this other America, we see it as an arena \n     of blasted hopes and shattered dreams.\n\n  He details this other America by saying that ``many people of various \nbackgrounds live in this other America. Some are Mexican-Americans, \nsome are Puerto Ricans, some are Indians.'' Millions of them are White. \n``But probably the largest group in this other America in proportion to \nits size in the population is the American Negro.''\n  We are moving now on education legislation, but let's tell the truth \nof what is happening in this other America--that there is still a dark \nunderside where lack of achievement and lack of opportunity in this \nother America must be addressed.\n  I have visited schools all over New Jersey. We are a State that is \nthe envy of America in the quality of our schools. We have reached \nheights of educational attainment, and New Jersey youngsters go to \ngreat, prestigious universities all over our State and our country. I \nam proud that we are one of the greatest education States in America. \nBut I also know that even New Jersey has some schools--particularly in \nvulnerable places of high poverty--that fail to serve the genius of our \nchildren.\n  I have also had the privilege to travel our Nation, having been \ninvited to speak in cities from coast to coast, and, like New Jersey, I \nsee signs of hope and signs of promise. I see kids going to schools in \nthe toughest neighborhoods, but those schools are more than schools-\nthey are cathedrals of learning that serve their genius. Yet I am still \ntold by parents from New Jersey and in our Nation, who look me in the \neye and know their schools are failing their kids--they don't need \nreports from any government body to let them know their kids are not \ngetting the education they deserve and to know the even more painful \ntruth that their children, should they not get the education they \ndeserve, will have options for themselves that are lost and constricted \nin this greatly global economy we have.\n  I worry that if we put legislation forward which does not keep those \nchildren in the center of our hearts and our minds, the consequences of \ndashing those dreams are great for our Nation.\n  When I was a child, I heard this poem by Langston Hughes:\n\n     What happens to a dream deferred?\n     Does it dry up\n     like a raisin in the sun?\n     Or fester like a sore--\n     And then run?\n     Does it stink like rotten meat?\n     Or crust and sugar over--\n     like a syrupy sweet?\n     Maybe it just sags\n     like a heavy load.\n     Or does it explode?\n\n  In our country, people who are in environments with schools that fail \nthe genius of our kids witness the disastrous manifestation of that \nfailure on a daily basis. We now know that in America, a young Black \nboy who does not graduate from high school has a 70 percent chance, \nwithout that diploma, of ending up in jail by his midthirties. We now \nknow that in our prisons in this Nation, 67 percent of inmates are high \nschool dropouts. We know that the national average spent for a student \nin our country is $12,643. Yet, somehow we allow funds to drain from \nthe National treasure that are the kids in our schools, by spending \nalmost $29,000, on average, to keep one person behind bars in federal \nprison.\n  If we deny poor children a quality education, there will be \ndisastrous consequences. We now know that in our Nation, if you are \nborn in poverty, you have a 9-percent chance of going to college. I \nwill repeat that. If you are born in poverty, you have a 9-percent \nchance of going to college and graduating. This is unacceptable.\n  We cannot design legislation in this body that does not stand up to \nthis reality. Indeed, the legislation we are\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\npassing now has its roots in its initial focus on the disadvantaged.\n  Fifty years ago this past April, President Lyndon B. Johnson sat in \nfront of what once was a one-room schoolhouse in Texas, next to a woman \nnamed Kate Deadrich Loney, and signed into law the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. It had a purpose to it. It had a mission.\n  Sitting next to his former teacher and in front of his former school, \nPresident Lyndon Johnson signed the law and said that this law \n``represents a major commitment of the federal government to quality \nand equality in the schooling that we offer our young people. By \npassing this bill, we bridge the gap between helplessness and hope for \nmore than five million educationally deprived children.''\n  That is not all he mentioned, but he specifically focused on those \ndisadvantaged children--those 5 million in our Nation--who were not \ngetting access to the American ideal, the American dream. Their dream \nwas to be deferred or stolen or denied.\n  Today in America, 6 percent of high schools fail to graduate one-\nthird of their students. We must do better by them. It is this issue in \nour country that we have to recognize.\n  As stated in President Johnson's words, the Federal Government's role \nin education has been that of a bridge between helplessness and hope, \none that identifies the needs of the underserved and the most \nvulnerable students and the schools that are not serving them. Since \n1965, the Federal Government has done a good job of playing a critical \nrole in advancing equality and greater educational opportunity so that \nmore children are included. The creation of Pell grants, title IX, and \nthe first Education for All Handicapped Children Act are great strides \nour Nation has taken in being that bridge from helplessness to hope.\n  The reauthorization of the critical legislation that first \nestablished that ``bridge'' has taken different forms over the past 50 \nyears. In certain instances, as in the case of No Child Left Behind, it \ntook a step too far. That is why this Senator praises Senator Alexander \nand Senator Murray for beginning to correct the inadequacies and \ndeficiencies and harm that bill has done.\n  When it comes to reauthorization of the ESEA, we cannot allow for an \noverly prescriptive No Child Left Behind bill. We cannot afford to go \nback to that era. We must change. However, we cannot allow the pendulum \nto swing so far that we abdicate our responsibility to make sure every \nstudent--to make sure the students in that other America are being \nserved by a quality school.\n  It is not overly prescriptive to ask schools that are failing to \ngraduate a large share of their students to do something differently. \nIt is not overly prescriptive to ask schools--these 6 percent of our \nschools that are dropout factories in our Nation--to make changes to \nhonor the children, their beauty, their dignity, and their potential. \nAnd it is certainly not asking too much that we who are putting \nhundreds of millions of dollars from the Federal Government into a \nsystem--that there is some accountability for these dropout factors.\n  This body should be a steward of taxpayer dollars. Congress has a \nrole when it comes to the investments we make in housing, when it comes \nto the investments we make in infrastructure, and when it comes to \ndefense dollars, to make sure these dollars are serving the purpose to \nwhich they are extended--to make sure these investments produce returns \nfor taxpayers. Today, the Federal Government and this body still have \nthat critical role to play when it comes to making sure all American \nchildren have access to a quality education.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. Too many of our children are still \nstuck in failing schools--schools that are so bad that they put \nthousands of children into that world where they do not have a chance \nat a college education or even getting a high school degree. The \nstudents succeeding in our country's quality schools will have the \nopportunity to become the next generation of teachers, mayors, police, \nfirefighters, doctors, and Senators. They will lead the globe. This is \nwhat I am proud of as an American. The students in our country's \nfailing schools deserve to have that same opportunity.\n  I know this from traveling our country and traveling our State: that \nprodigy isn't bounded by geography and that genius is equally \ndistributed in our country. Talent is as concentrated in one ZIP Code \nas it is in another. There are as many geniuses in Camden as there are \nin Princeton. The next Einstein or Gates or Hemingway is as likely to \nbe growing up in Newark as they are in the Upper East Side of \nManhattan. I have seen schools flourish in poor neighborhoods. I have \nseen great schools meet incredible challenges and succeed in educating \nour kids. We know it is possible, and we should expect better than we \nare seeing now.\n  Our moral test is whether we will be able to attain success \neverywhere it might be found, whether we will be able to nurture the \ngenius in all of our kids. We owe it to every child in America to \nensure that every door is open for them to demand better. We need to \ndemand better for our kids. We need to keep them front and center as we \nconsider this bill on the floor.\n\n  I want to conclude by saying that we cannot succeed as a nation, in \nan increasingly global competitive environment, if we leave genius on \nthe sidelines. Our educational determination to help those children is \nnot simply about them, it is about us. It is about whether we will get \nthe full bounty of the strength and potential of our Nation or if we \nwill cast many aside into those dark places, into that other America.\n  We cannot now be damned by the self-defeating stakes of low \nexpectations for ourselves and all of our children. Kids who languish \nin this other America because of a lack of compassion and support and \ninvestment cannot afford to have less accountability for their success.\n  I know as we debate this bill there will be resistance to the idea \nthat those failing most, those stuck in dropout factories, those in the \nother America don't deserve levels of accountability. But I know that \nif we focus on those children, to keep them at the center of our \nthoughts, as was done by President Johnson when this bill originated, I \nknow we can be the America we want to be, a nation that when our \nchildren put their hands on their hearts and say those words, ``liberty \nand justice for all,'' that they are real, indeed, for all children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2089\n\n       (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I call up the Alexander-Murray \nsubstitute amendment No. 2089.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2089.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n\n\n           Work in the Senate and Nuclear Agreement With Iran\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, last week I had a chance to travel the \nState of Texas. Of course, the Presiding Officer can imagine, I had a \nchance to move around the State to listen to what people were saying \nand, frankly, to tell them what it is we have done on their behalf in \nthe Senate so far this year. By and large, I heard that folks are happy \nto see the Senate back to work, under new management, and getting \nthings done that they elected us to do.\n  I spent a good amount of time out in West Texas and in the panhandle \nand had a chance to speak to a number of farmers and ranchers in that \npart of the State. They are, frankly, very pleased to hear that they \nwill soon have access to new markets in Asia now that the trade \npromotion authority bill has been passed and is the law of the land, \nand we are currently in the final stages of negotiating the Trans-\nPacific Partnership.\n  The trade promotion authority, of course, passed last month and was\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nsigned by the President, and it represents a true bipartisan \naccomplishment between Congress and the President. While it is true \nthat I disagree with the President more often than I agree with him, in \nthis case we can both agree that opening new markets for our farmers, \nranchers, and our small business people is good for our States and good \nfor the country.\n  Getting Texas beef, cattle, cotton, and other goods to new markets \ntranslates into better jobs, better wages, and a better economic \nclimate for hard-working Texans. But of course passing the trade \npromotion authority legislation is just one example of what this \nChamber has accomplished so far this year. Under new leadership, the \nSenate has made tremendous progress from what this Senate used to be. \nWe have seen the return to regular order, functioning as a deliberate \nbody that considers a wide range of legislation to benefit the everyday \nlives of the American people.\n  I think pointing out that we voted on more than 130 amendments, \ncompared to just the 15 that were voted on last year, is a great \nindicator that this Chamber is actually back working the way it should. \nThe good news is, whether you are in the majority or the minority, \neveryone is getting a chance to participate in this process, and \nregular voting on amendments brought by any of our Members is now \ntypical and not the exception to the rule.\n  I mention we passed the trade legislation, but overall the Senate has \npassed more than 40 bipartisan bills. We have seen 22 of those already \nsigned into law by President Obama. So the American people let their \nvoices be heard last November 4. They sent us here to do their work. \nThis week, we will take up another important piece of legislation. We \nwill take up an education bill that will ultimately give school \ndistricts in Texas and across the country more flexibility and more \npower to make the best choices for their students.\n  I know the HELP Committee--the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee--the committee of jurisdiction in education matters, has \nworked hard under the leadership of Chairman Alexander and Ranking \nMember Murray. They brought this bill to the floor with a unanimous \nvote in the committee. So I and others look forward to an open \namendment process and a vigorous debate over our Nation's education \npriorities and the important role the States play and local control \nplays in making sure all students have access to educational \nopportunities.\n  Later this week, we will likely have a chance to reconcile the \nlanguage between the House and the Senate version of the Defense \nauthorization bill, a bill that will help equip our Armed Forces with \nthe resources and give them the authorities they need to keep our \ncountry safe. Of course, the Senate will also continue discussions on \nhow to responsibly address the challenges facing the highway trust fund \nand find a way forward for our transportation networks.\n  I remain optimistic that this Chamber can ultimately take up \nappropriations bills that are needed to fund our troops on the \nbattlefield and care for our veterans upon their return. Last month, \nour Democratic friends laid out a strategy, something they called the \nfilibuster summer, saying unless they get 100 percent of what they \nwant, that they are not going to allow the Senate to proceed to \nconsider these appropriations bills.\n  Well, I would like to just remind them there is a lot of work we have \nto do that needs to be done, and if we could just get back in the \nspirit of this bipartisan cooperation, everybody can let their voice be \nheard and their vote will count, but pure partisanship will not get the \njob done. The many Texans I spoke to back home want this spirit of \ndiligent, focused work to continue. They certainly want to see us \nprovide the resources to our troops that they need to carry out their \nmission. So while we have a strong track record so far in the 114th \nCongress, we still have a lot of work to do. I hope my friends across \nthe aisle will continue to work with us on behalf of the people who \nsent us here.\n  Separately, I know my colleagues and I are anxiously awaiting the \nnews of the final outcome of Secretary Kerry's ongoing negotiations \nregarding Iran and its nuclear aspirations. As we all know, earlier \nthis year, Congress passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which \nguarantees that Congress, on behalf of the American people, will have \ntime to study, scrutinize, debate, and then ultimately vote on whether \nwe approve or disapprove of the negotiated deal between Secretary Kerry \nand the administration and Tehran.\n  If the President reaches a deal with Iran by Thursday, then Congress \nwill have up to 30 days to review it and then to vote on whether to \napprove it. As I have said all along, I have grave concerns about how \nthe President has been negotiating with one of our foremost \nadversaries, a country that constantly threatens the American people \nand our allies and has done nothing to garner our trust or respect.\n  The broad outlines of the deal--of the potential deal--we have seen \nreported in the press don't look particularly promising. It seems to \nget actually worse by the day. So I strongly encourage the President \nand Secretary Kerry to remember that if you want a deal badly enough, \nthat is exactly what you are going to get is a bad deal. So ``any deal \nat any cost'' is not the mantra of the American people who are \nunderstandably very wary of any agreement with Iran.\n  But, fortunately, the Senate has proved we will not stand by and \nwatch the President as he makes far-reaching agreements without the \nconsent of the American people through their elected representatives. \nSo I look forward to working with my colleagues to give very careful \nscrutiny, certainly the sort of scrutiny this proposed deal deserves, \nto make sure our country's best interests are protected. If this deal \ndoes not protect our national security and the security of the region \nand our allies, Congress may have no other choice than to vote it down \nby passing a resolution of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Ayotte). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment I have filed to the Every Child Achieves Act that will be \nbrought up, I believe, later today. In the spirit of my friend the \nSenator from Texas I am glad he has joined me on this amendment. I know \nas we get into this terribly important education bill, I want to \ncommend Senator Alexander, Senator Murray for their leadership in \nbringing it to the floor and trying to wrestle through the right \nbalance of between Federal, State, and local partnerships in education. \nI look forward to being a part of that debate.\n  While we will spend hours on the floor of the Senate debating issues \naround accountability and assessment, terribly important issues, there \nis one issue I believe all of us in this body can agree upon, to make \ncertain we ensure that all dollars that are spent on education are \nspent appropriately and in an efficient way and that most of those \ndollars end up in the classroom.\n  This was a conversation I started when I was Governor of Virginia. \nWhen I looked around at the Commonwealth of Virginia, where we spend \nclose to $9 billion a year on public education, I realized that many of \nthe same debates we are having in the Chamber we were having in \nVirginia at that time. But again, one area where there was complete \nagreement was to make sure those dollars spent on education were spent \nefficiently.\n  Too often school divisions, quite honestly, didn't know how to spend \nusing best practices in terms of bus routes, energy usage, back-office \nstaffing. How do you make sure you can take best practices around--I \nmentioned this was being done in Virginia, from around the State--and \nmake sure those dollars were better spent, more efficiently, in the \nclassroom.\n  Well, we looked around the country and we actually found a program in \nTexas--again, why I am so grateful my friend the Senator from Texas, \nMr. Cornyn, has joined me on this amendment. We put in place a program \nto bring better accountability to our school divisions.\n  As I mentioned, too many school divisions don't have the ability to \nassess whether they are spending operational funds in the smartest way. \nMy amendment helps school districts figure out how to be thoughtful \nabout their operations budget, which again allows them to put more \nmoney back into their\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nclassrooms. I mentioned this was an initiative I started as Governor \nback in 2003 in Virginia.\n  I mentioned as well that Virginia was spending a combined $9 billion \nin local, State, and Federal support for public schools. I felt it was \nvery important we make sure that as much of those resources were spent \nin classroom instruction and not in back-office administrative \nfunctions. So, in Virginia, we asked our Department of Planning and \nBudget to design a school efficiency review program. Our public school \ndivisions actually volunteered--a local school superintendent actually \nvolunteered to work with the State Department of Education. It took \nsome level of trust, but they volunteered to undergo a review of their \nnoninstructional functions, things like human resources, purchasing, \nfacilities, transportation, and food service.\n  So we launched this program, and over a decade reviews have been \nconducted in 41 localities around the Commonwealth, in rural, suburban, \nand urban districts. Over the course of the history of this program, \nVirginia's program has identified $45 million in annual potential \nsavings. In Virginia, each review cost an average of about $110,000 and \nproduced an average annual savings of $1.1 million, a return in \ninvestment of nearly 9-to-1, a return that allowed these dollars to be \nmore valuably spent on instruction.\n\n  These reviews recommend commonsense steps: software programs to \nimprove bus transportation routes, enterprise-wide facilities \nmanagement, best practices in purchasing and personnel, and smart, \nresponsible steps to conserve limited resources and direct those \nsavings into the classroom.\n  As I mentioned, we initially borrowed this concept from Texas. Since \nthat time, additional States, including Oklahoma, Minnesota, New York, \nKansas, and Arizona, have implemented similar programs.\n  This commonsense best practice should be available to school \ndistricts nationwide. That is why I am proud, along with Senator \nCornyn, to offer an amendment that will allow States to use their title \nIX consolidated administrative funds to pay for fiscal support teams. \nThis proposal will empower localities with the information they need to \nbetter allocate limited resources so they get a maximum impact in the \nclassroom. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport it. I believe this amendment will be brought up later by either \nSenator Murray or Senator Alexander, and I look forward to its \nconsideration tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Warren pertaining to the introduction of S. 1709 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements of Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. WARREN. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today as the Senate begins its \nconsideration of the Every Child Achieves Act under the leadership of \nChairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray--two great leaders who \nhave done a great job on this bill. The HELP Committee, under their \nleadership, has produced a truly bipartisan effort to find solutions to \nthe seemingly intractable problems facing our educational system. I \ncommend our distinguished chairman and ranking member for their \nleadership and their commitment to prioritizing concrete results over \npartisan grandstanding.\n  While the nature of compromise means that this bill may not be \nperfect in each Senator's eyes, it represents an opportunity for \nmeaningful reform for America's schools, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its swift passage.\n  Ensuring that every child has access to a high-quality education is a \ntop priority shared by all Republicans and Democrats alike. In 2001, I \njoined 86 of my colleagues in supporting No Child Left Behind to \naddress the shortcomings of our educational system. Despite the best of \nintentions, No Child Left Behind fell short of true success. Its \ntesting requirements hamper learning by compelling students to take \ntest after test to satisfy the law's various requirements. Its focus on \nmetrics incentivizes schools to report higher graduation rates even if \nthat means pushing out failing students unprepared for the working \nworld. Because of these and other unintended consequences, of course, \nthe current law is in desperate need of reform.\n  With the Every Child Achieves Act, Congress now has an opportunity to \ncorrect the shortcomings of No Child Left Behind. Instead of setting \nartificial and unattainable requirements, the new legislation allows \nStates to set their own standards for success. It defers to local \nleaders to formulate goals that are realistic and effective for their \ndistricts. It puts parents and teachers in the driver's seat, not \nWashington bureaucrats.\n  For years, States have sought relief from burdensome Federal mandates \nin education, and many States find themselves in untenable positions \nthanks to Federal law. For example, my home State of Utah has struggled \nin the past few years with an impossible decision--either ask for a \ncontinuation of Department of Education waiver mandates or fall back on \nunattainable No Child Left Behind requirements and risk losing crucial \nFederal funding all together.\n  Under this new bill, States will continue to develop their own \nstandards and will establish their own accountability systems linked to \nthese standards. States will also be able to say what they want their \naccountability systems to measure and will be able to determine how \nwell their students are doing based on a variety of important metrics. \nMaintaining the Federal requirement for statewide annual testing is \nnecessary to ensure transparency on school performance and to set a bar \nby which States can measure themselves in a comparable fashion.\n  My colleagues and I were able to make significant improvements to \nthis legislation through the committee and the committee's process. I \nwas especially pleased to see two amendments I care deeply about \nadopted by voice vote during the committee markup: the Innovative \nTechnology Expands Children's Horizons--or I-TECH--Program and the \nEducation Innovation and Research Program.\n  Senator Baldwin and I worked closely to develop I-TECH to ensure that \ntechnology in the classroom is coupled with teacher support to give \nstudents access to a wide range of personalized learning opportunities. \nBy intertwining technology and traditional teaching methods, we can \ntailor each student's educational journey to his or her individual \nneeds and learning style to boost achievement.\n  With the Education Innovation and Research Program, Senator Bennet \nand I created a flexible funding stream that would allow schools, \ndistricts, nonprofits, and small businesses to develop proposals based \non the specific needs of students and the community. Funding for that \nprogram will be awarded based on an initial evidence-based proposal, \nwith continued funding tied to demonstrated successful outcomes flowing \nfrom the project. It is time we start looking at new ways of investing \nin education, much like we do in other realms. Money should not be tied \nto what the U.S. Senate or the Federal Department of Education thinks \nis a good prescriptive idea. It should be tied to local innovation and \nclear outcomes.\n\n  Senator Bennet and I have expounded on that idea by pushing for Pay \nfor Success Initiatives in the underlying bill, as well as in the \namendment process on the floor. Pay for Success allows the government \nto pay only for programs that actually achieve meaningful results. I \nhave offered an amendment to allow funding from the early childhood \nprogram to be used in this manner.\n  My home State of Utah has the first-ever Pay for Success Program \ndesigned to expand access to early childhood\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\neducation for at-risk children. The Utah High Quality Preschool Program \ndelivers a high-impact, targeted curriculum that increases school \nreadiness and academic performance among 3- and 4-year-olds. As \nchildren enter kindergarten better prepared, fewer students will need \nto use special education and remedial services in kindergarten through \n12th grade, allowing schools and States to save money. We should build \non this success and empower other States to do the same.\n  In addition to these cost-saving programs, technology will also \nimprove the quality of education in our country, but advancements in \ntechnology must come side-by-side with a conversation on how best to \nprotect our children's privacy. Education technology is a multibillion \ndollar industry, and it is important to balance the needs for \ninnovation and expansion in schools with reasonable privacy safeguards.\n  To that end, I joined with the senior Senator from Massachusetts in \nfiling an amendment to this legislation to create a structured \ncommission to study important aspects of the convoluted world of \nstudent privacy. The primary law governing this realm--the Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act--was last updated in 2001. Since \nCongress last acted in this area, there have been significant changes \nin the way student information is stored and how outside parties use \nthat information. These changes have led to the introduction of \nnumerous proposals to update this outdated law.\n  The amendment Senator Markey and I have introduced strengthens \nstudent privacy by requiring a commission to report to Congress on the \ncurrent mechanisms for transparency, parental involvement, research \nusage, and third-party vendor usage of student information. The \nCommission will also be tasked with providing suggestions for \nimprovement. This process will allow privacy experts, parents, school \nleaders, and the technology industry to provide us with a clear \nconsensus on how best to protect personal data while not hampering \ndevelopment in schools or access to the important data we garner from \naggregated student information.\n  In addition to protecting student privacy, I have introduced another \namendment crucial to ensuring success in all schools nationwide. The \nEvery Child Achieves Act asks States to identify low-performing schools \nand to allow localities to intervene in these schools. One of the \ngreatest tools Congress could give localities in this process would be \nthe power to renegotiate contracts and to reallocate money and policies \nin more effective ways. Under my amendment, many failing schools would \nbe permitted to ask relief from contracts from vendors and unions, \namong others. These schools would also be able to renegotiate the terms \nof these contracts.\n  Currently, school funding is trapped in a cobweb of unwieldy and \ncomplicated vendor contracts and collective bargaining agreements. Old, \nautomatically renewing contracts with janitorial services, \ntransportation vendors, teachers unions, and testing companies \nrepresent massive locked-in expenditures. Education leaders need \nflexibility to enable failing schools to get a fresh start--the same \nopportunity available to successful charter and private schools. Right \nnow, local leaders' budgets and staffing decisions are largely shaped \nby forces beyond their control. My amendment will encourage more \ncommonsense change from the Federal level to empower localities to act \nin the best interest of the students they serve.\n  The bill we are now considering will make significant improvements to \nthe quality of education in this country and the ability of our \nstudents to compete in a global economy once they enter the workforce. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support these efforts, and I again \nexpress my congratulations and my support to the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member on this committee, Senator Alexander and Senator \nMurray, who have done a really good job in the best interests of \nchildren all over this society.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nremarks and his contribution to the committee's legislation. He is a \nformer chairman of the Senate's education committee--we call it the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee--and his contributions \nin this legislation on early childhood education and other matters are \nawfully important, and I thank him for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, let me just state that this legislation \nbefore us is of vital national importance, and I would like to commend \nChairman Alexander and Senator Murray for their commitment to an open \nand inclusive debate. They and their staffs have been unfailingly \nresponsive, helpful, and thoughtful throughout the process. I was a \nlong-standing member of the education committee, having served on the \nEducation and Labor Committee in the other body, and on the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee for 14 years in this body. And \nI have had the privilege of working with my colleagues over the last \ntwo reauthorizations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  So, again, I must commend Senators Alexander and Murray for the \nextraordinary work they have done and also my colleague Senator \nWhitehouse, who has been a major contributor to this effort. I am \nhopeful and confident, because of the leadership of Senators Alexander \nand Murray, that we will reach a strong bipartisan outcome on this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to continue to work with the committee \non issues that are very important. The fair and equitable access to the \ncore resources for learning, access to effective school library \nprograms, professional development for teachers and principals, family \nengagement, and environmental education are all topics I think are \ncritical, and I am very appreciative my colleagues also thought they \nwere important and gave them very thorough and very fair consideration.\n  I am convinced, if you provide the resources, if you support teachers \nand principals and you engage families, students will thrive. This \nlegislation reflects that perspective, and I appreciate that very much.\n  Our challenges and our responsibilities are to create and support \nlearning environments that enable young people to hone their talents, \ndiscover their skills, and pursue their passions. In some respects, \neducation is about finding a child's talent--letting them find their \ntalent. If you do that, then stand back, they will do wonderful things \nfor themselves, their communities, and this Nation.\n  In fact, our Nation is very much dependent upon education to achieve \nour noblest ideals. As we create educational opportunities for all, we \nfulfill the basic aspiration of this country. While we know we still \nhave work to do, I am very pleased at the work that has been done so \nfar by the committee.\n  We are closing the gaps in high school graduation between minority \nand other students--majority students--but college education gaps are \nwidening, and that is something that must be addressed. The debate we \nbegin today is vital because the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nis not just about elementary schools and high schools, it is about \npreparing young people for what comes next--for college, postsecondary \neducation, for careers, and for contributions to their communities. We \nhave to start at the beginning to get it right in the middle and in the \nend. Again, Senators Alexander and Murray have brought this \nperspective, this bipartisan approach, and I commend them for it.\n  This bill is an improvement over current law. The Every Child \nAchieves Act maintains the critical transparency and high expectations \nfor all students that were the hallmarks of the No Child Left Behind \nAct. It does so while updating the parts of the law that have become \nunworkable and counterproductive, such as the overly prescriptive \napproach to school improvement and corrective action.\n  I am pleased the Every Child Achieves Act continues Federal support \nin key areas for building strong and successful schools, including \ninvestments in literacy and school library programs, for professional \ndevelopment to strengthen educator effectiveness, and family engagement \nin education. From the beginning, access\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nto effective school library programs was a critical part of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. The results from a recent \nNational Center for Education Statistics survey shows there are still \ngaps in access to school libraries.\n  Effective school library programs are essential supports for \neducational success. Multiple education and literacy studies have \nproduced clear evidence that school libraries staffed by qualified \nlibrarians have a positive impact on student achievement.\n  Now, Senator Cochran and I introduced the Strengthening Kids' \nInterest in Learning and Libraries--SKILLS--Act to ensure that school \nlibraries continue to be a part of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. The Every Child Achieves Act recognizes this need by \nincluding an authorization to provide funds to high-need school \ndistricts to support effective school library programs.\n  Soon we will be voting on an amendment that Senator Cochran and I are \noffering to further integrate school library programs into the core \nElementary and Secondary Education Act formula grant programs. I \nencourage all our colleagues to vote yes on this bipartisan amendment \nthat will support student learning.\n  I am also pleased that the Every Child Achieves Act recognizes the \nimportance of ensuring that disadvantaged children have access to books \nin their homes from a very early age. Literacy skills are the \nfoundation for success in school and in life. Developing and building \nthese skills begins at home, with parents as the first teachers.\n  Senator Grassley and I introduced the Prescribe A Book Act to help \naddress this issue, and the Every Child Achieves Act includes some key \nprovisions from this legislation.\n  We also know teachers and principals are two of the most important \nin-school factors related to school achievement. It is essential that \nteachers, principals, and other educators have a comprehensive system \nthat supports their professional growth and development starting on day \none and continuing throughout their careers.\n  Senator Casey and I introduced the Better Education Support and \nTraining Act to create such a system. Once again, I am extraordinarily \npleased that the Every Child Achieves Act includes many of the \nprovisions of that legislation, particularly the focus on equitable \naccess to experienced and effective educators.\n  I remain concerned, however, that the failure to define an \n``inexperienced teacher'' will mask inequities and will limit the \nusefulness of the reporting for parents and communities. I hope we can \nclarify this issue as we proceed forward.\n  Family engagement is another critical area this bill addresses. I \nhope we will be able to strengthen these provisions by increasing the \nresources that school districts dedicate to meaningful, evidence-based \nfamily engagement activities and by providing a statewide system of \ntechnical assistance that supports these efforts.\n  I have been working with Senators Coons and Bennet on amendments that \nmake these additions to the bill based on the Family Engagement and \nEducation Act that I introduced with Senators Coons and Whitehouse in \nthe past two Congresses.\n  Most fundamental to the question of whether we move closer to \nachieving our ideals for educational equity and excellence is \nresources. The grand bargain of the No Child Left Behind Act was \ngreater accountability coupled with greater resources. We have fallen \nshort on accountability for resources. The authorized level for title I \nfor fiscal year 2007 was $25 billion. That is in the No Child Left \nBehind Act. Today, we are nowhere near that level--at only $14.4 \nbillion.\n  We need to be just as concerned about opportunity gaps as we are \nabout achievement gaps, and that is why the first bill I introduced \nthis Congress was the Core Opportunity Resources for Equity and \nExcellence--CORE--Act to establish an accountability mechanism for \nresource equity. We must look to hold our educational system \naccountable for both results and for resources.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act includes some of what I proposed in the \nCORE Act by bringing some long-overdue transparency to resource equity, \nrequiring States to report on key measures of school quality beyond \nstudent achievement on statewide assessments, including student access \nto experienced and effective educators, access to rigorous and advanced \ncourse work, availability of career and technical educational \nopportunities, and safe and healthy school learning environments.\n  However, transparency alone is not enough. I am pleased to be working \nwith Senators Kirk, Baldwin, and Brown on the opportunity dashboard of \ncore resources amendment, which will add further provisions from the \nCORE Act; namely, some accountability for action on disparities in \naccess to critical educational resources.\n  With more than one in five school-aged children living in families in \npoverty and roughly half of our public school students eligible for \nfree or reduced-price lunches, we cannot afford nor should we tolerate \na public education system that fails to provide resources and \nopportunities for the children who need them the most.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Alexander and Senator Murray for bringing \nthis bill before us so thoughtfully, so carefully, and with so much \neffort and expertise, and their staffs also. I hope we can work \ntogether on this amendment to improve an already excellent bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I simply wish to acknowledge the \ncontributions of the Senator from Rhode Island. He may not officially \nbe on the committee, but he stays actively interested in all of the \neducation issues. He has made important contributions to the pending \nlegislation in support of libraries, and we are working with him on a \nnumber of matters, including risk sharing and higher education. So I \nthank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership and his \ncontinued interest in better schools and better colleges and \nuniversities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n       Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on S. 474, the \nProtecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act.\n  This is a bipartisan bill that Senator Joe Manchin and I introduced \nsome time ago. We have been working on this for a while now, and we \nintend to offer this legislation as an amendment to the pending \nlegislation, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  This is a commonsense bill, designed simply to protect children from \nchild molesters and predators--predators who infiltrate our schools \nbecause they know that is where the kids are.\n  The vast overwhelming majority of school employees, we all know, are \npeople who care very much about kids. It would never occur to them in a \nmillion years to do anything to harm the children in their care. But \nthe fact is there are pedophiles in our society--there are predators in \nour society--and they do in fact look to find opportunities where they \nwill find their prey. So we need protections against these people as \nthey try to infiltrate our schools. These are protections I have been \nfighting for, for some time now, and I am not going to stop until we \nget this done.\n  There are lots of reasons to have this fight. For me, as for so many \npeople, it is personal. I have three young children. They are 15, 13, \nand 5 years old. When I send my kids to school in the morning and watch \nmy children get on the schoolbus, I have every right to know I am \nsending my children somewhere where they can be safe, where they can be \ncared for, where they can be in the safest possible environment, and \nevery other parent deserves that too--every parent across Pennsylvania, \nevery parent across America.\n  Unfortunately, too many children and too many families have \ndiscovered this is not always the case. The horrific story which \nbrought my attention to this cause and my passion for this was the \nstory about a little boy named Jeremy Bell.\n  The story begins in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. One of the \nschoolteachers was molesting boys. He was a serial pedophile. He raped \na boy. The school officials discovered what was going on. They brought \nit to the attention of law enforcement, but law enforcement authorities \nnever had\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\nenough strong evidence to make a successful criminal case. The school \ndecided they would dismiss the teacher for sexually abusing students. \nBut, appallingly, the school also helped this teacher get a new job in \nWest Virginia, where he became a teacher, in part because he got a \nletter of recommendation from the school that knew he was preying on \ntheir students. But they wanted him to be someone else's problem, so \nthey gave him a letter of recommendation.\n  He went to a new school in a nearby State. Eventually, he became a \nprincipal. Along the way, of course, he continued his ways, culminating \nin the rape and murder of a 12-year-old boy named Jeremy Bell. Justice \ndid finally catch up with that monster. He is now in jail serving a \nlife sentence for the murder of Jeremy Bell, but for Jeremy Bell that \njustice came too late.\n  We would like to think this is a bizarre and isolated event that \ncould never happen again. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Last \nyear alone, there were 459 school employees arrested across America for \nsexual misconduct with the children they are supposed to be taking care \nof--459--and those were the ones where there was enough of a case that \nthe arrest was actually made. It is more than one per day. Twenty-six \nof them were in my State of Pennsylvania.\n  Sadly, we are halfway through 2015 now, and we are doing even worse. \nIn the first half of 2015, there have been 265 such arrests. We are on \npace to have well over 500 school employees across America arrested for \nsexual misconduct with the children they are supposed to be taking care \nof.\n  Every single one of these stories has a terrible tragedy at the \ncenter: a little girl whose sexual abuse began at age 10 and only ended \nwhen at 17 years old she found herself pregnant with the teacher's \nchild, a teacher's aide who raped a young, mentally disabled boy in his \ncare, a kindergarten teacher who kept a child in during recess, then \nforced her to perform sexual acts on him.\n  This is hard stuff to talk about, but that doesn't make it go away. I \nthink we need to confront it, and the cases are too many to ignore.\n  Senator Manchin and I decided it is time for Congress to act, to do \nsomething to make it more difficult for these predators to carry out \nthese appalling acts, so we introduced the Protecting Students Act. It \nhas two important goals, two protections, designed to prevent convicted \nsex offenders from infiltrating our country's schools. The first is a \nstandard background check process that will catch those who have been \nconvicted. The second feature in our legislation would end this \nterrible practice we saw in the Jeremy Bell case--the practice of a \nschool knowingly helping a child molester find employment in a new \nschool, a practice called passing the trash.\n  Now, both of these provisions, both of these ideas have very broad \nbipartisan support. The House of Representatives unanimously passed a \nbill including both protections last Congress, and just last fall \nCongress voted 523 to 1--both Houses combined voted unanimously, with \nonly one dissenting voice--for even more expansive background check \nlanguage enacted in the Child Care Development Block Grant that we all \nvoted for, 523 to 1.\n  In addition, Senator Manchin's and my legislation, the Protecting \nStudents Act, has been endorsed by numerous organizations in various \ncategories.\n  First, child protection groups: National Children's Alliance, which \noversees the Nation's Children's Advocacy Centers, the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, the Pennsylvania Coalition Against \nRape, the Children's Defense Fund, the Pennsylvania Partnerships for \nChildren. Law enforcement organizations overwhelmingly support our \nlegislation: the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association. Prosecutors support \nSenator Manchin's and my bill. The Association of Prosecuting Attorneys \nand the National District Attorneys Association have both endorsed the \nbill. The medical professionals at the American Academy of Pediatrics \nand the Pennsylvania School Board Association, they all have endorsed \nthis legislation, and they have said it has two essential features, two \nways in which we would be protecting our kids.\n  The first is the criminal background check. Let me be clear. Every \nState in the Union performs some kind of background check already. That \nis true. That is a fact. The problem is that many of them are woefully \ninadequate. For instance, several States fail to check all the school \nworkers. They check teachers, for instance, but not nonteachers, and \nothers will check certain criminal databases, but they won't check \nothers, and so they miss convictions.\n  Our legislation, Protecting Students Act, requires that if a school \nwants to accept Federal funds, it has to perform background checks on \nall adult workers who have unsupervised access to children. That would \nbe both new hires and existing employees.\n  Many States have only recently adopted background check policies. \nMany employees were hired before they put the background check policies \nin place, so many of these employees were never subject to a background \ncheck.\n  Consider the case of 64-year-old William Vahey, who taught for \ndecades across America and across the globe at some of the world's most \nelite schools. He would give his young students Oreo cookies laced with \nnarcotics. While the boys slept, the teacher molested them and \nphotographed them. Scores of children were sexually abused. This \nteacher had been convicted for sexual abuse of children in California \nwhen he was in his twenties, but he was hired before many States had \nbackground check requirements, and therefore he was grandfathered into \nthe system. The Protecting Students Act ensures that convicted sex \noffenders like William Vahey will be discovered and they will not be \nhired.\n  It also would include contractors. There are 12 States that don't \nrequire background checks for contractors at all. This fact recently \ngave Montana parents a rude awakening.\n  An audit of Montana's busdrivers found that 123 drivers had criminal \nhistories, including 1 driver whose conviction landed him on the Sexual \nand Violent Offender Registry and 1 with an outstanding arrest warrant.\n  Running checks is really only helpful if the checks are thorough \nenough to find all convictions. So our legislation would require the \nfour major databases to be checked: the FBI fingerprint check in the \nNational Crime Information Center database, the National Sex Offender \nRegistry, the State criminal registry, and State child abuse and \nneglect registries. These background check requirements constitute the \nfirst part of our bill. As I said, this was passed unanimously in the \nHouse. I wouldn't think this would be controversial.\n  The second part of our bill is equally important, and that is the \npart which precludes passing the trash. It addresses the terrible acts \nthat led to and made it possible for little Jeremy Bell to be raped and \nmurdered. What this provision says is that if a school wishes to \nreceive Federal funds, the school may not knowingly help a child \nmolester obtain a new teaching job. I would think this would not be \ncontroversial. The practice, as I alluded to before, has become so \ncommon, sadly, that it has its own moniker. It is called passing the \ntrash. It has become all too prevalent.\n\n  I see that the Senator from Tennessee would like to address the body.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Senator yield----\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I will.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. For the purpose of allowing me consent to take up \nseveral amendments, including Senator Toomey's amendment, which he has \nworked on so hard for a long period of time and he and I have \ndiscussed? This will take about 60 seconds, if he permits this.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4676]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Chair and the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I interrupted his remarks, but I thought it was \nimportant to make sure that the full Senate consented to an ability to \ndeal with an issue he has worked on for so long.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I am claiming my time. I want to thank \nSenator Alexander for the sincere effort we have been engaged in for \nsome time to find our common ground on this. I appreciate his \nconstructive efforts. I know they are continuing, and I hope we will be \nable to reach an agreement on this. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n       Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act\n\n  I was talking about the second part of our legislation. The first \npart is requiring background check standards that would actually work. \nThe second part is a provision that would forbid this terrible practice \nknown as passing the trash. When we hear the idea that a school, a \nprincipal, a superintendent or a school district would knowingly and \nwillfully recommend for hire a known predator, it strikes us as so \nmorally repulsive that we think this couldn't really seriously happen \nexcept in the most bizarre and unusual circumstances. I wish that were \nthe case. It is not the case. The fact is it happens.\n  Let me give you an example. In February, WUSA News 9 reported some \nreally shocking news on the public school system of Montgomery County, \nMaryland. Since 2011, 21 Montgomery County public school workers have \nbeen investigated for child sexual abuse or exploitation. The news \nstation learned that the Montgomery County school system ``keeps a \n`confidential database' of personnel who demonstrate `inappropriate or \nsuspicious behavior' toward children--a watch list of suspected abusers \nwho are working in area schools.''\n  WUSA 9 learned that the school system has a record of passing the \ntrash. For example, elementary school teacher Daniel Picca abused \nchildren for 17 years. The school system knew. What did they do? The \nteacher was punished. You know what his punishment was? It was to \nassign him to another school again and again--17 years of passing a \nknown child molester from one elementary school to another.\n  This is appalling. This has to stop. It has to stop now. The Federal \nGovernment can play a role in stopping it. Frankly, only the Federal \nGovernment can play a role because sometimes the passing the trash \noccurs across State lines, as in the case of Jeremy Bell.\n  Or, for example, more recently, a Las Vegas, NV, kindergarten teacher \nwas arrested for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and infecting her with a \nsexually transmitted disease. That same teacher had molested six \nchildren, all fourth and fifth graders, several years before while \nworking as a teacher in Los Angeles, CA. The Los Angeles school \ndistrict knew about these allegations. In fact, in 2009 the school \ndistrict recommended settling a lawsuit--a suit that alleged that the \nteacher had molested the children. The school district wanted to \nsettle.\n  When this teacher came across the State lines to Nevada to work, the \nNevada school district specifically asked if there had been any \ncriminal concerns regarding the teacher. The Los Angeles school direct \nnot only hid the truth, not only hid what they knew about this \nmolester, but it provided three references for the teacher.\n  For those folks who suggest that States can solve this problem on \ntheir own, I have a question: What in the world can Nevada do about the \nbehavior that is occurring in California? Since when can the laws of \none State reach into and be enforced in another State?\n  I know the answer. It can't. It doesn't work. The only way to deal \nwith this cross-border abuse, this horrendous abuse of kids, is with \nFederal legislation.\n  The Toomey-Manchin bill that we are going to be offering as an \namendment to this underlying legislation has a simple proposition: If a \nschool district wants to take Federal tax dollars, it can't use that \nmoney to hire convicted sexual offenders of kids.\n  Is that really unreasonable? Is that really too much to ask? To \naccomplish that, the school district has to perform a criminal \nbackground check on those workers who have unsupervised access to \nchildren. The school district must prevent passing the trash. That has \nto be illegal. It has to be illegal to knowingly and willfully \nrecommend for hire a pedophile who is molesting children. There is no \none who can stand here and tell me these protections against child \nsexual predators are not urgently needed--not when more than one person \nis being arrested every day across America for committing sexual crimes \nagainst children and the rate at which these people are being arrested \nis accelerating.\n  What is more urgent than that? The Protecting Students Act has \noverwhelming bipartisan support. As I said earlier, the House passed \nthis legislation unanimously last Congress--unanimously. How many \nthings can pass the House unanimously? This did. The entire Congress, \nthe House and Senate together, adopted that virtually identical \nbackground check requirements be imposed for kids at daycares, younger \nchildren, by a vote of 523 to 1.\n  We have already vetted this. We have already been down this road. \nThis body and the House have expressed their support for this. I would \nremind my colleagues that the Protecting Students Act has been endorsed \nby many, many groups. I rattled off several of them: Child protection \ngroups, law enforcement groups, prosecutors, the medical professionals \nat the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Pennsylvania School \nBoard Association. The Toomey-Manchin proposal is the only proposal \nthat is endorsed by these groups.\n  We know there are going to be alternatives. There are going to be \nside-by-sides. Those alternatives do not have the endorsements of these \norganizations, for reasons that we may need to elaborate on later.\n  Finally, there are 459 arrests--more than one a day. Every single one \nof those represents a tragedy--a childhood that has been shattered, a \nfamily that has been torn by grief, by self-blame, by betrayal. The \nnumbers aren't staying the same. The numbers are growing. The problem \nis getting worse.\n  How many more arrests do we need before the Senate decides that it is \ntime that we do our part to protect these kids? Children of America \nhave waited long enough, and I say no more waiting--no more passing \nchild molesters into new schools so they can find new victims, no more \ndefenseless children such as Jeremy Bell falling victim to a known \nchild predator, no more excuses for not enacting a bill that the House \nof Representatives has passed unanimously over a year ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Protecting Students from Sexual \nand Violent Predators Act and to vote aye when I offer it as an \namendment this week.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2094 to Amendment No. 2089\n\n  Madam President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment in order to \ncall up amendment No. 2094.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Toomey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2094 to amendment No. 2089.\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect our children from convicted pedophiles, child \n molesters, and other sex offenders infiltrating our schools and from \nschools ``passing the trash''--helping pedophiles obtain jobs at other \n                                schools)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                   Nomination of Kara Farnandez Stoll\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, we are finally, finally going to \nvote on the nomination of Kara Farnandez Stoll to serve as a judge on \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. She is \nsuperbly qualified, and once confirmed, she will be the first woman of \ncolor to serve on the Federal Circuit.\n  She has the strong endorsement of the non-partisan Hispanic National \nBar Association as well as from the Federal Circuit Bar Association, \nand the American Intellectual Property Law Association. In its letter \nof support to the Judiciary Committee, the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, HNBA, wrote that their due diligence has confirmed that \nMs. Farnandez Stoll ``maintains the highest ethical and professional \nstandards. She is also competent and hardworking. Her litigation \nexperience, commitment to public service, and temperament make her an \nideal candidate for a court appointment.'' I could not agree more. So \nwhy did it take so long for the Republican leadership to schedule a \nconfirmation vote for this uncontroversial, highly qualified, and \nhistoric nominee?\n  The President nominated Ms. Farnandez Stoll last year--nearly 8 \nmonths ago. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported her \nnomination to the full Senate more than 2 months ago. There is no good \nreason why her confirmation vote has been stalled over and over again.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican majority's treatment of Ms. Farnandez \nStoll's nomination is more pattern than aberration. Six months into \nthis new Republican-led Congress that was supposed to move forward on \nthings and the Senate has only confirmed a handful of judges. In fact, \nit has been more than 6 weeks since a vote was even scheduled by the \nmajority leader for a single judicial nominee. This glacial pace of \nconfirmations is a dereliction of the Senate's constitutional duty to \nprovide advice and consent on judicial nominees. Many are concerned \nthat such treatment threatens the functioning of our independent \njudiciary.\n  We have 11 other consensus judicial nominations pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar in addition to Ms. Farnandez Stoll. No one can \ncredibly claim that the majority's slow pace in scheduling confirmation \nvotes is due to a lack of nominees. This group includes another nominee \nwho has received the strong support of the HNBA--Armando Bonilla--one \nof five pending nominees to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, CFC. Like \nMs. Farnandez Stoll, Mr. Bonilla's confirmation will be an historic \nmilestone--when confirmed he will be the first Hispanic judge to hold a \nseat on the CFC.\n  In less than 48 hours, the Judiciary Committee is expected to report \nout another HNBA-endorsed nominee, Luis Felipe Restrepo, who will fill \na judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit. Judge Restrepo was unanimously confirmed 2 years ago by the \nSenate to serve as a district court judge in Pennsylvania. I have heard \nno objection to his nomination, yet it took 7 months just to get him a \nhearing. Once confirmed, Judge Restrepo will be the first Hispanic \njudge from Pennsylvania to ever serve on this court and only the second \nHispanic judge to serve on the Third Circuit.\n  If Senate Republicans had an issue with any of the pending nominees \nor if they sought time to debate them on the floor, some of the delay \nmight be understandable. But no Senator has spoken in opposition to any \nof the pending nominees. In fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nreported all 11 of them by voice vote. Instead of receiving timely \nconsideration of their nominations, however, these uncontroversial \nnominees have not been treated fairly by the Senate majority.\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\n  There is a different way to lead. In the last 2 years of George W. \nBush's term, Democrats came into the majority. Some thought we would \nslow up his judges. We did not. I served as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee during those last 2 years of President George W. Bush's \nadministration and we confirmed 68 district and circuit court judges \nduring that time. In fact, by this time in the seventh year of the Bush \nadministration, the Democratically controlled Senate had confirmed 21 \njudges--including 18 district and 3 circuit court judges. Compare that \nto this seventh year of the Obama administration under Republican \ncontrol, in which the Senate has thus far confirmed just four district \ncourt judges this year. Just four. Now this is outrageous. It hurts. It \npoliticizes the Federal bench. It hurts the rules of law in this \ncountry.\n  So under a Democratic majority with a Republican President, we \nconfirmed five times more judges than the Senate Republican majority \nhas allowed under their control of the Senate for a Democratic \nPresident. The disparity of treatment is clear, and it is wrong. \nIncidentally, that is the same way we did it when Democrats took over \ncontrol of the Senate during the last 2 years of President Reagan's \nterm. We moved judges at a much faster pace than anything Republicans \nhave allowed us to do under President Obama. This is wrong. This is \npetty partisanship that hurts our independent judiciary. We are not \nasking for anything special but we are saying it would be nice if \nRepublicans treated Democrats the same way we treated them.\n  We should also not forget the rising number of judicial vacancies in \nour Federal courts. At the start of this Congress, there were 44 \nvacancies, including 12 vacancies deemed ``judicial emergencies'' by \nthe nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. That number \nhas climbed to 63 vacancies, including 27 ``judicial emergency'' \nvacancies on our district and circuit courts. The vast majority of \nthese vacancies are concentrated in States with at least one Republican \nhome State Senator. Of particularly concern are four circuit court \n``judicial emergency'' vacancies: two in Texas, one in Alabama, and one \nin Kentucky. Each vacancy has been left open for well over a year, \nincluding one in Texas that has remained vacant for almost 3 years.\n  All Senators know that it is our constitutional duty to provide \nadvice and consent on judicial nominees. When it comes to filling \nvacancies on the Federal courts in our State, we have unique insight \ninto our States' legal communities to share with the President before \nhe makes a nomination. Americans expect us to do our jobs and in the \nSenate that includes ensuring their access to the Federal courts. I \nurge all Senators to work with the President to fill the growing number \nof judicial vacancies in their States.\n  We will at least make some small progress today as we finally take up \nMs. Farnandez Stoll's nomination. Her extensive experience on issues \nthat come before the Federal Circuit will serve the court well. She is \ncurrently a partner at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett and \nDunner, a law firm specializing in intellectual property law. Ms. \nFarnandez Stoll also teaches as an adjunct professor at George Mason \nUniversity Law School. Before practicing law, Ms. Farnandez Stoll was a \npatent examiner in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Ms. Farnandez \nStoll received her B.S. in electrical engineering from Michigan State \nUniversity in 1991 and her J.D. from Georgetown University Law School \nin 1997. Upon graduating from law school, she served as a law clerk to \nFederal Circuit Judge Alvin Schall. I trust that her background and the \nreputation she has earned in the legal community will serve her well as \nshe begins this new chapter.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  S4678, July 7, 2015, in the middle column, the following \nlanguage appears: . . . law, Ms. Fernandez Stoll wa . . .\n  \n  Record has been corrected to read: . . . law, Ms. Farnandez \nStoll was . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I congratulate Ms. Farnandez Stoll on what I expect will be her \nsuccessful, albeit long overdue, confirmation.

The role of the Federal Government \nshould be to promote policies that will improve the ability of \nindividual States to meet the needs of their specific communities. To \nthat end, I have worked with my colleagues, Senator King and Senator \nTester, to offer an amendment promoting local governance in education.\n  The purpose of this bipartisan amendment is simple: to ensure that \nour local school districts are not coerced into adopting misguided \neducation requirements.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the bipartisan \nEvery Child Achieves Act. This bill is landmark legislation that would \nreform and reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also \nknown as No Child Left Behind. This bill would improve our schools and \nstrengthen the traditional roles played by our local communities, our \neducators, and our States.\n  I am proud to have joined every member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee in voting to report this bill \nand I applaud the chairman, Senator Alexander, and the ranking member, \nSenator Murray, for their leadership.\n  Congressional action to remedy the serious problems with the law No \nChild Left Behind, while preserving its valuable parts, is long \noverdue. NCLB was a well-intentioned law, and its focus on the \neducation of every child, greater transparency in school performance, \nand more accountability for results were welcome reforms. But some of \nits provisions were simply not achievable and thus discouraging to \nteachers, to parents, and to students alike.\n  The current system of unattainable standards and a patchwork of State \nwaivers has led to confusion about Federal requirements. High-stakes \ntesting and unrealistic 100-percent proficiency goals do not raise \naspirations; they instead dispirit those who are committed to a high-\nquality education for our students. Responding to those concerns in \n2004, along with then-Senator Olympia Snowe, I established the Maine \nNCLB Task Force to examine the issues facing Maine and to provide \nrecommendations for changes to No Child Left Behind.\n  Our task force brought together individuals with a great deal of \nexpertise, experience, and perspective on the law and on educational \npolicy in general. The task force included teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents, school board members, parents, and State officials. It \nwas cochaired by Leo Martin, a former commissioner of the Maine \nDepartment of Education, and Anne Pooler, a former professor and then-\nassociate dean at the College of Education at the University of Maine. \nThe task force completed its work in 2005.\n  Well, our Maine NCLB task force proved to be prescient in identifying \nthe problems with implementing No Child Left Behind, and 10 years later \nits report is as relevant as ever.\n  Chief among the task force's final recommendations was the need for \ngreater flexibility for the State department of education and for local \nschool boards. The members pointed out that the principles of improved \nstudent performance and closing achievement gaps were completely \ncompatible with according States more flexibility to design different \naccountability systems.\n  Reflecting that recommendation, the bill before us, the Every Child \nAchieves Act, would remove the high-stakes accountability system that \nhas been proven unworkable under No Child Left Behind. Our bill would \ngive States much-needed flexibility over how to improve the \naccountability of schools for student achievement. Recognizing also the \ncritical importance of family engagement in education, the bill \nsupports school districts in conducting parent outreach and \nparticipation activities.\n  The Every Child Achieves Act would also eliminate the burdensome \ndefinition of a ``highly qualified teacher'' which has proven to be \nunworkable in Maine's small, rural schools. In such schools, the \nreality is that teachers must often teach multiple subjects and are \nreassigned to different content areas because of low enrollment.\n  For example, on Maine's North Haven Island, there is one school that \nserves all students from kindergarten through the 12th grade. With \nfewer than 70 students, North Haven Community School is one of the \nsmallest K-through-12 schools in my State. It is not surprising that \nthe educators at the North Haven Community School teach multiple \nsubject areas across the different grades because of the school's size.\n  Speaking of smaller schools, I am particularly pleased that the Every \nChild Achieves Act would extend the Rural Education Achievement \nProgram, known as REAP, which I coauthored with former Senator Kent \nConrad in 2002. Students in rural America should have the same access \nto Federal grant dollars as those who attend schools in large urban and \nsuburban communities. Most Federal competitive grant programs, however, \nfavor larger school districts because those are the districts that have \nthe ability to hire grant writers to apply for these grants. If you are \nin a school district such as North Haven, which only has 70 students \nfor all the grades, you don't have the luxury of extra funds to hire \ngrant writers to apply for these competitive grant programs.\n\n  What REAP does is provides financial assistance to small and high-\npoverty rural districts to help them address their unique local needs \nand also to meet Federal requirements. This program has helped to \nsupport new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, \nprofessional development for educators, as well as an array of other \nprograms that benefit students and teachers in rural districts. Since \nthe law was enacted, at least 120 Maine school districts have \ncollectively received more than $42 million from the Rural Education \nAchievement Program. That is money which has made a real difference to \nthese small, rural, high-poverty districts, and it is Federal funds \nthat they would never have been able to successfully compete for when \nthey were applying against large, urban school districts.\n  Maine's educators are working hard to develop high-quality \nassessments that better track student performance and growth. I am \npleased that the Every Child Achieves Act includes a pilot program to \nsupport States that are designing alternative assessment systems based \non student proficiency, not just traditional standardized tests. Such \nsystems often give teachers, parents, and students a fuller \nunderstanding of each student's abilities and better prepare them for \ncollege or the career path they choose. The Federal Government should \ncooperate with States and school districts that are designing new \nassessment systems, and this pilot program is an important step in the \nright direction.\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n  During the committee's consideration of this bill, I offered an \namendment with Senator Sanders to allow more States to participate in \nthe innovative assessment program and to give participating school \ndistricts more time to scale up their systems statewide. Our amendment \npassed unanimously in committee, and I thank Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Member Murray for continuing to work with me to refine and \nimprove this pilot program.\n  The bottom line is that Washington should not be imposing a top-down, \none-size-fits-all approach to assessment. What works in Chicago may not \nbe the answer for Turner, ME, which was named a Blue Ribbon School last \nyear. Assessing the progress of our students is critical, but there are \nmany effective ways to determine students' level of learning.\n  Fifty years ago and alongside significant civil rights legislation, \nCongress first passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to \nimprove access to education, particularly for the students from low-\nincome families. Providing a good education for every child must remain \na national priority so that each child reaches his or her full \npotential, has a wide range of opportunities, and can compete in an \nincreasingly global economy. The Every Child Achieves Act honors those \nguiding principles while returning greater control and flexibility to \nour States, to local school boards, and to educators.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee \nfor their work in crafting this bipartisan bill. I look forward to the \ndebate on it in the week to come, and I urge my colleagues to support \nits passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/senate-section/article/S4679-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4679-S4680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EVERY CHILD ACHIEVES ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

With \nfewer than 70 students, North Haven Community School is one of the \nsmallest K-through-12 schools in my State. It is not surprising that \nthe educators at the North Haven Community School teach multiple \nsubject areas across the different grades because of the school's size.\n  Speaking of smaller schools, I am particularly pleased that the Every \nChild Achieves Act would extend the Rural Education Achievement \nProgram, known as REAP, which I coauthored with former Senator Kent \nConrad in 2002. Students in rural America should have the same access \nto Federal grant dollars as those who attend schools in large urban and \nsuburban communities. Most Federal competitive grant programs, however, \nfavor larger school districts because those are the districts that have \nthe ability to hire grant writers to apply for these grants. If you are \nin a school district such as North Haven, which only has 70 students \nfor all the grades, you don't have the luxury of extra funds to hire \ngrant writers to apply for these competitive grant programs.\n\n  What REAP does is provides financial assistance to small and high-\npoverty rural districts to help them address their unique local needs \nand also to meet Federal requirements. This program has helped to \nsupport new technology in classrooms, distance learning opportunities, \nprofessional development for educators, as well as an array of other \nprograms that benefit students and teachers in rural districts. Since \nthe law was enacted, at least 120 Maine school districts have \ncollectively received more than $42 million from the Rural Education \nAchievement Program. That is money which has made a real difference to \nthese small, rural, high-poverty districts, and it is Federal funds \nthat they would never have been able to successfully compete for when \nthey were applying against large, urban school districts.\n  Maine's educators are working hard to develop high-quality \nassessments that better track student performance and growth. I am \npleased that the Every Child Achieves Act includes a pilot program to \nsupport States that are designing alternative assessment systems based \non student proficiency, not just traditional standardized tests. Such \nsystems often give teachers, parents, and students a fuller \nunderstanding of each student's abilities and better prepare them for \ncollege or the career path they choose. The Federal Government should \ncooperate with States and school districts that are designing new \nassessment systems, and this pilot program is an important step in the \nright direction.\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\n  During the committee's consideration of this bill, I offered an \namendment with Senator Sanders to allow more States to participate in \nthe innovative assessment program and to give participating school \ndistricts more time to scale up their systems statewide. Our amendment \npassed unanimously in committee, and I thank Chairman Alexander and \nRanking Member Murray for continuing to work with me to refine and \nimprove this pilot program.\n  The bottom line is that Washington should not be imposing a top-down, \none-size-fits-all approach to assessment. What works in Chicago may not \nbe the answer for Turner, ME, which was named a Blue Ribbon School last \nyear. Assessing the progress of our students is critical, but there are \nmany effective ways to determine students' level of learning.\n  Fifty years ago and alongside significant civil rights legislation, \nCongress first passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to \nimprove access to education, particularly for the students from low-\nincome families. Providing a good education for every child must remain \na national priority so that each child reaches his or her full \npotential, has a wide range of opportunities, and can compete in an \nincreasingly global economy. The Every Child Achieves Act honors those \nguiding principles while returning greater control and flexibility to \nour States, to local school boards, and to educators.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the committee \nfor their work in crafting this bipartisan bill. I look forward to the \ndebate on it in the week to come, and I urge my colleagues to support \nits passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S4680-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING ELDER BOYD K.

Packer was both a man of principle and a man who knew the \npower of principles. He taught that talking about principles and \ndoctrines changes behavior far better than talking about behavior \nchanges behavior. He boldly stood as a ``watchman on the tower,'' \nproclaiming the principles that lead to faithful families, strong \ncommunities, and ultimately better nations.\n  Trained as an educator, Elder Packer was truly a teacher first, last, \nand always. Whether interacting with an individual, speaking in front \nof thousands, writing one of his many insightful books, or simply \nspending time with one of his beloved children, he was forever \nteaching. And to be clear, he wasn't preaching; he was teaching--\nteaching principles that would instruct, inspire, and improve all who \ncame within the sound of his distinct and powerful voice.\n  Boyd K. Packer understood the important influence of simple stories \nin teaching. He masterfully wove priceless principles into powerful \nmodern-day parables, keen observations from everyday living, and \nspiritual lessons that were meaningful and memorable. Experiences such \nas tuning an old radio, getting his boys to stop wrestling in the \nliving room, visiting a small church in Denmark, carving and painting \nbirds, learning about crocodiles in Africa, or observing the pleadings \nfor help from an orphan boy while serving as a serviceman in Japan, all \nemerged as foundational stories from which to teach life-changing \nprinciples.\n  Faith and family were always at the center of Elder Packer's \nteaching, and he often illustrated that the intersection of faith and \nfamily is where critical lessons are taught. He illustrated that this \nintersection between faith and family is precisely where critical \nlessons are taught and learned and where children are prepared to live \nnobly and serve selflessly.\n  In describing how to prepare children for the challenges of life, he \nthought that children should be provided with a shield of faith and \nthat forming that shield of faith was of necessity a cottage industry. \nIn his own words:\n\n       We can teach about the materials from which a shield of \n     faith is made: reverence, courage, repentance, forgiveness, \n     compassion. . . . We can learn how to assemble and fit them \n     together in many places. But the actual making of and fitting \n     on of the shield of faith belongs in the family circle. \n     Otherwise it may loosen and come off in a crisis.\n\n  As a ``watchman on the tower,'' Boyd K. Packer was perpetually ahead \nof his time. He could see around difficult societal corners and had a \nclear view of the blessings and benefits that flow from principled \nliving. What some may have interpreted as a stern and serious speaking \nstyle was simply Elder Packer teaching out of both love and urgency \nbecause he could see and he could sense what was on the horizon.\n  It has been said that the ability to see ahead is both a blessing and \na tremendous burden. It is a blessing because you can prepare, and it \nis a burden because often the people you are trying to help can't see \nwhat you can see.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Aaron Goldberg, \nJeffrey Potash and the greater Ohavi Zedek community for their tireless \nefforts in relocating a treasured artifact in our State's Jewish \ncommunity. For nearly two decades, the historically significant Shul \nMural--a 105-year-old rare mural--has sat hidden behind the walls of \nChai Adam Synagogue in Burlington's north end district. In May, after \nyears of careful restoration and planning, the mural was safely moved \nto its new home, where it will finally be displayed to honor a \nprominent period in our State's Jewish history.\n  Burlington's Jewish history dates back to the mid-1880s, when a large \ninflux of Lithuanian Jews traveled from Eastern Europe to settle in \nVermont. Ohavi Zedek Synagogue was established in 1885 by the \nLithuanians, and has since remained a thriving community stronghold for \nBurlington's Jewish population. In 1889, the Chai Adam Synagogue was \ncreated by a group of Orthodox Jews previously aligned with Ohavi \nZedek. It is here the Shul Mural was created.\n  Stretching floor-to-ceiling, the Shul Mural depicts two lions and the \nTen Commandments, two iconic symbols in the Jewish faith. The Shul \nMural, painted by Ben Zion Black, uses a rare artistic style, one that \ndates back to before World War II and was prevalent in wooden \nsynagogues across Eastern Europe. At that time, vast murals of iconic, \nhand-painted images sprawled entire walls and ceilings to capture the \nimagery held in Jewish Torah readings. The Shul Mural presents a rare \nfolk design mixed with modern painting techniques, yet little is \nactually known about its genre, as most of these works were sadly \ndestroyed during the Holocaust.\n  In 1939, Ohavi Zedek and Chai Adam rejoined, and the old Chai Adam \nwas sold and used as retail space and later a rug store. It was here \nthat Adam Goldberg, a volunteer and historian of Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, \ndiscovered the mural. Through the years, the Shul Mural sat uncovered \nand ill-preserved, until 1986 when the space was renovated to an \napartment complex, and Mr. Goldberg along with Ohavi Zedek archivist, \nJeffrey Potash, pleaded with the new owner to cover the mural with a \nfalse wall so that it would not bear further decay.\n  Over two decades later, when the apartment building was again sold in \n2012, its new owner, Steven Offenhartz, agreed to donate the mural to \nOhavi Zedek. The false wall that had covered the Shul Mural for more \nthan 20 years was lifted, and the construction team worked with \nConstance Silver, a conservator from Brattleboro, to stabilize and \nrecover what was lost. At that point, decades of deterioration had \ntaken their toll, and the once vibrant paint began to dull and flake \naway. Piece by piece, Constance reinforced and restored the painting.\n  On May 6, 2015, after decades in hiding, the mural was successfully \ntransported to Ohavi Zedek where it will be cleaned and further \nrestored. The hard work and dedication of the entire team with the \nsupport of Burlington's community--which raised over $400,000 to \nsupport the restoration and transportation of this historic piece of \nart--made this incredible feat possible.\n  Adam Goldberg, Jeffrey Potash, Steven Offenhartz, Constance Silver, \nand the many other members of the Ohavi Zedek and greater Burlington \ncommunity should be congratulated for their support and dedication to \nprotecting and restoring one of our State's most significant treasures. \nThis important piece of Burlington's Jewish history will finally be on \nproper display for all to enjoy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that an article on the Shul Mural from \nthe Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 14, 2015]\n\n                  ``Lost'' Jewish Mural Finds New Home\n\n               (By Zach Despart, Free Press Staff Writer)\n\n       When the project was done, it might have appeared to \n     onlookers that a construction crew had no difficulty moving \n     the Lost Shul Mural to a new home in the Old North End.\n       After all, the construction crew only had to remove the \n     roof of a Hyde Street building, lift via crane a brittle, \n     multi-panel, 105-year-old rare piece of art, place the mural \n     on a flatbed truck, drive it nearly half a mile uphill and, \n     with the strength of many workers, push the artwork, on \n     rollers, into Ohavi Zedek Synagogue.\n       All in a day's work for a volunteer group of local \n     residents, who for almost three decades have been trying to \n     find a way to move the historic artifact from a hidden alcove \n     on Hyde Street to more suitable location.\n       ``I had hoped to someday move the mural, but it's been over \n     29 years we've been waiting for this time,'' Ohavi Zedek \n     archivist Aaron Goldberg said Wednesday. ``It's a remarkable \n     achievement for the community to have this here.''\n       The story of the lost work begins in 1910, when \n     Burlington's Jewish community commissioned Lithuanian artist \n     Ben Zion to paint a mural within the Chai Adam synagogue, \n     which was built on Hyde Street in 1889. The floor-to-ceiling \n     mural contains three panels that depict Jewish iconography, \n     including two lions and the Ten Commandments.\n       In 1939, Chai Adam merged with Ohavi Zedek and vacated the \n     Hyde Street building.\n       Congregants, in an effort to preserve the mural, hid the \n     piece behind a false wall. The ownership of the building \n     changed hands several times in the following decades, and a \n     private owner in 1986 converted the building into apartments.\n       That year, Goldberg and other archivists persuaded the \n     owner to wall off the mural permanently with Sheetrock, so \n     the art would be safe for a later move. Many tenants over the \n     next two decades never knew the mural was there.\n       But Burlington's Jewish community never forgot about the \n     lost mural. In 2012, some 26 years since the mural \n     disappeared from public view, the archivists of Ohavi Zedek \n     worked with the owner of the building to uncover the artwork.\n       They decided to move the artifact to Ohavi Zedek and \n     proudly display the mural in the lobby. For the next three \n     years, a dedicated group of congregants developed a plan for \n     the big move, and raised more than $400,000.\n       ``This is a very innovative job,'' Goldberg said. ``This \n     took two and a half years of planning.''\n\n\n                              The big move\n\n       The moment Goldberg for decades had waited for arrived \n     Wednesday. Shortly after 8 a.m. on the warm, calm morning, \n     crews used a crane to lift off a pre-cut section of the roof \n     of the synagogue-turned-apartment-building on Hyde Street, \n     exposing the old cupola that held the mural.\n       The mural itself was not visible to onlookers. For \n     protection, it was encased in cushioning made of Chinese silk \n     and other materials. Bob Neeld, the structural engineer, said \n     this project required special attention to minimize any \n     vibrations that could damage the mural.\n       ``Even a three-story building can be built to handle \n     several inches of movement,'' Neeld said. For this move, \n     Neeld added, the crew was hoping to limit movement ``to a \n     couple thousandths of an inch.''\n       The mural itself is made of less than half an inch of \n     plaster on a wood lathe. To stabilize the century-old \n     material before the move, crews reinforced the artwork with \n     mortar.\n       After the roof was off, the crane lifted the fragile mural, \n     encased in a specially built steel frame, from the second \n     floor of the structure and placed the artifact onto a flatbed \n     truck. The mural and frame stood about feet tall and 15 feet \n     wide, and weighed about 6,500 pounds.\n       Next came a slow parade through the Old North End, as the \n     truck crept north on Hyde Street, east on Archibald Street \n     and south on North Prospect Street, onto the lawn of Ohavi \n     Zedek.

Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Aaron Goldberg, \nJeffrey Potash and the greater Ohavi Zedek community for their tireless \nefforts in relocating a treasured artifact in our State's Jewish \ncommunity. For nearly two decades, the historically significant Shul \nMural--a 105-year-old rare mural--has sat hidden behind the walls of \nChai Adam Synagogue in Burlington's north end district. In May, after \nyears of careful restoration and planning, the mural was safely moved \nto its new home, where it will finally be displayed to honor a \nprominent period in our State's Jewish history.\n  Burlington's Jewish history dates back to the mid-1880s, when a large \ninflux of Lithuanian Jews traveled from Eastern Europe to settle in \nVermont. Ohavi Zedek Synagogue was established in 1885 by the \nLithuanians, and has since remained a thriving community stronghold for \nBurlington's Jewish population. In 1889, the Chai Adam Synagogue was \ncreated by a group of Orthodox Jews previously aligned with Ohavi \nZedek. It is here the Shul Mural was created.\n  Stretching floor-to-ceiling, the Shul Mural depicts two lions and the \nTen Commandments, two iconic symbols in the Jewish faith. The Shul \nMural, painted by Ben Zion Black, uses a rare artistic style, one that \ndates back to before World War II and was prevalent in wooden \nsynagogues across Eastern Europe. At that time, vast murals of iconic, \nhand-painted images sprawled entire walls and ceilings to capture the \nimagery held in Jewish Torah readings. The Shul Mural presents a rare \nfolk design mixed with modern painting techniques, yet little is \nactually known about its genre, as most of these works were sadly \ndestroyed during the Holocaust.\n  In 1939, Ohavi Zedek and Chai Adam rejoined, and the old Chai Adam \nwas sold and used as retail space and later a rug store. It was here \nthat Adam Goldberg, a volunteer and historian of Ohavi Zedek Synagogue, \ndiscovered the mural. Through the years, the Shul Mural sat uncovered \nand ill-preserved, until 1986 when the space was renovated to an \napartment complex, and Mr. Goldberg along with Ohavi Zedek archivist, \nJeffrey Potash, pleaded with the new owner to cover the mural with a \nfalse wall so that it would not bear further decay.\n  Over two decades later, when the apartment building was again sold in \n2012, its new owner, Steven Offenhartz, agreed to donate the mural to \nOhavi Zedek. The false wall that had covered the Shul Mural for more \nthan 20 years was lifted, and the construction team worked with \nConstance Silver, a conservator from Brattleboro, to stabilize and \nrecover what was lost. At that point, decades of deterioration had \ntaken their toll, and the once vibrant paint began to dull and flake \naway. Piece by piece, Constance reinforced and restored the painting.\n  On May 6, 2015, after decades in hiding, the mural was successfully \ntransported to Ohavi Zedek where it will be cleaned and further \nrestored. The hard work and dedication of the entire team with the \nsupport of Burlington's community--which raised over $400,000 to \nsupport the restoration and transportation of this historic piece of \nart--made this incredible feat possible.\n  Adam Goldberg, Jeffrey Potash, Steven Offenhartz, Constance Silver, \nand the many other members of the Ohavi Zedek and greater Burlington \ncommunity should be congratulated for their support and dedication to \nprotecting and restoring one of our State's most significant treasures. \nThis important piece of Burlington's Jewish history will finally be on \nproper display for all to enjoy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that an article on the Shul Mural from \nthe Burlington Free Press be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 14, 2015]\n\n                  ``Lost'' Jewish Mural Finds New Home\n\n               (By Zach Despart, Free Press Staff Writer)\n\n       When the project was done, it might have appeared to \n     onlookers that a construction crew had no difficulty moving \n     the Lost Shul Mural to a new home in the Old North End.\n       After all, the construction crew only had to remove the \n     roof of a Hyde Street building, lift via crane a brittle, \n     multi-panel, 105-year-old rare piece of art, place the mural \n     on a flatbed truck, drive it nearly half a mile uphill and, \n     with the strength of many workers, push the artwork, on \n     rollers, into Ohavi Zedek Synagogue.\n       All in a day's work for a volunteer group of local \n     residents, who for almost three decades have been trying to \n     find a way to move the historic artifact from a hidden alcove \n     on Hyde Street to more suitable location.\n       ``I had hoped to someday move the mural, but it's been over \n     29 years we've been waiting for this time,'' Ohavi Zedek \n     archivist Aaron Goldberg said Wednesday. ``It's a remarkable \n     achievement for the community to have this here.''\n       The story of the lost work begins in 1910, when \n     Burlington's Jewish community commissioned Lithuanian artist \n     Ben Zion to paint a mural within the Chai Adam synagogue, \n     which was built on Hyde Street in 1889. The floor-to-ceiling \n     mural contains three panels that depict Jewish iconography, \n     including two lions and the Ten Commandments.\n       In 1939, Chai Adam merged with Ohavi Zedek and vacated the \n     Hyde Street building.\n       Congregants, in an effort to preserve the mural, hid the \n     piece behind a false wall. The ownership of the building \n     changed hands several times in the following decades, and a \n     private owner in 1986 converted the building into apartments.\n       That year, Goldberg and other archivists persuaded the \n     owner to wall off the mural permanently with Sheetrock, so \n     the art would be safe for a later move. Many tenants over the \n     next two decades never knew the mural was there.\n       But Burlington's Jewish community never forgot about the \n     lost mural. In 2012, some 26 years since the mural \n     disappeared from public view, the archivists of Ohavi Zedek \n     worked with the owner of the building to uncover the artwork.\n       They decided to move the artifact to Ohavi Zedek and \n     proudly display the mural in the lobby. For the next three \n     years, a dedicated group of congregants developed a plan for \n     the big move, and raised more than $400,000.\n       ``This is a very innovative job,'' Goldberg said. ``This \n     took two and a half years of planning.''\n\n\n                              The big move\n\n       The moment Goldberg for decades had waited for arrived \n     Wednesday. Shortly after 8 a.m. on the warm, calm morning, \n     crews used a crane to lift off a pre-cut section of the roof \n     of the synagogue-turned-apartment-building on Hyde Street, \n     exposing the old cupola that held the mural.\n       The mural itself was not visible to onlookers. For \n     protection, it was encased in cushioning made of Chinese silk \n     and other materials. Bob Neeld, the structural engineer, said \n     this project required special attention to minimize any \n     vibrations that could damage the mural.\n       ``Even a three-story building can be built to handle \n     several inches of movement,'' Neeld said. For this move, \n     Neeld added, the crew was hoping to limit movement ``to a \n     couple thousandths of an inch.''\n       The mural itself is made of less than half an inch of \n     plaster on a wood lathe. To stabilize the century-old \n     material before the move, crews reinforced the artwork with \n     mortar.\n       After the roof was off, the crane lifted the fragile mural, \n     encased in a specially built steel frame, from the second \n     floor of the structure and placed the artifact onto a flatbed \n     truck. The mural and frame stood about feet tall and 15 feet \n     wide, and weighed about 6,500 pounds.\n       Next came a slow parade through the Old North End, as the \n     truck crept north on Hyde Street, east on Archibald Street \n     and south on North Prospect Street, onto the lawn of Ohavi \n     Zedek. A crowd of congregants, many of them with cameras, \n     followed the informal procession. Burlington police blocked \n     the intersections along the way. Perplexed motorists \n     scratched their heads.\n       In front of the synagogue, another crane lifted the mural \n     onto a makeshift bed of rollers on a wooden ``landing pad.'' \n     Once there, about of dozen laborers pushed the 3-ton mural \n     through an opening into the lobby. Next week, crews will \n     hoist the mural above the lobby, where the art will hang for \n     visitors to see, much as it did on Hyde Street 105 years ago.\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\n       Organizers planned the move to take 12 hours, but it took \n     just three--a result engineers chalked up to good weather and \n     meticulous planning.\n\n\n                         Community significance\n\n       Thousands of European synagogues--and the ornate murals \n     within the places of worship--were destroyed by the Nazis \n     during the Holocaust.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor the \nmemory of a longtime journalist and true friend, Norman Runnion, who \npassed away in a Vermont hospital last month at the age of 85. Norm was \nmany things to many people, but as they say of those in the newspaper \nbusiness, he had ink coursing through his veins. Norm was born into a \nnews family and he loved to tell stories of his early days spent in \nnewsrooms, watching his father work the trade. But when tragedy struck \nhome--Norm's father was killed after falling under a train--the younger \nRunnion dedicated himself to the profession.\n  From his gritty beginnings working the night cop beat on Chicago's \nSouth Side, Norm worked his way up as a reporter and editor with United \nPress International, covering the biggest stories of the day, including \nthe Cuban Missile Crisis and the Warren Commission report. By the mid-\n1960s, Norm made the wise decision to ply his skills in Vermont and \nsettled in at the Brattleboro Reformer. He soon made his way to the \nmanaging editor post, where he earned deep respect from his community \nand his State over the next two decades. When newspapers lost a bit of \nluster for Norm, he turned to the seminary and became an Episcopal \npriest, further dedicating his life in public service.\n  In retelling the path of his colorful news career, Norm suggested \nthat fate led to his successes. ``I was really incredibly lucky,'' he \ntold a younger reporter who he once mentored. ``Everywhere I went was \none after another of the biggest news stories of the world. Those were \nthe most monumental news stories of my generation.''\n  I believe it was far more than luck that made Norm Runnion the talent \nthat he was. It was devotion to a trade that he believed was worthy of \nthat commitment. And his readers were incredibly lucky for that. I feel \nfortunate to have spoken with Norm shortly before his passing. Although \nweak, his spirit was still very much evident. In honor of that spirit, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a remembrance of \nNorm Runnion, which appeared on VTDigger.org.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From VTDigger.org, June 22, 2014]\n\n            Vermont Journalist Norman Runnion Dies at Age 85\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Ask Norman Runnion for his life story and he'd point to a \n     newspaper.\n       Take the old Kansas City Journal-Post, where he played as a \n     child while his father pounded on a manual typewriter.\n       Or the Evanston (Ill.) Review, where he broke into \n     journalism pasting up the sports page for $5 a week.\n       Or Vermont's Brattleboro Reformer and The Herald of \n     Randolph, where he capped a globetrotting career covering the \n     world for wire service desks in New York, London, Paris and \n     Washington, D.C.\n       ``I'm a newspaperman, my father was a newspaperman--I love \n     that word, I grew up on that word. It would never have \n     occurred to me to be anything else.''\n       ``I'm a newspaperman, my father was a newspaperman--I love \n     that word, I grew up on that word,'' he said in 1989. ``It \n     would never have occurred to me to be anything else.''\n       Except an Episcopal priest, which he tried for a decade at \n     midlife. But Runnion eventually returned to writing, which he \n     did until shortly before his death Friday at Randolph's \n     Gifford Medical Center at age 85.\n       When Newfane mystery novelist Archer Mayor wanted an \n     interesting character name for his 1993 book ``The Skeleton's \n     Knee,'' he borrowed Norm Runnion's. But fiction was no match \n     for the real man's feats.\n       The lifelong scribe made his own headlines as recently as \n     two years ago, when he wrote a widely circulated column \n     recalling his work as Washington night news editor for United \n     Press International when President John F. Kennedy was \n     assassinated Nov. 22, 1963.\n       ``For those of us who were around on that searing day in \n     American history, it could have been yesterday, not 50 years \n     ago,'' he recalled of an event for which UPI's coverage won a \n     Pulitzer Prize. ``I can hear today the haunting sounds of the \n     muffled drums as they passed below our windows, leading the \n     solemn procession past the thousands of people who jammed the \n     sidewalks to watch and mourn.''\n       Runnion went on to write the main story about the 888-page \n     Warren Commission report on the shooting.\n       ``The report was embargoed for a later release to give \n     journalists time to absorb the contents instead of rushing \n     out with the first available tidbits,'' he wrote. ``But the \n     stark principal finding was right there: Oswald, acting \n     alone, had murdered America's beloved president.''\n       Ask Runnion what sparked his interest in journalism and \n     he'd rewind back to his birth in Kansas City, Mo., in 1929. \n     His mother was a teacher; his father, like his grandfather, \n     was a newspaperman.\n       ``I grew up in a newsroom--quite literally,'' he told this \n     reporter in a 1989 interview.\n       For Runnion, home was wherever his father worked. At age \n     12, his family moved to St. Louis and the Star-Times; in \n     1941, it was Chicago and the Sun.\n       Life changed in 1945 when Runnion's father fell underneath \n     a commuter train and was killed. The next day, Runnion, then \n     a high school junior, enrolled in a journalism course. \n     Eventually receiving a degree from Northwestern University's \n     Medill School of Journalism in 1951, he worked ``four god-\n     awful months'' at the Chicago City News Bureau, servicing a \n     half-dozen metropolitan papers with crime reports.\n       ``I was covering the night police beat in the south side of \n     Chicago, which had the second highest crime rate in the world \n     outside of Singapore at that time,'' he recalled. ``Earned 25 \n     bucks a week for approximately an 80-hour week.''\n       Runnion went on to join United Press International, \n     reporting and editing in New York starting in 1953, in London \n     in 1955 (where he covered Winston Churchill), in Paris in \n     1957 (where he covered Charles de Gaulle) and in Washington, \n     D.C., in 1960.\n       ``Came in on the tail end of the '60 elections, spent the \n     next three years covering Kennedy, the civil rights movement, \n     covered Martin Luther King's march on Washington, got \n     assigned to cover the space program, covered Alan Shepard's \n     flight, covered John Glenn's flight,'' he recalled.\n       Runnion was also the lead writer of UPI's coverage of the \n     Cuban missile crisis.\n       ``I was really incredibly lucky,'' he said. ``Everywhere I \n     went was one after another of the biggest news stories of the \n     world. Those were the most monumental news stories of my \n     generation. What the hell more do you want?''\n       In 1966, Runnion decided he needed a break. Moving to \n     Vermont, he joined the Reformer in 1969 and became its \n     managing editor in 1971. Working in Windham County for two \n     decades, he both reported and made state news.\n       In 1983, for example, Runnion was the only journalist \n     invited to the wedding of then Vermont House Speaker Stephan \n     Morse--a ceremony presided over by then Gov. Richard \n     Snelling--with explicit instructions not to write a word.\n       If the bride and groom didn't suspect Runnion had other \n     thoughts when he arrived\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n     with a camera, they knew it when they picked up the Reformer \n     the next publication day and saw their nuptials splashed as \n     an exclusive atop the front page.\n       Runnion, deemed by one competitor ``chief curmudgeon of the \n     Vermont press corps,'' surprised readers in 1990 by leaving \n     the paper to attend Virginia Theological Seminary, work as a \n     seminarian assistant at the all-black St. Luke's Episcopal \n     Church in Washington, and serve as rector of St. Martin's \n     Episcopal Church in Fairlee.\n       Invited to address several New England press associations, \n     the new priest condemned the media for ``growing ineptness'' \n     he blamed on a loss of ethics and ``corporate obsession with \n     the bottom line.''\n       ``I don't think the First Amendment is a protective \n     umbrella for the kind of sin journalism we are seeing in our \n     culture today,'' he said at one event. ``I don't think \n     picturing violence for the sake of money is what Thomas \n     Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton had in mind. The fact is, \n     the public has a right not to know a lot of the junk that is \n     being tossed their way in the name of the `right to know.' ''\n       Runnion would retire from the church in 2001 and return to \n     journalism by writing for the weekly Herald of Randolph, near \n     his Brookfield home. His column on the 50th anniversary of \n     Kennedy's assassination was reprinted by the statewide news \n     website VTDigger.org, spurring a flurry of public comment.\n       ``Hey, Norm: Oswald did not do it,'' one reader posted.\n       ``Good point--I agree,'' Runnion replied. ``It was ET and \n     the aliens.''\n       Runnion will be remembered July 8 at a public service in \n     Randolph to be led by Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely, \n     with specifics to come from that town's Day Funeral Home. \n     (``He wrote a partial obituary and said, `You can fill in the \n     blanks,' '' his wife Linda said Monday.)

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor the \nmemory of a longtime journalist and true friend, Norman Runnion, who \npassed away in a Vermont hospital last month at the age of 85. Norm was \nmany things to many people, but as they say of those in the newspaper \nbusiness, he had ink coursing through his veins. Norm was born into a \nnews family and he loved to tell stories of his early days spent in \nnewsrooms, watching his father work the trade. But when tragedy struck \nhome--Norm's father was killed after falling under a train--the younger \nRunnion dedicated himself to the profession.\n  From his gritty beginnings working the night cop beat on Chicago's \nSouth Side, Norm worked his way up as a reporter and editor with United \nPress International, covering the biggest stories of the day, including \nthe Cuban Missile Crisis and the Warren Commission report. By the mid-\n1960s, Norm made the wise decision to ply his skills in Vermont and \nsettled in at the Brattleboro Reformer. He soon made his way to the \nmanaging editor post, where he earned deep respect from his community \nand his State over the next two decades. When newspapers lost a bit of \nluster for Norm, he turned to the seminary and became an Episcopal \npriest, further dedicating his life in public service.\n  In retelling the path of his colorful news career, Norm suggested \nthat fate led to his successes. ``I was really incredibly lucky,'' he \ntold a younger reporter who he once mentored. ``Everywhere I went was \none after another of the biggest news stories of the world. Those were \nthe most monumental news stories of my generation.''\n  I believe it was far more than luck that made Norm Runnion the talent \nthat he was. It was devotion to a trade that he believed was worthy of \nthat commitment. And his readers were incredibly lucky for that. I feel \nfortunate to have spoken with Norm shortly before his passing. Although \nweak, his spirit was still very much evident. In honor of that spirit, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a remembrance of \nNorm Runnion, which appeared on VTDigger.org.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From VTDigger.org, June 22, 2014]\n\n            Vermont Journalist Norman Runnion Dies at Age 85\n\n                          (By Kevin O'Connor)\n\n       Ask Norman Runnion for his life story and he'd point to a \n     newspaper.\n       Take the old Kansas City Journal-Post, where he played as a \n     child while his father pounded on a manual typewriter.\n       Or the Evanston (Ill.) Review, where he broke into \n     journalism pasting up the sports page for $5 a week.\n       Or Vermont's Brattleboro Reformer and The Herald of \n     Randolph, where he capped a globetrotting career covering the \n     world for wire service desks in New York, London, Paris and \n     Washington, D.C.\n       ``I'm a newspaperman, my father was a newspaperman--I love \n     that word, I grew up on that word. It would never have \n     occurred to me to be anything else.''\n       ``I'm a newspaperman, my father was a newspaperman--I love \n     that word, I grew up on that word,'' he said in 1989. ``It \n     would never have occurred to me to be anything else.''\n       Except an Episcopal priest, which he tried for a decade at \n     midlife. But Runnion eventually returned to writing, which he \n     did until shortly before his death Friday at Randolph's \n     Gifford Medical Center at age 85.\n       When Newfane mystery novelist Archer Mayor wanted an \n     interesting character name for his 1993 book ``The Skeleton's \n     Knee,'' he borrowed Norm Runnion's. But fiction was no match \n     for the real man's feats.\n       The lifelong scribe made his own headlines as recently as \n     two years ago, when he wrote a widely circulated column \n     recalling his work as Washington night news editor for United \n     Press International when President John F. Kennedy was \n     assassinated Nov. 22, 1963.\n       ``For those of us who were around on that searing day in \n     American history, it could have been yesterday, not 50 years \n     ago,'' he recalled of an event for which UPI's coverage won a \n     Pulitzer Prize. ``I can hear today the haunting sounds of the \n     muffled drums as they passed below our windows, leading the \n     solemn procession past the thousands of people who jammed the \n     sidewalks to watch and mourn.''\n       Runnion went on to write the main story about the 888-page \n     Warren Commission report on the shooting.\n       ``The report was embargoed for a later release to give \n     journalists time to absorb the contents instead of rushing \n     out with the first available tidbits,'' he wrote. ``But the \n     stark principal finding was right there: Oswald, acting \n     alone, had murdered America's beloved president.''\n       Ask Runnion what sparked his interest in journalism and \n     he'd rewind back to his birth in Kansas City, Mo., in 1929. \n     His mother was a teacher; his father, like his grandfather, \n     was a newspaperman.\n       ``I grew up in a newsroom--quite literally,'' he told this \n     reporter in a 1989 interview.\n       For Runnion, home was wherever his father worked. At age \n     12, his family moved to St. Louis and the Star-Times; in \n     1941, it was Chicago and the Sun.\n       Life changed in 1945 when Runnion's father fell underneath \n     a commuter train and was killed. The next day, Runnion, then \n     a high school junior, enrolled in a journalism course. \n     Eventually receiving a degree from Northwestern University's \n     Medill School of Journalism in 1951, he worked ``four god-\n     awful months'' at the Chicago City News Bureau, servicing a \n     half-dozen metropolitan papers with crime reports.\n       ``I was covering the night police beat in the south side of \n     Chicago, which had the second highest crime rate in the world \n     outside of Singapore at that time,'' he recalled. ``Earned 25 \n     bucks a week for approximately an 80-hour week.''\n       Runnion went on to join United Press International, \n     reporting and editing in New York starting in 1953, in London \n     in 1955 (where he covered Winston Churchill), in Paris in \n     1957 (where he covered Charles de Gaulle) and in Washington, \n     D.C., in 1960.\n       ``Came in on the tail end of the '60 elections, spent the \n     next three years covering Kennedy, the civil rights movement, \n     covered Martin Luther King's march on Washington, got \n     assigned to cover the space program, covered Alan Shepard's \n     flight, covered John Glenn's flight,'' he recalled.\n       Runnion was also the lead writer of UPI's coverage of the \n     Cuban missile crisis.\n       ``I was really incredibly lucky,'' he said. ``Everywhere I \n     went was one after another of the biggest news stories of the \n     world. Those were the most monumental news stories of my \n     generation. What the hell more do you want?''\n       In 1966, Runnion decided he needed a break. Moving to \n     Vermont, he joined the Reformer in 1969 and became its \n     managing editor in 1971. Working in Windham County for two \n     decades, he both reported and made state news.\n       In 1983, for example, Runnion was the only journalist \n     invited to the wedding of then Vermont House Speaker Stephan \n     Morse--a ceremony presided over by then Gov. Richard \n     Snelling--with explicit instructions not to write a word.\n       If the bride and groom didn't suspect Runnion had other \n     thoughts when he arrived\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n     with a camera, they knew it when they picked up the Reformer \n     the next publication day and saw their nuptials splashed as \n     an exclusive atop the front page.\n       Runnion, deemed by one competitor ``chief curmudgeon of the \n     Vermont press corps,'' surprised readers in 1990 by leaving \n     the paper to attend Virginia Theological Seminary, work as a \n     seminarian assistant at the all-black St. Luke's Episcopal \n     Church in Washington, and serve as rector of St. Martin's \n     Episcopal Church in Fairlee.\n       Invited to address several New England press associations, \n     the new priest condemned the media for ``growing ineptness'' \n     he blamed on a loss of ethics and ``corporate obsession with \n     the bottom line.''\n       ``I don't think the First Amendment is a protective \n     umbrella for the kind of sin journalism we are seeing in our \n     culture today,'' he said at one event. ``I don't think \n     picturing violence for the sake of money is what Thomas \n     Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton had in mind. The fact is, \n     the public has a right not to know a lot of the junk that is \n     being tossed their way in the name of the `right to know.' ''\n       Runnion would retire from the church in 2001 and return to \n     journalism by writing for the weekly Herald of Randolph, near \n     his Brookfield home. His column on the 50th anniversary of \n     Kennedy's assassination was reprinted by the statewide news \n     website VTDigger.org, spurring a flurry of public comment.\n       ``Hey, Norm: Oswald did not do it,'' one reader posted.\n       ``Good point--I agree,'' Runnion replied. ``It was ET and \n     the aliens.''\n       Runnion will be remembered July 8 at a public service in \n     Randolph to be led by Vermont Episcopal Bishop Thomas Ely, \n     with specifics to come from that town's Day Funeral Home. \n     (``He wrote a partial obituary and said, `You can fill in the \n     blanks,' '' his wife Linda said Monday.) He'll also live on \n     through nearly seven decades of his published work.\n       ``I personally witnessed much of this history and believe \n     what I saw over what people who were not there claimed \n     happened 20 or 30 or 50 years later,'' he recently posted to \n     Internet readers sharing conspiracy theories. ``But hey, it's \n     differences of opinion that make the world go around.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor Gary \nHollander of Milwaukee, WI, for 20 years of guiding Diverse & Resilient \nas its founder and CEO. I have known Gary for many years and have been \nproud to work with and support his efforts at Diverse & Resilient \nthroughout that time. Gary has been a leader in the mental health and \nLGBT communities, and his passion for serving people will be missed by \nall who have\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nworked with him and who have benefited from his guidance and passion.\n  A licensed psychologist, Gary received his degrees in education and \npsychology from the University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee. His \nprofessional career began in the Milwaukee Public Schools, where he was \na classroom teacher and school psychologist. He later served in the \neducation division at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and later as an \neducational consultant to Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \nGary developed an HIV mental health program and HIV clinic in \nconjunction with Aurora Health Care, a leading health care provider in \nWisconsin. He later directed their medical education programs and was \nthe founding administrator of the Center for Urban Population Health.\n  In 1995, Gary founded Diverse & Resilient as a way to build the \ncapacity of LGBT groups across Wisconsin, filling a void in the public \nhealth sphere. Gary recognized that public health organizations and \ncommunity groups were not rising to meet the needs of the LGBT \ncommunity, and he became the driving force behind greater community \nengagement and recognition of the LGBT community in Wisconsin. During \nhis tenure, Diverse & Resilient has expanded many times over and \ncurrently serves more than 5,000 LGBT people each year, helping them to \nthrive by living healthy, satisfying lives in safe, supportive \ncommunities.\n  His tireless work on behalf of Wisconsin's LGBT community has led to \ngreater understanding, improved access to care, and new ways of looking \nat the unique and divers needs of the LGBT community. Gary and his team \nhave focused their work in six priority areas: acceptance, cultivating \nleaders, mental health, sexual health, partner and community violence, \nand substance abuse--areas in which they hope to eliminate health \ndisparities between LGBT people and the general population.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor Gary \nHollander of Milwaukee, WI, for 20 years of guiding Diverse & Resilient \nas its founder and CEO. I have known Gary for many years and have been \nproud to work with and support his efforts at Diverse & Resilient \nthroughout that time. Gary has been a leader in the mental health and \nLGBT communities, and his passion for serving people will be missed by \nall who have\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\nworked with him and who have benefited from his guidance and passion.\n  A licensed psychologist, Gary received his degrees in education and \npsychology from the University of Wisconsin--Milwaukee. His \nprofessional career began in the Milwaukee Public Schools, where he was \na classroom teacher and school psychologist. He later served in the \neducation division at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and later as an \neducational consultant to Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \nGary developed an HIV mental health program and HIV clinic in \nconjunction with Aurora Health Care, a leading health care provider in \nWisconsin. He later directed their medical education programs and was \nthe founding administrator of the Center for Urban Population Health.\n  In 1995, Gary founded Diverse & Resilient as a way to build the \ncapacity of LGBT groups across Wisconsin, filling a void in the public \nhealth sphere. Gary recognized that public health organizations and \ncommunity groups were not rising to meet the needs of the LGBT \ncommunity, and he became the driving force behind greater community \nengagement and recognition of the LGBT community in Wisconsin. During \nhis tenure, Diverse & Resilient has expanded many times over and \ncurrently serves more than 5,000 LGBT people each year, helping them to \nthrive by living healthy, satisfying lives in safe, supportive \ncommunities.\n  His tireless work on behalf of Wisconsin's LGBT community has led to \ngreater understanding, improved access to care, and new ways of looking \nat the unique and divers needs of the LGBT community. Gary and his team \nhave focused their work in six priority areas: acceptance, cultivating \nleaders, mental health, sexual health, partner and community violence, \nand substance abuse--areas in which they hope to eliminate health \ndisparities between LGBT people and the general population. They have \nmade many impressive strides over the past 20 years, and I know that \nthe future is bright for Diverse & Resilient, as well as Wisconsin's \nLGBT community, because of Gary's work.\n  I am proud to call Gary a friend, and I am grateful for his important \ncontributions to our State and the LGBT community. I know that his \npassion and dedication to improving the lives of others will continue \nlong after he steps down from his leadership role at Diverse & \nResilient. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/senate-section/article/S4684-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RECOGNIZING BATH, NEW HAMPSHIRE ON ITS 250TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nBath, NH--a town in Grafton County that is celebrating the 250th \nanniversary of its founding. I am proud to join citizens across the \nGranite State in recognizing this historic occasion.\n  Bath is surrounded by the Green Mountains to the west and White \nMountains to the east and is situated at the furthest navigable point \nof the Connecticut River. Both the Ammonoosuc and Wild Ammonoosuc \nRivers flow through Bath and are the source of the rich soil and ample \nwater power responsible for Bath's thriving industrial and agricultural \nhistory.\n  The town of Bath is named for William Pulteney, first Earl of Bath, \nand was originally chartered by Colonial Governor Benning Wentworth in \n1761 and later settled by John Herriman of Haverhill, MA, in 1765.\n  Bath is known as the Covered Bridge Capital of New England and is \nhome to the Bath, Swiftwater, and Bath-Haverhill covered bridges. \nBath's architectural history is represented by a well-preserved group \nof 18th and 19th century style buildings located within its villages. \nOne of the most famous of these buildings is The Brick Store. Opened in \n1824, this Bath landmark holds the distinction of being the oldest \ncontinuously operated general store in the United States.\n  As both statesmen and soldiers, Bath residents have been known \nthroughout the town's history for their commitment and sacrifice in the \nservice of our great Nation. United States Congressmen Harry Hibbard \nand James Hutchins Johnson both share ties to Bath, but it is New \nHampshire's former District 1 executive councilor, Raymond S. Burton, \nwho exemplified the meaning of public service. For over 30 years, Ray \ntirelessly advocated for his constituents throughout the North Country, \nand at the end of the day he always returned to his farm on River Road \nin Bath.\n  On behalf of all Granite Staters, I am pleased to offer my \ncongratulations to the citizens of Bath on reaching this special \nmilestone, and I thank them for their many contributions to the life \nand spirit of the State of New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/senate-section/article/S4684-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        RECOGNIZING BATH, NEW HAMPSHIRE ON ITS 250TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. AYOTTE.

My office helped the \nfoundation do everything we could to plan a memorable trip for Jim and \nhis wife and son, including tours of the White House and U.S. Capitol \nand visits to historic landmarks around the city.\n  Jim was deeply proud of his military service, and looked forward to \nsharing the rich cultural history of the Nation's capital with his \nfamily, writing: ``I am hoping this trip will help them to fully \nunderstand why I felt the call to duty in my youth and why my service \nto this country is so important to me.''

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 617 \nWalnut Street in Helena, Arkansas, as the ``Jacob Trieber Federal \nBuilding, United States Post Office, and United States Court House''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the Honorable Jacob Trieber, of Helena, \nAR, known as a ``genius lawyer and jurist,'' served as the first Jewish \nFederal judge in the United States. Born on October 6, 1853, in \nRaschkow, Prussia, a young Jacob Trieber and his family escaped the \ngrowing anti-Semitism in Prussia and moved to the United States. In a \nfew short years they established their homestead and a family store in \nHelena, AR. In 1873, he began to study law, and 3 years later entered \nthe Arkansas Bar. In 1897, he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of Arkansas in Little Rock. Three years later, on July \n26, 1900, President William McKinley appointed Jacob Trieber to the \nFederal bench, where for 27 years Judge Trieber served on the U.S. \nCircuit Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Judge Trieber was \ncommitted to equal justice for all, and ruled for equality for African \nAmericans and women. Judge Trieber had astounding foresight. Many of \nhis rulings were important to civil rights and wildlife conservation. \nJudge Trieber was also committed to his local Arkansas community and \nserved as an elected official on the Helena City Council and as the \nPhillips County treasurer. Judge Trieber played an influential role in \nsaving the Old State House and establishing the Arkansas State \nTuberculosis Sanatorium. In honor of Judge Jacob Trieber, Senator \nCotton and I are introducing this legislation that designates the \nFederal Building in Helena-West Helena, Arkansas, the ``Jacob Trieber \nFederal Building, United States Post Office, and Court House.''

JACOB TRIEBER FEDERAL BUILDING, UNITED STATES POST \n                   OFFICE, AND UNITED STATES COURT HOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Federal building located at 617 \n     Walnut Street in Helena, Arkansas, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Jacob Trieber Federal Building, United \n     States Post Office, and United States Court House''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     Federal building referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     deemed to be a reference to the ``Jacob Trieber Federal \n     Building, United States Post Office, and United States Court \n     House''.\n\n[[Page S4689]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. WARREN (for herself, Mr. McCain, Mr. King, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 1709. A bill to reduce risks to the financial system by limiting \nbanks' ability to engage in certain risky activities and limiting \nconflicts of interest, to reinstate certain Glass-Steagall Act \nprotections that were repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \n21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. I am honored to join Senators McCain, \nCantwell, and King in introducing this bill.\n  Washington is a partisan place and this Congress has its share of \npartisan bills, but we have all joined together because we all want a \nmore stable economy that works not just for those at the top but for \neveryone.\n  Seven years ago, Wall Street's high-risk bets brought our economy to \nits knees. The Dallas Fed estimates that the total cost of the crash \nwas $14 trillion. Millions of families lost their homes. Millions of \npeople lost their savings. Millions of people lost their jobs. And even \ntoday, millions of hard-working, play-by-the-rules people are still \nstruggling to survive.\n  Over the past 7 years, we have made some real progress dialing back \nthe risk of a future crisis. But despite that progress, the biggest \nbanks continue to threaten the economy. The biggest banks are \ncollectively much bigger today than they were 7 years ago. They \ncontinue to engage in dangerous, high-risk practices. And with each new \nheadline and subsequent legal settlement, it becomes clearer that they \nkeep chasing profits even if it means breaking the law.\n  The big banks weren't always allowed to take on big risks while \nenjoying the benefits of taxpayer guarantees. Four years after the 1929 \nWall Street crash, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act, which is \nbest known for separating investment banks and their risk-taking from \ncommercial banks that manage savings accounts, checking accounts, and \noffer other banking services.\n  For 50 years, Glass-Steagall played a central role in keeping our \ncountry safe. Traditional banking stayed separate from high-risk Wall \nStreet banking. There wasn't a single major financial crisis, and the \nfinancial sector helped contribute to a sustained, broad-based economic \ngrowth that helped build America's middle class. But the big \ntraditional banks wanted the higher profits they could get from taking \nmore risks, and investors in the big investment banks wanted access to \nthe low-cost, insured deposits of traditional banks, so they teamed up \nto try to tear down Glass-Steagall's wall. Starting in the 1980s, \nregulators of the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of \nthe Currency buckled under industry pressure and began poking bigger \nand bigger holes in the wall between investment and commercial banking, \nand, after 12 separate attempts, Congress repealed most of Glass-\nSteagall in 1999.\n  The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will rebuild the wall between \ncommercial banks and investment banks, separating traditional banks \nthat offer savings and checking accounts and that are insured by the \nFDIC from their riskier counterparts on Wall Street. Banks can choose: \nTake big risks using investors' money or be very careful using \ndepositors' money--but no more mixing the two.\n  The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act also fills in the holes the \nregulators punched in the original Glass-Steagall, and it recognizes \nthat the financial markets have become more complicated since the \n1930s, so it covers products that did not exist when Glass-Steagall was \noriginally passed.\n  By itself, the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act will not end too big \nto fail and implicit government subsidies, but it will make financial \ninstitutions smaller, safer, and move us in the right direction. By \nseparating depository institutions from riskier activities, large \nfinancial institutions will shrink in size and won't be able to rely on \nFDIC insurance as a safety net for their high-risk activities. It will \nstop the game these banks have played for far too long--heads, the big \nbanks win and take all the profits; tails, the taxpayers lose and get \nstuck with the bill.\n  Our proposal has an added benefit--it is simple. It doesn't require \nthousands of pages of new rules. And better still, if we rebuilt the \nwall between commercial banks and investment banks, we could even cut \nback on some of the other rules we have in place to stop big banks from \ntaking on too much risk.\n  If financial institutions actually have to face the consequences of \ntheir business decisions, if they cannot rely on government insurance \nto subsidize their riskiest activities, then the investors in those \ninstitutions will have a stronger incentive to closely monitor those \nrisks before they get out of hand and take down the entire economy. \nGovernment regulators could play a more limited role, and that is an \noutcome everyone should like.\n  It has now been 7 years since the great financial crash. Most of the \nbanks that were too big to fail in 2008 are even bigger now. Shortly \nafter they were bailed out by the American taxpayers, these banks once \nagain started raking in billions of dollars in profits. In fact, in \n2014 they posted two of their most profitable quarters in the last 20 \nyears. Between 2010 and 2013, the median compensation for a big-bank \nCEO was about $15 million a year while median household income in the \nUnited States during that same period--that is, income for the whole \nfamily--was barely above $50,000. The big banks and their executives \nhave recovered handsomely from the crisis they helped create while too \nmany other Americans are still scraping to get by.\n  We weren't sent to Washington to work for the big banks. It is time \nfor a banking system that serves the best interests of the American \npeople, not just those few at the top. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall \nAct is an important step in the right direction, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan measure to \nstrengthen our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/senate-section/article/S4688-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4688-S4689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. Cotton):\n  S. 1707. A bill to designate the Federal building located at 617 \nWalnut Street in Helena, Arkansas, as the ``Jacob Trieber Federal \nBuilding, United States Post Office, and United States Court House''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, the Honorable Jacob Trieber, of Helena, \nAR, known as a ``genius lawyer and jurist,'' served as the first Jewish \nFederal judge in the United States. Born on October 6, 1853, in \nRaschkow, Prussia, a young Jacob Trieber and his family escaped the \ngrowing anti-Semitism in Prussia and moved to the United States. In a \nfew short years they established their homestead and a family store in \nHelena, AR. In 1873, he began to study law, and 3 years later entered \nthe Arkansas Bar. In 1897, he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the \nEastern District of Arkansas in Little Rock. Three years later, on July \n26, 1900, President William McKinley appointed Jacob Trieber to the \nFederal bench, where for 27 years Judge Trieber served on the U.S. \nCircuit Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas. Judge Trieber was \ncommitted to equal justice for all, and ruled for equality for African \nAmericans and women. Judge Trieber had astounding foresight. Many of \nhis rulings were important to civil rights and wildlife conservation. \nJudge Trieber was also committed to his local Arkansas community and \nserved as an elected official on the Helena City Council and as the \nPhillips County treasurer. Judge Trieber played an influential role in \nsaving the Old State House and establishing the Arkansas State \nTuberculosis Sanatorium. In honor of Judge Jacob Trieber, Senator \nCotton and I are introducing this legislation that designates the \nFederal Building in Helena-West Helena, Arkansas, the ``Jacob Trieber \nFederal Building, United States Post Office, and Court House.''

STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2015''.\n       (b) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Public school students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n     or transgender (referred to in this section as ``LGBT''), or \n     are perceived to be LGBT, or who associate with LGBT people, \n     have been and are subjected to pervasive discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     and have been deprived of equal educational opportunities, in \n     schools in every part of the Nation.\n       (B) While discrimination of any kind is harmful to students \n     and to the education system, actions that target students \n     based on sexual orientation or gender identity represent a \n     distinct and severe problem that remains inadequately \n     addressed by current Federal law.\n       (C) Numerous social science studies demonstrate that \n     discrimination at school has contributed to high rates of \n     absenteeism, academic underachievement, dropping out, and \n     adverse physical and mental health consequences among LGBT \n     youth.\n       (D) When left unchecked, discrimination in schools based on \n     sexual orientation or gender identity can lead, and has led, \n     to life-threatening violence and to suicide.\n       (E) Public school students enjoy a variety of \n     constitutional rights, including rights to equal protection, \n     privacy, and free expression, which are infringed when school \n     officials engage in or fail to take prompt and effective \n     action to stop discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation or gender identity.\n       (F) Provisions of Federal statutory law expressly prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, \n     disability, and national origin. The Department of Education \n     and the Department of Justice, as well as numerous courts, \n     have correctly interpreted the prohibitions on sex \n     discrimination to include discrimination based on sex \n     stereotypes and gender identity, even when that sex-based \n     discrimination coincides or overlaps with discrimination \n     based on sexual orientation. However, the absence of express \n     Federal law prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of \n     sexual orientation and gender identity has created \n     unnecessary uncertainty that risks limiting access to legal \n     remedies under Federal law for LGBT students and their \n     parents.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that all students have access to public \n     education in a safe environment free from discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (B) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (C) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (D) to invoke congressional powers, including the power to \n     enforce the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States and to provide for the general welfare pursuant to \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution and the power to \n     make all laws necessary and proper for the execution of the \n     foregoing powers pursuant to section 8 of article I of the \n     Constitution, in order to prohibit discrimination in public \n     schools on the basis of sexual orientation or gender \n     identity; and\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\n       (E) to allow the Department of Education and the Department \n     of Justice to effectively combat discrimination based on \n     sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, \n     through regulation and enforcement, as the Departments have \n     issued regulations under and enforced title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) and \n     other nondiscrimination laws in a manner that effectively \n     addresses discrimination.\n       (c) Definitions and Rule.--\n       (1) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (A) Educational agency.--The term ``educational agency'' \n     means a local educational agency, an educational service \n     agency, or a State educational agency, as those terms are \n     defined in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n       (B) Gender identity.--The term ``gender identity'' means \n     the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or \n     other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with \n     or without regard to the individual's designated sex at \n     birth.\n       (C) Harassment.--The term ``harassment'' means conduct that \n     is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a \n     student's ability to participate in or benefit from a program \n     or activity of a public school or educational agency, \n     including acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, \n     intimidation, or hostility, if such conduct is based on--\n       (i) a student's actual or perceived sexual orientation or \n     gender identity; or\n       (ii) the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender \n     identity of a person with whom a student associates or has \n     associated.\n       (D) Program or activity.--The terms ``program or activity'' \n     and ``program'' have the same meanings given such terms as \n     applied under section 606 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000d-4a) to the operations of public entities under \n     paragraph (2)(B) of such section.\n       (E) Public school.--The term ``public school'' means an \n     elementary school (as the term is defined in section 9101 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7801)) that is a public institution, and a secondary school \n     (as so defined) that is a public institution.\n       (F) Sexual orientation.--The term ``sexual orientation'' \n     means homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.\n       (G) Student.--The term ``student'' means an individual \n     within the age limits for which the State provides free \n     public education who is enrolled in a public school or who, \n     regardless of official enrollment status, attends classes or \n     participates in the programs or activities of a public school \n     or local educational agency.\n       (2) Rule.--Consistent with Federal law, in this section the \n     term ``includes'' means ``includes but is not limited to''.\n       (d) Prohibition Against Discrimination.--\n       (1) In general.--No student shall, on the basis of actual \n     or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of such \n     individual or of a person with whom the student associates or \n     has associated, be excluded from participation in, be denied \n     the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n     program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n       (2) Harassment.--For purposes of this section, \n     discrimination includes harassment of a student on the basis \n     of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity \n     of such student or of a person with whom the student \n     associates or has associated.\n       (3) Retaliation prohibited.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--No person shall be excluded from \n     participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \n     to discrimination, retaliation, or reprisal under any program \n     or activity receiving Federal financial assistance based on \n     the person's opposition to conduct made unlawful by this \n     section.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph, \n     ``opposition to conduct made unlawful by this section'' \n     includes--\n       (i) opposition to conduct believed to be made unlawful by \n     this section or conduct that could be believed to become \n     unlawful under this section if allowed to continue;\n       (ii) any formal or informal report, whether oral or \n     written, to any governmental entity, including public schools \n     and educational agencies and employees of the public schools \n     or educational agencies, regarding conduct made unlawful by \n     this section, conduct believed to be made unlawful by this \n     section, or conduct that could be believed to become unlawful \n     under this section if allowed to continue;\n       (iii) participation in any investigation, proceeding, or \n     hearing related to conduct made unlawful by this section, \n     conduct believed to be made unlawful by this section, or \n     conduct that could be believed to become unlawful under this \n     section if allowed to continue;

POSTHUMOUS PARDON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, \n     and controversial figure in the history of the United States \n     who challenged racial biases.\n       (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to \n     parents who were former slaves.\n       (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled \n     throughout the United States, fighting White and African-\n     American heavyweights.\n       (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.\n       (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first \n     African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of \n     the World.\n       (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a \n     search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a \n     recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great \n     white hope''.\n       (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries \n     left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.\n       (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed \n     the ``Battle of the Century''.\n       (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the \n     racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the \n     United States.\n       (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.\n       (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were \n     lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White \n     women.\n       (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose''.\n       (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a \n     White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter.\n       (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act.\n       (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped \n     when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, \n     and then married Jack Johnson.\n       (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across States lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery''.\n       (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the \n     Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.\n       (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries.\n       (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title \n     to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.\n       (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.\n       (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.\n       (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War \n     II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating \n     in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.\n       (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n       (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29,111th Congress, agreed \n     to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th Congress \n     that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon for his \n     racially-motivated 1913 conviction.\n       (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that \n     Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--\n       (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the \n     prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the \n     annals of criminal justice in the United States; and\n       (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural \n     contributions of Jack Johnson to society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2112.

STUDENT NON-DISCRIMINATION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2015''.\n       (b) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (A) Public school students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, \n     or transgender (referred to in this section as ``LGBT''), or \n     are perceived to be LGBT, or who associate with LGBT people, \n     have been and are subjected to pervasive discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     and have been deprived of equal educational opportunities, in \n     schools in every part of the Nation.\n       (B) While discrimination of any kind is harmful to students \n     and to the education system, actions that target students \n     based on sexual orientation or gender identity represent a \n     distinct and severe problem that remains inadequately \n     addressed by current Federal law.\n       (C) Numerous social science studies demonstrate that \n     discrimination at school has contributed to high rates of \n     absenteeism, academic underachievement, dropping out, and \n     adverse physical and mental health consequences among LGBT \n     youth.\n       (D) When left unchecked, discrimination in schools based on \n     sexual orientation or gender identity can lead, and has led, \n     to life-threatening violence and to suicide.\n       (E) Public school students enjoy a variety of \n     constitutional rights, including rights to equal protection, \n     privacy, and free expression, which are infringed when school \n     officials engage in or fail to take prompt and effective \n     action to stop discrimination on the basis of sexual \n     orientation or gender identity.\n       (F) Provisions of Federal statutory law expressly prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, \n     disability, and national origin. The Department of Education \n     and the Department of Justice, as well as numerous courts, \n     have correctly interpreted the prohibitions on sex \n     discrimination to include discrimination based on sex \n     stereotypes and gender identity, even when that sex-based \n     discrimination coincides or overlaps with discrimination \n     based on sexual orientation. However, the absence of express \n     Federal law prohibitions on discrimination on the basis of \n     sexual orientation and gender identity has created \n     unnecessary uncertainty that risks limiting access to legal \n     remedies under Federal law for LGBT students and their \n     parents.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to ensure that all students have access to public \n     education in a safe environment free from discrimination, \n     including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence, \n     on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (B) to provide a comprehensive Federal prohibition of \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (C) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for \n     discrimination in public schools based on actual or perceived \n     sexual orientation or gender identity;\n       (D) to invoke congressional powers, including the power to \n     enforce the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States and to provide for the general welfare pursuant to \n     section 8 of article I of the Constitution and the power to \n     make all laws necessary and proper for the execution of the \n     foregoing powers pursuant to section 8 of article I of the \n     Constitution, in order to prohibit discrimination in public \n     schools on the basis of sexual orientation or gender \n     identity; and\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\n       (E) to allow the Department of Education and the Department \n     of Justice to effectively combat discrimination based on \n     sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, \n     through regulation and enforcement, as the Departments have \n     issued regulations under and enforced title IX of the \n     Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) and \n     other nondiscrimination laws in a manner that effectively \n     addresses discrimination.\n       (c) Definitions and Rule.--\n       (1) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (A) Educational agency.--The term ``educational agency'' \n     means a local educational agency, an educational service \n     agency, or a State educational agency, as those terms are \n     defined in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801).\n       (B) Gender identity.--The term ``gender identity'' means \n     the gender-related identity, appearance, or mannerisms or \n     other gender-related characteristics of an individual, with \n     or without regard to the individual's designated sex at \n     birth.\n       (C) Harassment.--The term ``harassment'' means conduct that \n     is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a \n     student's ability to participate in or benefit from a program \n     or activity of a public school or educational agency, \n     including acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression, \n     intimidation, or hostility, if such conduct is based on--\n       (i) a student's actual or perceived sexual orientation or \n     gender identity; or\n       (ii) the actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender \n     identity of a person with whom a student associates or has \n     associated.\n       (D) Program or activity.--The terms ``program or activity'' \n     and ``program'' have the same meanings given such terms as \n     applied under section 606 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2000d-4a) to the operations of public entities under \n     paragraph (2)(B) of such section.\n       (E) Public school.--The term ``public school'' means an \n     elementary school (as the term is defined in section 9101 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     7801)) that is a public institution, and a secondary school \n     (as so defined) that is a public institution.\n       (F) Sexual orientation.--The term ``sexual orientation'' \n     means homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.\n       (G) Student.--The term ``student'' means an individual \n     within the age limits for which the State provides free \n     public education who is enrolled in a public school or who, \n     regardless of official enrollment status, attends classes or \n     participates in the programs or activities of a public school \n     or local educational agency.\n       (2) Rule.--Consistent with Federal law, in this section the \n     term ``includes'' means ``includes but is not limited to''.\n       (d) Prohibition Against Discrimination.--\n       (1) In general.--No student shall, on the basis of actual \n     or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity of such \n     individual or of a person with whom the student associates or \n     has associated, be excluded from participation in, be denied \n     the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any \n     program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\n       (2) Harassment.--For purposes of this section, \n     discrimination includes harassment of a student on the basis \n     of actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity \n     of such student or of a person with whom the student \n     associates or has associated.\n       (3) Retaliation prohibited.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--No person shall be excluded from \n     participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected \n     to discrimination, retaliation, or reprisal under any program \n     or activity receiving Federal financial assistance based on \n     the person's opposition to conduct made unlawful by this \n     section.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of this paragraph, \n     ``opposition to conduct made unlawful by this section'' \n     includes--\n       (i) opposition to conduct believed to be made unlawful by \n     this section or conduct that could be believed to become \n     unlawful under this section if allowed to continue;\n       (ii) any formal or informal report, whether oral or \n     written, to any governmental entity, including public schools \n     and educational agencies and employees of the public schools \n     or educational agencies, regarding conduct made unlawful by \n     this section, conduct believed to be made unlawful by this \n     section, or conduct that could be believed to become unlawful \n     under this section if allowed to continue;\n       (iii) participation in any investigation, proceeding, or \n     hearing related to conduct made unlawful by this section, \n     conduct believed to be made unlawful by this section, or \n     conduct that could be believed to become unlawful under this \n     section if allowed to continue;

POSTHUMOUS PARDON.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson was a flamboyant, defiant, \n     and controversial figure in the history of the United States \n     who challenged racial biases.\n       (2) Jack Johnson was born in Galveston, Texas, in 1878 to \n     parents who were former slaves.\n       (3) Jack Johnson became a professional boxer and traveled \n     throughout the United States, fighting White and African-\n     American heavyweights.\n       (4) After being denied (on purely racial grounds) the \n     opportunity to fight 2 White champions, in 1908, Jack Johnson \n     was granted an opportunity by an Australian promoter to fight \n     the reigning White title-holder, Tommy Burns.\n       (5) Jack Johnson defeated Tommy Burns to become the first \n     African-American to hold the title of Heavyweight Champion of \n     the World.\n       (6) The victory by Jack Johnson over Tommy Burns prompted a \n     search for a White boxer who could beat Jack Johnson, a \n     recruitment effort that was dubbed the search for the ``great \n     white hope''.\n       (7) In 1910, a White former champion named Jim Jeffries \n     left retirement to fight Jack Johnson in Reno, Nevada.\n       (8) Jim Jeffries lost to Jack Johnson in what was deemed \n     the ``Battle of the Century''.\n       (9) The defeat of Jim Jeffries by Jack Johnson led to \n     rioting, aggression against African-Americans, and the \n     racially-motivated murder of African-Americans throughout the \n     United States.\n       (10) The relationships of Jack Johnson with White women \n     compounded the resentment felt toward him by many Whites.\n       (11) Between 1901 and 1910, 754 African-Americans were \n     lynched, some simply for being ``too familiar'' with White \n     women.\n       (12) In 1910, Congress passed the Act of June 25, 1910 \n     (commonly known as the ``White Slave Traffic Act'' or the \n     ``Mann Act'') (18U.S.C. 2421 et seq.), which outlawed the \n     transportation of women in interstate or foreign commerce \n     ``for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any \n     other immoral purpose''.\n       (13) In October 1912, Jack Johnson became involved with a \n     White woman whose mother disapproved of their relationship \n     and sought action from the Department of Justice, claiming \n     that Jack Johnson had abducted her daughter.\n       (14) Jack Johnson was arrested by Federal marshals on \n     October 18, 1912, for transporting the woman across State \n     lines for an ``immoral purpose'' in violation of the Mann \n     Act.\n       (15) The Mann Act charges against Jack Johnson were dropped \n     when the woman refused to cooperate with Federal authorities, \n     and then married Jack Johnson.\n       (16) Federal authorities persisted and summoned a White \n     woman named Belle Schreiber, who testified that Jack Johnson \n     had transported her across States lines for the purpose of \n     ``prostitution and debauchery''.\n       (17) In 1913, Jack Johnson was convicted of violating the \n     Mann Act and sentenced to 1 year and 1 day in Federal prison.\n       (18) Jack Johnson fled the United States to Canada and \n     various European and South American countries.\n       (19) Jack Johnson lost the Heavyweight Championship title \n     to Jess Willard in Cuba in 1915.\n       (20) Jack Johnson returned to the United States in July \n     1920, surrendered to authorities, and served nearly a year in \n     the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.\n       (21) Jack Johnson subsequently fought in boxing matches, \n     but never regained the Heavyweight Championship title.\n       (22) Jack Johnson served the United States during World War \n     II by encouraging citizens to buy war bonds and participating \n     in exhibition boxing matches to promote the war bond cause.\n       (23) Jack Johnson died in an automobile accident in 1946.\n       (24) In 1954, Jack Johnson was inducted into the Boxing \n     Hall of Fame.\n       (25) Senate Concurrent Resolution 29,111th Congress, agreed \n     to July 29, 2009, expressed the sense of the 111th Congress \n     that Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon for his \n     racially-motivated 1913 conviction.\n       (b) Recommendations.--It remains the sense of Congress that \n     Jack Johnson should receive a posthumous pardon--\n       (1) to expunge a racially-motivated abuse of the \n     prosecutorial authority of the Federal Government from the \n     annals of criminal justice in the United States; and\n       (2) in recognition of the athletic and cultural \n     contributions of Jack Johnson to society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2112.

This \nextension is yet another folly. Yet the President and the Secretary of \nState act as if it is cost free. These extensions are not cost free.\n  First, Iran repeatedly violates the interim agreements--for example, \nby enriching uranium beyond specified limits or exporting more oil than \nallowed.\n  Second, we have repeatedly taught Iran a very dangerous lesson, which \nis that the window for diplomacy never ends with this President and the \nUnited States. They can get extension after extension after extension, \nand we will grant concession after concession after concession.\n  Just 3 months ago, Iran reneged on its commitments to send its \nuranium stockpiles overseas and to close its underground fortified \nmilitary bunker. Now, again, they have taken that lesson and introduced \na new demand into these negotiations. They are now demanding that the \nWest lift its arms embargo on conventional arms to Iran at a time when \nIran is destabilizing the entire Middle East and that we lift sanctions \non their ballistic missile program, which was explicitly ruled off the \nnegotiating table at the beginning of these negotiations.\n  Well, here is my proposal: If Iran wants to introduce new terms to \nthe debate at this late hour, the U.S. Government should leave the \ntable. We should break off the negotiations, and we should say to Iran: \nIf you want to introduce new terms, you will release American hostages \nwithin 24 hours. Bob Levinson, Amir Hekmati, Saeed Abedini, and Jason \nRezaian will be released within 24 hours or the negotiations are over, \nwe will reimpose sanctions, the U.S. Congress will impose new \nsanctions.\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\n  It is a disgrace that we are letting Iran add new terms to the \nnegotiations at this late hour when four Americans are still held \nhostage by the Government of Iran.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/senate-section/article/S4802-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4802-S4803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN\n\n  Mr. COTTON.
