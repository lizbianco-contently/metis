Madam President, like many of my colleagues, I plan to \ncommemorate Veterans Day with the people I am honored to represent here \nin the Senate. I will join Kentuckians at a ceremony in Shelbyville's \nVeterans Memorial Park. Hands will be put to heart as the ``Star \nSpangled Banner'' is played. Heads will bow in reverence as 106 names \nare read aloud, each a Kentuckian who made the ultimate sacrifice in \nthe service of others, and each a reminder of our enduring debt to \nAmerica's men and women in uniform.\n  I am proud to represent the nearly 330,000 Kentuckians who have \nserved in the Armed Forces. I am also proud to represent the many \nthousands of soldiers and their families who reside in or hail from our \ngreat Commonwealth, whether at Fort Knox, Fort Campbell, the Blue Grass \nArmy Depot, or beyond.\n  I recently had a chance to meet some of Kentucky's brave soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines who currently serve in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Sadly, a NATO helicopter had just crashed in Kabul, killing five \npeople, including two American servicemembers. I was honored to take \npart in a prayer service led by a chaplain from Lexington, KY, and I \nnote that the occupant of the Chair was with me at the time.\n  What an incredibly humbling moment it was. The tragic crash is a \nstark reminder of the incredible danger our service men and women face \nevery day, and a stark reminder of what all Americans owe them.\n  Veterans should know that they have many champions fighting for them \nhere in the Senate. One of them is Senator Isakson, the chair of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. Under his leadership, the committee has \nactively sought to do right by the men and women who never hesitate to \ndo right\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\nby us. He has sent important legislation to the Senate floor that we \nhave been able to pass on a bipartisan basis and that the President has \nsigned into law.\n  One law we passed would improve the Veterans Choice Program, for \ninstance, while another, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American \nVeterans Act, would help reduce the tragedies that befall too many of \nour heroes and the heartbreak that befalls too many of their families.\n  Important Veterans' Affairs Committee oversight has also been brought \nto bear on an agency that has lost the trust of many it serves; that \nis, the VA.\n  Of course, there is much more to be done. Veterans deserve the very \nbest, and the VA crisis will not be resolved easily or quickly, but \nworking together, there is a lot we can do for the men and women who \nrisk their all for their country.\n  One way to do so is by passing the Veterans funding bill that is \nbefore us. It is a result of great work by another champion of \nveterans, Senator Kirk, chair of the Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs Appropriations Subcommittee. Just like Senator Isakson's \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, the subcommittee led by the Senator from \nIllinois has done great work for veterans in sending important \nlegislation such as this to the floor. We will pass one important \nmeasure today.\n  Senator Kirk's bill would fund the health care and the benefits our \nveterans rely on. It would support military families by funding the \nhousing, schools, and health facilities that sustain them. It would \nprovide support for medical research, for women's health, and for \nveterans suffering from traumatic brain injury. And in Kentucky, it \nwould provide funding for a special operations headquarters at Fort \nCampbell, for educational facilities at Fort Knox, and for design work \nfor a new medical center in Louisville.\n  Senator Kirk's bill would also fund reforms designed to help address \nthe crisis we have seen at the VA. These reforms would allow for \ngreater national and regional progress in reducing claims backlogs, and \nthey would deploy important protections for whistleblowers as well.\n  It is obvious why our veterans deserve this bill right now, so let's \nnot wait a moment longer. Let's pass this important legislation later \ntoday. The men and women who have worn our uniform have had to wait \nlong enough for it already.\n  We will also turn to legislation today for the men and women who \ncurrently wear our uniform and have had to wait too long for it.\n  When Senator McCain says that it is the first duty of the Federal \nGovernment to protect the Nation, he means it. He knows what it means \nto serve. He knows what it means to sacrifice. And in his role as chair \nof the Armed Services Committee, he worked hard to craft a bipartisan \nDefense authorization bill with input from both parties.\n  It would transform bureaucratic waste into crucial investments for \nour troops and their families, like the raises they have earned and the \nquality of life programs they deserve.\n  It would provide hope for wounded warriors and extend a hand of \ncompassion to heroes who struggle with mental health challenges.\n  It would also authorize a new medical facility at Fort Knox, an \nimportant project I have championed literally for years.\n  And at a time when our country faces the most ``diverse and complex \narray of crises'' since the Second World War, as Henry Kissinger \nobserved, Senator McCain's bill would help position our military to \nconfront the challenges of tomorrow as it offers support to the men and \nwomen serving in harm's way today.\n  The Defense authorization bill is legislation we typically consider \nevery year. It is legislation that typically passes with broad \nbipartisan support. We expect that to finally happen again today. We \nexpect the President to finally sign it this time.\n  This should have been allowed to happen a whole lot sooner. We all \nknow the unfortunate and unnecessary roadblocks the Defense \nauthorization bill has faced this year. We all know the President \ndecided to veto the version of the bill we passed last month. That veto \nis particularly unfortunate and puzzling, given the two chief concerns \nthe President cited when he vetoed it. No. 1, he said he was concerned \nthat the bill relied upon contingency funding to meet the Department's \noperational costs. No. 2, he said he was concerned that the bill again \ncontained a clear, bipartisan prohibition on moving Guantanamo Bay \nterrorists into our local communities.\n  But the bill really hasn't changed much since then, and the top line \nhas now been settled by the bipartisan budget agreement. Either way, we \nlook forward to the Senate passing this essentially unchanged \nlegislation and the President's signing the bipartisan bill, along \nwith--along with--its restrictions against bringing terrorists into the \nUnited States, into law.\n  This bill will include restrictions on bringing terrorists into the \nUnited States, and he is going to sign it. That is the right thing for \nour men and women in uniform, and that is the right thing for our \ncountry.\n  Before I leave the floor, I wish to underline a point I just \nreferenced. This morning the Senate will pass two bills. It will pass a \nVeterans funding bill that supports Americans who have already served \ntheir country, and it will pass a Defense authorization bill that \nsupports Americans who are currently serving. Each of these bills \ncontains a clear, bipartisan prohibition on the President moving \nGuantanamo Bay terrorists into the backyards of the American people. \nBoth of these bills include restrictions on moving terrorists into our \ncountry.\n  The Senate has voted many times over the years to enact these \nbipartisan prohibitions. We have enacted them in Congresses with split \nparty control. We have enacted them in Congresses with massive, \noverwhelming Democratic majorities. And, today, the Congress elected by \nthe American people will express itself clearly one more time--not \nonce, but twice--today.\n  The President may not like this bipartisan action. It may conflict \nwith a campaign slogan from 8 or 9 years ago. But here is how one \nSenator put it: ``Congress' job is to pass legislation. The President \ncan veto it or he can sign it.'' That was then-Senator Obama as he was \ncriticizing the idea of doing an ``end-run around Congress.''\n  ``I believe in the Constitution,'' he said at the time--Senator \nObama--``and I will obey the Constitution of the United States,'' said \nSenator Obama. Those were his words then. They should guide his actions \nnow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7870-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as I mentioned yesterday morning, the \nRepublican leader is right about a lot of what he talked about \nregarding the Military Construction-VA-HUD legislation, but the one \nthing he just glossed over is that as a result of our holding firm--we \nas a Democratic caucus holding firm--the veterans now have $2 billion \nmore than they would have, had we followed the Republicans' lead--$2 \nbillion more--allowing 70,000 veterans to be treated who wouldn't have \nbeen otherwise. So we are satisfied that this bill is a good bill, and \nit is a good bill because veterans are getting $2 billion more. There \nare other reasons, of course. I think the bipartisan support we got for \nthe bill was important, but for our veterans, the most important part \nwas $2 billion extra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7870-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7870-S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FIFTH CIRCUIT COURT IMMIGRATION DECISION\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Fifth Circuit Court's decision \nyesterday was a political move that ignores past precedents on \nExecutive action on immigration.\n  The Republicans have spoken out against the President's action on \nwhat he has done on immigration. Why did he do it? Because he was \ntrapped. He had to do it because the Republicans refused to legislate.\n  And like every President before him, President Obama has a legal \nright to establish clear immigration enforcement priorities and \nallocate resources accordingly.\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\n  But the attorney general of Texas and 25 other Republican Governors \nand attorneys general filed a lawsuit stating that the President had \nexceeded his authority. This decision affects millions of American \nfamilies who are now subject to being torn apart, and as many as 5 \nmillion immigrants could be set for mass deportation.\n  I expect the administration will swiftly appeal this decision to the \nSupreme Court and that the Court will find the actions lawful. It is \nsad that Republicans are wasting their time talking about mass \ndeportation when they could be doing things to solve the problem, such \nas passing a bill that reforms our immigration system once and for all. \nThe Republican Party has neglected the lessons of the 2012 elections \nand has plunged over a cliff following Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and \nthe others.\n  The Executive actions were neither a complete nor a permanent \nsolution to the problems plaguing the immigration system, but they were \na commonsense step in the face of inaction.\n  As Judge Carolyn Dineen King stated in her dissent very clearly, ``a \nmistake has been made.'' So it is now up to the U.S. Supreme Court to \ncorrect this grave mistake--a mistake that sets not only a dangerous \nprecedent but one that is bad for families, bad for our communities, \nand bad for the future prosperity of our country. Again, as Judge King \nsaid, ``a mistake has been made.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7871-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

In short, no matter how Republicans misrepresent the \nIran nuclear agreement, the agreement brought about the long-sought \ngoal of preventing Iran from having a nuclear weapon. The agreement is \nnothing more, nothing less. It prevents Iran from having a nuclear \nweapon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7871-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOSTING PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, later today the Republican leader and I \nwill host Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, as we have done on many \nother occasions. It is always a pleasure to meet with Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and reaffirm America's longstanding commitment to the \nsecurity of Israel. Israel knows it has an ally in the United States--\nin fact, no greater ally in the world than our great country.\n  While some Republicans in Congress are trying to drive a false \nnarrative of acrimony between the United States and Israel, I choose to \nsee the full picture, and the full picture is one of strengthened \ncooperation and shared interests.\n  Israel has always and will always depend on the United States to be \nby its side. That is why the United States and Israel are negotiating \nright now a new 10-year memorandum of understanding on security \nassistance. Much of yesterday's meeting between the President of the \nUnited States and the Prime Minister of Israel centered on the \ncontinued assistance we would provide Israel. Israel's interests have \nalways been protected by the United States in matters that come before \nthe United Nations, as Israel has always protected the interests of the \nUnited States before the United Nations.\n  In recent years we have seen how resolutions before the United \nNations General Assembly and the U.N. Human Rights Council have \nunfairly targeted the people of Israel. The administration has \ndenounced such efforts, but we also stand against Palestinian attempts \nto use the United Nations to go around a negotiated peace process. \nWherever, whenever, and however, the United States will always stand by \nIsrael.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7871-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I share the Republican leader's hope that \nwe can conclude the Military Construction-VA bill later this morning. I \ncommend the managers of that legislation for doing a good job. There is \nno Senator I admire more than Jon Tester from Montana, and he has been \nably leading the direction of this bill.\n  I join with the Republican leader as we honor our veterans tomorrow \non Veterans Day.\n  Madam President, I just want to take a brief minute to talk about a \nveteran, whom I look to with admiration.\n  Today the chaplain gave a prayer saying that he prayed for veterans \nwho have already left us and those veterans who are still alive.\n  My town is Searchlight, NV, a little tiny town with not a lot of \npeople in it. It has been that way for a long time. For a brief period \nSearchlight was bigger than Las Vegas. It had 3,000 people there.\n  During World War II a young man who was already married and had \nchildren went to a movie with his wife in Las Vegas. He came out of the \nmovies and told his wife: I think I have to join. He didn't have to, \nbut he felt he had to.\n  So this young man joined the U.S. Army Air Corps, which is now the \nU.S. Air Force. It was a huge sacrifice for him and his family. He \ntraveled with his wife and children to Georgia where he did his \ntraining and then went to the European theater as a pilot.\n  He served gallantly, bombing, strafing, and all the other things you \ndid in the air in World War II. He had been through 68 different \nmissions. He was through. But as happens sometimes in life, things \ndevelop that change your life. He volunteered for one more flight \nbecause one of the other pilots was unable to go.\n  On his 69th flight, somewhere over Belgium, Bill Nellis, the boy from \nSearchlight, was shot down. He is still there. That is where his grave \nis.\n  I know his family. I know his son Gary and his Aunt Thelma, whom I \nknew in Searchlight.\n  This good man was so gallant in the eyes of people from Nevada that a \nprevious congressional delegation, in conjunction with the President of \nthe United States, decided it would be appropriate to name the Las \nVegas Gunnery School, as it was called at that time, Nellis Air Force \nBase.\n  Today Nellis Air Force Base, named after this man from Searchlight, \nis the finest Air Force fighter training facility in the world. \nThousands and thousands of people serve there.\n  It was originally on the outskirts of Las Vegas. Now it is in Las \nVegas in a very populated area. No one complains about it. We are so \nproud of that Air Force base. It is a huge facility that has the finest \ngunnery range for Air Force pilots in the world. We have exercises \nthere every year where pilots from all over the world bring their own \naircraft from Australia, Great Britain, and other places to train \nthere.\n  We in Nevada are very proud of Nellis Air Force Base, as is the \nentire military complex in the United States. It is a wonderful \nfacility. Tomorrow is the day we honor Bill Nellis and the other \ngallant people who have served and are serving in the U.S. military.\n  Would the Chair announce the business this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7871-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to support and to request the \nSenate's approval of this resolution, which would designate the second \nweek of November as National Pregnancy\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\nCenter Week in honor of the lifesaving and life-affirming work of \nAmerica's community-supported pregnancy centers.\n  I am asking for my colleague's unanimous consent because there is \nabsolutely nothing contentious about this resolution, S. Res. 312, nor \nis there anything contentious about the pregnancy resource centers \ncommemorated by this resolution.\n  There are approximately 2,500 pregnancy resource centers in America. \nEvery single day they serve an average of 65,000 women and men faced \nwith challenging pregnancy decisions, providing them with a wide array \nof resources. That includes, at many centers, health care services such \nas pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and testing for STDs and STIs. It \nincludes emotional and educational support such as options counseling \nand parenting classes. It includes material and logistical assistance \nto help new moms and dads deal with all the little things that easily \nadd up to big obstacles in the first few weeks and months of \nparenthood.\n  America's pregnancy resource centers aren't out to make a profit nor \nare they out there to push a particular political agenda. They are just \nthere to help and to do so in a way that is compassionate, considerate \nof individual privacy, and respectful of the equal dignity of all human \nlife.\n  Any way you look at it, America's pregnancy resource centers deserve \nour recognition and they deserve our respect and our gratitude. The \nreal measure of their significance isn't in the words of a floor speech \nin the Senate or the outcome of a vote, it is in the thousands of lives \nthey help save from the pain of abortion every year and in the millions \nof teachers, soldiers, nurses, neighbors, friends, and spouses whose \nlives and contributions to our communities we might never have known \nhad it not been for the unassuming heroes down at the local pregnancy \ncenter who give their time to keep the lights on, answer the phones, \nand help young women find the hope and the courage to choose life.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. Res. 312, submitted earlier today; \nthat the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the \nmotions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would \nask the Senator to modify his request and offer a resolution that \nactually helps to move women's health and rights forward.\n  Simply put, the resolution that the Senator has offered is more of \nthe same. It is another effort to pander to the extreme Republican base \nby using women's health and constitutionally protected rights as a \npolitical football. Unfortunately, it makes it clear for the umpteenth \ntime that when it comes to improving access to affordable health care \nfor women, some Republicans are determined to stand in the way of \nprogress.\n  I expect that some of my Republican colleagues will say this \nresolution shows how much they care about women's health. The truth is \nit shows the opposite. It shows once again that the Republican Party \nwants to interfere in a woman's medical decision. Strengthening women's \nhealth care doesn't start with telling women what they should and \nshould not do with their own bodies, but that is exactly what that \nresolution does.\n  If my Republican colleagues really want to support women's \nreproductive care, they would work with Democrats on improving access \nto affordable birth control under the Affordable Care Act, including \nemergency contraceptives, ensuring women and families make their own \ndecisions about their health care--not their bosses--and fighting back \nagainst efforts across the country to undermine women's \nconstitutionally protected health care rights.\n  It is time for Republicans to drop the political attacks on women's \nhealth and instead join Democrats to focus on these priorities and more \nlike them, so that women--not politicians, not insurance companies, not \nCFOs or CEOs--are in control of their health care, as it should be.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 37\n\n  That is why I ask the Senator to modify his request and instead ask \nunanimous consent that the HELP Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. Res. 37, and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration; that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed \nto, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, reserving the right to object, there is \nnothing divisive about this resolution I have offered today, nothing \ndivisive whatsoever.\n  This simply seeks recognition of the great work that is performed by \nthe men and women who staff these pregnancy centers. There is nothing \nabout it that is a political football, nothing about it that is \ndesigned to drive a wedge.\n  Unlike our resolution, the resolution I submitted today, S. Res. 312, \nwhich mainly commends community volunteers around the country for \nhelping young mothers and their children--hardly divisive--the \nSenator's counterproposal is divisive and controversial. My cosponsors \nand I only wanted to recognize the life-affirming and lifesaving work, \nthe kind of work that brings families and communities together the \ncounterproposal would only pull Americans further apart and further \naway from the more humane and compassionate society that all Americans \ndeserve.\n  If calling for recognition of these brave and noble men and women who \nserve people at pregnancy centers around the country is divisive, we \nhave significant problems, but the fact is, it is not. I would \nencourage anyone within the sound of my voice to read S. Res. 312, and \nthey will discover it is not the least bit divisive and doesn't discuss \nanything that is the least bit controversial.\n  On that basis, I can't agree with the modification, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I object to the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                   Armed Services Authorization Bill\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to speak as in morning business \nin terms of the bill we will be voting on at 11:20 a.m. today, the \narmed services authorization, as well as what we are going to be voting \non this afternoon, which is veterans health care. They actually go hand \nin hand and what a great set of votes in a symmetry that shows our \nsupport for national security, our support for our U.S. military, our \nsupport for our U.S. military who are on Active Duty today, and then \nalso for our veterans who in their hearts are always on Active Duty.\n  Today we have the ability to actually show we can govern, we can pass \nbills on a bipartisan basis that will help our country be able to \ndefend itself, show our support to the U.S. military, and honor our \ncommitment to the veterans. I am looking forward to voting on the armed \nservices authorization because it does give the tools we need to be \nable to defend ourselves. I commend Senators McCain and Jack Reed for \ntheir excellent work.\n  Madam President, I wish to speak now as the vice chair of the \nAppropriations Committee. I am so excited that we are bringing the \nMILCON-VA bill to the Senate. I have been voting for veterans ever \nsince I have come to Congress. Veterans are our Nation's heroes. They \nput their lives on the line to fight for our freedom. They have made \ntremendous sacrifices for our country. Whether it is veterans who are \nstill alive from World War II, those who fought on Pork Chop Hill \nduring the Korean war, the Vietnam war at Mekong Delta, and of course \nDesert Storm, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we owe our veterans a debt of \ngratitude. We want to show our gratitude not only with words and yellow \nribbons but with deeds. I believe the best deed is to make sure we \nadequately fund the Veterans' Administration to end the backlog for \ndisability benefits--if you fought on the frontlines, you shouldn't \nstand in line to get your disability benefits--and to robustly fund \nveterans\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\nhealth care, along with other benefits this Congress has so authorized.\n  We have accomplished a lot over the years working for our veterans, \nand we will have a lot to do with what is in our legislation. I wish to \ncommend the subcommittee chair, Senator Mark Kirk, and our vice chair, \nSenator Jon Tester, for the work they have done. As we were working on \nour bill this summer and through the spring, veterans told me and they \ntold them that the Senate funding was too spartan; that we were \nunderfunding our veterans and not just by a few dollars but by $850 \nmillion. So we held it up, not as a parliamentary ping-pong, not as a \nparliamentary temper tantrum but as a way of saying our veterans need \nmore money.\n  As a result of the budget agreement, we are able to do this. We are \non the floor today where an amendment will be offered by Senators Kirk \nand Tester to add $2 billion for veterans health care, $2 billion to be \ndetermined by the Secretary.\n  What do we look forward to? Well, lifesaving drugs. One of course is \nthis issue of being able to pay for hepatitis C; the other, while we \nare looking at actual hands-on medical care, we want to reduce the wait \ntimes. There is too much waiting at the Veterans' Administration, \nwhether you are waiting for your disability claim or you are waiting to \nsee your doctor or your mental health counselor or your \nophthalmologist. We need to be able to reduce the wait times, and this \nis what part of this $2 billion will do.\n  Then there are those who are not only chronically ill from the wounds \nof war but are chronically and devastatingly injured. So we looked at \nthose who are unable to care for themselves but are being cared for at \nhome by loved ones. This will add more funds to be able to help those \ncaregivers who are stepping up for their responsibility. So they are \ntaking family responsibility, but we have to take USA responsibility. \nThat is what we fought for in the $2 billion.\n  I urge my colleagues to move ahead and be able to vote for this bill. \nI do believe this legislation, by adding the money and the kind of \nexcellent work that has been done by our authorizers, the insistence of \ngood provisions being put into the bill--we are going to shrink that VA \nbacklog. Also, we are going to do something else. We are going to \nadvance funding for mandatory veterans' benefits. So no matter what \ngovernment means, if we ever get into more shutdown, slamdown, slowdown \npolitics due to us, the veterans' benefits will go forward.\n  I have been working on this backlog for a long time. By the time we \ngot to March 2013, we were at a national standoff. There were over \n600,000 claims pending. In Maryland we had one of the worst claims \noffices in my own hometown of Baltimore. I couldn't believe it. When I \nmet with my Veterans Advisory Board and stories poured out of the kinds \nof calls that were coming into my Constituent Services Offices, not \nonly were they waiting in line--this isn't like just standing in line \nat the supermarket, this is for disability benefits, for people who are \nin danger of losing their homes and other kinds of things. So we went \nto work on a bipartisan basis. I am proud of what we did. I am proud of \nour authorizers.\n  I see Senator Isakson from Georgia is on the floor. He was a big part \nof the reform effort. It shows our military knows how to win wars, but \nwe need to know how we can govern so they don't have to fight a war \nwith the VA bureaucracy. We hope we will be able to make these reforms. \nWe are not going to throw money at it. We are going to insist on \nmetrics.\n  The last point I wish to talk about is the advance appropriations. \nPeople will say: Aren't VA benefits mandatory? They are unless we get \ninto one of our parliamentary ping-pong debates.\n  So I worked with the Disabled Veterans of America and a coalition of \nseveral voluntary veterans service organizations--great groups: the \nAmerican Legion, Vietnam Veterans and Iraq and Iran Veterans of \nAmerica. They asked me to add advance appropriations to the omnibus 1 \nyear in advance--making sure we funded things 1 year in advance--\nprotecting them from shutdown and slamdown politics. We were able to do \nthat again, and I hope we can do that again this year.\n  I know I have other colleagues on the floor who wish to speak now, \nbut I wish to say we can really show we not only know how to fight for \nAmerica and its security, but we know how to fight for those who do the \nfighting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise on the eve of Veterans Day to \nurge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2016 Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill.\n  This marks the first time in 2 years that we have had the opportunity \nto debate, amend, and vote on this important legislation on the Senate \nfloor. It is vital to those who serve and to those who have served our \nNation.\n  I first learned to honor our veterans from my father. My father is a \nWorld War II veteran who was wounded twice in the Battle of the Bulge \nand earned his Purple Heart and his Bronze Star. It was he who would \ntake me to the parades on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day and boost me \nhigh on his shoulders. From the best vantage point in the parade, I \nwould watch our veterans march by. He taught me of their sacrifice and \nthat we have a never-ending obligation to thank those who wore the \nuniform of our country.\n  Passing this bill fulfills important obligations that we owe to our \nNation's 22 million veterans, 127,000 of whom live in the great State \nof Maine. It sends an important message to our veterans: We will honor \nthe sacrifices that you made and are making on our behalf. It would be \na mistake to send the opposite message by further postponing or \ndelaying consideration and final passage of this important bill before \nwe celebrate our veterans, honor, and remember them tomorrow.\n  As a member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs \nSubcommittee, I know this bill before us now is the result of \nbipartisan compromise. I commend the leadership of Chairman Kirk and \nRanking Member Tester, who have worked hand in hand to craft the \nmanagers' amendment that they will be bringing before us today.\n  In May of this year, the Appropriations Committee reported this \nfunding bill by a strong vote of 21 to 9. Since then the Bipartisan \nBudget Act has been enacted, which provides needed additional resources \nto fund vital national priorities and that will be reflected in the \nmanagers' amendment. The managers' substitute would provide a total of \n$79.7 billion in funding, which I would note represents more than $1 \nbillion more than the President's budget request.\n  This bill increases funding for our veterans in areas where they need \nit most, including mental health care and benefit claims processing, \ntwo issues which the Senator from Maryland has been so active in \nresolving. This bill also includes funds aimed at reducing veterans \nhomelessness. This is a special priority of mine as the chairman of the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee. I worked with Senator Murray on this issue, and we have \nmade real progress--exciting progress--in reducing the number of \nhomeless veterans across this country through the VASH Program, but \nthere is still more work to be done. In addition, this bill includes \n$270 million in funding for the Office of Rural Health, through which \nthe Access Received Closer to Home or the ARCH Program is funded. In \nfive pilot States in which it operates, ARCH ensures that rural \nveterans, who often have a very difficult time accessing the regular VA \nhealth care system--particularly the VA hospitals--can receive care \ncloser to where they live and where their families live.\n\n  I will never forget the story shared with me by a Maine veteran who \nbroke his hip during a terrible snow storm and needed urgent care. The \nARCH program, located at Cary Memorial Hospital in Caribou, ME, ensured \nhe could receive the care he needed in his community and close to his \nfamily, rather than enduring a 4-hour drive over bumpy winter roads \nduring a ferocious snow storm to the Togas VA Medical Center in \nAugusta, ME. ARCH has made a tremendous difference for our veterans and \ncontinues to help those who live in rural communities and who are \nfacing similar challenges and emergencies.\n  The managers' substitute also increases Veterans Affairs medical \nservices by nearly $2 billion, including $10\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\nmillion for programs supporting caregivers. We all know of the \nwonderful work that Elizabeth Dole has done in this area, and I have \nbeen very pleased to join with my colleague Senator Patty Murray in \nintroducing the Military and Veteran Caregiver Services Improvement \nAct. The bill before us is going to help provide benefits for those who \nshoulder the responsibilities associated with long-term care for \ncritically injured veterans. This bill would expand comprehensive \ncaregiver benefits for those who take on those responsibilities.\n  I would note, Madam President, that the Senator from Wisconsin, \nSenator Baldwin, and I have a broader bill dealing with caregivers that \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is considering \nand I hope will be approving shortly.\n  In addition to the vital funds for veterans programs, this bill also \nfunds military construction projects, which unfortunately had been \nadversely affected--cut, delayed, deferred--as a result of the budget \ncaps and the impact of sequestration. Therefore, I am particularly \npleased this bill includes $7.2 million in funding needed to repair, \nrenovate, and upgrade the 101st Air Refueling Wing's fire and crash \nrescue station in Bangor, ME. This is funding for which I have strongly \nadvocated, and I thank the managers for including it the bill. The \n101st ``MAINEiacs'' provide critical 24/7 air and ground refueling \nservices that support local military operations, and this funding will \nstrengthen their capabilities.\n  I would note, Madam President, that I recently met with General \nBreedlove, our NATO commander, and he told me he refueled at Bangor, \nME, on his way back from Europe recently.\n  Madam President, I could go on and on about the important programs \nand priorities in this bill. They are essential to providing what we \nowe to our servicemembers and our veterans: safe and reliable \ninfrastructure so that our troops can complete the missions they are \nassigned, access to medical care, earned compensation and benefits, and \nassistance to help our veterans successfully transition to their \ncivilian lives.\n  Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, our Nation will pause to honor all those \nwho served. Today, we have the opportunity to say to the American \npeople, to our veterans, and to those who are considering military \nservice to our Nation that no matter what partisan issues may divide \nus, we stand united in fulfilling our commitment to those who serve and \nthose who have served.\n  We can send that message by passing this measure and sending to the \nPresident a funding bill that takes care of our servicemembers, our \nveterans and their families, and that honors their service to our great \ncountry.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I wish to support the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct. This bipartisan bill provides critical resources for our active \nmilitary, veterans, and their families.\n  The courage and sacrifice that define our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nmarines, coastguardsmen, and all servicemembers over the years cannot \nbe understated. Major chapters in our Nation's rich history have been \nand continue to be written by our brave servicemen and women, many of \nwhom hail from Louisiana.\n  The very least we can do in return is keep our commitments to them. \nIt is our obligation to fund veterans' health care and benefits, and \nthis bill does just that while also making necessary reforms to the \nscandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Our Louisiana veterans have waited a long, long time to have \nefficient access to effective health care, and they deserve much better \nthan what has been handed to them. That is why I have worked for years \nto authorize new VA clinics and build interim clinics in southwest \nLouisiana, including one in Lake Charles, LA, that is expected to open \nbefore the Thanksgiving holiday.\n  The latest National Defense Authorization measure has been revised to \nreflect the recent budget deal, which modified the spending caps for \nboth base and war defense spending. In light of these changes, I firmly \nbelieve the administration should honor past statements that current \nmilitary reductions are due to defense budget cuts stemming from \nsequestration, which have now been postponed for 2 years.\n  It is critically important to recognize that the newly revised 2-year \nbudget deal provides necessary relief for the Department of Defense and \nallows a much-needed opportunity to avoid further cuts to the Active-\nDuty Army's troop strength. Since 2013, the U.S. Army alone has \ndecreased troop strength 21 percent. That is both dangerous and \nunacceptable.\n  I have fought against dangerously steep drawdowns and was proud to \nfight this issue on the Senate floor last year. The United States \ncannot afford continued troop cuts at a time when military leaders say \nthat we are facing an unprecedented number of threats.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our military and to support this \nbipartisan bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Veterans Day\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, this Veterans Day we pause to honor the \nmen and women in our military who stepped up to fight for our freedom \nand to protect our families. In my home State of Washington, we have a \nlot to be thankful for. More than 600,000 of our friends, our \nneighbors, and our family members have bravely served their country.\n  As the daughter of a World War II veteran, I know the sacrifice it \ntakes to keep our country safe and protect our values. Thanks to my \nfather and the countless other veterans I have had the honor of \nmeeting, I believe that when brave individuals sign up to serve our \ncountry, we must fulfill our promise to support them when they come \nhome. We should honor our veterans by showing them we have their backs \nlong after the war is over.\n  While I would like to stand here and say that our country is doing \neverything we can for the people we owe the most to and that we are \nfulfilling the promise we made to them when we sent them off to fight \nfor us, I believe our work is far from over. Though Congress passed a \nsweeping bill last year to provide new resources and add more \naccountability to the VA, I continue to hear from veterans across my \nhome State of Washington about care that is falling short. Despite \nstructural changes at the VA, veterans are still waiting on surgeries \nand MRIs and oncology appointments, mental health screenings, you name \nit. Our veterans have already fought for our country. They should not \nhave to fight to get their health care or the benefits they were \npromised, so we have to fight on their behalf.\n  As the senior member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am \ncommitted to making this country work better for our veterans. Even \nthough there are challenges, there is hope. Just 2 weeks ago, we \nsuccessfully passed the Homeless Veterans Services Protection Act out \nof the Senate to make sure a VA policy change doesn't cut off services \nand force veterans onto the street. That bill cleared one hurdle; now I \ncall on my colleagues in the House to get this done.\n  I am also fighting to end the VA's outdated ban on fertility services \nfor veterans so they can start families. There is absolutely no reason \nto deny this service for members of our military, especially when they \nare injured while fighting for our country. And I believe we must \nextend the critically important military caregiver support services \nprogram to veterans of all eras--a program that enables injured \nveterans to recover and stay in their homes with their families instead \nof being in a hospital or a nursing home.\n  Madam President, these aren't the only things I am working on. \nBecause our veterans kept their end of the bargain, we have to keep \nours. That means they should have access to mental health care to help \ndeal with the often invisible wounds of war. That means a solid path to \na college degree. That means job training programs and transitional \nservices so that veterans have a path to good careers after their \nmilitary service is complete. These things aren't about going above and \nbeyond; they are the bare minimum of what our country should be doing \nto fulfill its promise to care for our veterans.\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\n  So as our country recommits to that promise this Veterans Day, I want \nto let veterans know in my home State of Washington and across the \ncountry that I will not stop fighting for them. I again want to express \nmy heartfelt thanks to all the veterans around the country who have \nserved and for all who are still serving today.\n  I call on all of my colleagues and fellow citizens to honor our \nveterans every day of the year with the kind of action that shows them \nwe are grateful for their service.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I want to thank Senator Kirk and \nSenator Tester for their outstanding work on this appropriations bill; \nSenator Murray for her cooperation and help on caregivers and so many \nprograms in the committee; and Senator Collins and her work on MILCON. \nI want to encourage all my fellow Members of the Senate to vote \nfavorably on this legislation when it comes before us later today.\n  I want everyone to stop, take a deep breath, and think about three \nthings: No. 1, today is the 240th anniversary of the United States \nMarine Corps--the strongest veterans we have, veterans who fought and \ndied for us around the world for 2\\1/2\\ centuries. Tomorrow, at the \neleventh hour, on the eleventh day of the eleventh month, we celebrate \nthe armistice of World War I and Veterans Day in America. And today on \nthe floor of the Senate, we are fixing some problems that have \nconfronted our veterans for the better part of the last 10 years. As \nthe Members of the committee who are on the floor know, the VA \nliterally almost collapsed 2 years ago. Health services in Phoenix, AZ, \nwere a disaster. People were cheating on appointments and shortening \nveteran times to make themselves look better. The VA had a reputation \nof being the worst agency in the Federal government.\n  Now, I don't take credit for it as chairman, but I will tell you what \nyour committee members have done--members like Senator Tester and \nSenator Murray. Instead of complaining about people, instead of putting \ntargets on the wall and saying they are the problem, we decided to be \npart of the solution. I want to recite for just a second what has \nhappened in the last 10 months.\n  No. 1, we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American \nVeterans Act, and this bill funds it. It will help to reduce the number \nof suicides. Today, 22 veterans per day commit suicide, and we want \nthat reduced to a perfect score of zero at some point in time. But you \ndo that only by investing funds, hiring psychiatrists, and making a \ncommitment. This Senate and the House have done so.\n  We had an overrun of $1.428 billion--more than I can count to--in the \nDenver hospital the VA was trying to build. They were 13 years into \nconstruction and not even half finished. This committee said that will \nnot stand. We passed legislation to complete the funding by taking the \nmoney out of VA without additional appropriations from the Congress, \nand more importantly we got the VA out of the construction business. We \nsaid: You guys are supposed to take care of the health of our veterans, \nnot----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired, Senator.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I ask unanimous consent to have 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TESTER. I just need about 1 minute, Johnny--sorry, the Senator \nfrom Georgia. You can have everything, but just give me 1 minute.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 2\\1/2\\ minutes, Senator.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, let me just give you the closing, and I will leave \nall the juicy parts for later on. We will talk about those in the press \nrelease.\n  The story that should be read about this appropriations bill is we \nare not letting our veterans down. We are uplifting our veterans, and \nwe are seeing to it they get what they deserve. We are seeing to it \nthat the problems we have seen illustrated in the papers of the United \nStates of America are being fixed.\n  The VA is a work in progress. There will still be problems but not \nbecause of attitude or lack of funding and not because of a lack of \ncommitment by this Congress. We are going to do what our veterans did \nfor us. We are going to stand ground, we are going to take the hill, we \nare going to hold the hill, and we are going to see to it that those \nwho fought and died for the United States of America are rewarded, not \nonly for themselves and for their health care but for their retirement \nbenefits and for their loved ones as well.\n  I commend Senator Tester on what he has done, Senator Kirk for what \nhe has done, and all the members of the committee.\n  I yield back the remainder of the time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana, who can call me Johnny any time he wants to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I \nappreciate his comments and very much thank him for the compliments. \nThis MILCON-VA appropriations bill is a critically important bill. Why? \nBecause we are demanding a lot from the VA. In order to demand a lot, \nwe need to give them the tools and resources they need to be \nsuccessful. It would be totally unfair to put them on the line without \nthe resources they need to take care of our veterans.\n  That is important because today we have unprecedented demand. Not \nonly are our Vietnam veterans getting older, not only do they need \nservices like never before, but we have been at war for 15 years in the \nMiddle East, and we have folks coming back with complex injuries. We \nhave men and women who need help when they get back. Some of these \nveterans would not have survived if they had been in any other war but \nthis one. So the pressure on the VA is incredibly important, and if we \nare going to fix the access problem, if we are going to serve our \nveterans in the way they need to be served, we need to pass this bill.\n  Let me finish with a quick story. Not long ago a guy by the name of \nHenry--a Vietnam vet from Helena, MT--walked into my office. Henry \nfought in Vietnam. He was awarded four Purple Hearts for his combat and \nfor his sacrifice. Henry walked into my office, sat down across from my \nstaff member, and said: I can't live any more. Henry was in trouble. He \nhad behavioral health problems that he needed professional help to get \nfixed. We were able to get him to the VA. The VA had a behavioral \nhealth professional who was able to help Henry, and Henry is living a \ngood life today.\n  Our veterans deserve no less than to make sure they get the help they \nneed when they need it, and that is what this bill is about. So we will \nbe voting on a managers' package soon, and then we will be voting on \npassing this bill and getting it to the President's desk. Hopefully, we \ncan do it with a strong, healthy vote--a unanimous vote, as a matter of \nfact--because this is an important bill not only for military \nconstruction but also for veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, I move to concur in the House amendment \nto S. 1356.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on the motion to concur in the \nHouse amendment to S. 1356.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today the Senate will once again \nconsider the National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation \npassed the House last week in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 370 \nto 58. I hope we will have a similarly resounding vote here today.\n  Today's vote would not be possible without the hard work of Chairman \nMac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. It has \nbeen a privilege to work alongside him and the gentleman from \nWashington, Congressman Smith, to produce a defense authorization bill \nworthy of the troops it supports.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, for \nhis dedicated work on this legislation and his many substantive \ncontributions that made this a better bill.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for bringing this \nlegislation to the floor today and for his commitment throughout this \nprocess to ensuring we give our military the certainty they need to \nplan and execute their missions.\n  For 53 consecutive years, Congress has passed the National Defense \nAuthorization Act. That is a testament to the vital importance of this \nlegislation, which provides the authorities and support necessary for \nour military to defend the Nation. But perhaps at no time in the last \nhalf century has this legislation been so critical. Our Nation \nconfronts the most diverse and complex array of crises since the end of \nWorld War II--the rampage of ISIL's terrorist army, Iran's malign \nactivities across the Middle East, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and \nbloody intervention in Syria, China's continued pattern of assertive \nbehavior toward its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific, and the list goes \non, including what appears to be the recent bombing of an airliner over \nEgypt which apparently caused the loss of 244 lives, apparently an act \nof terror of monumental consequences.\n  Rising to the challenges of an increasingly dangerous world requires \nbold reforms to national defense, and that is what this legislation \ndelivers. The legislation is a reform bill. This legislation delivers \nthe most sweeping reforms to our defense acquisition system in a \ngeneration. The NDAA modernizes a 70-year-old military retirement \nsystem and extends benefits to hundreds of thousands of servicemembers \npreviously excluded under the old system. The legislation also makes \nsignificant reforms to Pentagon headquarters and management to ensure \nthat precious defense resources are focused on our warfighters rather \nthan bloated staffs. The bill identifies $11 billion in excessive and \nunnecessary spending from that request and reinvests those savings in \ncritical national security priorities, including more fighter aircraft, \naccelerated shipbuilding, strengthening our cyber defenses, and $300 \nmillion in vital assistance to Ukraine to resist Russian aggression.\n  We did all of this while upholding our commitments to our \nservicemembers, retirees, and their families. The NDAA reauthorizes \nover 30 special pays and bonuses, makes military health care more \nportable, increases access to urgent care facilities, strengthens \nsexual assault prevention and response, and knocks down bureaucratic \nobstacles to ensure servicemembers maintain access to the medicines \nthey need as they transition from Active Duty.\n  Finally, the legislation before us recognizes that a strong national \ndefense requires supporting our friends and allies and responding to \ncommon threats. With Vladimir Putin on the march, the NDAA includes \n$300 million to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, including $50 \nmillion for lethal assistance and counter-artillery radars. As China \ncontinues its aggressive behavior in the South China Sea, the NDAA will \nprovide $50 million to assist and train our allies in the region to \nincrease maritime security and the maritime domain awareness. As the \nTaliban mounts an offensive across Afghanistan, the NDAA authorizes \n$3.8 billion for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund to preserve the \ngains of the past decade and continue to degrade and defeat terrorists \nwho want to attack the United States and our allies.\n  This is an ambitious piece of legislation, but in the times we live, \nwe cannot afford business as usual in the Department of Defense. To \nprepare our military to confront our present and future national \nsecurity challenges, we must champion the cause of defense reform, \nrigorously root out Pentagon waste, and invest in modernization and \nnext-generation technologies to maintain our military technological \nadvantage. That is what this legislation is all about.\n  Additionally, I would point out that as our citizenry and our voters \nare deeply frustrated and angry about our failure to get anything done \nhere in the Congress of the United States, I would at least make the \ncomment that our highest priority and responsibility is defending the \nNation. I believe this legislation is an example of working not only on \nboth sides of the aisle but on both sides of the Capitol. I would argue \nthat this is the most significant reform legislation that has been \npassed in 30 years, but I would also tell my colleagues that this is \njust the beginning. This is the beginning of a bipartisan effort to \nreform the Pentagon, to reform the way we do business, to reform our \npriorities, and to reform the way the Pentagon was structured and our \ndefense was structured. The last time it was reformed was 30 years ago \nunder legislation called Goldwater-Nichols. Obviously, in the last 30 \nyears that world situation has changed dramatically--dramatically.\n  On a bipartisan basis, working across the aisle and across the \nCapitol, I can assure my colleagues that next year at about this time, \nthey will be seeing legislation that will try to address the challenges \nwe are now facing in the world--in a more chaotic world than we have \nseen since the end of World War II. That is not just John McCain's \nopinion; that is the opinion of every knowledgeable, respected national \nsecurity expert, ranging from Henry Kissinger, to Madeleine Albright, \nto Zbigniew Brzezinski, to Brent Scowcroft and others. We have to have \na reformed Pentagon to meet the challenges. One great example of that \nis cyber security. Thirty years ago there were no cyber attacks on the \nUnited States of America. Today it is one of the looming challenges we \nface.\n  I intend to carry on in the long tradition of this committee in which \nthe Senator from Rhode Island and I have worked in partnership in \naddressing these new challenges and these grave challenges to America's \nsecurity.\n  I am proud of this legislation. Could we have done more? Yes. Were \nthere different areas to which perhaps we should have paid more \nattention? Perhaps. But I would argue that this is the most significant \nreform legislation in the last 30 years.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Rhode Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the revised \nNational Defense Authorization Act conference report we have before us \ntoday. It is the result of months of collaborative work by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and a very thoughtful conference. I would like \nto join Chairman McCain and commend Chairman Mac Thornberry of Texas \nand Ranking Member Adam Smith of Washington. The collaboration, the \nthoughtfulness, and the consideration were extraordinary and \noutstanding throughout the conference process.\n  I have to say that from my point of view, the reason we are here \ntoday most fundamentally is the leadership of Chairman McCain on the \ncommittee. It was thoughtful, it was bipartisan, and it encouraged \nparticipation by all the members of the committee. There was vigorous \ndebate and then there were votes, and that is the way this\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\ncommittee and this Congress should operate.\n  Ultimately, too, I think it reflected what the Chairman has always \nbrought to his duties as a Member of the U.S. Senate and before that \nthe U.S. House of Representatives and before that the U.S. Navy--\nunderstanding that what we do here ultimately reflects and influences \nand shapes the service and sacrifice of millions of young Americans in \nuniform. The Chairman never forgets that. He has laid out some of the \nextraordinary reforms that have been included in this legislation, and \nhe has also indicated that we will continue to work next year under his \nleadership on additional reforms. These reforms in compensation, \npersonnel policies, and a host of others, are going to set us and our \nDepartment of Defense on a better path forward. Again, much of it is \nbecause of his leadership and his direction.\n  Previously, the National Defense Authorization bill came before the \nSenate and there was one area of major disagreement; that was the use \nof the overseas contingency operations fund. I must again thank the \nChairman because he allowed a vigorous debate, a vote on the floor, and \nultimately and very satisfactorily this has been resolved in the recent \nbudget agreement. So now we have legislation before us that raises the \nannual budget cap of the Department of Defense and other agencies, and \nit allows our defense to be more forward-looking and more able to \nrationally budget going forward. I think this has given us both the \nbudget authority and the proper direction so that we can have a much \nmore stable and much more predictable future. Again, I think it will be \na wonderful facilitator as we consider additional reforms next year in \nthe Defense Authorization bill.\n  The budget agreement also recognizes the fact that one of the \nchallenges is not only those programs that are controlled by the \nDepartment of Defense but also other agencies that are involved in \nnational security. Relief for those agencies is also important in \ncarrying out the mission of the Department of Defense and protecting \nthe American people.\n  With this new NDAA, I think we have been able to keep our pledge to \nthe men and women in uniform of the United States.\n  Let me finally conclude where I began. I thank Chairman McCain, \nChairman Thornberry, and Ranking Member Smith, but more particularly \nthe staff. We who have the privilege of serving on the Armed Services \nCommittee understand the extraordinary hours, the effort, the insight, \nand the total commitment of not only the committee staff members but \nthe staffs of the individual members. Their efforts are reflected in \nthis bill. It will not bear their names but, more importantly, it will \nbear their work. For that I thank them very, very much.\n\n  Let me urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, to join \nSenator McCain and others so that for the 54th straight year we will \nhave a National Defense Authorization Act that will become the law of \nthe United States.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this year, I voted in opposition to \nthe fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. Since \nthe Senate last voted on the fiscal year 2016 NDAA, Congress has passed \nand the President has signed the new Bipartisan Budget Act, which \nraised the discretionary caps on spending across the government, \naverted a default, and provided a path forward on appropriations.\n  The Bipartisan Budget Act also enabled authors of the NDAA to fix a \ngimmick that called for spending from overseas contingency operations, \nOCO, funding to meet requirements that should have been supported by \nthe Department's base budget. I remain concerned, however, that, in \norder to meet the new caps, budgetary authority had to be cut from this \nbill. Specifically, I do not believe that readiness funds for the Army, \nthe Army National Guard, and the Army Reserves should be slashed at the \nsame time that many in this body are demanding more soldiers be sent to \nplaces like Eastern Europe. This authorization bill will spend hundreds \nof millions of dollars on unneeded and ineffective missile defense \nprograms, for example, while cutting the training and preparation funds \nfor the men and women we send overseas. The bill also makes significant \nchanges to the defense acquisition system and, inexplicably, cuts key \nprovisions to support the National Guard that enjoyed support in both \nthe Senate and the House.\n  But perhaps most importantly, I am concerned that, in this new \nversion of the bill, Congress failed to reconsider the ill-advised \nrestrictions on detainee transfers from Guantanamo Bay that are \ncontained in this NDAA--restrictions that President Obama cited as one \nreason for his veto of the original version of the bill last month. I \nopposed passage of that conference report in part because it contained \na needless prohibition on transferring detainees to the United States \nfor detention or trial, and it imposed unnecessary restrictions on \ntransferring detainees to foreign countries.\n  Rather than working to address these misguided provisions, \nRepublicans in Congress have evidently decided to stand in the way of \nfinally bringing this terrible chapter to a close. They are making a \ngrave mistake. For over a decade, the detention facility at Guantanamo \nhas been a stain on our national reputation and served as a recruitment \ntool for terrorists. Guantanamo is also a tremendous waste of taxpayer \ndollars, costing approximately $3.4 million per year to maintain a \nsingle detainee--an astonishing amount of money that could be \nrepurposed to keep our men and women in uniform safe. Closing \nGuantanamo is the morally and fiscally responsible thing to do, and I \nam deeply disappointed that these restrictions have been included. That \nis why I was proud to cosponsor an amendment filed by Senator Feinstein \nto strip these troubling provisions from the bill.\n  The bill does include an extremely significant provision: the McCain-\nFeinstein antitorture amendment. Last year, Senator Feinstein and the \nSenate Intelligence Committee did this country a great service in \nexposing the CIA's horrific practices under the Bush administration. \nThe McCain-Feinstein amendment is a major step toward finally bringing \nto a close that dark, shameful chapter in our Nation's history. This \nprovision finally codifies in statute the interrogation standards in \nthe Army Field Manual--not just for military personnel, but for \nintelligence agents as well. It will clearly define acceptable \ninterrogation practices and will hopefully ensure that America never \nengages in torture again.\n  Providing certainty for the Department's men and women and their \nfamilies, as well as for military planners, is very important, and in \nsignificant ways, this bill accomplishes that. While this bill has \nshortcomings I hope we can address in the near future, I have given my \nsupport to its adoption and will only add that, in advance of Veterans \nDay and every day the men and women who serve and protect us deserve \nnothing less than the thanks of a grateful nation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to express reluctant support for \nthe fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Many parts of the agreement represent bipartisan consensus between \nChairman McCain, Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Reed, and Ranking \nMember Adam Smith. We all appreciate their hard work on those matters \nfor our troops and their families.\n  It provides well-deserved pay increases to our uniformed and defense \ncivilian workforce. It modernizes the personnel benefit system to \ninclude a government matched savings plan. It authorizes $300 million \nin assistance to Ukraine, of which $50 million may be lethal \nassistance. It codifies the President's Executive order against torture \nand ensures that interrogations follow the Army Field Manual. I wish to \nthank Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein in particular for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  In addition, it extends the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program so \nthat we may continue to keep faith with foreign translators who risked \ntheir lives working with our troops. It authorizes a number of military \nconstruction projects around the world, including $29 million in family \nhousing units at Rock Island Arsenal, IL. It reauthorizes the DOD-VA \npilot program at North Chicago, the Lovell Federal Health Care Center.\n  For these and many other reasons, I voted for the agreement, but it \nis a\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\ncompromise, and I must express my opposition to a few of its \nprovisions.\n  One of those points of disagreement is that the bill prevents the \nclosure of the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The reality \nis that, every day that it remains open, Guantanamo prison weakens our \nalliances, inspires our enemies, and calls into question our commitment \nto human rights.\n  Time and again, our most senior national security and military \nleaders have called for the closure of Guantanamo. In addition to the \nnational security cost, every day that Guantanamo remains open, we are \nwasting taxpayer dollars. We are spending $3.3 million per year for \neach detainee held at Guantanamo Bay--compare that with the estimated \n$78,000 that it costs to hold a detainee in a Federal super maximum \nsecurity prison.\n  Yet the conference agreement makes it even harder to transfer \ndetainees to foreign countries, prohibits transfers to the U.S., and \nprohibits construction or modification of facilities in the U.S.\n  All of us are committed to preventing terrorist attacks. Terrorists \ndeserve swift and sure justice and severe prison sentences.\n  But holding detainees at Guantanamo does not administer justice \neffectively. It does not serve our national security interests, and it \nis inconsistent with the country's history as a champion of human \nrights.\n  In order to conform to the budget agreement, the bill also includes \n$1.7 billion in reductions to headquarters management personnel. \nEveryone in the Senate wants to cut the fat from the Pentagon, but we \nmust make sure that these cuts are targeted toward inefficiency and \nwaste, as opposed to recklessly eliminating our valued DOD civilian \nworkforce.\n  The women and men who serve our Nation's defense outside of a uniform \nare our teammates in making our country secure. They process military \npay; investigate fraud, waste, and abuse; oversee expensive weapons \nprograms; and many more important functions. I am proud of each DOD \ncivilian, especially those who work in Illinois, and I will work to \nmake sure that the Congress supports their contributions to our \ncountry.\n  This is a very good agreement, these reservations notwithstanding. It \nis full of provisions which help our troops, reforms the way the \nPentagon does business, and provides for our military families. I thank \nSenator McCain and Senator Reed for their hard work and commend the \nbill's passage for the 54th year in a row.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK.

All right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks of the Senator from Delaware, I be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wicker). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, something came to my attention today that \nI haven't seen before. Actually, it is a blog which was apparently \nwritten by Ben Bernanke, the immediate past Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. He wrote it for the Brookings Institute, and he talked about \none of the pay-fors for the transportation bill for which we will be \nsending conferees to discuss later today.\n  As my colleagues may recall, the House passed a 6-year authorization \nbill for transportation--roads, highways, bridges, and transit--with \nfunding for 3 years. When we sent our legislation over to the House, \nthey came up with some new pay-fors. Frankly, it is not user fees, it \nis not even like pension smoothing, it is not like stealing TSA fees or \nCustom fees, but something new. They found money--about $40 to $50 \nbillion--in the Federal Reserve and said: Why don't we use that for \ntransportation spending?\n  Interestingly enough, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve has \nwritten about this issue, and it has been editorialized in today's \nWashington Post, among others. I will read a sentence or two out of \nChairman Bernanke's comments, if I may, talking about the new pay-for, \nwhere we take money from the Federal Reserve and use it for \ntransportation purposes.\n  Here is what Chairman Bernanke says:\n  More substantively--and this is what I want to focus on in the post--\n``paying'' for highway spending with Fed capital is not paying for it \nat all in any economically meaningful sense. Rather, this maneuver is a \nform of budgetary sleight-of-hand that would count funds that are \nalready designated for the Treasury as ``new'' revenue.\n  Every year this extra money that the Federal Reserve has is turned \nover to the Treasury. In fact, it may be as much as one-half trillion \ndollars. That money goes into the earnings that the Federal Reserve \nmakes, and at different points during the year, they turn money over to \nthe Treasury.\n  What the House language says here is that we are going to reduce that \namount of money that would normally go from the Federal Reserve to the \nTreasury during some part of this year, and we are simply going to pull \nthat money out and use it for transportation. Now, that money was going \nto go to the Treasury anyway. It was going to go from the Federal \nReserve to Treasury anyway, and now we are going to sort of slip in and \npull that money out and say: No, no, we are going to use it for roads, \nhighways, and bridges. It is a sleight of hand. GAO is blowing the \nwhistle on it as well, and I am delighted Chairman Bernanke is calling \nit for what it is.\n  Look, we had the opportunity to pay for transportation projects. We \nhad the opportunity to pay for roads, highways, and bridges, and to do \nit the old-fashioned way, and frankly, in a way that the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Inhofe, was in favor of. We have a tradition and \nhistory in this country of saying that things that are worth having are \nworth paying for, and people and businesses that use roads, highways, \nand bridges here in the past have said we ought to pay for the use of \nthem. Now we are looking at a transportation bill that says: No, we are \ngoing to take money from TSA--TSA fee increases--and instead of using \nit to make our skies and aviation safer, we are going to steal 10 years \nof TSA revenues and put it over here in transportation. We are going to \ntake money that ought to go to fortify our borders to make us stronger \nand better equipped so we can do a better job of finding out whether \nwhat is in the trucks is really produce or some other product, such as \nnarcotics--our border crossings, where we have literally tens of \nmillions of dollars' worth of trade going through trade every day--and \ninstead we are going to take those revenues and put them into \ntransportation.\n  There is the idea of taking money out of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, where we pay $80 to $90 to $100 a barrel and are now selling \nit for about half that and using the proceeds from that--buy high, sell \nlow--to pay for transportation.\n  The latest trick from the House is to take the money out of the \nFederal Reserve when it is already going to go to Treasury anyway. \nInstead, we are going to take that money away from the Federal Reserve \nand pretend like it has no consequence. Well, actually that $50 or $60 \nbillion would have reduced the deficit. That is where it would have \ngone.\n  This is not the way to do business. We had the opportunity to fully \nfund a robust transportation plan. Several of us--Senator Durbin, \nSenator Feinstein, and I--offered legislation, very much like Bowles-\nSimpson, that would actually restore the purchasing power of the gas \nand diesel taxes in this country. We have not raised them since 1993.\n  Since 1993, the Federal gasoline tax has been roughly 18 cents. It is \nnow worth less than a dime because of inflation. The diesel tax, since \n1993, is worth less than 15 cents. Nominally, it is 23 cents. \nMeanwhile, roads, highways, and bridges are more expensive. Asphalt is \nmore expensive, as is concrete, steel, and labor. Instead of being able \nto fund transportation in a genuine, honest kind of way, we are \nspending about $50 billion a year at the Federal level for \ntransportation. It is about one-third of what is being spent \nnationally. Out of that $50 billion, we are only raising $35 billion \nthrough our user fees, and we just go out and borrow the money for the \nrest. When we run out of money in the general fund, we go around the \nworld and borrow money from China and other places so that we can build \nroads, highways, and bridges.\n  When the Chinese are mucking around in the South China Sea or the \nSpratly Islands or some of those other places, we say: You can't do \nthat. They say: We thought you wanted to borrow our money. If they are \nmanipulating their currency or dumping their goods and products into \nour markets, we say: You can't do that. They say: We thought you wanted \nto borrow our money.\n  We should not be beholden to them or to anybody else. We should fully \nfund transportation projects, and we could do that.\n  The legislation that Senators Feinstein, Durbin, and I offered would \ngradually raise the tax on diesel and gasoline by 4 cents a year for 4 \nyears, and then index it going forward. How much money would that \ngenerate? That would generate about $220 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Our roads, highway, and bridges get D-plus these days. Why? Because \nabout a quarter of our bridges are in bad shape and the service of our \nroads and highways is as well. People say they don't want to pay any \nmore money for user fees on gas or diesel. Well, people paid less than \n$2 a gallon for gasoline at about 30,000 gas stations across America \nlast week.\n  My friends, as it turns out, if we actually did raise the price for \ngas and diesel by 4 cents a year for 4 years, what would the effect be \nin 2020--4 years from now--for average drivers? The out-of-pocket \nimpact would be about the cost of a cup of coffee a week. Meanwhile, \nbecause our roads, bridges, and highways are in such lousy\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nshape, we, as constituents--people who drive around this country--have \nan average cost of damage to our vehicles, tires, steering, and rims of \nour tires of over $350 a year. That is not my number; that is a real \nnumber.\n  The other thing that is going on here is that we sit in traffic a lot \nin our country these days because we are not addressing our bottlenecks \nand doing what we ought to be doing in terms of upgrading our roads, \nhighways, and bridges.\n  Every year Texas A does an analysis. What they do is to look at how \nmuch time we sit in traffic in this country. The average driver in this \ncountry sits in traffic 42 hours a year. In cities such as Washington, \nDC, the numbers are more like 80 hours a year. We are not moving. We \nare just sitting there wasting time, wasting fuel, and polluting the \nskies. We don't have to do that. Instead of doing something that is \nintellectually honest, what we are doing is really, I think, shameful. \nI think it is shameful.\n  Initially, I was just confused by what the House wants to do with the \nFederal Reserve by moving $50 to $60 billion out of there. Now that I \nunderstand what they are doing, it is even more shameful. We can do \nbetter than this, and the American people deserve better than that.\n  Our friends at the McKinsey Global Institute spent some time last \nyear trying to figure out if we were actually investing robustly in our \nroads, highways, and bridges in this country. They looked at how it \nwould affect our GDP and if it would have any effect on putting people \nto work. If we are willing to make robust investments for the next 10 \nyears instead of, frankly, not much at all in terms of investments, \nhere is what they said: We would grow GDP by about 1.5 percent per year \nfor the next 10 years. So far this year it has been somewhere between 2 \nand 2.5 percent. We could increase it by another 1.5 percent if we make \nthese kinds of honest investments. We are not going to come close to \nmaking robust investments.\n  The McKinsey Global Institute also told us that in terms of new \nemployment, if we were actually to invest robustly in roads, highways, \nand bridges in this country, we would put 1.8 million people to work \nbuilding roads, highways, bridges, and transit systems. But we are not \ngoing to do that.\n  We are not even close to what the McKinsey Global Institute was \ncalling for in robust investments that would actually grow our GDP by \n1.5 percent each year and increase employment by 1.8 million people. In \nfact, what we are passing here isn't even close to the 4 cents a year \nfor 4 years and indexing going forward. That produces $220 billion over \nthe next 10 years.\n  What we are doing is barely keeping Federal funding at $50 billion, \nand the way we are doing most of that is by sleight of hand and by \nusing money that has nothing to do with roads, highways, and bridges \nand nothing to do with businesses and people that use those \ntransportation modes to pay for them--nothing. And now we are about to \nname conferees and go to conference on that kind of deal? The American \npeople aren't stupid. They are not stupid.\n  Do you know what a bunch of States around the country--like 12 States \nin the last 2 years--did when they found out they were running out of \nmoney to build their transportation systems in their States? They \nraised their user fees. They actually raised them.\n  Do you know what happened when they had elections last November? Some \n95 percent of the Republicans who voted to raise their user fees were \nreelected, and 90 percent of the Democrats who voted to raise their \nuser fees in those 12 States were reelected. They didn't pay a penalty \nfor it. They were rewarded for it. The people who voted the other way--\nwho voted not to raise the user fees--didn't do as well. People aren't \nstupid.\n  We are going to have an opportunity here to name conferees and go to \nconference, and I just want to say that this man sitting next to me, \nJim Inhofe, is a good man. He chairs our Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Our committee reported out a very good 6-year authorization \nbill. He is proud of it. Senator Boxer and I worked on it, and I am \nvery proud of what we did. I commend Senator Inhofe for a great bill. \nThat is the authorization piece. If we could just stop there, we would \nbe fine. Unfortunately, the authorization is only half the game.\n  What was the picture of the guy they had on the floor not long ago? \nIt was a picture of a cowboy wearing a big hat and lying back sleeping, \nand the caption under the picture says: All hat, no cattle. Well, when \nyou have a great authorization bill but no real money to pay for it, \nthat is really all hat, no cattle. I don't think there is a better \nexample of it that I have seen than the legislation that we are going \nto be conferencing on very soon.\n  I wish I could sit here and say it is all going to work out and we \nwill do just fine, but that is not the truth. We have let a great \nopportunity pass us by. We are about to let a great opportunity pass us \nby.\n\n  We are worthy of a better opportunity than that, and frankly the \npeople of our country deserve a better effort than that.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. CARPER. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me say in response that a couple of \ntimes my good friend from Delaware has observed that the American \npeople are not stupid, but the American people also want highways. That \nis one of the big things they want. In fact, we have a document called \na Constitution that says we are supposed to be doing two things here: \ndefending America, and roads and bridges. And I think we both agree on \nthe significance of that.\n\n\n                                Burundi\n\n  I hope I will have time to get into something because our State \nDepartment of the United States of America is getting involved in \nBurundi, in their election. They had a duly-qualified election. The \nconstitutional convention declared that Nkurunziza, who is the \nPresident, had a legal election, and we ought to stay out of their \nbusiness. If there is time, I would like to elaborate on that, but I \nknow I am competing for time.\n\n\n                                 Gitmo\n\n  On the President's Gitmo message, we have--I will give a little \nchronology on that. On January 22, 2009, Obama signed an Executive \norder to close Gitmo within the year.\n  On February 3 of that same year, 2009, I introduced a bill to \npermanently prevent Gitmo detainees from being relocated anywhere in \nthe United States. At that time they were ready to talk about \nrelocating them to parts of my State of Oklahoma, in the Fort Sill \narea.\n  In May 2009 I authored bipartisan legislation with Senator Danny \nInouye to block funding to close Gitmo and to move the detainees \nanywhere on U.S. soil. That passed 90 to 6.\n  Every year since, Congress has blocked the attempts by this President \nand his administration to close Gitmo or move terrorist detainees into \nthe United States.\n  Every year, Congress has passed laws that continue to limit the \ntransfer of these detainees, including in the conference report for the \nfiscal year 2016 NDAA bill. That is what we are talking about right \nnow. It prohibits the transferring of Gitmo detainees to the United \nStates through December 31, 2016. That also tightens the restrictions \non the detainees being transferred to other countries.\n  The fiscal year NDAA also included language preventing closure of \nGitmo through December 31, 2016. However, this has not prevented \nPresident Obama from trying to empty Gitmo and releasing these \nterrorist detainees to any country he can pay to take them back and now \nthreatening an Executive order to bring them to the United States--to \nthe States of Colorado, South Carolina, and Kansas--against the will of \nthe Senators from those States, the House Members from those States, \nand the American people.\n  This is not the first time the President has gone against the will of \nthe American people and violated our laws. The President violated the \nlaw last June when he transferred the Taliban Five from Gitmo in \nexchange for Sergeant Bergdahl, and my colleagues will\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\nremember that issue. He failed to notify Congress. The laws we passed \nsaid they had to notify Congress 30 days in advance of any transfer of \nterrorists to any facility. His failure to adhere to the law he signed \nplaced our Nation's security at great risk.\n  Let me just mention--I carry this with me. If people realize whom he \nturned loose, the Taliban Five--this is a statement that was made by \nthe Taliban commander. His name is Mullah Khan. He was talking about \nMohammad Fazl. Keep in mind he was arguably the most dangerous person--\nterrorist--who was being held in Gitmo. He said:\n\n       His return is like pouring 10,000 Taliban fighters into the \n     battle on the side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right \n     lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in \n     Afghanistan.\n\n  These are the kinds of people he is turning loose.\n  According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 29 \npercent of the detainees transferred out of Gitmo have either been \nconfirmed or suspected of returning to the fight and killing Americans. \nThat is how serious this is.\n  Gitmo is outside the sovereign territory of the United States, which \nmeans detainees held there do not have constitutional rights. But if we \nput them back in the United States, it is very likely they would have \nthose rights.\n  I have a quote from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who \nsaid:\n\n       The question of what constitutional rights may apply to \n     aliens in government custody is unsettled, but it is clear \n     from existing jurisprudence that physical presence in the \n     United States would be a significant, if not a decisive, \n     factor.\n\n  I am also concerned about the security of the people here who would \nhave to guard these terrorists.\n  Back when a Thomson, IL, prison was discussed--that was in 2009--\nRepresentative Mark Kirk--at that time he was in the House; that was \nbefore he was in the Senate--called the move ``an unnecessary risk,'' \nand other Illinois Members were concerned that the transfer of \nprisoners--some for trial and some for indefinite detention--could make \nthe State a target for terrorists. Mark Kirk was then and is now \ncorrect that prisons holding these detainees will become magnets, and \nthere is the very real possibility that these detainees would recruit \nmore terrorists.\n  We have to keep in mind that a terrorist is not a criminal. A \nterrorist is someone who trains other people to be terrorists, and that \nis what we would be seeing happening in our courts.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller said there is the very real possibility \nthat Gitmo detainees will recruit more terrorists from among the \nFederal inmate population and continue Al Qaeda operations from outside \nthe country.\n  I have been to Gitmo several times, as has the occupier of the chair. \nIt is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for \nall detainees. When I was there, the biggest problem they had with the \ndetainees was that they were overweight. They are all obese because \nthey are eating so well. It is fully in compliance with the Geneva \nConvention and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum \nsecurity prison in the world, as tested by human rights organizations \nsuch as the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent \ncommission led by Admiral Walsh. It is a secure location away from \npopulation centers, and it has a $12 million expeditionary legal \ncomplex. That is a courtroom. We can't use our courtrooms because of \nthe confidentiality of information that is extracted from these \nindividuals and used in the courtroom, so they use the expeditionary \nlegal complex.\n  The last thing I would say is that it is clear that--and this comes \nfrom former CIA Director Leon Panetta. He was talking about the fact \nthat our President--talking about the way they were able to get the bad \nguy, and what they have refused to understand is the information they \nextracted at Gitmo was used to actually capture Osama bin Laden.\n  Anyway, we don't want that to happen, we can't afford to let that \nhappen, and we are going to do everything we can to keep the President \nfrom making that happen. This has become an obsession of his, and we \nare not going to let that happen.\n\n\n                                Burundi\n\n  Lastly, I do want to mention that on this whole issue in Burundi \nright now, we have to understand in this country that there are other \nnations that have their own systems of government. They are the ones \nthat have their elections. In this case, I happened to be there in \nBurundi when the court declared that the incumbent President, \nNkurunziza, was qualified to run again, even though they have a term \nlimit. The first term was not a complete term, so that didn't count, \naccording to the court. For us to come in afterward and say ``Well, we \nthink the court was wrong, we don't think he is qualified to run, and \nwe are going to withhold things from that country'' is something we \nshould not be doing in this country.\n  I can assure my colleagues that the six Members who went with me over \nthere were all on the scene and agreed that Nkurunziza should be \nlegitimately elected, and we should stay out of their business.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7884-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 2:45 \np.m. is equally divided.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to vote on a \nmotion to instruct the conferees on the highway bill. It will be a \nmotion to instruct them not to proceed with a Federal mandate that \nwould force these long double trailers called twin 33s on the 38 States \nwhere currently they are illegal.\n  This Senator would observe that it is not often we get a chance to \nvote on a motion that will accomplish so much. We are going to get a \nchance in 30 minutes or so to vote on a motion that will save lives. It \nis a motion that would prohibit a Federal mandate, that supports small \nbusiness, and that would save $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion per year in \nhighway maintenance. It is a vote that is supported by an overwhelming \nmajority of the American people. This is a rare opportunity for us to \ncome together on a motion that does all of those things.\n  It is also a bipartisan motion to instruct. It will be sponsored by \nthe Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, and there will be \nbipartisan votes for the motion on both sides of the aisle.\n  Now, why are we here? The motion is here because it stems from an \namendment in the Appropriations Committee to the Transportation \nappropriations bill, which would require every State to allow these \ntwin 33-foot trailers on Federal highways. Currently some 12 States do \nallow them. They have a right to do that, and if they made a considered \ndecision in their State legislatures and in consultation with their \ndepartments of transportation, then more power to them.\n  Well, 38 States say that these trucks are not safe and that these \ntrucks are too long. They tell us they don't want them on the highways. \nI think we should respect that decision by these 38 States.\n  Who supports the Wicker-Feinstein motion to instruct the conferees? I \ngo back to the point that this is a vote to save lives. Who says this? \nAAA, a respected nationwide organization that knows quite a bit about \nhighway safety, says support the Wicker amendment. Don't mandate on 38 \nStates something they don't want to do with these extra long trucks.\n  I would point out on this diagram the size of the average passenger \ncar. Look how much longer this proposed twin 33 double rig with the \ntractor part on the front is. Frankly, the American people don't want \nto contend with these long double trailers on their roads.\n  The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety say this isn't safe. A \n``yes'' vote\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\non the Wicker-Feinstein motion would be a vote for safety.\n  The National Troopers Coalition--we ought to listen to them--say \nthese trucks are not safe, and at the very least, there should be no \nmandate from Washington, DC. In the time remaining, I would suggest to \nMembers and legislative staff back in their offices to call their local \ntroopers in their various States and see what the troopers say about \nthis. I will tell you that troopers in State after State say don't \nmandate these long trucks. Sheriff's associations say don't mandate \nthese long trucks.\n  Chiefs of police say don't mandate these long, twin 33 double \ntrailers. So you may ask yourself what a chief of police in a \nmunicipality has to do with this. Aren't we talking about interstate \nhighways and big old Federal highways? Not true at all. I don't know \nabout you, but in the place where I live, if something comes in by \ntruck, they bring it right into town. So the chiefs of police say: We \ndon't want these twin 33s on our two-lane streets; we don't want them \non the two-lane highways. That would be the result of the mandate that \nis contained in the appropriations bill unless we turn that around.\n  Who else is opposed to mandating twin 33s on the 38 States that don't \nwant them? The State trucking associations are opposed to this mandate. \nOne would think that the truckers would be for this. After all, if you \nare a big enough trucking company and you have enough money, you can \nbuy the truck, haul more, and make more money. That is the idea, but we \nneed to bear in mind that most of the truckers in the United States are \nsmall business owners. Frankly, some of them have told me that if this \nmandate on all 50 States is passed, they are going out of business.\n  We have resolutions from the Mississippi Trucking Association, the \nArizona Trucking Association, Louisiana Trucking Association, and we \nhave an alliance of small business truckers from States that include \nIndiana, Texas, Tennessee, Nebraska, Louisiana, Maryland, Washington, \nIowa, Mississippi, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Arkansas--and I \ncan go on. Trucking companies and small truckers in all of these States \nare saying: Please don't put us out of business by having us try to \ncompete with these large twin 33s.\n  I would submit to my colleagues that 20 minutes from now we are going \nto have a vote. This is the only opportunity that 100 Senators elected \nby the people of the 50 States will have to address this issue. This \nvote we are going to take in just a few moments will send a strong \nsignal to the people in some office here on Capitol Hill, in some room \non Capitol Hill, where they are devising the Omnibus appropriations \nbill. We need to send a strong signal to them that we don't want this \nmandate in the omnibus. We don't want the mandate in the highway bill.\n  We need a strong vote. This is a chance to vote on how we stand with \nsmall business in our States, with the troopers, the sheriffs, the \nchiefs of police, the trucking associations, and the advocates for \nhighway safety.\n  I would urge my colleagues to thoroughly consider this in the next 20 \nor 25 minutes. When you come to vote, a ``yes'' vote will be a vote to \navoid the Federal mandate. I urge my colleagues to join me on a \nbipartisan basis--and I believe they will join me on a bipartisan \nbasis--in allowing the 38 States that opt out of this to continue to do \nso, making a stand for small business, for the States' decisionmaking, \nand for safety.\n  Mr. President, I understand we are going to move to a vote at 2:45 \np.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ntime while we are in quorum calls be divided equally between the \nparties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are about to vote on whether we want to \ngo to conference with our Transportation bill that passed this body \nwith well over 60 votes in July. We have been pushing hard--Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle--to move the House toward a situation where we \ncan finally go to conference and reconcile the two bills. We are at \nthat point, and I certainly hope we get a very solid vote.\n  I am also hopeful the Wicker-Feinstein motion does succeed, and I \ncertainly will try my best to raise it in the conference. We still have \nabout 1.5 million unemployed construction workers since the recession. \nWe have seen terrific job growth, but we know it hasn't hit all the \nsectors, so this is an extremely important bill.\n  Also, we know that thousands in businesses rely on a robust highway \ntrust fund. Whether it is the granite people, the cement people, they \nare all for going to conference. Whether it is the international \nassociation of machinists or it is the labor union, the chamber of \ncommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, it is a rare and \nglorious occasion to see everybody come together and say: Let's get a \nbill.\n  We want to have a robust bill. We don't want to have a bill that is \nbusiness as usual and this is why--we have 60,000 bridges that are \ndeficient. They were not built with the kinds of traffic they are now \nwithstanding in mind, so we must have this vote to go to conference.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator McConnell, for his work and the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Reid. I also extend my thanks to Senator \nCantwell, who worked so hard with other Senators on this side to get \nEx-Im included in this bill. We will have the Export-Import \nreauthorization in this bill.\n  I am very excited to get to conference. My goal is just to put it on \nthe table, to bring to that conference the bipartisan spirit we had \nwhen we did this bill in the Senate. When I thank both the majority \nleader and the Democratic leader, it is because they put strong people \non this conference. I think it is going to be a strong conference. We \nhave a lot of similarities. Somebody who looked at both bills said the \nHouse bill is about 90 percent similar to the Senate bill. This is a \ngood thing. This means we don't have to take our time because the trust \nfund, the authorization runs out very soon, right before Thanksgiving. \nSo it is a good moment for the Senate.\n  I think we showed leadership on both sides of the aisle on getting \nthis bill done. We continue to work well together, both leaders have \nsent strong conferees to the conference. I know our staffs are already \nspeaking, and I am hopeful we get a strong vote, which I think we are \ngoing to have in a few minutes. Am I correct it is about 3 minutes from \nthat vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. All right. So in 3 minutes I hope we have a solid vote to \ntake our bill to conference with the House, where I will work very \nclosely with Chairman Shuster and the rest.\n  The last point I make is I read that Congressman DeFazio--who is our \nDemocratic ranking member in the House T Committee--has had a very \nserious eye situation and had to go for emergency surgery. I wish to \nsay my heart is with him. He is a very important person in terms of \nweighing in on the transportation needs. I will work with him, I will \nspeak with him, and I am very hopeful that although he may not be \npresent--I hope he will be present for the conference--if he is not, I \nwish to reassure him that we will take his concerns into this \nconference.\n  I am looking forward to a strong vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time and \nproceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have a motion to instruct at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Wicker] moves that the \n     managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the \n     disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the Senate amendment \n     to the bill H.R. 22 be instructed to insist upon the \n     inclusion of the following section in title XXXII:\n\n     SEC. 32__. TRUCK TRACTOR-SEMITRAILER-TRAILER COMBINATION \n                   LENGTH LIMITATION.\n\n       The Secretary may promulgate a rule to increase the minimum \n     length limitation that a State may prescribe for a truck \n     tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination under section \n     31111(b)(1)(A) of title 49, United States Code, from 28 feet \n     to 33 feet if the Secretary makes a statistically significant \n     finding, based on the final Comprehensive Truck Size and \n     Weight Limits Study required under section 32801 of the \n     Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Enhancement Act of 2012 \n     (title II of division C of Public Law 112-141), that such \n     increase would not have a net negative impact on public \n     safety.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes. I will \nspeak briefly and then yield to Senator Feinstein.\n  This is what this is about, these twin 33 double trailers, which are \nlonger than is legal in 38 States. The question is whether we as a \nSenate, we as a Congress, we as a Federal Government, are going to \nmandate on the 38 States that don't allow these to allow them on their \nroads at any rate. So a ``yes'' vote would be a vote against the \nFederal mandate.\n  When do you get in one fell swoop an opportunity to vote--a vote that \nwill save lives, a vote to prevent a Federal mandate, a vote for small \nbusiness, a vote to save $1.2 to $1.8 billion a year in highway \nmaintenance, and a vote supported by the overwhelming majority of the \npeople?\n  Vote yes not to mandate this on the States.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if we look at that, that is 91 feet \nwith the twin 33s and the cab, 91 feet of truck. Thirty-eight States do \nnot want that in their States. This bill overwhelms that. We had an \namendment in the Appropriations Committee that would prevent that. It \nwas a tie vote.\n  Senator Wicker and I ask you, please don't force States to do this \nbefore the safety work is done by the Secretary. We have 4,000 people \nkilled every year from these trucks in all kinds of horrific \naccidents--and they are not as long as this one. These trucks would not \nonly be on the freeways, but they would be in the villages, the towns, \nand the cities as well.\n  I hope you will support this motion to instruct to protect the 38 \nStates and say: Before you do this, do the safety investigations and \ntell us these trucks are safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there time taken in opposition?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Blumenthal] moves that \n     the managers on the part of the Senate at the conference \n     on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the House \n     amendment to the bill H.R. 22 be instructed to insist upon \n     the inclusion of the rail safety provisions contained in \n     the amendment passed by the Senate on July 30, 2015, \n     including the authorization of grants for the installation \n     of positive train control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, in recent years all of our \nconstituents have seen a scourge in rail accidents. There have been \nsimilar accidents all around the country. This motion insists that the \nSenate's provisions be included in this conference and in what comes \nout of the conference committee, including the authorization of grants \nfor the installation of positive train control.\n  This summer, with the leadership of the committee chairman, Senator \nThune, and the ranking member, Bill Nelson, who are both champions of \nrail safety, in this instance it resulted in some very key reforms, and \nthe Senate passed the DRIVE Act which is not perfect--troublesome in \nsome highway safety elements--but forward thinking on rail safety. It \nincludes funding for PTC, redundant signal protection, improved \ninspection practices, and a followup on the FRA's deep dive \ninvestigation. Along with cameras and grade crossing, these provisions \nhelp to advance the cause of rail safety.\n  The House has done nothing.

Mr. President, I am honored to represent nearly 500,000 \nMissouri veterans in the Senate. Tomorrow, on Veterans Day, we pause to \nreflect on the countless contributions and sacrifices that the men and \nwomen who serve in uniform and have served in uniform have made to our \ncountry. I hope we will all use this opportunity to recommit ourselves \nnot only to appreciate their service but to be sure that the \ncommitments our government has made to them are commitments that we \nmove forward on and that they are commitments that we look at the time, \nplace, and the veterans being served and decide when they need to be \nchanged. I think one of the things we have done in the last year to \ncreate more choices and more competition for veterans is an important \nstep in that direction.\n  When I introduced the Excellence in Mental Health Act with Senator \nStabenow, one of our biggest support groups for that act, which not \nonly would treat behavioral health care like all other health care but \nwould also create more opportunities to access behavioral health care, \nwere the younger veterans. The Iraq and Iran veterans and the veterans \nfrom Afghanistan wanted to have more choices and were big supporters of \nnot just traditional VA services but other services as well.\n  I am pleased that the bill today steps forward in important ways and \ndoes things for veterans. The bill we just voted on, the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs appropriations bill, actually reached \na record level of funding for veterans services. It increases veterans \nservices by $7.9 billion over last year's levels, and it appropriates \n$1 billion more than the President asked for.\n  It was also a bipartisan vote for lots of reasons. There should be no \nmore of a bipartisan cause among all the funding bills than a bill that \ntakes care of veterans and provides the facilities for those who are \nserving and for their families' needs. This is an important matter for \nus to address, and this is a great week for us to do it.\n  This bill provides specific funding for women veterans. I was at a \nwomen's veterans clinic in St. Louis recently. This bill includes \nadditional care for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. It provides \ntreatment for the kinds of traumatic brain injuries that veterans often \nleave the military with today, which they did not have post-9/11 and \npost the cowardly devices that are used to attack our people in the \nservice.\n  It increases veterans funding in areas such as health care, benefit \nclaims processing, medical research, and technology upgrades. It also \nincludes funding for construction and renovation of projects that \nensure military readiness and improve the quality of life for military \nfamilies.\n  As GEN Ray Odierno, the recently retired Chief of Staff of the Army, \nhas said, our military families are the strength of the military. \nSenator Gillibrand and I recently introduced a bill--The Military \nFamilies Stability Act--that allows us to do new things. It allows \nfamilies for educational or professional reasons to stay longer or \nleave earlier, depending on when the person serving gets transferred. \nIf there is a month of school left or a professional matter that the \nspouse needs to be a part of and needs to finish a job quickly or go to \na job early, why wouldn't we want to allow that to happen through \nlegislation? This legislation looks at military families' needs, among \nthe other things it looks at.\n  Because of the dissatisfaction that many of our veterans \nappropriately have with the Veterans' Administration, this bill \nincludes necessary reforms such as protection for whistleblowers, the \nkind of protection that construction oversight managers need, and it \nassesses some new measures for construction oversight so that we don't \nhave these facilities costing more than they should cost.\n  Frankly, if we look at competitive alternatives that veterans should \nhave available to them, it is probably a good time to think about how \nwe could make that program work better--rather than to continue to \ninvest more money in facilities that they have to drive by--with better \nlocations to get to that would give them that choice.\n  This bill has been ready for months now. I was disappointed the \nDemocrats blocked consideration of this bill earlier this year, but I \nam pleased that we finally got to a bill that everybody could vote for. \nIt actually shows how shortsighted the lack of willingness was to let \nus do our work, to bring this\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nbill to the floor, and to let Members offer amendments. Those \namendments were either included in the bill or explained to Members: \nNo, this is already in there. We have already taken care of this, and \nthis is why this doesn't have to be done.\n  We have a real obligation to take care of our veterans--those who \nhave served for our country--and I hope we continue to build on the \nwork we have done today.\n  Earlier today we also passed the bipartisan Defense Authorization \nAct, another bill we could have gotten to earlier. In fact, the House \npassed it earlier. The President vetoed it, but now that same essential \nbill goes back to the President's desk because some other problem has \nbeen solved that should never have been tied to authorizing the defense \nof the country.\n\n  Every year since 2011, the Congress has passed and the President has \nsigned a bill just like the bill we passed today that would make it \nclear to the President that the Congress doesn't want the President to \ngo forward with his proposed changes for Guantanamo. Unfortunately, the \nmedia reports suggest that the President once again is considering \nacting unilaterally to bring terrorists to the United States. Both of \nthese bills today said no terrorist can be brought to the United States \nfrom Guantanamo.\n  It is another example of the President ignoring the law, deciding \ninstead: I am going to enforce the law I want to enforce, and I am \ngoing to ignore the law I want to ignore. He did that a few months ago \nwith Executive amnesty. The President decided there are some laws that \nrelate to people who are in the country and who are here without \ndocuments that he doesn't intend to enforce. Unfortunately for the \nPresident and fortunately for the law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit ruled last night that the President can't do what the \nPresident said he was going to do. An earlier court had immediately \nsaid the President can't do what he said he was going to do.\n  This morning, I heard one of the spokesmen for the White House say: \nWell, every legal expert we have talked to believes the President has \nthe authority to do this. Well, apparently none of the legal experts \nthey have talked to are Federal judges, because Federal judges now, at \nthe two levels below the Supreme Court, have decided that the President \ndoesn't have, in all likelihood, the authority he says he has.\n  The courts, along with a bipartisan majority of the Congress, have \ntaken the President to task on a sweeping new rule on waters of the \nUnited States--an issue we debated here last week. The law says the EPA \nhas the authority to regulate navigable waters in the country. For 170 \nyears everybody understood what that meant, and I think everybody still \nprobably understands what that means, even the people at the EPA, who \nwant it to mean something much broader than it clearly means. The \nFederal courts, again, at both the first level and the appeals level--\nthe appeal of the appeal court and the appeal court have said: No, you \ndon't have the authority to do that. We are not going to let that rule \ngo into effect.\n  That rule, by the way, in my State would put more than 99 percent of \nall of the geography of Missouri under the control of the EPA for \nanything that is related to water, including any water that runs off a \nroof, any water that runs off a parking lot, any water that runs down a \nroadside ditch. If the EPA wants that authority, they need to come to \nthe Congress and say: Change the law. Give us the authority over all of \nthe landmass, 99.3 percent of Missouri and similar amounts in many \nother States. Give us that authority.\n  Of course, the Congress wouldn't do that. The Congress knew what they \nwere doing when they said ``navigable waters,'' and the EPA has never \nsuggested to the Congress that the Congress change the law. The EPA \nwould like to change it on their own, but the Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals said: No, you don't have the authority to do that.\n  Here is another issue that has to go to the Supreme Court. \nApparently, the President doesn't mind going to the Supreme Court and \ndoesn't mind being reversed by the Supreme Court. The President \nparticularly, it appears, doesn't mind being reversed by the Supreme \nCourt if somehow the rules got by the other two levels of Federal \ncourt, as the mercury rule did 2 years ago. Twenty-two months later, \nwhen the Supreme Court finally ruled, they said: No, the EPA doesn't \nhave the authority to regulate that item in that way. But even people \nat the EPA said: Well, even though we didn't have the authority, 1,500 \npowerplants had to close down permanently because of the rule. And they \nseemed to take great pleasure in the fact that the rule accomplished \nits goal even though the law was not served and the EPA, according to \nthe Supreme Court, didn't have the authority for that rule.\n  On the President's overreach, I reintroduced a law again this year--\nthe Executive Needs to Faithfully Observe and Respect Congressional \nEnactments of the Law Act--the ENFORCE Act--which simply says something \none would never think the Congress would have to say to the President, \nwhich is: Mr. President, you have to enforce the law. Mr. President, \nyou have taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. There is a way to do \nthis job in a constitutional way, and there is a way to do the job in \nthe way you are doing it now.\n  We shouldn't need this bill. The President swore to uphold the law. \nWith the action we took today, we see another place where the Congress \nhas clearly spoken over and over and over again, and the President \nsays: If the Congress won't do this, I am going to do it on my own.\n  Apparently, the President has discovered some authority as Commander \nin Chief to close military bases. Does that mean the President on his \nown can close any military base in the country? I don't think that is a \nprecedent we want to set. There is a way to do this. The Congress has \nto be involved. The laws of the Constitution have to be respected.\n  Over and over again, even on the eve of Veterans Day--a celebration \nof those who did more than anybody else to defend our freedoms--even on \nthe eve of Veterans Day, we need to remind ourselves what the \nConstitution is all about, what the country stands for, and the \nfreedoms those veterans were willing to serve to defend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7888-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7888-S7890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is my habit to give my ``Time to \nWake Up'' speeches once a week when the Senate is in session. It is \nalso a practice of mine to go to other States--particularly States that \nhave Republican Senators--to look at what is happening in the States \nand get a sense of where the local universities and the local experts \nare with respect to climate change. My last visit was to Ohio. I have \nalso been to New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, \nFlorida, Tennessee, and Iowa. The thing that is common across all of \nthose trips is that there is no denying climate change in those States. \nThe denial is the function of this building, and it is the function of \nthe wall of money the fossil fuel industry has erected around this \nbuilding. But pick a State university in the country and go there, and \nwe find there is simply not climate denial.\n  I am joined today by my friend Sherrod Brown, Ohio's senior Senator, \nwho was kind enough to accompany me on the trip--on several parts of \nit, anyway. We went to Cleveland. We had a couple of meetings there \ntogether. Another one of my visits was to Lake Erie, which got \nclobbered by the cyanotic bacteria that shut down Toledo's water \nsystem, which is also climate change-related.\n  Let me yield to the Senator from Ohio for a few moments, and then we \ncan talk about Cleveland and the lake.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse.\n  When I introduced Senator Whitehouse to the mayor of Cleveland and to \na number of experts in Cleveland, from public health officials, to wind \nenergy entrepreneurs, to community groups to whom climate change \nmatters so much, I introduced him as probably--not just probably--there \nis no person in the Senate who has done a better job of focusing public \nattention on the threats of climate change and what it means to our way \nof life and what it means to our country. I thank Senator Whitehouse \nfor that.\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\n  I want to point to what happened in Toledo, OH, in 2011. This green \ncolor in this picture is algae bloom. This is a small boat that is \nmaking its way through the algae bloom.\n  This wasn't even the year Toledo residents lost their water supply. \nIn 2014--last August, 15 months ago--algae blooms were so serious in \nLake Erie and in the western basin--Toledo is in the western basin of \nLake Erie, Cleveland is sort of central, and then Ashtabula and Erie, \nPA, are in the eastern basin of Lake Erie. Again, this is not the most \nserious situation, although the algae bloom is so overwhelming here. \nThis green is all algae bloom. The lake actually should be the color--\nwhere you can see dark blue here, that is normally the color of the \nlake. We can see the wake of the boat, and that is the normal color of \nthe lake, as the boat plowed through the algae bloom.\n  The problem with Lake Erie is that it is the most vulnerable lake \nbecause it is the shallowest lake in the western basin of Lake Erie. In \nthis part of Lake Erie, it is only 30 feet deep. It is fed by the \nMaumee River, which is the largest tributary of any river into any of \nthe five Great Lakes. Keep in mind that it is 30 feet deep here, fed by \nfarmland and commercial activity and industry and homeowners--greater \nToledo in northwest Ohio. Contrast that with Lake Superior. It is 30 \nfeet deep here, and Lake Superior is 600 feet deep on average. And Lake \nSuperior mostly drains forests, so we can see why Cleveland and Toledo \nare so vulnerable to climate change and so vulnerable to pollution and \nall that has happened with the algae blooms.\n  People in Toledo--500,000 people lost their drinking water for 2\\1/2\\ \ndays. People were great, stepping up from all over southern Michigan, \neastern Indiana, and northwest Ohio to ship in water for people. But it \nmade such a--it says to us that climate change isn't the only reason \nthis happened, but it is clearly happening. We are seeing this algae \nbloom worse and worse and worse in hot weather.\n  One other thing about this Great Lake. Lake Erie is only 2 percent of \nall of the Great Lakes' water--five Great Lakes. Lake Erie is only 2 \npercent of all the Great Lakes' water because it is shallow and its \nsurface areas are not as big as the others. Fifty percent of the fish \nof all of the Great Lakes are in Lake Erie because fish will produce \nand will prosper in shallower, warmer water, but the water was too warm \nbecause of climate change and all of the things that came out of that.\n  In this meeting we had with Dr. Aparna Bole--a pediatric specialist \nat Cleveland's University Hospital--she talked about asthma rates. We \nheard from others too.\n  I will turn it back to Senator Whitehouse and ask him what he learned \nfrom these meetings. He was not just in meetings with people in \nCleveland learning about what climate change means there, he also went \nto the Stone Lab and he can tell us about that. Then he had an amazing \nmeeting at Ohio State University with some of America's amazing climate \nscientists. I will kick it back to Senator Whitehouse and again thank \nhim for traveling the country every single week and looking for places \nwhere climate change has done the most damage in terms that people can \nunderstand. His leadership is so important.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for the work he has done, and I am so \ngrateful he came to the city of Cleveland and joined us.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Well, I was very happy to join the Senator. I thought \nFrank Jackson was extremely impressive on this subject. He pointed out \nthat there are times in life when we simply have to go to the future, \nand if you decide to hang on to the past, you will fail as a result of \nmissing that curve. He said that the business community in Cleveland \nwas really beginning to get that, beginning to take it on. So he has \nled with a Cleveland Climate Action Plan, which is one of the best ones \nin the country.\n  We went to a great place where they are growing lettuce \nhydroponically, 3, 4 acres in an old building, under an open glass \nceiling. They are using captured rain water; they are recycling it. The \npeople there have jobs that pay well. They were the owners of the \nproject and they were really vested in it. Wasn't the morale of the \npeople working there phenomenal? It was terrific.\n  Dr. Aparna Bole, whom Senator Brown mentioned, was very in tune to \nwhat was happening in minority communities as a result of climate \nchange from asthma, from heat. She is seeing it with her young \npatients. She was wonderful, talking about that. At this point, because \nof toxic ground level ozone and ragweed being triggers for asthma \nattacks--she has seen so much of that. She said that more than one in \nfive African-American kids in Cleveland has asthma, and she connects it \nto what is happening in climate change.\n  Of course, we understand that in Rhode Island because we have the \nsame bad air days where we have to have kids stay indoors and elderly \npeople stay indoors, all because of the air coming from the Midwest \nthat has been fouled by these coal-burning powerplants.\n  Out on Lake Erie I met with some of the scientists from Stone Labs \nand a couple of the lifelong fishing captains who had been out there on \nthe lake. Here are some of the water samples we took while we were out. \nIt is clean now--this is what the water should look like--but back \nbefore, when the climate change-driven rain bursts were flooding Lake \nErie with phosphorus from the farms in the watershed, there was an \nexplosion of cyanotic bacteria to the point where these guys said \ndriving their boats wasn't like driving through water, it was like \ndriving through pudding, and the wake would slurp over instead of \nturning the way a regular boat's wake would. One of them had been doing \nthis for 35 years and he said: I don't know this lake any longer. I \ndon't know where the fish are going to be. For 35 years I have fished \nthis lake, and now it is like a stranger to me because of all these \nchanges that are happening.\n  That is exactly what my Rhode Island fishermen are telling me, too, \nabout Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound. We are here with the \nSenator from Massachusetts. ``Sheldon, it is getting weird out there. \nSheldon, this is not my grandfather's ocean.'' We have some \nresponsibilities to pay attention to these people and to listen to \nthem.\n  One of the most impressive parts of the trip was this at Ohio State. \nOhio State is host to the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center named \nafter the famous polar explorer Admiral Byrd. These two scientists, \nEllen Mosley-Thompson and Lonnie Thompson, have spent their lives \ntraveling all over the planet going to these incredible, faraway \nplaces--the North Pole, the South Pole, to the Greenland icecap, going \nto glaciers high in Peru, going to glaciers in the faraway mountains of \nChina. They drill down and take a core sample out of the glacier and \nget hundreds of thousands of years of data in that core sample.\n  Then there you are on the top of a glacier in Peru or China, and you \nhave to figure out how to get this core sample back to Ohio--and it has \nto stay frozen the whole time. So they had this huge logistical \nchallenge. They conquered all of that. They are two amazing people.\n  These are all the core samples from glaciers all around the globe. \nSome of them, because of the way climate has dissipated the glaciers, \nwhere they drilled the core sample the glacier doesn't exist anymore. \nIt is the last record of gone glaciers.\n  Here is a picture they had. This is the same site. On this side is a \npicture of the glacier. You can see striations from the seasons and \nyears going by, and they took this picture from the same place. You can \nsee how the glacier used to be right in front of them and now this \nglacier is off in the distance. It has moved back as the climate has \nwarmed.\n  They gave me this. This is a piece of plant matter. You can hardly \nsee it. It is plants that were unearthed as the glacier moved back, and \nthey can date them. Those plants were last out 6,626 years ago, when a \nsnow covered those plants. Snow piled on to snow and it was buried \nunder the glacier. It stayed and it stayed, and thousands of years went \nby. Then, after thousands of years had gone by, Jesus came and walked \nthe Earth, and then thousands more years came by, and now the glaciers \nare melting so fast that here it is. You can look, and you can still \nsee the leaves. It is squashed and old, but it hasn't decomposed \nbecause of the way\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\nit was preserved under the glacier that is going away now. In this \nlaboratory they have this incredible treasure. You can go in and you \ncan find air that was on this planet when Jesus walked the Earth, and \nit is still preserved just the way it was in the ice. You can find dust \nfrom dust storms that were written about in Egyptian hieroglyphics, and \nthere is the actual dust held in the ice. This is the record that the \nclimate science is based on, and it truly is a marvel.\n  The last thing I will mention is that we also stopped by the Ohio \nState Center for Automotive Research. Here is a brandnew Camaro in the \nbackground. They work with GM to get cars brand-spanking-new, a high-\nperformance American Camaro. These students are going to take it apart \nand put it back together so it runs cheaper, faster, and with less \nfuel. They are going to make a hybrid Camaro with the same level of \nperformance, and it is really very impressive what they are doing. They \nknow climate change is here. That is why they are doing this stuff.\n  I will close out because I have other Senators waiting, but I thank \nSenator Brown for taking me around Cleveland, meeting all the people we \ndid, and taking me on those visits. I thank the folks at Ohio State. \nStone Labs out on Lake Erie is an Ohio State facility. The Byrd Polar \nand Climate Research Center is an Ohio State facility. I met with the \nJohn Glenn Institute folks at Ohio State University.\n  Look, if you are a Buckeye fan and you are listening, pay attention \nto what Ohio University says about climate change. Don't listen to the \nfossil fuel phonies. Listen to what your home State university says. \nThese guys are deadly serious. They know it is real. I don't think \nthere is a home State university in this country that is denying \nclimate change, and yet this body is stuck in denial. It has nothing to \ndo with the facts; otherwise the home State universities would say \nsomething different. You can't go home and root for the Buckeyes on the \nweekend and then come here and deny climate change and pretend you are \nbeing true to your home State university. I don't care what your home \nState is--Iowa, Oklahoma, Florida, Georgia--you name it. Go to the big \nState universities. They understand that climate change is real.\n  What prevents us from acting isn't information, it is the wall of \nspecial influence money that the fossil fuel industry has built around \nthis place, and it is time we woke up and got on with our business. So \nI will close with that.\n  I am grateful for the people in Ohio who showed me around, \nparticularly to Dave Spangler and Paul Pacholski, lifelong charter boat \ncaptains. They make their living out on Lake Erie. They know what it is \nlike out there, and they know what climate change is doing to their \nbeloved lake and their beloved way of life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7890-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7890-S7892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OVERSIGHT OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, oversight of the executive branch of \ngovernment by the Congress is as old as the Constitution, it is a \ncritical role, and it is one that was intended by the writers of the \nConstitution. I believe oversight leads to better government, better \nlaws, and actually saves the taxpayers money. That is why this Senator \nworks very hard at oversight.\n  I went after the Reagan Defense Department for wasteful spending in \nthe 1980s. I held up the Department of Justice nominees during the Bush \nadministration to get my oversight letters answered, just as I am doing \nnow with the Obama Department of State. I voted in support of giving \nthe Judiciary Committee the authority to issue subpoenas regarding its \ninquiry into the firing of U.S. attorneys during the Bush \nadministration when a lot of Republicans didn't want that to happen. My \nbelief in and exercise of the oversight role by Congress is \nlongstanding and nonpartisan.\n  Yesterday the Senate minority leader said my investigation into the \nDepartment of State's use of special government employee designations \nand how Secretary Clinton's private email arrangement interfered with \nthe Freedom of Information Act compliance is political. This simply is \nnot so. This investigation involves many things, but it does not \ninvolve politics. His speech yesterday inferred that I was doing all \nthese things for political reasons. That is simply not true, nor is it \nin accordance with my reputation as an equal opportunity overseer.\n  My investigation into the potential abuse of the special government \nemployee designations and Secretary Clinton's use of a personal email \nserver and the potential spillage of classified information is not \npolitical. It is evidence-based, and it has something to do with our \nnational security.\n  Unfortunately, the Department has been largely uncooperative since \nJune of 2013. The Department's lack of cooperation has caused me to \nplace 22 holds on its nominees. These are not secret holds. I have \nplaced, according to the rules of the Senate, a statement in the Record \nof why those holds are placed, and to correct the senior Senator from \nNevada, my holds do not include 600 Foreign Service officers and do not \ninclude individuals from Iowa.\n  With respect to my pending requests to the Department of State, I am \nstill waiting for a full production of documents from my June 2013 \noversight request--the constitutional responsibility of those of us who \npass laws and appropriate money. That happened to be 2\\1/2\\ years ago, \nand the State Department has still not produced the materials I have \nrequested. The Department has implemented several clever strategies to \ndelay the process. I will give you some examples. The Department \nroutinely assigns new employees to handle different requests. Each time \na new employee is assigned we get the same excuses why they cannot \ndeliver on our requests. These excuses go something like this: I am \nnew, so I don't know who to talk to and where to find the documents.\n  For years the Department has delayed in productions, each time with \nmore excuses. For instance, the Department still refuses to answer \nwhether Secretary Clinton's private server was approved. The Department \nhas failed to provide emails for Department personnel communicating \nabout Secretary Clinton's private server that we have strong reason to \nbelieve exist. The Department took over 2 months to schedule a single \ninterview with a former employee. The Department for over 2 months has \nrefused to provide instructions it gave to Clinton attorney David \nKendall to secure the thumb drives that contained classified \ninformation--even though the Department was quoted in the news as \nproviding those instructions. The Department has failed to provide \ntravel reimbursements and leave documents for its employees. On August \n5 of this year, I requested classification nondisclosure forms for \nSecretary Clinton, Huma Abedin, and Cheryl Mills. On November 5, the \nDepartment provided those documents to a Freedom of Information Act \nrequester but not to the committee.\n  I highlight that. The Freedom of Information Act request was made, \nbut the same information that was sought by a congressional committee--\none was granted and the other so far has been denied. While the \nDepartment provided the documents to that requester under the Freedom \nof Information Act, Department employees told me they had been unable \nto find those documents.\n  Not only has the Judiciary Committee experienced unacceptable \nDepartment of State delays in receiving the information we request, \nothers inside and outside of the government have experienced delays as \nwell.\n  The Associated Press sued the State Department over the failure to \nsatisfy repeated document requests under the Freedom of Information Act \nrelated to these same agents. One of these requests dates back 5 years \nago.\n  Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia, the judge responsible for this case, scolded the State \nDepartment for its failure to produce documents on time:\n\n       Now, any person should be able to review that in one day--\n     one day. Even the least ambitious bureaucrat could do this.\n\n  Let there be no mistake about this investigation. This investigation \nis centered on the Freedom of Information Act, a law that is within the \nJudiciary Committee's jurisdiction. This investigation is centered on \npotential abuse of the special government employee designation that \nallows government employees to be paid by outside\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\nemployers, in this case hundreds of thousands of dollars by a \nconsulting firm run by a former Clinton administration employee.\n  This investigation is centered on potential violations of the Federal \nRecords Act and holding government officials accountable for their \nactions. This investigation is centered on whether public officials \nproperly handled classified information.\n  Nobody is above the law. Senior government officials and regular \nemployees should get equal treatment under the law, and that treatment \nshould be fair and objective. It should not depend on what your \nposition is.\n  When it looks like the treatment is different, we have to figure out \nwhat is going on. For example, it looks like other government employees \nare subject to very different treatment when accused of mishandling \nclassified information.\n  Army LTC Jason Amerine, a decorated war hero, contacted Congress to \ntry to warn about bureaucratic problems with U.S. hostage recovery \nefforts, problems that he believed were putting lives at risk. He was \naccused of improperly transmitting classified information to Congress \nin the process.\n  This war hero was removed from his job, was escorted out of the \nPentagon, had his clearances suspended, had his scheduled retirement \ndelayed indefinitely, was fingerprinted and had a mug shot taken, was \nthreatened with court-martial, and was subject to extensive \ninvestigation.\n  After almost a year of being investigated, the Army decided not to \ncourt-martial Lieutenant Colonel Amerine.\n  Instead, he was awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally \nmeritorious service and was finally allowed to retire. But look at how \ndifferently he, a war hero, was treated when accused of mishandling \nclassified information compared to Secretary Clinton and her \nassociates. Where was the minority leader in trying to help this war \nhero from these attacks from this administration?\n  Nowhere to be seen is the answer to that.\n  It is apparent that some have a selective memory when it comes to \nputting value on oversight and investigations. But I do not. I have \nbeen consistent in my oversight role my entire career, investigating \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  My oversight and investigations unit is involved in many \ninvestigations. The vast majority of them have nothing to do with \nSecretary Clinton.\n  Looking out for the public interest isn't a waste of time, and I will \nkeep at it regardless of misguided attacks on my motivations and \nmischaracterizations of my work. I will continue this investigation \nbecause the American people have a right to the truth and government \nofficials have an obligation to answer to ``We the People.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article dated \nSeptember 4, 2015, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Daily Beast, Sept. 4, 2015]\n\n                   The Hillary Email Double Standard\n\n                          (By Danielle Brian)\n\n       How whistleblowers see their lives destroyed over \n     infractions the powerful get away with.\n       Watching the news about Hillary Clinton's emails, it is \n     remarkable to see how many people now have opinions about the \n     overclassification of information and the relative merits of \n     prosecuting people for mishandling classified material or \n     destroying government records.\n       Newspapers, blogs, and television reports are full of \n     pundits explaining the law as they see it, with people \n     opining about who is right: the two Inspectors General who \n     assert there was classified material in her emails, or the \n     State Department, which asserts that the information was not \n     classified at the time.\n       So where were all these ``experts'' when whistleblowers \n     accused of the same infraction--mishandling classified \n     material--were forced to spend a fortune on lawyers, were \n     fired from their jobs, and were threatened with imprisonment?\n       The amount of time being spent by Hillary Clinton defenders \n     and detractors parsing rules, policies, and laws on whether \n     she broke the law is maddening. That time desperately needs \n     to be spent on transforming the classification system and \n     modernizing electronic records retention policies, as \n     promised in the Obama administration's second National Action \n     Plan for the Open Government Partnership nearly two years \n     ago.\n       It is hard to reconcile Clinton's actions with her speech \n     at the 2012 opening session of the Open Government \n     Partnership: ``In the 21st century, the United States is \n     convinced that one of the most significant divisions among \n     nations will not be north/south, east/west, religious, or any \n     other category so much as whether they are open or closed \n     societies. We believe that countries with open governments, \n     open economies, and open societies will increasingly \n     flourish. They will become more prosperous, healthier, more \n     secure, and more peaceful.''\n       She was right then. It is essential to maintain the records \n     of our policymakers for historical analysis so that the \n     public can know what actions have been taken in our name by \n     our leaders. Clinton did not maintain these records. The fact \n     is she indisputably broke the rules, and although that is not \n     a criminal offense, it certainly is a political one.\n       Even more infuriating is the disparity of treatment between \n     the politically powerful and everyday truth-tellers. High-\n     level officials often receive little more than a tap on the \n     wrist for mishandling classified information. But \n     whistleblowers seeking to expose wrongdoing and protect the \n     public are almost without exception subjected to overzealous \n     investigations and prosecution.\n       Rather than focusing on the distinction between whether a \n     person deliberately released classified information or not, \n     the more appropriate lens is whether there was an intended \n     public benefit for that disclosure, such as protecting public \n     health or safety or revealing wrongdoing.\n       Of course the Secretary of State had some classified \n     information in her emails. As Bill Leonard, former director \n     of the federal Information Security Oversight Office, told \n     Reuters, information that foreign officials give U.S. \n     officials in confidence is ``born classified.''\n       And yes, the government is dramatically overclassifying \n     information. Clinton herself tweeted that the government's \n     ridiculous classification rules are the ``real problem.'' But \n     rather than tackling the many problems with the \n     classification system, or investigating Clinton through the \n     post-Wikileaks ``insider threat'' program created to \n     investigate individuals who exploited, compromised, or made \n     an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, the \n     State Department has spent weeks defending their former boss \n     and claiming dismissively that nothing was classified at the \n     time anyway.\n       General Petraeus, who deliberately gave classified \n     information to his lover/biographer, was afforded similar \n     latitude, with Senator Feinstein going so far as to make a \n     public plea for clemency in his case. In the end he was only \n     given a paltry fine--one that he will be able to pay off with \n     less than one of his speaking engagement fees.\n       The Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) tried to \n     bury, and then gutted, its own report that concluded then-CIA \n     Director Leon Panetta had released classified information \n     about the Osama bin Laden raid to the Zero Dark Thirty \n     Hollywood producers. Panetta was never penalized despite the \n     IG's findings.\n       In stark comparison, even national security whistleblowers \n     who worked through proper channels, including reporting to \n     their superiors, Inspectors General, and the Congress, are \n     faced with a white-hot vindictive frontal attack from the \n     government.\n       NSA whistleblower Tom Drake and Justice Department \n     whistleblower Thomas Tamm both had armed FBI agents raid \n     their homes. Drake reported to the Pentagon IG and Congress \n     about the NSA's unconstitutional and wasteful overreach \n     through its domestic surveillance program (years before \n     Edward Snowden). Tamm also challenged the legality of the \n     government's warrantless wiretap program.\n       Tamm lost his clearance and his government career. Drake \n     was prosecuted for espionage and lost his career after \n     pleading to the misdemeanor of ``excceding the authorized use \n     of a computer.'' Both spent a fortune on attorneys.\n       Air Marshal Robert MacLean had to take his case all the way \n     to the Supreme Court to prove that he had a right to reveal \n     unclassified information to a TV reporter about the TSA's \n     decision to remove air marshals from high-risk flights after \n     9/11. His disclosure forced the TSA to reverse their plan and \n     to better protect the public by keeping air marshals on \n     cross-country flights. MacLean won, but he and his family had \n     to put their lives on hold while he fought his case for years \n     without a paycheck.\n       Lieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by \n     the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of \n     revealing classified information to Congress, which is \n     permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in \n     the executive branch. His disclosure to Congress led the \n     White House to overhaul its hostage recovery policies. Yet \n     his retirement from the military, after an extraordinary and \n     decorated career in the Army, has been put on hold \n     indefinitely as the investigation drags on.\n       Our system now protects the powerful and attacks the \n     heroes, both of which are fundamentally un-American.\n       So let's stop wasting time making politically expedient \n     proclamations that serve no purpose but to score points for \n     candidates. There are real issues all the campaigns should \n     address: We need to dramatically shrink the incidence of and \n     incentives for overclassification. We also need to apply a \n     public interest balancing test so that when there is an \n     alleged breach of classified information, the violation is \n     weighed against the benefits of the information becoming \n     known.\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n     And we need to level the playing field so that there aren't \n     different accountability standards for those with clout and \n     those without.\n       If the dialogue doesn't change, most federal employees who \n     witnesses waste, fraud. or abuse will feel the chill and \n     decide against stepping forward while the politically \n     powerful class will continue to be rewarded and see their \n     transgressions forgiven.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, before long, two must-pass pieces of \nlegislation will come to the floor, a highway bill and a government-\nfunding bill. It is like ringing the dinner bell for Wall Street banks. \nThe lobbyists are swarming this place. They want to roll back financial \nregulations, and they are working every contact they can to attach \nthese rollbacks to anything that moves.\n  It is a pretty neat trick. They probably can't get a rollback of \nfinancial regulations passed out in the open where Americans can see \nwhat is happening and see which Senators and which representatives \nvoted to gut the rules for Wall Street banks. So they slipped these \nrollbacks into must-pass legislation, which gives the financial \nindustry's friends in Congress a lot of cover.\n  Of course, it is not just Wall Street that is trying this. Lobbyists \nand their Republican allies want to weaken the rules protecting \nworkers, retirees, and our environment. They want to defund Planned \nParenthood, attack civil rights laws, and shove all kinds of other \nprovisions that would be terrible for our country. But, as in so many \nthings, Wall Street is the true master of this strategy.\n  It has been almost 1 year since Citigroup lobbyists wrote a provision \nto blast a hole in Dodd-Frank and, at the last minute, got it attached \nto a government funding bill. Since the government would have shut down \nif the funding bill hadn't passed, that Citigroup amendment made it \nthrough tacked on the back of the funding deal.\n  The provision that got blown up last year was called ``Prohibition \nagainst Federal Government bailouts of swaps entities.'' The idea \nbehind the rule is pretty simple. If a bank wanted to enter into \ncertain risky deals--such as the credit default swaps that had been at \nthe heart of the 2008 crisis--it had to bear all of the risk itself \ninstead of passing it along to taxpayers. That was the provision that \nCongress repealed.\n  Because Democrats weren't willing to shut down the government, Wall \nStreet won that round. But this isn't over. Congressman Elijah Cummings \nand I decided to hunt down the impact of the Citigroup amendment. We \nopened an investigation, and today we released our findings.\n  There are lots of details, but here is the takeaway. The FDIC \nestimates that the provision written by Citigroup lobbyists last year \nallows a few banks to put taxpayers on the hook for risky swaps with an \nestimated value of nearly $10 trillion. And what does it mean to load \nup on swaps such as this? The FDIC said: ``Generally speaking, large \nvolumes of derivative activity conducted by a [bank] would be expected \nto increase its risk profile.\n  And who is gobbling down most of this $10 trillion of risk? Three \nhuge banks: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America--three \nbanks, nearly $10 trillion.\n  Now $10 trillion is a lot of risky business. Just remember, the whole \nTARP bailout was less than $1 trillion. Now a few banks--a few too-big-\nto-fail banks--are going to keep another $10 trillion in risky business \non their books. These banks will happily suck down the profits when \ntheir high-stakes bets work out, and they will just as happily turn to \nthe taxpayers to bail them out when there is a problem--all of this \nbecause the lobbyists persuaded Congress to do just one little favor \nfor them.\n  Earlier today Congressman Cummings and I asked the Government \nAccountability Office to do more analysis of these issues. But whatever \nthe GAO finds, Congress now has 10 trillion reasons to stand up to \nCitigroup and bring back the swaps pushout rule to ensure that working \nfamilies in this country--families with mortgages and student loans to \npay and kids to take care of--aren't on the hook again, this time for \n$10 trillion of the big banks' risky bets. Congress has one job here. \nCongress should strengthen, not roll back, financial rules before one \nof these banks takes down our economy again.\n  But bills to hold the big banks more accountable aren't getting much \ntraction around here. Instead, right now people in Congress are talking \nabout repealing more Dodd-Frank provisions. That is right. At this very \nmoment lobbyists and Senators are plotting new ways to take cops off \nthe beat on Wall Street and to weaken, delay or dilute the rules that \nprotect consumers and hold big banks accountable and then to hook those \nrollbacks either onto a bill to fund our highways or to keep our \ngovernment open.\n  Now, Republicans say: Hey, if you want to get something done, if you \nwant to repair our roads or keep the government open, this is the \nprice; help the big banks.\n  To be fair, Republicans are also getting some help from some \nDemocrats. They say: Wall Street accountability is important, but I \njust want to get something done around here for a change; so let's go \nalong.\n  Well, yes, I want to get something done too. Who doesn't? But I \ndidn't come here to carry water for the big banks.\n  If Republicans think it is time to talk about financial reform, then \nlet's put it all on the table and let's have everyone in Congress--\nDemocrats and Republicans--declare publicly where they stand. If the \nindustry wants to push rollbacks, then I want to make it easier to send \nbankers to jail when they launder money for drug cartels or when they \nrig foreign exchange markets or when they cheat pension funds out of \ndesperately needed money.\n  If the industry wants to chip away at financial oversight, then I \nwant to have a serious, on-the-record conversation about breaking up \nthe biggest banks. Let's start with the three that are taking $10 \ntrillion in risky business onto their books: Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, \nand Bank of America.\n  Yes, the American people want us to get something done. They are \nbegging us to do some real work, but I don't hear a lot of my \nconstituents asking us to water down financial rules and to do more \nfavors for the big banks.\n  So let's put it to the American people. Are you ready to weaken Dodd-\nFrank, to give the biggest banks in the country more chances to take \nmore risks and to leave you holding the bag, or is it time for a little \nmore accountability--accountability for large financial institutions \nthat month after month are in the headlines for breaking the law? Is it \ntime to stop pretending and truly get rid of too big to fail once and \nfor all? We can let every Republican and every Democrat vote in \nCongress on these questions. Let's do it with microphones on and the \ncameras rolling, but not behind closed doors and out of public view.\n  We need to vote on a highway bill. We need to vote on a government \nfunding bill. And if there is anyone in this Chamber, Republican or \nDemocrat, who thinks they can slip goodies for Wall Street into these \nbills without a fight, they are very wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in commemoration, celebration, and honor \nof Veterans Day, I would like to share the stories of two Louisiana \nheroes who served in World War II: Lucius Forsyth and Robert ``Emmett'' \nStanley--two Louisianans who answered the call to serve and did so most \nhonorably.\n  Lucius Forsyth left his home in Paulina, LA, to serve in World War II \nin his late teens as a U.S. Navy seaman aboard the USS Saratoga. On \nFebruary 21, 1945, Lucius and the crew of the Saratoga experienced the \nmost concentrated assault of World War II against a warship. The \nSaratoga and her 3,500 sailors fought bravely as the Japanese forces \nattacked the ship for 3 hours. Bombs were dropped and five Japanese \nkamikazes crashed their aircraft into the Saratoga.\n  Seven levels below the main deck, Lucius knew that the impact of a \nbomb or a kamikaze near his location would\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\nmean certain death. Ignoring the danger, Lucius continued to work in \nthe compartments adjacent to the ammunition stockpiles. Mr. President, \n125 members of the Saratoga lost their lives that day.\n  Lucius remained aboard the Saratoga for the rest of the war. After \nthe Japanese surrendered, he returned home, married Rita Bourgeois of \nGonzales, LA, raised 5 children, and today is blessed with 21 \ngrandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.\n  The other Louisiana veteran I would like to recognize is Robert \n``Emmett'' Stanley. Born in New Orleans in 1923, Emmett left home \nshortly after graduating from high school to serve the United States. \nHe enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 1943 and served as a seaman first \nclass on the USS Luce.\n  On the morning of May 4, 1945, 1 day after Emmett's 22nd birthday, \nJapanese kamikaze pilots attacked the USS Luce. Emmett was knocked to \nthe deck as shrapnel pierced his scalp through his steel helmet and \nfragmented pieces went into his legs. He still feels pain from those \ninjuries today.\n  Emmett and the other crew members were soon given orders to abandon \nthe USS Luce after more kamikazes struck. Emmett swam 40 yards away \nfrom the sinking ship to avoid being sucked under by the waves, but a \nsecond explosion forced more shrapnel into his stomach. Out of the 312 \nmen on the USS Luce, 126 were killed in the attack.\n  Although eligible then, Emmett did not receive his Purple Heart until \nOctober 17 of this year, when he was the honoree at the U.S. Navy \nBirthday Ball. He was thrilled to be surrounded by his entire family.\n  These are two stories about heroism and valor, but there are many \nmore. Let me brag a little bit about a couple of young men who work on \nmy staff.\n  One young man, Chris Anderson, enlisted in the Army after completing \nhis college education. He could have pursued business or graduate \nschool, but Chris wanted to serve our country in the War on Terror. He \ndid so bravely and honorably in Afghanistan clearing ordnance. Imagine \nwhat his mother thought every night, knowing the job he had. Now he is \na tireless advocate for VA reform so that those he served with can get \nthe care they need and deserve.\n  Another member of my staff back in Baton Rouge, Michael Eby, served \nin the Louisiana National Guard for 9 years and was awarded the \nNational Defense Medal and the Louisiana War Cross.\n  To Lucius, Emmett, Chris, and Michael and all who served and serve \nnow, thank you for your service. This Veterans Day and every day, we \nremember your sacrifices, courage, and dedication to ensuring that our \nchildren, their children, and we all can live in freedom in the \ngreatest Nation in the world. May God bless you, your families, and the \nUnited States of America.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman).

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to talk about a set \nof issues we don't, frankly, spend enough time on that relate to our \nchildren. I have often said--and I think it is true throughout this \nChamber when we talk about these issues--that we come to this because \nwe are concerned about the future of this country when we talk about \nwhat happens to our children.\n  I have always believed--and I think this is a prevailing point of \nview here in this Chamber and across the country--that every child is \nborn with a light inside them, the light of the full measure of their \npotential. Some children don't need a lot of help along the way. They \nare born into circumstances or into families or born to parents or \nthere are other factors that give them an advantage. They have a lot of \nability, and they do not need much in the way of intervention from any \npart of our society, including the government. Some children are born \nwith a bright light, but it may not burn as brightly or shine as \nbrightly as some other kids, and they need a little extra help. Some of \nthose kids, if they get help when they are very young, can thrive and \nsucceed and grow without any further help or assistance.\n  If we are serious about growing the economy, if we are serious about \ncreating jobs and creating the kind of opportunity that we say we are \nconcerned about and that we say is part of the fabric of being an \nAmerican, then we have to be concerned about what happens to our kids.\n  A lot of what I will talk about today can be summarized in maybe one \nline: As kids learn more now, they are going to earn more later. We \nknow all the data shows that. The child who has access to early \nlearning will earn more later in life. It also is essential that they \nhave access to quality health care and the kind of security that comes \nwhen you have enough to eat--food security.\n  If we want our children to learn more now and earn more later, we \nhave to make the right investments. Unfortunately, that child or any \nchild won't be able to learn more now and therefore earn more later if \nthey live a life of poverty. Maybe some will get through, but that is \nvery difficult. If we don't take action against child poverty, we have \nalready erected barriers in their path.\n  Today, as of 2014, the latest numbers for child poverty in the United \nStates are 21.1 percent. That number is up substantially since the \ngreat recession--a couple of percentage points--and therefore there are \nmillions more children living in poverty.\n  In Pennsylvania, it is only a little lower--19.4 percent. No one here \nwould try to make the case that is acceptable, that 21 percent of \nchildren living in poverty is something we can accept. We should all be \nnot only outraged by it but take action and have a sense of urgency to \ncombat it.\n  There are a couple of things we can do. First of all, we have to know \nwhat is happening to children on a broad range of topics. That is why \nwe have to rely upon public policy expertise. There is a whole group of \nfolks out there in organizations. I am holding in my hand just one \nexample. You can't see it from a distance, but this is a kind of one-\npage summary by the Annie E. Casey Foundation--no relation to me but a \ngreat foundation that has tracked child well-being for years. They have \nfour categories: economic well-being, education, health, and the fourth \ncategory is family and community.\n  If you could see this up close, you would notice some categories. \nThere are 16 altogether, with 4 indicators in 4 categories.\n  If you look at the orange, wherever you see orange, that means the \nnumbers are getting worse for children. If you see green, that means we \nare doing better. So it is a mixed report, with some numbers getting \nbetter over the last 5 years or 7 years or time increments such as \nthat. But what has gotten worse since the great recession is that the \nnumber of children living in poverty has gone up. The number of \nchildren whose parents lack secure employment has gone up. \nUnfortunately, two other indicators of poverty--children in single-\nparent families is up, meaning the number has worsened, and children \nliving in high-poverty areas is worse.\n  I won't go into those numbers today, but that is just an indication \nthat childhood poverty has been a challenge for a long time. It got a \nlot worse after the great recession, when our economy began to collapse \nand folks across the country paid the price, and a lot of children have \npaid the price.\n  So what do we do about it? One thing we do is to begin to see that at \nlong last we can't just talk about reducing child poverty. We can't \njust nibble around the edges or hope a program here or a program there \nwill help. We have to have a strategy. In order to have a strategy, we \nhave to have a goal, and the goal ought to be that we reduce child \npoverty and take the same approach, frankly, the United Kingdom took a \ncouple of years ago.\n  I will walk through some of the background, but Senator Baldwin and \nSenator Brown and I introduced a bill just last week--the Child Poverty \nReduction Act--to establish that kind of a target to reduce child \npoverty. Under the legislation, child poverty would be cut in half in \n10 years. So child poverty would be cut in half in a decade. The second \ngoal would be to eliminate child poverty in 20 years. Deep poverty \nwould be eliminated in 10 years--meaning the worst kind of poverty for \nour children and for our families.\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\n  To meet these goals, we would give an assignment to an interagency \nworking group to reduce child poverty, to develop a plan, and include \nrecommendations to improve coordination and efficiency of existing \nprograms and initiatives, because there are a lot of them--and we can \nget to those in a moment--along with recommendations for new \nlegislation, new strategies, and new approaches to focus on child \npoverty.\n  Here is what happened in the United Kingdom. In 1999, the UK \nestablished a national child poverty target and measured in U.S. terms \nthe UK's child poverty target, and the policy changes made in \nconjunction with that effort reduced Britain's child poverty rate by 50 \npercent in the first 10 years--a significant achievement. In \ncomparison, between 2000 and 2013--a little more than a decade--in the \nUnited States, the child poverty rate increased by over 20 percent. So \nroughly in the same time period, as our poverty rate was going up for \nkids, the UK's poverty rate for children was going down. One of the \nreasons for that--not the only reason--is they set a target, and both \nsides came together--the labor party, the conservatives--and the \ncountry made it a goal. We haven't done that yet, and we need to focus \non that kind of a goal.\n  So one thing we need to do is to focus on a goal and have legislation \nto enact part of the strategy. Then, of course, we can't just stop \nthere. We can't just assume having a target and working toward it is \nenough.\n  One of the most powerful examples in my home State of Pennsylvania \nover the last couple of years of what it means to live in poverty--in \nthis case, moms who were willing to tell their stories--is the effort \nundertaken by Witnesses to Hunger. That is what this photograph \ndepicts--a child who was photographed by her mother. Other mothers were \nwilling to take pictures of their children to tell the world about \ntheir own circumstances and to give us living proof of what it means to \nlive in poverty, what it means to be a child living in poverty. That is \nWitnesses to Hunger.\n  This all started at Drexel University, where they gave cameras to a \ngroup of moms who decided to open up their own lives, courageously and \ngenerously, and to tell us more about these challenges.\n  The first picture after that is a picture of a young woman by the \nname of Monique who is on her way to her local WIC office--the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program--the office in this part of Philadelphia. \nMonique says: ``I love WIC because it supports me by helping me nurse \nmy baby.'' That is a picture of her and her baby.\n  The next picture is a picture of a group of classmates, and the mom's \nname is Shearine. Shearine's daughter joins her classmates in this \nphoto. Here is what Shearine says about her circumstances and what she \nhopes for the future:\n\n       My daughter and her classmates are symbols of change. They \n     have hope for a brighter future and faith that the adults in \n     their lives will work together to make a change. We must do \n     whatever it takes so that they can grow up and be strong, \n     educated adults.\n\n  I think Shearine gave us all an assignment, not just speaking to \nherself. I think she gave us all an assignment that we have to make \nsure we are taking the steps necessary and essential to do all we can \nto give that bright future and to validate the faith those children \nhave in us, whether we are going to meet our obligations to help those \nchildren--every single one of those children in that class picture.\n  Finally, the last picture is of a young boy giving his mother Gale a \ngreat smile. In this photo, Gale captures her son's happiness as he \nholds up nutritious bananas. It is good to have that in the picture. \nWhen we talk about child poverty and hunger, it is not just some public \npolicy issue, some issue for a think tank to analyze. Child poverty is \ndepicted in some of these pictures, but it is also in our newspapers \nevery day of the week and in our midst. I hope more of us will be \nsummoned by our conscience to do something constructively about this \nissue.\n  We have a lot to do in the next couple of months. We have child \nnutrition reauthorization, which is a great opportunity for us to, at \nlong last, begin to take steps in the right direction.\n  The Women, Infants, and Children Program I mentioned before is one of \nthose. One reason I am so concerned about where we are in the WIC \nProgram is that some children literally are caught in a nutrition gap. \nBecause they are age 5, they may be caught in a gap where they are not \ngetting school meals and they are not getting nutrition any other way. \nSome children can experience this nutrition gap almost 12 months, \nalmost a year being caught because they turned 5. The time in this \nnutrition gap is a time when they are neither supported by WIC nor \nsupported by a school meals program.\n  We had the privilege recently of talking to a constituent from \nWestern Pennsylvania. Her son is currently 4 years old. He will be \nenrolled in kindergarten in the fall of 2016. When he enrolls in \nschool, he will get healthy meals, but in the next month when he turns \n5, he will be cut off from the opportunity to benefit from the WIC \nProgram. This child loves yogurt, fruit and vegetables and whole grains \nprovided by the WIC Program, but he will not benefit from that because \nof this glitch in the law. So I propose a new bill, the Wise Investment \nin our Children Act, the WIC Act, to close the nutrition gap by \nallowing States to increase the age limit for WIC to age 6.\n  We also have to be concerned, at the same time focusing on making \nchanges to the WIC Program, to focus on another support for our \nchildren and families, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, so-called \nCACFB, as a quality source of nutrition. For many children, the meals \nthey eat in childcare programs are the most nutritious meals they will \neat all week. In other words, absent the childcare setting, they will \nlikely not have a nutritious meal in the course of a week. As working \nfamilies shuttle between home, childcare, and work, little time remains \nfor food shopping, healthy meal planning or sitting down to eat healthy \nmeals. The Child and Adult Care Food Program provides healthy, \nnutritious meals to more than 3 million children each day who are \neither in Head Start, Early Head Start or childcare programs in both \ncenters and family childcare homes.\n  I introduced this bill as well to focus, improve, and strengthen this \nprogram. The Child and Adult Care Improvement Act would enhance several \naspects of this program, including allowing childcare centers and homes \nthe option of serving a third meal for children who are in care for 8 \nor more hours a day.\n  We have a lot to do, but we cannot get to the goal of reducing child \npoverty by 50 percent or reducing poverty overall in the near term in \nthe next decade, unless we have a strategy, set a goal, and then begin \nto strengthen what works and improve the existing programs--whether it \nis WIC, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, the SNAP program--what \nused to be called food stamps. Whatever the program is, we have to \nstrengthen and invest in it. We can't talk about all those lofty \nterms--like ``GDP growth, job growth, and growing economy'' and all the \nwonderful things that get discussed in this Chamber--without a strategy \nfor our kids.\n  We have a way to go, but I believe this commitment to our children is \nnot just the right thing to do and it is not just something we ought to \nfocus on as something consistent with what our conscience tells us, but \nit is in fact a great economic strategy for the country. If kids learn \nmore now, they are going to earn more later. They can't learn more now \nif they don't have access to early learning, if they don't have access \nto healthy, nutritious foods, if they don't have access to quality \nhealth care, and if we don't protect them from people who would do them \nharm. If we do at least four of those things well--if we have early \nlearning opportunities, opportunities to invest in food security \nstrategies so they get healthy, nutritious foods, and we make sure they \nhave quality health care in addition to early learning, we can move \nforward in a direction that gets us to the goal of making sure every \nchild in this country has an opportunity to grow and to learn and to \nmove in the future together. We can't do that if all we do in \nWashington is use phrases like ``job creation'' and ``economic growth'' \nwithout a strategy to get our kids there. We should make sure every \nchild in this country has the same opportunity to learn and to grow. \nThey can't do that if we as the adults don't give them that \nopportunity.\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n  So as we look at some of the real lives depicted in these \nphotographs, I think Shearine gave us a very powerful message today, \nwhere she said: ``They,'' meaning the children in the picture of the \nclassroom--``They have hope for a brighter future and faith that the \nadults in their lives will work together to make change.''\n  Shearine is right. She has given me an assignment, she has given 99 \nother Senators an assignment, and a lot of other adults across the \ncountry. I believe this is a mission worthy of a great nation, just \nlike every other major undertaking we have confronted and dealt with \nover many generations of greatness in our country.\n  When we talk about American exceptionalism and what it means to be an \nAmerican, part of being an American is making sure every child has the \nsame opportunity to learn and to grow. We can do this. We can do it in \na bipartisan fashion. If the United Kingdom can reduce child poverty, \nthe United States can do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7895-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7895-S7896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would point out to our colleagues, \nthat we now have now received the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. \nIt amounts to 5,544 pages, not including the dozens of side-\nagreements--three times the book I know the Presiding Officer knows, \nthe Bible. It is three times the length of the Bible and several times \nthe length of ObamaCare. It has just been delivered to us with all \nkinds of promises for good things that might result from its \naffirmation.\n  No American has the resources to ensure that his or her interests are \nbeing protected in this document. It is so long and the ramifications \nare so broad that Congress cannot do its job to ensure that the \npeople's interests are safeguarded by such an agreement.\n  We already have trade deals with all the major TPP countries, except \nJapan. So I will say with real confidence this is much more than trade. \nIf it was, a bilateral agreement with Japan would fix it. We have \nagreements with Australia, Chile, Canada, and other countries.\n  The TPP is about the goal of creating a new global regulatory \nstructure--what I have called a Pacific Union--transferring power from \nindividual Americans and Congress, eroding Congress, to an \nunaccountable, unelected, international bureaucratic committee.\n  Because President Obama has been given fast-track powers by this \nCongress--unwisely I think--Congress cannot amend this deal, we cannot \nstrike one offending provision, apply a filibuster to force a \nsupermajority of 60 votes, as we have to have for most legislation, or \nto apply a two-thirds treaty vote. Additionally, the White House writes \nthe implementing legislation, which, in turn, necessarily supersedes \nany existing American law. So this is what we mean by fast-track.\n  Today I would like to share a few thoughts about one aspect of this \nagreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission. There is a \nparticular chapter in this mammoth agreement, chapter 27, titled--\ninnocuously enough--``Administrative and Institutional Provisions,'' \nwhich deals with the creation of a Trans-Pacific Partnership \nCommission.\n  Section 27.1 outlines the creation of this Commission and who is a \nmember. The agreement states that ``each party shall be responsible for \nthe composition of its delegation.'' In other words, we are empowering \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership countries to create a new congress of \nsorts--a group with delegates that goes and meets and decides important \nissues that can impact everyday lives of Americans. The American \nrepresentative in this Commission, which will operate in many ways like \nthe U.N., will not be answerable to voters anywhere. How long will \ntheir terms be? How will they be chosen? Will there be any restrictions \non lobbying, any requirements of transparency? Can they always meet in \nsecret? Are there any ethics rules? The answer is, it will be whatever \nthe TPP countries decide it will be.\n\n  The fact that they negotiated this in secret for months--years, \nreally--indicates that transparency is not a quality they value very \nhighly. It is an entity untethered above and outside the Constitution \nof the United States. All our government agencies in the United States \nmust answer to the Congress and the President, the Chief Executive. \nThese institutions will not. So we need to be cautious.\n  All I am saying is, why do we have to do this? Why do we have to \ncreate a Commission in which Vietnam or the Sultan of Brunei gets the \nsame vote as the President of the United States?\n  Section 27.2 lists several powers of the Commission which should be \nexpected in any regulatory body. It is granted the power to oversee the \nimplementation of the TPP and the power to supervise the work of \nrelevant working groups under its jurisdiction. However, then the \nsection states this: Under the rules, the Commission shall ``consider \nany proposal to amend or modify this Agreement,'' to change the \nagreement. They get to change the agreement. We can ratify this, but \nthey get to change it whenever they deem appropriate. Also, the \nCommission shall ``seek the advice of non-governmental persons or \ngroups on any matter falling within the Commission's functions'' and \n``take such other action as the Parties may agree,'' while considering \n``input from non-governmental persons or groups of the Parties.''\n  It also says it will consider the findings of international fora to \nhelp advise them. I guess one of the fora they will not be considering \nis a group like the National Federation of Independent Business, small \nbusinesses.\n  None of these terms are defined as to what constitutes a \nnongovernmental person or group. What is that?\n  Remember, when the Founders of our country negotiated the \nConstitution, they worried about every word. They thought about what it \nwould mean and could mean decades, centuries later. They talked about \ncreating a new form of government on this entire continent. They \nactually believed that could be possible, and it certainly has become \nreality. Have we given that kind of thought to the power we are \ndelegating to this Commission? How will the agreement be amended or \nmodified?\n  Just last week, the Secretary of State, Secretary Kerry, was in \nKazakhstan. He told the television station in Kazakhstan that he is \ninterested in seeing China and Russia be added to the TPP and that they \nwould consider the Philippines a prime candidate to join in the future. \nThat is an interesting thing to announce, particularly in Kazakhstan. \nSince it impacts the people of the United States, it might be nice for \nhim to be talking more to the people of the United States.\n  So this would create a situation in which new countries can be added, \nit appears, most any different way.\n  The point is, this global governance authority is open-ended. The \nagreement states that ``the Commission and any subsidiary body \nestablished under this Agreement may establish rules of procedures for \nthe conduct of its work.''\n  It even covers climate regulation--a lot about climate regulation. \nThe agreement states that ``the Parties acknowledge that transition to \na low emissions economy requires collective action.'' Having been a \nproud cold warrior, I have never been happy with people who use the \nword ``collective.'' It makes me nervous.\n  The TPP is a living agreement. According to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's own Web site, the living agreement provision is in the \nTPP: ``. . . to enable the updating of the agreement as appropriate to \naddress trade issues that emerge in the future as well as new issues \nthat arise with the expansion of the agreement to include new \ncountries.'' It says it is to deal with trade issues and new issues. \nAre those issues nontrade? Are they environmental issues? Are they \nlabor agreements or other kinds of things that are unrelated directly \nto trade? I think it is clear this would allow that to happen.\n  Regardless, after the TPP is passed and Congress has blessed the \nunion, the Senate will have no say in how the\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nCommission is established or the rules by which it is governed. It is \nuntethered to the Congress.\n  Second, currency manipulation is a serious issue. It is impacting our \nability to trade effectively today in a very large way.\n  Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve during a time when he \nand President Reagan transformed the American economy from raging \ninflation and interest rates to a sound economy, said that currency \nmanipulation could wipe out decades of trade negotiations in a matter \nof minutes. We have seen that happen.\n  Currency is huge and impacts so many companies. If you read the \nfinancial pages, you will see that companies are worried about their \nbottom line in large part because it will be harder for them to compete \nwith foreign competitors who devalue their currency deliberately in \norder to gain an advantage in trade. But there is no enforceable \ncurrency mechanism in this agreement, although it was fought for in \nboth Houses of Congress and came close, but it is not in it.\n  On November 5, the Wall Street Journal wrote: ``Mexico, Canada and \nother countries signaled they were open to the [currency] deal when \nthey realized it wouldn't include binding currency rules that could \nlead to trade sanctions through the TPP.'' This caused Ford Motor \nCompany to immediately reject the TPP the day it was released. Their \nspokesman argued that they could not support a deal in which currency \nrules ``fell outside of TPP and [failed to] include dispute settlement \nmechanisms to ensure global rules prohibiting currency manipulation are \nenforced.''\n  This is a huge matter. Ford says that when they are selling an \nAmerican-made automobile or truck in a foreign country, they are losing \nthousands of dollars as a result of currency manipulation by many of \nour trading partners. So it is hard to sell an automobile if our \nforeign competitors have, in effect, a comparative advantage on \ncurrency alone of several thousand dollars.\n  The administration has zero interest in preventing foreign market \nmanipulations and currency manipulations, and thus the TPP will cause \nmassive job losses. It just will. We will be less able to compete.\n  Let's be frank. I supported the Korean trade agreement. We have great \nallies in Japan and Korea and others in the Pacific, but they are tough \ntrading partners--competitors, if you want to know the truth. They are \ncompetitors. They are mercantilists. They have a goal. Their goal is to \nsell as much as possible to foreign countries and particularly to the \ngreatest market in the world, the market they lust to gain even more \naccess to--our market. They want to sell to us. Through a whole lot of \ndifferent mechanisms, they resist purchasing anything from us. Have we \nmade any progress in lessening the trade deficit to Japan or Korea \nlately? It is not going to happen because these barriers are nontariff, \ncurrency being one of the most noteworthy.\n  Foreign workers and governments under the TPP are not inhibited from \nillegally undercutting American workers through currency manipulation \nin order to export their unemployment to the United States.\n  The way this happens is, if you have a business in a foreign country \nand the world market has slowed down and your exports are slowing down, \nif you devalue your currency, your product becomes cheaper and can be \nsold in the United States or other countries at a cheaper price, and \nyou keep your people working and manufacturing those widgets, whereas \nthe country that imported your product lays off its workers because it \ncan't compete at that price--for the widgets. It is an artificial way \nto gain market advantage.\n  In May of this year, I wrote the President and asked him simple \nquestions. This is important, colleagues. I asked him to state whether \nthe TPP would increase or decrease our trade deficit. He refused to \nanswer. I asked him whether the TPP would increase or decrease the \nnumber of manufacturing jobs in the United States. He refused to \nanswer. I asked him how the TPP would affect the average hourly wages \nof the American middle class. He refused to answer. He never wrote \nback. All that the proponents in the White House have said about this \ndeal is that it would increase production and jobs in the export \nindustries. But exporting is such a small part of American industry \nproduction. They don't mention how many jobs would be lost by the \nincreased imports into our country.\n  Dan DiMicco, the CEO emeritus of Nucor Steel, which operates steel \nplants all over the Nation, wrote in his recent book:\n\n       The world says one thing about open markets and free trade \n     but does another. Whatever sharp cultural or political or \n     language differences may separate the Japanese from the \n     Chinese, or the Germans from the French, this much they all \n     have in common: they know how to advance and protect their \n     economic interests.\n\n  Mr. President, has my time lapsed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama, there is a 10-minute \ntime limit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They know how to advance their interests, and we have \nnot been effective in advancing ours.\n  It is time to take TPP off the fast track, take this off the fast \ntrack and get busy defending the interests of the American people.\n  DiMicco writes:\n\n       In principle, any industrial policy would begin by saying \n     the business of creating, making, and building things must be \n     at the heart of any overreaching economic strategy.\n\n  This agreement is not just about promoting trade; it is about \ncreating a framework for a transnational union which supersedes the \nauthority of Congress.\n  Finally, if it were truly about opening markets to U.S. producers, \nthe United States would simply have negotiated bilateral agreements \nwith the countries we need to talk to.\n  We are the world's greatest market for worldwide products that are \nmade, and right now we give open access, incredibly, to foreign \nimports. Just look at those containerships on the Pacific coast stacked \nto the top. It is not working for jobs in America, it is not working \nfor wages in America, and it is not working for manufacturing. We have \nto make things. Moving to a services economy would be failure.\n\n  Of course we want trade. Of course we want to purchase items from \nabroad. I am not saying we shouldn't. What I am asking is, are we, in \nnegotiating this trade agreement, giving even broader access to our \nmarkets without getting enough in return? That is the problem. America \nmust make things. Consumption in America should be for Americans and \nfor export. Our competitors want the opposite, and they have been \nwinning, but they need us more than we need them; thus, we have great \npower to reverse this course.\n  Figuratively speaking, some of our politicians will be pushing up \ndaisies if they don't listen to what the American people are saying. \nThey must listen to the sound, common sense of the people who hold the \nultimate power. They expect us to make sure their interests are \nlegitimately defended. I don't believe this trade agreement does that, \nand we will talk more about it as time goes by.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7896-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7896-S7897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DOROTHY ``DOT'' HELMS\n\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I have the sad duty to report to the \nSenate the passing of the first lady of North Carolina, Dorothy ``Dot'' \nHelms. Mrs. Helms was known to many in this body as the ever gracious \nwife of my illustrious predecessor, Senator Jesse Helms.\n  In fact, I chose to stand at this desk because it is the desk he \nstood behind for the many years as he served the United States and the \ngreat State of North Carolina in the Senate.\n  For 66 years Dot Helms was the rock upon which the Helms legacy was \nbuilt. Long before she met her future husband, Dot Helms was a \ntrailblazer in North Carolina. She was the first woman to graduate from \nthe University of North Carolina school of journalism in 1940, where \nshe rubbed elbows with the likes of fellow Tar Heels, Edward R. Murrow \nand friend and classmate David Brinkley.\n  While a reporter for the legendary owner-editor of the Raleigh News \nand Observer, Joseph Daniels, she met a young man on the sports desk \nnamed Jesse Helms, and the rest is history.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n  Mrs. Helms was a leader in Christian causes, such as her sponsorship \nof the interdenominational children's camp Willow Run at Lake Gaston. \nWhile in Washington, she taught at Gallaudet University and actually \nwrote a book on great Americans who happened to be deaf.\n  In the Senate, she was the leader of the Senate Ladies Bible Study, \nthe Congressional Wives Prayer Group, and the U.S. Senate chapter of \nthe Red Cross. She was a confidante and pillar for many friends on both \nsides of the aisle, including Elizabeth Dole, Erma Byrd, Beryl Bentsen, \nand Linda Johnson Robb.\n  Politically, she was a close friend of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. In \n1976, she took the unusual step of campaigning tirelessly across the \nState of North Carolina in support of then-Governor Reagan's insurgent \nPresidential candidacy. Needless to say, the Governor carried the North \nCarolina primary against a sitting President in no small part due to \nthe work of Dot Helms.\n  Two years ago, Gov. Pat McCrory awarded Dorothy Helms the Order of \nthe Long Leaf Pine for her contributions to the civic and religious \nlife of the Tar Heel State. Fittingly, the Governor honored her with \nthe official North Carolina State toast:\n\n     Here's to the land of the long leaf pine,\n     The summer land where the sun doth shine,\n     Where the weak grow strong and the strong grow great,\n     Here's to ``Down Home,'' the old North State!\n\n  ``Where the strong grow great. . . . '' Dot Helms and North Carolina \nare one and the same. For her family and friends and a grateful nation, \nwe can turn in comfort to the Second Book of Timothy: ``I have fought \nthe good fight, I have finished the race, and I have kept the faith.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the obituary of Mrs. \nHelms from the Jesse Helms Center Foundation in Monroe, NC, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Dorothy Coble Helms\n\n\n                               1919-2015\n\n       Dorothy Coble Helms, wife of former U.S. Senator Jesse \n     Helms, passed away on November 6, 2015. She was the daughter \n     of the late Jacob Lonnie and Coral Beaty Coble. Mrs. Helms \n     was born in Raleigh, N.C. on March 25, 1919. She was \n     graduated from Hugh Morson High School in Raleigh in 1936. \n     She attended Meredith College from 1936 to 1938 before \n     transferring to UNC-Chapel Hill, where she was graduated in \n     1940 with a degree in journalism. She and her roommate, Doris \n     Goerch Horton, were the first two women graduates to receive \n     degrees in journalism from UNC. Both women were reporters for \n     The Daily Tarheel, the school newspaper. Dot, as she was \n     called by her friends, was the first president of The McIver \n     Dormitory for Women and served on The Women's Council. She \n     loved to write and wrote many short stories beginning when \n     she was a teenager. Later in life, she delighted her family \n     by telling ghost stories, and it was an especially fun time \n     when she shared her stories at night on the porch at the \n     family cottage at Topsail Beach.\n       After graduating from UNC, Mrs. Helms worked at The Raleigh \n     News and Observer as a city reporter and later as society \n     editor. It was while working at The News and Observer that \n     she met her future husband, a member of the sports \n     department. They were married on October 31, 1942, at the \n     First Baptist Church in Raleigh. One summer during the Second \n     World War, while her husband was on recruiting duty for the \n     Navy in the eastern part of North Carolina, she edited three \n     weekly newspapers which were published in Ahoskie, NC: The \n     Hertford County Herald, The Gates County Index, and The \n     Bertie-Ledger Advance. Mrs. Helms also worked part time at \n     The Star News when her husband was stationed in Wilmington, \n     NC.\n       Back in Raleigh after her husband's discharge from the U.S. \n     Navy, Mrs. Helms was active in the Women's Missionary Union \n     of Hayes Barton Baptist Church. She was also active in the \n     Colonel Polk Chapter, DAR and served as regent for two years. \n     In the early 1960s, Mrs. Helms and Mrs. Armistead Maupin \n     (Diana) were instrumental in founding the Wake County SPCA.\n       The Helms moved to Arlington, Virginia after Senator Helms \n     was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1972. While living there, \n     Mrs. Helms was active in The Spouses of the Senate and in the \n     Senate Ladies Bible Study. She was a volunteer at Gallaudet \n     College for the Deaf and wrote a series of stories entitled \n     ``Interesting Deaf Americans''. Some of the stories were used \n     in English classes at Gallaudet and others were used in \n     publications of schools for the deaf The Helms shared a deep \n     interest in Camp Willow Run, a youth camp for Christ on the \n     shores of Lake Gaston in North Carolina, and Mrs. Helms later \n     wrote a history of the camp.\n       Dot loved politics, and she backed many candidates through \n     the years. She always kept up with what was going on in the \n     world and was never without an opinion on an issue. She was \n     instrumental in the formation of The Jesse Helms Center \n     Foundation in Wingate, N.C. and served on the Board of \n     Directors for many years. She was also involved with The \n     Helms School of Government at Liberty University.\n       Dorothy was the rock of her family. She will be missed so \n     much, but the family rejoices that they had her for so long. \n     She was predeceased by her husband, U.S. Senator Jesse Helms; \n     her parents; her brother, Jack Coble, and her nephew Jack \n     Coble, Jr. She is survived by her children, Jane Knox \n     (Charlie), Nancy Helms, and Charles Helms (Kathleen). She is \n     also survived by her seven grand-children, Rob Knox \n     (Krystin), Jennifer Knox (Shields Carstarphen), Mike Stuart \n     (Rachel Foster), Ellen Stuart Gaddy (Will), Katie Stuart \n     Power (Andy), Amelia Helms, and Julie Helms; and six great \n     grandchildren, Maggie McGuire, Ryan Knox, Cooper Knox-\n     Carstarphen, Alex Knox-Carstarphen, Beatrix Gaddy, and Conrad \n     Power.

Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, and it is a \nspecial day for all of us who serve here and for all of our colleagues \ndown the hall in the House of Representatives. It is a special day for \nveterans across the country and around the world and their families and \nfor a lot of Americans who value the service and sacrifice of our \nveterans.\n  Veterans Day is not Memorial Day. On Memorial Day we mourn and salute \nthose who have given their all in service to our country. Veterans Day \nis really for all veterans, not just for those who have paid the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  I was privileged to go to college. I won a Navy ROTC scholarship and \nwent to Ohio State. I studied a little economics--my professors would \nsay not enough--graduated and went off to Pensacola and became a naval \nflight officer in the late 1960s. I ended up with Patrol Squadron 40 \nout of naval air station, Moffett, CA. I joined my colleagues there for \nseveral tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War.\n  When we came back to the States from overseas, I resigned my regular \ncommission and took a reserve commission and moved from California over \nto Delaware to enroll in the University of Delaware's Business School \nand earned an MBA.\n  Literally the first week I was in Delaware, in September of 1973, I \ngot in my Volkswagen Karmann Ghia with a rebuilt engine and drove up \nRoute 2, Kirkwood Highway, to north Delaware to the VA hospital in \nElsmere, which is about halfway between Newark and Wilmington in \nnorthern Delaware. I took my DD Form 214 in with me to present it to \nthe folks at the hospital to see if I was eligible for any veterans \nbenefits, and as it turned out I was eligible for benefits. Some of the \nbenefits actually have their roots going all the way back to the end of \nWorld War II when FDR signed--I think in 1944--legislation creating the \noriginal GI bill. Among the things I was eligible for was a home loan \nin which the VA would guarantee a portion of my loan so I could buy a \nhouse sometime later, and I did. I was also eligible for some medical \nbenefits, including dental benefits.\n  I didn't realize it at the time, but the VA hospital there was a \nWorld War II relic of a hospital. The morale was not good and the \nquality of service was not\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\ngood. If people in the central or southern part of our State needed \naccess to a VA medical facility and they didn't have it there, they \nwould have to somehow make their way up to northern Delaware. It is not \nlike driving from one end of California to the other, but it is a hike. \nWe didn't have any community-based, out-patient clinics in Delaware or \nany other States either at the time.\n  That fall, those of us who were enrolled in school who were Vietnam \nWar veterans, and in some cases other wars, were eligible for some \nbenefits. The GIs who served in the Vietnam war, including me, were \neligible for a GI bill benefit which was about $250 a month. It may not \nsound like a lot of money today, but I was happy to get every penny of \nit.\n  I continued to fly with a new squadron at the naval air station in \nWillow Grove, PA--the P-3 Squadron--and continued to track Soviet \nnuclear submarines in oceans all over the world as a ready reservist. I \nam one of a number of people in my family who have benefited from the \nGI bill. My father's generation served in World War II. He was a chief \npetty officer. His brother and my other uncle served in World War II. \nOne of them never made it home. He was 19 years old in 1944 and \nassigned to the USS Suwannee. The aircraft carrier was in the Pacific \nOcean when it came under attack by Japanese kamikaze planes, and he \nlost his life. His body was never recovered and neither were the bodies \nof a number of other people who I guess were on the deck of the carrier \nwhen the attacks occurred.\n  Other members of my family in my Dad's generation were able to take \nadvantage of the very first GI bill, which was signed into law in 1944 \nby President Roosevelt. What happened in the wake of World War II was a \nvery generous GI bill. At the time, you could go to Harvard on the GI \nbill, and it was basically fully paid for, plus you had a housing and \nliving allowance. It was an incredible deal, and a lot of people took \nadvantage of that, which is good. A lot of the folks went to colleges \nand universities, but others went to trade schools.\n  I never really talked to my dad about this, but I am told that he \nlearned how to do body work and to repair cars that had been wrecked. \nHe went to some kind of private school or trade school and learned how \nto do that and ended up working at Burleson Oldsmobile in Beckley, WV, \nwhere my sister and I were born. He was able to somehow do a good job \nthere and ended up working as a claims adjuster for Nationwide \nInsurance and ended up running the national school for claims adjusters \nfor Nationwide Insurance.\n  He was a guy with a high school degree from Shady Spring High School \nin Beckley, WV, and ended up, with the help of the Navy and the GI \nbill, with a wonderful career at Nationwide Insurance. He is sort of a \nposter child for those who were able to take that benefit and do \nsomething positive with it for their lives and for their families.\n  In the wake of World War II, there was also an emergence of for-\nprofit colleges and universities and for-profit trade schools. They \ncalled them proprietary trade schools, and they did not always have the \nbest interests of the GI at heart. They were not always interested in \nmaking sure that the GI man or woman got the training and the help they \nneeded to qualify for jobs, to go out there in that day and age and be \ngainfully employed and provide for themselves and their families. Some \nof the nonprofits that operated were very good and did a great job, \nothers not so much. They took advantage of the GIs, and ultimately they \ntook advantage of taxpayers.\n  Over a period of time, back then and in the years since then, on the \nheels of the Korean and Vietnam wars, there emerged an effort on the \npart of the Federal Government to try to make sure we put in place some \nmarket forces to ensure that the for-profit schools, or proprietary \nschools, that were offering the benefits of colleges or universities--\nthat that college or university would treat the GI fairly, the way we \nwould want to be treated, and to make sure they got the benefits that \nthey wanted and that the taxpayers deserved.\n  I think on the heels of World War II, there was an 85-15 rule that \nsaid if you happen to be a proprietary school and you were using the GI \nbill to pay for benefits for somebody--say you had 100 students; out of \nthe 100, no more than 85 of them could be there on the Federal dime. \nThe other 15 GIs, if you will, had to be there on their own or pay for \nit some way other than through the Federal Government. That was an \nearly way to introduce market forces into the benefits that were being \nprovided so we would end up with schools that were working and \nproviding training certificates or degrees that were worth the paper \nthey were written on.\n  More recently, something emerged called the 90-10 rule. The GI bill \nhad come and gone. For those who got into wars in Korea and Vietnam and \nmore recently in the Persian Gulf in Iraq and now Afghanistan--the \nbenefits that are offered to folks who literally served and applied for \nthe GI bill I think after 2007 or 2008--that is a very generous GI \nbill. We sent off about 300 Delaware Guard men and women 2 months \nago from Delaware to go serve in some cases in Afghanistan and in other \ncases maybe in Kuwait and at different duty stations around the world. \nBut I told them when they went off to deploy that when they came back \nat the end of their 6, 7, 8 months--whatever it will be--that they will \ncome back to the best GI bill in the history of the country.\n\n  Here is what they come back to if they have served for, I think, 3 \nyears. If they have served time in those parts of the world, they come \nback to a GI bill and if they went to a public college or university--\nthe University of Delaware, Delaware State, Wilmington University, \nDelaware Tech or a community college in my State or public colleges and \nuniversities across the country--they can go to those schools for \nfree--pretty good, free. We got 250 bucks a month. They can go for \nfree. Their tuition is paid for, books are paid for, fees are paid for, \ntutoring is paid for, and they get a $1,500 housing allowance. That is \npretty good--very good.\n  Just to make sure that we have some market forces in place to ensure \nthat these for-profit colleges and universities are really doing a good \njob and not just taking advantage of the GIs or of the taxpayers, we \nhave in place something called the 90/10 rule. It has been around for a \nwhile. The 90/10 rule says that no college or university--for-profit \ncollege or university, proprietary school, for-profit proprietary \nschool or training school--can get more than 90 percent of their \nrevenues from the Federal Government. But the 90 percent does not \nnecessarily cover--it can cover Pell grants and things other than the \nGI bill. But the GI bill--a school can get all of their money from Pell \ngrants, and students who are on the Federal dime and continue--Mr. \nPresident, I am not sure what is wrong with the public address system. \nI will try another mic. That is better. There we go.\n  Today we have a loophole in the 90/10 rule that allows a college, \nuniversity or a proprietary for-profit school to get 100 percent of \ntheir revenues from the Federal Government. It doesn't count the money \nthey get from the GI bill. It covers Pell grants and other Federal aid \nbut not the GI bill and not something called tuition assistance to \nActive-Duty personnel. I suggest that is something we need to fix. That \nis a loophole that needs to be plugged. No college or university should \nmake 100 percent of their revenues off the Federal Government.\n  The 90/10 rule is well-intentioned to make sure that market forces \nwork, but I am sure that people getting their education from a source \nother than the Federal Government would ensure that the diploma they \nare getting--the certificate they are getting--is worth something and \nthey are able to translate that into gainful employment.\n  Several of us, including myself and Senator Blumenthal, have offered \nlegislation to close the 90/10 rule and to really go back to the \noriginal intent--to say that no for-profit college or university or \ntrade school can get more than 90 percent of the revenues from the \nFederal Government. You can add in the GI bill or you can add in Pell \ngrants, tuition assistance for Active-Duty personnel, but that cannot \nexceed 90 percent--and educational entities' revenues. We need to \nrestore that market force, that governing, if you will, to better \nensure the integrity of these programs.\n  So I would just say to my colleagues as we approach this Veterans \nDay, it is\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\ngreat that we are able to offer a benefit that provides free--I don't \ncare whether a person is from North Carolina or from Utah; they can go \nto college free and get a housing allowance for $1,500 a month. But I \nwant to make sure that when a GI--I don't care if it is Army, Air \nForce, Navy, Marines or whatever--gets their certificate or diploma, it \nis worth the paper it is written on and that they will in some cases be \nable to go on to graduate school or further their learning, but almost \nin any case that it enables them to go on to a job that enables them to \nbe self-sufficient.\n  With that, I am going to yield the floor to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, and to say to \nboth of my colleagues on the floor here: My best wishes to you and your \nconstituents and have a wonderful Veterans Day. I will see you all next \nweek. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the work of the Senator from \nDelaware on our committee. He is one of the good people around here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7899-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7899-S7901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS LIBERTY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again on the \ntopic of religious liberty. This is the fifth in a series of addresses \nI have given on this vitally important subject. In my previous remarks, \nI have discussed why religious liberty matters, why it is important, \nand why it deserves special protection from government interference. I \nhave also detailed the history of religious liberty in the United \nStates in order to show that the desire for religious freedom was \ncentral to our Nation's founding and to the very idea of America. From \nthe beginning, religious liberty has been a preeminent value in \nAmerican life. Government accommodates religion--not the other way \naround. Lastly, in my previous remarks, I have sought to explain how \nreligion has always had a robust public role in our society and to \nrebut the wrongheaded, ahistorical view that religion is a purely \nprivate matter that should be kept out of the public domain.\n  Today I turn to the status of religious liberty in contemporary \nAmerican life. My argument is straightforward. In ways that are both \nsurprising and unprecedented, religious liberty is under attack here in \nthe United States. I speak not merely of attacks on particular \npractices but also of attacks on the very idea of religious liberty \nitself--on the idea that there should be room in society for believers \nto live and to worship in ways that differ from prevailing orthodoxy.\n  The campaign against religious liberty has three prongs: the courts, \nthe Obama administration, and State legislatures. My goal today is to \nexplain how each of these institutions is undermining the vitality of \nreligious life in our country and why what they are doing is wrong.\n  Many Americans are unaware of the substantial threats religious \nliberty faces here in the United States. They look abroad to the Middle \nEast or to Africa, where Islamist regimes are killing Christians and \nother dissenters from religious orthodoxy, and suppose that by \ncomparison, things are not so bad here in the United States. While it \nis true that religious minorities in America do not face death or \nserious physical harm for choosing to live their faith, we must not \nblind ourselves to the ways in which our government institutions are \nundermining religious liberty itself. We must instead come to recognize \nthat powerful forces in our society are working actively to restrict \nthe ability of religious believers to live out their faith and to foist \nupon them government mandates that are flatly inconsistent with our \nmost deeply held beliefs.\n  I begin with the courts, which I identified as the first front in the \nfight against religious liberty. For a number of years now there has \nbeen a steady stream of cases in which everyday Americans have been \nsanctioned--sometimes severely--for adhering to religious tenants that \nconflict with current political orthodoxy. The examples are myriad. A \nphotographer in New Mexico was fined $7,000 for declining to photograph \na same-sex commitment ceremony on the grounds that her religious \nbeliefs teach that marriage is a union between one man and one woman \nand that she could not in good conscience lend her services to the \nevent. A florist in Washington State was fined $1,000 for declining to \nprovide flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding. And a couple in \nOregon who owned a cake shop were ordered to pay $135,000 for telling a \nsame-sex couple that they could not provide a cake for their wedding \nceremony because the shop owners adhere to the traditional, biblically \nbased view of marriage.\n  The message that these court cases send is clear: If you are a \nreligious individual with religiously rooted views that differ from the \ncurrent policies of the State, you follow your beliefs at your own \nperil. Even those who don't endorse the view that it is appropriate for \nbusinesses to deny service to customers on the basis of deeply held \nbeliefs must concede that the fines and other sanctions in these cases \npresent a direct threat to religious liberty.\n  Note that there was no suggestion in any of these cases that the \ndefendant's refusal to provide services actually prevented the same-sex \ncouple from obtaining the desired items. In each case, other \nphotographers, florists, and bakers without religious or moral \nobjections stood ready to assist. The State was not stepping in to \nensure that the couple had access to needed goods and services. Rather, \nthe injury to the couple in each case was that the defendant would not \nsanction their ceremony. The State did not like the message the \ndefendant's religious beliefs conveyed and so ordered the defendant to \npay a potentially ruinous fine.\n  The notion that government can override or punish individuals for \ndeeply held religious beliefs merely because those beliefs deviate from \nprevailing views strikes at the very heart of religious liberty. \nReligious liberty is the right of an individual to practice his or her \nbeliefs even in the face of government, social or community opposition. \nIf all that is needed for government to override a person's deeply held \nbeliefs is a disagreement over whether the person's beliefs send the \nright message, then religious liberty is weak indeed. It is no longer a \npreferred value that government must make room for but rather a common, \nrun-of-the-mill interest that government can override essentially at \nwill.\n  Recent court cases have undermined religious liberty and threaten the \nintegrity of our religious institutions in other ways as well. One \ncase, decided by the Supreme Court about 5 years ago, held that schools \ncan require student religious groups to accept nonbelievers as leaders, \neven though doing so could undermine the group's mission and install as \nleaders individuals who do not share the group's core beliefs. Other \ncases have sown confusion about students' ability to express religious \nconviction in school settings. Teachers and school administrators have \nbarred students from wearing religious imagery, from affirming their \nfaith in essays and speeches, and from performing religious music \nbecause they fear running afoul of judicial prohibitions on State \nestablishment of religion. Other officials have denied religious groups \naccess to State facilities to worship or to hold meetings, again \nfearing potential lawsuits.\n  But courts are not the only places where religious liberty is under \nattack. I am sorry to say that the current administration has done much \nto weaken religious freedom and to undermine the rights of conscience.\n  Certainly, the most notorious instance of the administration's \nefforts to undermine religious liberty is the ObamaCare contraception \nmandate. This provision requires employers to provide their employees \naccess to contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs even when the \nemployer has profound moral objections to such drugs. There is a narrow \nexemption for houses of worship, but countless other religious \nemployers--including religious schools, hospitals, and charities--must \neither comply with the mandate in violation of their religious beliefs \nor pay substantial financial penalties.\n  The administration has also stripped funding from religious groups \nthat refuse as a matter of conscience to toe the administration's line \non abortion and contraception. In a remarkable and shortsighted move, \nthe administration\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nrevoked funding for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' relief \nprogram for victims of human trafficking because the conference \ndeclined on religious grounds to refer victims for abortion or \ncontraceptives. So not only is the administration using the threat of \nfinancial loss to pressure religious groups to violate their beliefs, \nbut it is also harming trafficking victims by hindering the ability of \nreligious groups that differ from the administration on matters of \nconscience to aid victims.\n  The administration, too, has put Federal contractors that subscribe \nto traditional views on marriage and sexuality on the horns of a \nterrible dilemma. Last year the President issued an Executive order \nprohibiting contractors from taking into account sexual orientation or \ngender identity when hiring employees. The order contains no exemptions \nfor contractors with religious affiliations. Under the President's \norder, a contractor with a religious mission may be forced to hire an \nindividual who holds views that run counter to that mission in order to \nremain eligible for Federal contracts. The President's order thus \ncreates the very real possibility that religiously affiliated \ncontractors will have to choose between impairing the integrity of \ntheir organization and competing for Federal funds.\n  In addition to pursuing these troubling policies, the administration \nhas also taken extreme and unsupportable positions in court filings \nthat if adopted would undermine religious freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto finish these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Before the Supreme Court, the administration made the \nremarkable claim that Federal law authorizes the Federal Government to \ninvolve itself in the hiring and firing of church ministers. \nSpecifically, the administration said that Federal antidiscrimination \nlaws override the First Amendment right of churches to select whomever \nthey wish as ministers and instead allow the administration to actually \nsue a church if it believes a particular hiring or firing was improper. \nThis radical position would allow the Federal Government to insert \nitself into some of the most important decisions churches make \nregarding religious doctrine and governance.\n  Thankfully, the Supreme Court rejected the administration's position \nunanimously. Indeed, in a striking rebuke, the Court called the \nadministration's claim that the First Amendment provides no more \nprotection to a church in selecting its leader than it does to a \n``labor union or a social club . . . remarkable.'' The fact that the \nadministration felt comfortable making this argument, and apparently \nthought it was a correct argument, speaks volumes regarding this \nadministration's dim view of religious liberty.\n  More recently, the administration has signaled that the forced \nlegalization of same-sex marriage will present religious schools and \ninstitutions with significant challenges in reconciling school \nstandards with Federal antidiscrimination laws.\n  At oral argument in the Obergefell case, one of the Justices asked \nthe Solicitor General whether a religious school that opposed same-sex \nmarriage would lose its tax-exempt status. The Solicitor General \nresponded that ``it's certainly going to be an issue.'' With those \nseven words, the Solicitor General made clear that religious \ninstitutions that adhere to traditional views regarding marriage and \nsexuality--such as by providing housing only to opposite-sex couples--\nwill face potentially staggering financial consequences for their \ncommitment to their religious convictions.\n  The third front in the fight against religious liberty happens to be \nthe State legislatures. In many ways what we are seeing at the State \nlevel is a mirror of what the administration has been doing at the \nFederal level. Just as the administration has stripped funding from \nreligious organizations that refused to follow the administration's \nliberal social policies, States have withdrawn funding and licenses \nfrom groups that adhere to traditional religious views. Massachusetts, \nfor example, passed a law requiring State-licensed adoption agencies to \nplace children with same-sex couples. As a result, Catholic Charities, \nwhich had operated adoption services in the State for over 100 years, \nwas forced to shut down its adoption program. That is outrageous. \nCatholic Charities affiliates in Illinois were similarly forced to \nclose after the State announced it would no longer provide funding to \nadoption agencies that declined to place children with same-sex \ncouples. Other religiously affiliated groups and schools have lost \ncontracts, faced loss of accreditation, and have been denied permission \nto use public facilities because of their doctrinally based views on \nfamily, marriage, and sexuality. The mayor of Houston even went so far \nas to subpoena internal church communications as part of an \nintimidation campaign against churches that opposed a city \nnondiscrimination ordinance. Far from treating religious liberty as a \npreeminent value, many States and localities have thrust it aside in \nfavor of other goals.\n  Another disturbing trend at the State level has been the growing \nopposition to State religious freedom laws. Over 20 years ago I helped \nlead a broad bipartisan effort in Congress to pass the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act or RFRA. RFRA sought to undo a misguided \nSupreme Court decision that authorized Congress and the States to \nabridge religious freedom so long as their actions did not specifically \ntarget religion. RFRA says that government may not substantially burden \na person's exercise of religion unless doing so is necessary to further \na compelling government interest.\n  The coalition that helped pass RFRA included Members as ideologically \ndiverse as Ted Kennedy, Pat Leahy, Strom Thurmond, and Phil Gramm. \nGroups from across the political spectrum such as the ACLU, People For \nthe American Way, the Traditional Values Coalition, and the Christian \nLegal Society strongly supported the bill. Given this broad ideological \nsupport, RFRA passed the House without recorded opposition and passed \nthe Senate 97 to 3--nearly unanimous.\n  For a major piece of legislation like RFRA to pass Congress with only \nthree recorded ``no'' votes was nearly unprecedented and indicated the \nbreadth of support at the time for the view that religious liberty \ndeserves special protection.\n  Twenty years later, however, the consensus in favor of robust \nprotection for religious liberty has splintered. Whereas the Federal \nRFRA was able to pass Congress almost without opposition--the whole \nCongress, that is--recent efforts to enact State level RFRAs have run \ninto substantial resistance. Efforts in Indiana and Arizona are two \ngood examples. They ignited media firestorms and generated strong \npushback from groups who mistakenly viewed the measures as \ndiscriminatory. It should be emphasized both bills were modeled after \nthe Federal RFRA, but the political dynamics have changed so \ndramatically over the last 20 years that protecting religious freedom \nhas gone from being the rare issue on which all sides agree to becoming \na political hot potato. Some groups that supported the Federal RFRA \nhave even taken the position that future RFRAs must contain carve-outs \nfor particular groups or particular issue areas. Many of these same \ngroups endorsed an effort by Senate Democrats last year to exempt from \nthe Federal RFRA all Federal laws and regulations related to health \ncare. Of course any carve-outs in religious liberty protections \nundermine those protections because they limit the field on which \nreligious liberty has full effect. For this reason the Federal RFRA \ncontains no such carve-outs. Indeed, opposition to carve-outs was a key \nelement in both assembling and maintaining the RFRA coalition two \ndecades ago. Even if Members had varying views on the merits of certain \npractices, the one thing all could agree on is that religious liberty \nis a fundamental universal value that should apply equally to everyone, \nbut the price of admission for many groups today is a willingness to \ncut back on religious liberty in instances where religious belief \nconflicts with progressive social goals.\n  Twenty years ago this sort of hostage-taking was nowhere on the \nagenda, but religious liberty has now become a secondary goal or worse, \nan impediment, for many liberal groups that\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\nvalue what they call progressive social policy over protecting the \nrights of believers. I hate the use of that word ``progressive'' \nbecause it is anything but. This backtracking by many stalwart \ndefenders of religious liberty represents one of the most serious ways \nreligious freedom is under attack in this great country.\n  I will note one other political sea change that is undermining \nreligious liberty in the United States. For many years, groups on the \nleft have been advocating for laws to prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of sexual orientation. I am in general agreement with such laws \nand do not believe that sexual orientation should be grounds for \ndiscrimination or mistreatment. Many of the groups advocating for these \nlaws have previously been willing to include exemptions for religious \norganizations that hold traditional views on marriage and sexuality. I \nbelieve such exemptions are appropriate and strike the right balance by \nprotecting rights to nondiscrimination while enabling religious \norganizations to hold true to their beliefs. Indeed, I believe it is \nessential for nondiscrimination laws to properly accommodate religious \nliberty, and I would actively oppose any such law that fails to account \nfor the rights of religious believers.\n  Unfortunately, many groups that were previously willing to support \nreligious exemptions in nondiscrimination laws have reversed course. \nFor example, many groups that supported last Congress's Federal \nEmployment Nondiscrimination Act or ENDA, which would prohibit \ndiscrimination in the workplace on the basis of sexual orientation, \nhave withdrawn their support for the act because it contains a robust \nexemption for religious organizations. This Congress, they are instead \nsupporting the Equality Act, which contains no religious exemption at \nall.\n  I supported ENDA because I believed it reflected the right balance \nbetween nondiscrimination and religious liberty. I took some criticism \nfor doing so. I still believe it does reflect the right balance, but \nmany groups on the left have indicated they are willing to cast \nreligious liberty aside in furtherance of other goals. For these \ngroups, religious liberty no longer deserves special protection. It is \nno longer a preeminent value. Rather, it should be accommodated only so \nfar as it is convenient and does not interfere with other objectives. \nThis is a sea change and one that bodes ill for the future vitality of \nreligious freedom.\n  I said at the outset that religious liberty is under attack in \nAmerica in ways that are both surprising and unprecedented. Certainly \nthe willingness of former defenders of religious freedom to turn their \nbacks on believers is both.\n  I would like to close by returning to the New Mexico photographer \ncase I mentioned earlier, for that case contains perhaps the most \nsurprising and unprecedented feature of all. In a concurring opinion, \none of the judges in the case called the requirement to violate one's \nreligious beliefs when they conflict with State social policy ``the \nprice of citizenship.'' That statement represents a complete inversion \nof the relationship between government authority and religious liberty \nin America. When we are born or become American citizens, we do not \nsurrender our rights of conscience to the government. We do not pledge \nour allegiance to a secular God. We retain our right to religious \nliberty. Indeed, not only do we retain our right; our government \nguarantees our right to freely practice our faith in accordance with \nthe dictates of our own conscience. As the Declaration of Independence \ninstructs, all men--and women--are endowed by their Creator with \ncertain unalienable rights, and it is the fundamental purpose of \ngovernment to secure those rights.\n  If there is a price we pay as American citizens, it is not that we \ngive up our God-given rights, first and foremost of which is the right \nof religious liberty, it is that we agree to work together to promote \nthe common good of our country.\n  Subjugating religious beliefs to government decrees is not the price \nof citizenship. To the contrary, respecting and honoring the \nfundamental rights of all Americans is the price our government pays in \norder to enjoy the continued consent of the American people. Those who \nattack religious liberty and seek to devalue its place in society \nfundamentally misunderstands this key point.\n  Unfortunately, too many in America today, from the courts to the \nObama administration, to the State legislatures, undervalue religious \nfreedom and view it at best as a secondary goal. People of good will in \nCongress and across our Nation need to recognize that religious liberty \nis under attack and that unless we stand up and vocally support the \nrights of believers to live their faith, we will find much of what we \nhave fought for and much of what our forebears fought for swept away. \nWe must fortify the rights of believers to follow their conscience even \nwhen their fellow citizens or elected officials would prefer a \ndifferent course.\n  I will have much more to say on this topic in future remarks, but \nwith that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7901-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7901-S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this week we honor the men and women who \nserve our Nation with honor and their families who also sacrifice--whom \nwe do not remember enough--who sacrifice so much for the servicemembers \nthey love and for all of us in our country.\n  The sacrifice of our veterans demands that we fulfill the promises we \nhave made. This body is always willing to spend more dollars in \narmaments and on weapons, but when it comes time to fulfill our \nobligations to veterans, too many in this body are not generous enough.\n  I am the only Ohioan ever to serve a full term on the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. I take that duty very seriously. I know \nthe Presiding Officer, Senator Tillis from North Carolina, does too. \nThat means working to end the VA backlog. It means putting a better \nsystem in place. It means ensuring that our veterans have a roof over \ntheir heads and a place to call home. It means providing veterans with \nhealth care and the educational opportunities they deserve and which \nthey have earned.\n  Too many veterans face mental health challenges that can end in \ntragedy. More than 8,000 veterans each year take their own lives--154 a \nweek, 22 a day. Hundreds of thousands of veterans struggle with \ninvisible injuries. Nearly 300,000 have been diagnosed with post-\ntraumatic stress, and 300,000 have faced traumatic brain injuries--all \nbecause of the service they gave to us.\n  Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for \nAmerican Veterans Act. It is a good start yet not enough. We need to \nmake sure that when servicemembers return home, they have the \neducational and the employment opportunities they need, not only to \nsurvive but to thrive.\n  The GI bill's educational benefits are critical, but veterans, \nunfortunately, have a limited amount of time before their GI benefits \nexpire. In crowded colleges--whether in North Carolina, Oklahoma or \nOhio--general education requirements and prerequisites often fill up \nquickly. Many colleges and universities in my State offer priority \nregistration to veterans. All of our colleges and universities need to \nfollow Ohio's lead. That is why I worked with Senator Tillis, the \nPresiding Officer, on legislation to ensure that all veterans and \nservicemembers and their qualifying dependents can use their GI \nbenefits to their full potential and be guaranteed priority \nregistration.\n  The Senator from North Carolina and I also introduced the Fry \nScholarship Enhancement Act, which would expand eligibility for the \nVA's Yellow Ribbon Program to help students avoid out-of-pocket tuition \nand fees for programs that cost more than the allowance set by the \npost-9/11 GI bill.\n  Sadly, for too many veterans, they are far from the goal where they \nshould be. They struggle just to find a place to call home.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, \nsome 50,000 veterans were homeless during a survey conducted on a \nsingle night in January 2014. That is 50,000 too many. It is a disgrace \nthat after serving our country with honor, thousands of veterans are \nleft without a roof over their heads.\n\n[[Page S7902]]\n\n  Earlier this month I visited the Joseph House in Cincinnati, where \nNathan Pelletier and his team of dedicated staff and volunteers provide \naddiction treatment and traditional housing.\n  A group of us meeting there, mostly veterans who are homeless or were \nhomeless, listened to Britton Carter, who was formerly homeless. He \ncompleted his treatment program in the Joseph House. He now works as a \ncase manager there helping other struggling veterans.\n  Veterans such as Mr. Carter have served our country with honor. We \nowe them support, and we owe them counseling when they return home. \nThat is why I joined my colleagues in introducing the Veteran Housing \nStability Act of 2015, which would make meaningful improvements to \nservices for homeless veterans that would give veterans more access to \npermanent housing opportunities.\n  We know in the Veterans' Affairs Committee a number of things. We \nknow that the unemployment rate of veterans is generally higher than \nsociety's unemployment rate. We know that veterans' suicide rate is \nhigher than society's suicide rate. We know that veterans' drug \naddiction is higher than society's drug addiction rate. We know that \nveterans have suffered from PTSD and traumatic brain injury in numbers \nmuch higher than the general population. That is why we owe them so \nmuch. We in this body so rarely think about the cost of war.\n  We, as I said earlier, are willing to send more money to buy more \nweapons, to spend more money in armaments. We are not so generous when \nit comes time to take care of our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7902-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HONOR FLIGHTS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the last point I wish to make before \nturning to the Senator from Oklahoma is something that we call Honor \nFlights. One of the great things that have come out of the National \nWorld War II Memorial is that men and women who have served in World \nWar II are now getting the opportunity to go to visit this National \nWorld War II Memorial.\n  Retired Air Force Capt. Earl Morse, who worked in a VA clinic in \nSpringfield, OH, would often talk with his World War II veteran \npatriots. He realized that for most of these veterans, their dream of \nseeing the memorial built on the National Mall would never come true. \nSo one day in 2004, Captain Morse, a pilot and a member of the air club \nat Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, asked one of his patients if he \ncould personally fly him to Washington free of charge. The veteran, Mr. \nLoy, broke down in tears and accepted Earl's offer. Soon Earl was \noffering to fly other World War II veterans to visit the memorial and \nsoliciting help from other pilots.\n  Eleven pilots from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base volunteered. In \nMay 2005, the first Honor Flight took off from Springfield, OH.\n  A decade later, the Honor Flight Network is a national nonprofit that \nhas flown 100,000 veterans, usually 40 or 50 or 60 at a time in a \ncharter flight--always with a caretaker because these veterans are \nnever young. They are World War II veterans. They have been out of the \nservice now for 70 years at least.\n  The Honor Flight Program is in 41 States. I have had the honor of \nmeeting a number of them. Toledo, OH, seems to be one which has \nparticularly excelled and is encouraging local people, raising local \nmoney and getting every single veteran from northwest Ohio who was able \nto and wanted to join these Honor Flights.\n  I will quote one of these volunteers. Jim Salamon works for the Honor \nFlight Program in Dayton. He told me of a volunteer who goes by Ace and \nwho works at an Arby's in Maryland and provides discounted meals for \nHonor Flight Program attendees. Jim said:\n\n       Ace is part of Honor Flight Dayton's family. We rely on Ace \n     and he has not let us down. Over the last nine years Ace has \n     saved us more than $30,000 [because of Arby's donating these \n     meals], which pays the cost of transporting 92 veterans.\n\n  With an average of 800 World War II veterans dying each day, the \nmission of the Honor Flight Program is more important now than ever.\n  I am thankful to those who have helped Honor Flight. I am thankful to \nthose veterans and their families who have done so much.\n  I remind my colleagues, as they are always eager to vote for more \nmoney for weapons, that we should understand and think about the cost \nof war and take care of our returning servicemembers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Well, I would tell you--as a person who has been to Guantanamo \nBay and has seen that facility and am very aware of what is going on \nthere--we are missing one big element. The terrorists do not know who \nthe guards are at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nor do they have access to \ntheir families.\n  And while they are infuriated about Gitmo, I promise you if those \nprisoners are moved into Colorado, Oklahoma or Kansas or any other \nplace, the terrorists overseas won't rage about Gitmo anymore, they \nwill then rage about Colorado or they will then rage about Illinois or \nwherever those prisoners are being held. They are not mad at Gitmo and \nthe treatment there. They are mad that these terrorists, whom they have \naffection for, are being detained by the United States of America. \nRight now all of the individuals who are guarding those individuals and \nkeeping them detained will no longer be hidden anymore because \nterrorists could linger around the outside of these facilities and \ncontact the different guards that are coming in and out. Suddenly, the \nguards and their family members become exposed and the stakes for those \nindividuals are exposed.\n  He is not thinking through the real consequences of flippantly moving \nthese individuals into the United States. It is a big issue that we \nface.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7902-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7902-S7903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, but I have to say this last weekend, as \nI was going through all the different news and the many things that we \ntrack, I was quite surprised last Friday afternoon at the way the \nPresident addressed something that this Nation has\n\n[[Page S7903]]\n\ndiscussed for 7 years--a pipeline permit, a permit called the Keystone \nXL Pipeline.\n  It is not a revolutionary thing. Quite frankly, I wish to show you \nsomething. These are all the pipelines that currently exist in the \nUnited States.\n  Right now, there are 19 international crossings of pipelines already \ncoming into the United States, either from Canada into the northern \npart of the United States or from Mexico and from the South. There are \nalready 19 of them. This would just be a 20th pipeline. There is \nnothing different about that.\n  There are 60,000 miles of crude oil pipelines in the United States \nright now. There are about 63,000 miles of refined product pipelines. \nIf you want to go to natural gas, there are about 300,000 miles of \nnatural gas pipelines already in the United States. Yet this pipeline \nis treated like some radical and new invention--as if we have never \nconsidered a pipeline before. But what surprised me so much wasn't the \n2,600-plus days that this pipeline request sat on the President's desk. \nWhat surprised me was his reason for actually deciding not to do then \nthe permits. That was the surprising part.\n  Quite frankly, last Friday afternoon as I heard the reasons, I went \nback, read the transcript, and these were the three reasons the \nPresident gave. He said: No. 1, ``the pipeline wouldn't make a \nmeaningful long-term contribution to our economy,'' and he encouraged \nus to pass a highway bill instead because it would provide more jobs. I \ndon't remember ever discussing and saying: This pipeline is going to \nprovide as many jobs as highways. That has never been discussed on this \nfloor. It is apples and oranges. A highway bill is public funding. It \nis the taxpayers that actually fund transportation, and we should do \nhighways in transportation.\n  This is a private project that was never intended to have as many \njobs as a highway. It is a pipeline. So he said it is not going to \nprovide enough jobs, and so he is not going to permit it.\n  The second reason he gave is this: ``The pipeline would not lower gas \nprices for American consumers.'' He said gasoline prices are already \nlow, and so we don't need this pipeline--as if gasoline prices don't \nrise and fall and we shouldn't plan forward for the future.\n  Do you want to know why gasoline prices are low right now? It is \nbecause over the decades, Americans have done this, and we have an \nefficient system of moving energy. By the way, the pipeline is the \nsafest and least expensive way to move energy around our country. So \nwhat the President is saying is this: What we have is enough. I don't \nwant to plan for the future anymore. I don't want to look for what is \ngoing to help our children. Our prices are low enough. I don't care \nwhat our children pay in the future days.\n  Well, that is absurd. But, quite frankly, the third one is the one \nthat was the most jarring to me, so I want to be able to say this \nstatement to you. This is reason No. 3 the President gave: ``Shipping \ncrude oil into our country from unstable countries would not increase \nAmerica's energy security.'' Let me read that to you again because I \nwas so stunned by it. This is exactly from the President's speech off \nof the White House site. This is what the President said off this \nstatement. He will not permit the Keystone Pipeline coming from Canada \ninto the United States. He said shipping dirtier crude oil into our \ncountry would not increase America's energy security. He said:\n\n       What has increased America's energy security is our \n     strategy over the past several years to reduce our reliance \n     on dirty fossil fuels from unstable parts of the world.\n\n  Now, as I heard the President say that, I was a little taken aback \nbecause I don't remember any other President referring to Canada as an \nunstable part of the world from which we don't want to get our energy--\nan unstable country, and saying Canada was that country.\n  So I kept reading it and rereading it, thinking maybe he was implying \nsomething else, but the problem with that is he either means that \nCanada is an unstable country and we don't want to be reliant on them \nto get energy or he is saying the Middle East and other countries are \nunstable and we don't want to rely on them, so maybe we should buy from \nCanada instead. Either way it makes absolutely no sense.\n  But in its context--as I read it and read it and read it--the \nPresident stated that we don't need to have a Keystone Pipeline because \nCanada is unstable and we don't want to buy from unstable countries.\n  I would tell you that since the War of 1812 we have gotten along with \nCanada pretty well. We seem to have settled our differences about 1815, \nand they have been a very stable trading partner for us. It seems \nnonsensical to hear the President say: Because it doesn't produce \nenough jobs, I am not going to permit it. Because it won't affect the \nprice of gasoline today, I won't permit it. And because Canada is \nunstable as a trading partner, I am not going to permit it.\n  The President can choose to do whatever he chooses to do, but answers \nlike this make no sense to the American people and they make no sense \nto energy country when we understand full well the actual facts on the \nground.\n  In recent days, we have actually started an energy swap with Mexico. \nMany people may not even know that. You see, all oil is not the same. \nHeavier crude oil is preferred by many of our refineries in the United \nStates. Quite frankly, our refineries are capable of separating out \nmore of the different minerals and such that are within heavy crude or \nwhat is often called sour crude. Our refineries prefer the heavier \ncrude, much like what Canada produces and many parts of the United \nStates and Mexico produces. Many of the refineries in Mexico actually \nprefer the light sweet crude. We actually have more light sweet crude \nin America than we can use and what our refineries would prefer to \nhave.\n  So in the past couple of months, Mexico and the United States have \nworked a swap from pipelines, where they are picking up about 75,000 \nbarrels of light sweet and swapping us 75,000 barrels of heavier crude \nbecause they have a commodity we want and we have a commodity they \nwant. That is how we could solve some of our energy issues, to actually \nlook for what is the most efficient, whether it is purchasing it from a \npipeline from Canada, which makes great economic sense to us, or \nexporting our oil anywhere else around the world, whether to Mexico or \nany other country.\n  This body knows full well the United States cannot sell our oil on \nthe world market because we have a statute in place that would have us \nbelieve we are running out of oil rather than having a tremendous \namount, which is factually true, and we have particular types of oil \nthat like sweet crude many refineries around the world want. We \nactually have more of it than we can use. We should sell that. We \nshould put that on the open market. It is cleaner, it is easier to \nrefine, and it is a way to be able to stabilize jobs in the United \nStates.\n  I have been in front of this body time after time with a simple \nstatement: We can sell unleaded around the world, we can sell diesel \naround the world, we can sell coal around the world, and we can sell \nnatural gas around the world, but for whatever reason we can't sell \ncrude oil around the world. That makes absolutely no sense and we \nshould fix it.\n  Tens of thousands of Americans have lost their jobs because this body \nhas not acted on something as simple as being able to sell a product \nthe world wants and we have on the world market. It is fixable. It is \nnot about environmental disaster. The world is going to use oil. Even \nthe administration and quite frankly even the President in his own \nspeech made this statement last week: The truth is the United States \nwill continue to rely on oil and gas. And so will the world. Until some \nother solution is out there, which no one sees currently on the \nhorizon, we are going to continue to use oil and gas. Why don't we do \nit the cleanest way possible and why don't we provide American jobs \nwhile we are doing it?\n  It is fixable. It shouldn't be divisive. It is about putting \nAmericans back to work and about helping our economy.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Daines).

Mr. President, tomorrow is Veterans Day, and on Veterans\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nDay it is important that we thank America's veterans and their families \nfor their service to our Nation. Veterans Day is a time to honor all \nthose brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way so we may \nenjoy the tremendous freedoms and personal liberties that make our \nNation the greatest in the world. Such bravery deserves our unending \ngratitude.\n  We have an obligation to honor them all year-round by fighting to \nensure they have the resources, the support, and the protections which \nthey have earned. They fought for us, and now we need to fight for \nthem. When we send our men and women in uniform abroad, we can be \nconfident they will do their utmost to complete their missions. Our \nmission, as Senators, is to minimize the need to send our armed \nservices members into harm's way. The root causes of overseas conflict \nare complex and diverse, from religious divisions to natural resource \nallocations, to democratic yearnings. Increasingly, in the modern era, \nclimate change is straining the strands of stability until they snap.\n  When I was chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy \nIndependence and Global Warming, I held a 2007 hearing where one U.S. \ngeneral told the story of Somalia, how drought in Somalia had caused a \nfamine and how that famine had ultimately then led to and encouraged a \nconflict. The pattern in Somalia is the same pattern that we see in \nother countries: drought leading to famine, leading to fights between \ndifferent tribes or peoples who otherwise had no reason to fight. Aid \ncame in from the United States, warlords started to fight over it, and \nthat is how 18 U.S. service people lost their lives in what we now call \n``Black Hawk Down.''\n  In 2010, terrible droughts in Russia and China and floods in Pakistan \ndecimated wheat harvests and created a global shortage. The price of \nwheat increased dramatically. The Middle East, home to the world's top \nnine wheat importers, felt it severely, especially since the region's \nfarmers struggled with their own parched fields. Much of Syria was \ngripped with the worst drought it had ever experienced. The price of \nbread skyrocketed across the region and demands for regime change were \nnot far behind.\n  As we look around the world, we can see, hear, and feel how climate \nchange is a threat multiplier and a catalyst for conflict today. While \nwe have to deal with the consequences of climate change that are \nalready apparent, there is still time to prevent future catastrophes. \nThat is why President Obama has been using the tool he has in the Clean \nAir Act to reduce carbon pollution. He has used it to increase the fuel \nefficiency of America's cars and trucks, and now he has released the \nClean Power Plan, but Republicans want to undo it with the \nCongressional Review Act.\n  Starting next Monday in this Chamber, Senate Republicans can bring \nthe resolution to the Senate floor at any time to dismantle the Clean \nPower Plan. Undoing it would be bad for our economy, bad for our \nhealth, and bad for our national security.\n  Now, 2014 was the hottest year in global history. Records go back all \nthe way to 1880--the warmest year. The first half of this year is now \nthe hottest January to June in that same record. The Clean Power Plan \ncaptures the scientific urgency and the economic opportunity necessary \nto avoid the worst consequences of climate change. The Clean Power Plan \nprovides flexibility to the States to find the solutions to reducing \ncarbon pollution that works best for their situations, unleashing a \nclean energy revolution in every single State in the Union. It will \ncreate jobs and save consumers billions on their electricity bills. It \nwill avert almost 100,000 asthma attacks and prevent thousands of \npremature deaths. The climate and health benefits of the rule are \nestimated to save $34 billion to $54 billion per year by the year 2030.\n  Using the Clean Air Act to reduce carbon pollution is grounded in the \nSupreme Court's 2007 decision that confirmed the Environmental \nProtection Agency's authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other \nheat-trapping gases as pollutants under the Act. The Supreme Court has \nreaffirmed that authority in two subsequent cases, and we have used \nthat authority to set carbon pollution standards for vehicles. These \nstandards, along with increasing the fuel economy of our Nation's cars \nand trucks, are reducing pollution, saving drivers money, and sparking \ninnovation. We will see similar benefits coming from the Clean Power \nPlan.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate say it can't be done. Some will \nsay it will raise electricity bills. Some will say it will kill jobs. \nThe problem for them is their claims are just not true. The Clean Power \nPlan is a plan to create jobs and to grow our economy. It is a signal \nto the marketplace to invest in clean energy--in wind, in solar, and \nother renewable energy resources. That is the 21st century. Too many \npeople on the Senate floor keep looking at the future in a rearview \nmirror. They keep looking backward instead of ahead, unleashing the \ntechnologies of the 21st century. The green generation, the young \npeople in our country, they know we can do this. They know renewables \nare the technologies of the 21st century. If we do it, it will be a \nsignal to the rest of the world that the United States is going to lead \nthe effort to reduce greenhouse gases, while unleashing a job-creating \nrenewable energy revolution not just for our own country but for the \nentire planet.\n  Just 2 months ago, in September, Congress had the honor of hearing \nfrom Pope Francis, who shared his message of action. He told us the \nAmerican people can do it. He said:\n\n       I call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect \n     our steps and to avert the most serious effects of the \n     environmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am \n     convinced we can make a difference and I have no doubt that \n     the United States--and this Congress--have an important role \n     to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and \n     strategies.\n\n  He is right. The Pope is right. This is the time for action from \nCongress--not denial, not obstructionism. Now is the time for the \nUnited States, for this Senate, to be the leader in finding the global \nsolutions to this threat of dangerous climate change.\n  So what the Pope did was take the message of Christ and not deliver a \n``Sermon on the Mount,'' he delivered a sermon on the Hill--a sermon on \nthe Hill to the Members of the House and the Senate to do everything \nthey can to reduce dangerous greenhouse gases. In saying that to us, he \nsaid it as someone who taught high school chemistry, as someone who \nknows this issue--a Pope who taught chemistry. The Pope did not believe \nthat science is at odds with religion. The Pope believes science and \ntechnology is the answer to our prayers, and he called upon us to \nunleash a technological revolution to reduce these dangerous greenhouse \ngases.\n  Why do we know that we can do this? It is a moral imperative. The \nPope basically said three things: No. 1, the planet is dangerously \nwarming and the science confirms that; No. 2, human activity is largely \ncontributing to the warming of the planet and the science confirms \nthat; and, No. 3, since human beings are causing this problem, they \nhave a moral responsibility and a moral imperative to do something \nabout it. We are the United States of America. We are the global leader \nin technology. We are the revolution. So let's see how far we have come \nin a very brief period of time.\n  In 2005, we installed 79 megawatts of solar in the United States. \nSolar technology had been around for generations. Einstein actually won \nhis Nobel Prize for breakthroughs in solar research. Yet this is where \nwe were in 2005; a tiny 79 megawatts was all we were able to install. \nThen we began to change policies in the United States. We began to have \nStates across the country, 30 States, which said we are going to have \nmore renewable electricity in our States. We put tax breaks on the \nbooks, and look what happened in that very brief period of time. By \n2014, nearly 7,000 megawatts in solar were installed in 1 year, up from \n79, 100 times more solar, after not doing anything for generations. \nPolicies were put on the books. All the deniers, all those doubters--\nall of a sudden everything they said about how solar wasn't practical, \nsolar couldn't solve the problem--were confronted with this reality.\n  This year nearly 8,000 megawatts are going to be installed; next \nyear, 12,000 megawatts of solar. We are going to have 40,000 megawatts \nof solar installed by the end of next year in the United States--\n40,000--and we were doing 79\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\ntotal in 2005. That is how rapidly it is changing. That is how many new \njobs are being created in America.\n  The same thing is happening in wind. Wind is going to be producing \n20,000 new megawatts in just 2015 and 2016.\n  So here is the good news, and it is incredibly great. There will be \n300,000 jobs in the wind and solar sector by the end of next year, \n300,000 people working. There will only be 65,000 coal miners, but we \nwill have 300,000 people with these incredible jobs in wind and solar. \nThat is a revolution that wasn't on the books just 10 years ago. All \nthe experts said it can't happen, it won't work, and it will never be \nsuccessful.\n  So these revolutions are the things on which we have to continue to \nbe the leaders to ensure that we put on the books and keep on the books \nso that we are successful. There is a technological imperative that we \nlead, there is an economic imperative that we lead because these jobs \nget created, and there is a moral responsibility that the United States \nhas because we were the leading polluter for 100 years on the planet. \nChina has now caught up to us, but a lot of that CO2 is red, \nwhite, and blue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MARKEY. So here is where we are: The President is going to use \nall of his legal authority to reach a deal in Paris. He will do it \npursuant to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \nthat was signed by President George Herbert Walker Bush and ratified by \nthe Senate in 1992, so everything he is doing in Paris is completely \npursuant to a treaty that was agreed to by this body. He is doing the \nClean Power Plan to reduce greenhouse gases by 30 percent by the year \n2030 in the electric utility sector, by the Clean Air Act of 1990, a \nlaw passed by the Senate. He increased the fuel economy standards to \n54.5 miles per gallon by the year 2025, still the largest reduction of \ngreenhouse gas in the world's history, pursuant to a law passed in 2007 \nby the U.S. Senate.\n  Underlying it all is an authority given to him by the Supreme Court \nin 2007, in Massachusetts versus the EPA, which mandated the EPA had to \nact if they found there was an endangerment of an environment. All of \nthis is legal, all of it is authority the President is using, and all \nof it is working to create a new era of clean energy jobs all across \nour country so that we are no longer preaching temperance from a \nbarstool to the rest of the world. We can now say to China and to \nIndia: You too must put your reductions on the books.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7905-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to \ntalk about two issues that are of particular importance to me. When \nmost look at me now, they think about energy and more typically about \nAlaskan energy. I am not going to disappoint tonight. I would like to \nspeak to that, but I would also like to speak this evening about the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, the SPR. We have been talking about it a \nlot of late. It has been viewed as a source of revenue--a pay-for, if \nyou will--with certain measures that we have seen of late, whether it \nbe the transportation measure that we have in front of us, the budget \ndeal that was executed a couple weeks ago, or other measures.\n  I want to take a few minutes this evening to talk about the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. I will start by first addressing what I will call \nthe flagship SPR. It is the very important stuff, if you will, within \nthe Reserve, and that is the crude oil. I call this the flagship \nbecause there are five product petroleum reserve sites in the \nNortheast. We have product reserve sites for gasoline, distillate, and \nhome heating oil, but these are relatively small reserve sites. There \nare about 2 million barrels total. I think their effectiveness is \nprobably more controversial. But the flagship SPR is truly--when we \nthink about the impact, the import to our economy and to a level of \nstability, the flagship Strategic Petroleum Reserve occupies giant \nunderground caverns along the gulf coast.\n  I had the opportunity to visit the site of one of our Strategic \nPetroleum Reserves. It holds some 695 million barrels, and they are \nready to cover our Nation's net imports for several months if global \nenergy markets should spiral out of control.\n  The comforting reality about these flagship SPRs is that, through \nthick and thin, these reserves are rarely ever tapped. They have \noffered a measure of security and stability that I think is unique in \nthe history of global commerce.\n  Amid higher levels of domestic production and lower levels of \nimports, a number of reforms are being considered for the SPR by the \nDepartment of Energy now. There has been a lot of discussion. There is \na study underway by the DOE, and a discussion about upgrading the \ndistribution capacity of the SPR is underway, and it clearly has merit.\n  The North American energy landscape has changed so quickly and so \ndramatically that the volume of oil we can pump out of the Reserve is \ngreater and potentially much greater than the volume of oil we can \nactually move to refineries. This is something we need to understand \nand study more, but it is something that--we have congested waterways, \nwe can look at reversed pipelines and so on, ways that we can figure \nout how we can move this oil more readily if we so need it.\n  In the measure we have just executed with the budget proposal, there \nis funding set aside for Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintenance and \nlife extension, hopefully for marine terminals, but effectively \nrecognizing that we need to make sure that our SPR actually functions \nas it is intended. That study is underway. We will learn more, \nhopefully in the spring, but the imperative to have a functioning, \nworkable SPR is one that goes to national security, really, from an \noverall stability argument. I remain opposed to suggestions by some \nthat we should use the Reserve to pay for completely unrelated programs \nor that we simply sell off the entire stockpile, as some have \nsuggested.\n  As I wrote in my July report of this year called ``A Turbulent \nWorld,'' we have drawn down SPR only on a limited number of occasions. \nIn the entire history of the Reserve itself, only approximately 166 \nmillion barrels have ever left the storage sites for any reasons. So \n166 barrels have been sold off over the course of the life of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve for exchanges, emergencies, tests, deficit \nreductions. Everything that we have ever done that has involved a sale \nof the SPR totals just about 166 million barrels. That is this graph \nover here.\n  Over here are the new proposed sales to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. If we add up the barrels this Congress--the 114th Congress--\nhas already committed to sell for SPR modernization, the Bipartisan \nBudget Act, the DRIVE Act, the Transportation bill, and then a bill \nover on the House side, the 21st Century Cures Act, we are looking at a \ntotal of 279 million barrels to be sold off. That is 40 million for SPR \nmodernization, 58 million for the Bipartisan Budget Act, 21st Century \nCures Act is 80 million, and the highway bill is 101 million. We would \nbe selling off 279 million barrels total. Think about that--in the \nentire life of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 166 million barrels \nsold off. In one Congress, what we are proposing is 279 million \nbarrels. It is quite eye-catching.\n  These numbers matter. The SPR is designed to provide 90 days of net \nimport protection. It is a pretty simple math equation we are dealing \nwith. If we import more, we need more in storage; if we import less, we \nneed less. Currently, net imports are about 5 million barrels per day. \nTherefore, the bare minimum we need in storage is 450 million barrels. \nSo if we execute all of the sales the 114th Congress has either \napproved or is considering, we dip below the bare minimum that is \nrequired--the 450 million barrels--by the end of the 10-year window. I \nam going to be releasing another report on the cumulative impact of all \nthese sales on the integrity of the Reserve, so we should be seeing \nthat in a few days.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7905-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7905-S7906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PETROLEUM ADMINISTRATION FOR DEFENSE DISTRICT 5\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Now, Mr. President, I would like to turn quickly to a \nDepartment of Energy proposal to construct a new petroleum product \nreserve\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\non the west coast. We call this PADD 5, short for Petroleum \nAdministration for Defense District 5. PADD 5 is important because it \nconsumes 17 percent of the Nation's gasoline, 13 percent of its diesel \nfuel, and 30 percent of its jet fuel.\n  At the same time, PADD 5 is geographically isolated, according to the \nEnergy Information Administration. The approximately 30 refineries \noperating on the west coast are responsible for supplying nearly all of \nits petroleum products.\n  The argument for a product reserve is relatively straightforward. \nBecause PADD 5 is separated from the rest of the country by the Rocky \nMountains and from the world by the Pacific Ocean, a stockpile of \nrefined fuel should be established. That is the argument that is out \nthere. I don't oppose a study of this concept, but I can see the \npitfalls out there. PADD 5 imports over 1 million barrels of crude oil \nand petroleum products each day, suggesting that it really is not cut \noff from the world in the first place. And bear in mind the size of the \ndistrict that we are talking about. Any stockpile would have to be \nreally enormous to have significant impact.\n  Finally, would Federal gasoline reserves supplement or replace \ncommercial stocks? That is a question that needs to be asked.\n  So perhaps the solution is not a refined product reserve at all but \ninstead a return to basics, and that basic is crude oil. After all, \nthere are reasons we chose crude oil instead of the products when we \nfirst created the Reserve. By and large, that rationale hasn't changed. \nFirst, oil is better suited, chemically and economically, for long-term \nstorage underground, we don't have seasonal specifications on oil as we \ndo on gasoline, and oil can be processed into an array of products \nwhile gasoline cannot.\n\n  Very quickly, taking this back to Alaska, a gasoline reserve on the \nwest coast of any size would be small potatoes when compared to the \nincredible resource base we have in Alaska. For decades now, tankers \nhave shipped North Slope crude to the line of refineries that stretch \nfrom Anacortes, WA, down to Los Angeles. Drivers up and down the coast \nfuel their cars with gasoline that is refined from this Alaskan oil \nevery day.\n  Alaska North Slope crude oil is chemically similar to the kinds of \noil stored in the SPR. In fact, according to the Department of Energy, \nover 30 million barrels of Alaskan oil have been stored in the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. West coast refineries are optimized to run \nAlaskan crude. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System is only pumping about \n500,000 barrels per day, down from 2 million barrels per day at its \npeak. So there is plenty of room in our already built, already \noperating pipeline. The problem is--and you have heard me say this \nbefore--the Federal Government controls some 60 percent of the land in \nour State. More than 10 billion barrels of oil are buried under our \nonshore Federal lands alone, to say nothing of what is held in our \noffshore waters but remain almost universally inaccessible to American \nexplorers and producers. That includes about 10 billion barrels in the \nnonwilderness portion of ANWR, where we are asking for permission to \ndevelop 2,000 acres or 0.01 percent of the surface of the refuge. That \nis all we are asking to access. Beyond our ANWR resources, we have at \nleast another 900 million barrels in our National Petroleum Reserve, \nwhich is an area that is specifically reserved for development. The \nestimate on the 900 million barrels there is that it is likely far too \nlow.\n  For the record, I would add that Alaskans overwhelmingly support \ndevelopment of both of these areas. More than 70 percent of Alaskans \nwant development, understanding the significant economic benefits it \nwill bring and the strong record of environmental stewardship we have \nin the State.\n  We have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to develop our \nresources in order to create jobs, generate revenues, and bolster our \nNation's security and competitiveness. By doing this, we can actually \naddress not just one but two threats: First, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nis just one-third full; in large part because of the anti-energy \ndecisions made by this administration and the west coast is more \nvulnerable to supply disruptions as a result of falling production.\n  You think about a crisis situation in the Middle East. The west coast \nwill need more oil. Its refineries are ready to run Alaskan crude and \nAlaskans are ready to ship it, but there is nothing to ship because the \noil is still in the ground and there is no way to transport it from the \nNorth Slope to the terminals along the southern coast of the State.\n  I am not talking about keeping our oil in pristine condition, never \nto be used. Energy is not fine china that you keep up on a shelf. The \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve is not a petroleum preserve. Our strategic \nstocks, barrels ready to go, should rarely be tapped, but Alaskan \nresources are already part of the daily life of Californians, \nHawaiians. The resource must be accessible, though, but first they need \nto be accessed.\n  Opening Alaska's resources now would ensure that more oil is \ntransported through TAPS. A healthy pipeline would ensure that oil can \nbe shipped from Alaska to fuel the west coast refineries when they need \nit and help ensure that energy remains affordable for the west coast.\n  Instead of constructing an entirely new product reserve, as some are \ncontemplating, perhaps what we should do is preserve the infrastructure \nwe have already built and leverage it to boost our energy security. Why \nwould we want to build a reserve when you can prevent a shortage in the \nfirst place by letting a State that wants to produce oil go ahead and \nproduce the oil? To me that is sound, strategic thinking. That would be \na policy that benefits us instead of simply costing more money that we \ndon't have. That is the kind of thinking that I believe our Nation and \nour future generations should have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7906-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7906-S7908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         INTERNET SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES USAGE RULES\n\n  Mr. BLUNT.

Mr. President, on the eve of Veterans Day and the 240th \nBirthday of the United States Marine Corps, I rise to speak about the \nfiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA.\n  This legislation has taken a circuitous route to get to where it is \ntoday. The President correctly vetoed the original bill as it was a \nflawed product. It was flawed in the sense that it unfairly exempted \nthe defense budget from the same draconian budget caps on nondefense \nprograms by utilizing the overseas contingency operations, OCO. While \nthis approach would have funded the defense bill, it neglected our \neconomic security and left unaddressed important national priorities \nincluding law enforcement, education, transportation and community \ndevelopment, and medical research. A strong economy and strong \ncommunities are the backbone of our national security, and we should \nnot divide our country into two Americas--defense on one side and \neveryone else on the other. That is not the way Congress should be \ndoing business, and that is why our military leaders, led by Secretary \nof Defense Carter, opposed the earlier versions of this year's NDAA.\n  The bill, which we passed 91-3 today, comes after passage of the \nBipartisan Budget Act, which provides balanced relief from cuts to \nensure we have a strong defense and a strong economy. I supported this \nrevised bill. While it was not a perfect bill, it is the result of a \nbipartisan compromise by the Congress. The fiscal year 2016 NDAA \nprovides the men and women of our Armed Forces with the resources and \nequipment they need to defend our Nation and protect its interests.\n  I commend Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed for their \nleadership on the Senate Armed Services Committee in creating and \nshepherding this vital legislation through this chamber. The \noutstanding and bipartisan efforts of committee members will allow the \ndefense authorization bill to become law for the 54th consecutive year.\n  I am proud to serve alongside Chairman Wicker as ranking member of \nthe Seapower Subcommittee and want to thank him for leading the \nsubcommittee which helps ensure that our Navy and Marine Corps forces \nare trained and equipped to conduct the vital missions they are tasked \nto complete. A strong and prepared Navy and Marines is absolutely \nessential to our national security strategies in the Asia-Pacific \nregion, and this bill supports those efforts.\n  This NDAA includes a number of provisions that reaffirm the \nimportance of the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific; support the men and \nwomen who serve in our military and the Hawaii National Guard; invest \nin Hawaii's military bases, schools, and facilities and those that \nassess the ballistic missile capabilities of rouge nations and the \ncurrent capacity to defend Hawaii against missile threats.\n  Our support of the rebalance to the Asia-Pacific is critical. \nMaintenance of stability in this region cannot be underestimated. \nContinued engagement and partnership with our friends and allies in the \nregion is invaluable. By extending the State Partnership Program, we \nnot only hone the capabilities and readiness of our National Guard, but \nwe gain the dual benefit of enhancing our partnerships and the capacity \nof regional neighbors.\n  However, I do have some concerns with the final bill that I intend to \nwork on going forward.\n  While my colleagues and I continue to work to reduce redundancy and \nincrease efficiencies with in our military, I would have serious \nconcerns if across-the-board reductions to headquarters operations were \nmade by the Department of Defense implementing this bill. In talking \nwith military commanders, I know that cuts at command headquarters to \ninclude U.S. Pacific Command, U.S. Pacific Fleet, U.S. Marine Corps \nForces, Pacific, U.S. Army Pacific and Pacific Air Forces, which are \nall based in Hawaii, would impact our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines.\n  We need to ensure that any reductions are carefully thought out and \ntake into account the assigned missions and right sizing of \nheadquarters to adequately support the demands we place on our \noperational forces. I will closely monitor the Pentagon's \nimplementation of these provisions going forward.\n  In addition, I want to ensure that the men and women of the \nDepartment who travel for extended periods of time on official business \nare reimbursed for food and lodging at appropriate levels. Last year \nthe Department changed how these workers are reimbursed, and the bill \npassed today directs the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to \nreview the issue and report back to Congress. I will be tracking the \nGAO report on this important issue, as well as the Department's \nimplementation of their extended Temporary Travel Duty, TDY, policy.\n  While the passage of this legislation is critical, it still contains \nmisguided provisions I have long disagreed with and that negatively \naffect our security, as well as the men and women who defend this \nNation. An area I strongly disagree with is in regard to the \nrestrictions on transferring prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. These harm \nour security interests and continue to undermine our leadership on \nhuman rights. We need to work towards a solution to close this \nfacility.\n  Despite these concerns, this legislation is a product of a sincere \nbipartisan and bicameral effort to provide the men and women of our \nmilitary the tools and resources it needs to defend our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7908-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7908-S7909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OBSERVING VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate Veterans Day and to \nthank all those who have served our country for their extraordinary \nbravery and sacrifice.\n  As many of my colleagues know, President Woodrow Wilson first \nestablished this holiday--originally known as Armistice Day--on \nNovember 11, 1919, to honor the brave Americans who fought and died in \nWorld War I. After the end of World War II, Armistice Day was expanded \nto honor all veterans of our military services, and the holiday's name \nwas changed to Veterans Day.\n  My home State of Maryland has a long and proud military tradition \ndating to the first militiamen who set foot in the Maryland Colony in \n1634; to the\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\nWar of 1812, where our soldiers famously held Fort McHenry and our \nnational anthem, the ``Star-Spangled Banner,'' was penned; through both \nworld wars; Korea; Vietnam; the Persian Gulf war; and our most recent \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Maryland's veterans and troops \nrepresent the best of our State and our Nation.\n  Earlier this year, I had an opportunity to help present a \nCongressional Gold Medal to former Tuskegee Airman William A. Colbert, \nJr., a lifelong Marylander. Mr. Colbert enlisted in the Army Air Force \nin 1943 and achieved the rank of flight officer at the Tuskegee Army \nAir Field. While Mr. Colbert never saw combat, he learned to fly with \nthe best and became a full-fledged Red Tail. And as part of the first \nall-Black combat unit in the U.S. Armed Forces, Mr. Colbert and his \nfellow servicemen broke through racial barriers without any expectation \nof fame or fanfare. Their distinguished service and enduring courage \nplayed a critical role in the later desegregation of our Nation's \nmilitary. Mr. Colbert always considered his contribution to the \nTuskegee Airmen and his service to our country simply as what he was \ncalled to do as a citizen. Mr. Colbert passed away in early June but \nnot before we were finally able to thank him for his extraordinary \nservice to our Nation.\n  While we were able to honor Mr. Colbert, there are thousands of other \nveterans who remain nameless. That is why on August 5, 2015, I \nintroduced the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act of \n2015, S. 1982, along with the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nBoozman. Our legislation authorizes the addition of a Wall of \nRemembrance to the existing Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, \nDC. The Wall of Remembrance would list the names of members of the \nArmed Forces of the United States who died in theater in the Korean \nwar, as well as the number of servicemembers who were wounded in \naction, are listed as missing in action, or who were prisoners of war \nduring the Korean war. Authorizing a wall of remembrance here in the \nUnited States is just one way we can help ensure that those who gave \nthe ultimate sacrifice while serving our country in the ``forgotten \nwar'' are no longer forgotten.\n  As America celebrates Veterans Day, we stand united in honoring the \nacts of selfless service from our Nation's veterans. Our veterans and \nmilitary men and women and their families need to know that we remember \nthem not just on Veterans Day but every single day of the year. Our \nveterans have protected our country and defended our values. These \nAmericans are the bravest among us, and we applaud the innumerable \nsacrifices that they and their loved ones have made for this great \ncountry. As we celebrate Veterans Day, our thoughts and prayers are \nalso with ``veterans to be''--the men and women who are currently \nserving our country, especially those in harm's way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7909-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF KEN SARO-WIWA\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today marks a dark milestone on the \nlong road to environmental justice. Twenty years ago, Nigerian \nenvironmental and human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was hanged, along \nwith eight fellow defendants, following an internationally denounced \nmilitary tribunal.\n  Saro-Wiwa was a well-known author and television producer in his \nnative Nigeria before he chose to devote himself full time to the \ncauses of the Ogoni, a minority ethnic group of about 500,000 farmers \nand fishermen who hail from the Niger Delta. As president of the \nMovement for the Survival of Ogoni People--MOSOP--he fought against the \nexploitation of Ogoni lands and the Ogoni people themselves by the oil \ndrilling operations of Royal Dutch Shell.\n  As the oil industry grew to represent the main source of revenue for \nthe Nigerian Government, the delta landscape was ravaged by oil spills \nand acid rain. Fertile farmland turned to oil-soaked wasteland. The \nregion's fish and wildlife were wiped out--along with the livelihood of \nthe Ogoni. Out of the entire 5,000-person workforce employed by Shell \nin Nigeria, less than 100 were Ogoni.\n  Under Ken Saro-Wiwa's leadership, MOSOP organized hundreds of \nthousands of Ogoni to demand environmental remediation, compensation \nfor past damages, and a share in oil revenues. The regime of dictator \nGeneral Sani Abacha responded with a brutal campaign of occupation, \nmass arrest, rape, execution, and the burning of Ogoni villages. In May \n1994, Saro-Wiwa was abducted from his home and brought up on charges in \nconnection with the murder of four Ogoni leaders. He was tried and \nconvicted by a military tribunal that governments and human rights \norganizations worldwide condemned as fraudulent.\n  On November 10, 1995, Ken Saro-Wiwa was put to death.\n  ``The only crime he and his colleagues had committed,'' reads Saro-\nWiwa's citation for the prestigious Godman Environmental Prize, ``was \nto demand sound environmental practices and to ask for compensation for \nthe devastation of Ogoni territories.''\n  A human rights lawsuit brought by Saro-Wiwa's son and other victims' \nfamilies in U.S. Federal court alleged that Shell bribed at least two \nwitnesses in the 1995 tribunal and that Shell's manager in Nigeria \noffered Saro-Wiwa's brother, another jailed activist, release from \ncaptivity in exchange for abandoning the movement. That suit was \nsettled by Shell for $15.5 million, just days before going to trial in \n2009, following a protracted legal battle.\n  The Ogoni cause has been taken up by other Ogoni, both within Nigeria \nand living in exile, including Saro-Wiwa's sons. The struggle and death \nof Ken Saro-Wiwa serve as a lasting inspiration to people of all \nnations who seek relief from corporate abuse, government corruption, \nand environmental ruin. We will remember his noble fight for the basic \nright of a people to live in harmony with the Earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7909-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             NATIONAL DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SCOTT.

Even more important than \nthese awards, however, is the respect and admiration he has earned from \nthe students and faculty at the University of Colorado and all those \nwho tune in to Buffalo football.\n  Over his long and distinguished career, he has truly become a \nhallmark of CU football games. I thank him for his many years of \nexcellent broadcasting and wish him a very happy birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7910-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WELCOMING RITCHIE COUNTY VETERANS TO THE NATION'S CAPITAL\n\n Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I wish to recognize with, \noverwhelming pride, a group of courageous veterans from Ritchie County, \nWV, who are visiting our Nation's Capital this Thursday. On behalf of \nour State and Nation, it is a true honor and privilege to recognize \nthese heroic men and women and their families for their brave service \nand sacrifice as they tour the memorials built in their honor.\n  I have always said that West Virginia is one of the most patriotic \nStates in this great Nation, and we are so proud of the number of \nveterans and Active-Duty members who have served our country with honor \nand distinction. The 20 veterans and their family members who are \ntraveling to Washington, DC, embody our State's history and \ncontributions to the freedom of this Nation. They may represent \ndifferent generations of warriors, but no matter the war or the era, no \nmatter the rank, each and every one of them courageously answered the \ncall of duty to defend our Nation and protect the freedoms we enjoy as \nAmericans. In our time of need, they stepped forward and said, ``I'll \ndo it--I'll protect this country.''\n  This trip will be a truly moving and special experience for these \nveterans, many of whom have never been to the memorials that were built \nfor their service. It will include wreath-laying ceremonies at the \nmonuments that commemorate the wars in which many have served, \nincluding the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, \nand the National World War II Memorial. They will also be touring \nArlington National Cemetery and have private time for a wreath-laying \nceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n  Mr. President, it is also tremendously important to recognize that \nthis visit would not have been possible without the hard work and \ndetermination of an inspirational young Ritchie County native, Kirsten \nSeese. Kirsten is a Ritchie County High School senior who aspires to be \na nurse one day. She was inspired to coordinate this trip as her \nprenursing senior project after hearing about a group of veterans that \nhad recently traveled to Washington, DC, to visit the memorials \nsponsored by their community.\n  Kirsten wasted no time. She went to businesses in Ritchie County with \nthe goal of organizing a 100 percent free veterans appreciation tour. \nIn just 3 weeks, Kirsten raised enough money for 20 veterans, their \nfamily members, and local volunteers to visit to Washington, DC, \nabsolutely free. They will not have to pay for any meals or \nrefreshments and will receive a commemorative shirt and a hat. The \nfunding will also go towards the wreaths for the ceremonies that will \nbe held at each memorial and a group photo at the Capitol to \ncommemorate their special day.\n  I am so proud of Kirsten. She has truly set an extraordinary example \nfor her generation by giving back to those who have served this country \nand those who have protected our freedoms. It is the devotion and drive \nof young people like Kirsten that bring our communities together. I \nwish her the best of luck in her future endeavors, and I commend her \nfor making an enormous impact on the lives of our veterans through this \nveterans appreciation tour.\n  Mr. President, I am filled with pride every time I meet the patriots \nwho have served our country, and I am so pleased to welcome West \nVirginia's most courageous veterans who are all heroes to Washington, \nDC. I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in saluting them. They \ntruly inspire us all as we are reminded of their selfless service. It \nis because of their bravery that all Americans enjoy the greatest \nliberties and freedoms in the world. We whole heartedly thank \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7910-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7910-S7911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JUDGE GEORGE HEALY\n\n Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a \nRhode Islander whom I have known and admired for nearly 30 years: \nGeorge Healy, chief judge of our State's Workers' Compensation Court, \nwho retired in July after 24 years on the bench. A number of George's \ncolleagues will be gathering on November 19 to honor his years of \nservice, and it is indeed my honor to say a few words about him today.\n  I first came to know George Healy amidst a genuine crisis in Rhode \nIsland: the near-collapse of our State's workers' compensation system \nin 1991. Here is how a 1991 report by the Rhode Island Department of \nEconomic Development summed up the situation.\n\n       The financial burden borne by employers had simply become \n     too great. Insurers had begun to exit the Rhode Island \n     marketplace. And, most importantly, the financial protection \n     required for our state's injured workers was being placed in \n     jeopardy.\n\n  Indeed, when compared with our New England neighbors, our average \nclaim costs were through the roof. In 1990, the average claim in Rhode \nIsland was $12,638, more than three times higher than the average claim \nin Vermont and significantly higher than Massachusetts, Connecticut, \nand New Hampshire, which collectively had average claim costs in the \nrange of $6,000 to $7,000. This was simply unsustainable.\n  Enter George Healy who until that time had been a civil litigator and \nworkers' compensation practitioner. Our Governor at the time, Bruce\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\nSundlun, appointed George and a handful of other stakeholders to a task \nforce that was given a bold directive: Reduce the cost of the system \nwithout reducing benefits. As Governor Sundlun's legal counsel at the \ntime, I had the honor of leading the task force, but I relied greatly \non George for his expertise on the system. Working together with our \ncolleagues, we were able to develop a plan that protected workers, \nreduced costs, eliminated pending rate increases, stabilized the \nworkers' compensation market, eliminated fraud, and prevented a \ncollapse of the system.\n  One of the hallmarks of the reform was the creation of the Workers' \nCompensation Court, which hears and decides all disputes involving an \ninjured employee and an employer relating to workers' compensation \nbenefits. Governor Sundlun appointed George to be among the inaugural \nclass of the court's judges after its creation in 1991. George was then \nappointed chief judge by Governor Don Carcieri in 2004.\n  Now, as George Healy looks back on his career, I hope he will rule it \na success. I certainly do. The reforms he helped lead reduced average \nclaim costs in Rhode Island from $12,638 in 1991 to just $5,179 in \n2007. The reduction came about not from benefit cuts but from system \nreforms, quick court action, injury prevention, and getting people \nquickly back to work. A 2009 report by the International Workers' \nCompensation Foundation put it this way: ``When both claim frequency \nand severity are considered (taking into account all employees, whether \nor not injured) . . . Rhode Island stands out as the state with the \nlowest average medical cost per employee per year in the entire \ncountry.'' Because of George's work, Rhode Island is now a model system \nfor the rest of the country.\n  In short, thanks in large part to George's hard work and his years of \nservice on the bench, Rhode Island workers can rest assured that, if \nthey get hurt on the job, their State's insurance program will be there \nfor them. That is a proud and meaningful legacy to leave behind. In \naddition to all of George's accomplishments on the bench, I will always \nremember him for his humility, gentle demeanor, and respect toward \nthose who appeared before him. I will also be grateful for his \nfriendship through the years, and I hope George enjoys many peaceful \nyears of retirement, knowing that his efforts have improved the lives \nof countless others. I wish him the best as he enjoys much deserved \nfamily time with his lovely wife Ruth, his son Tim and his wife Jewel, \nhis son Paul and his wife Meghan, and George's three grandchildren, \nQuinn, Jack, and Charlotte. Godspeed, my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7911-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7911-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7911-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the title of the bill (H.R. \n22) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety \nprograms, and transit programs, and for other purposes, further, that \nthe House insists upon its amendment to the amendment of the Senate to \nthe text of the bill, asks a conference with the Senate on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and appoints the following \nMembers as managers of the conference on the part of the House:\n  From the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, for \nconsideration of the House amendment and the Senate amendment, and \nmodifications committed to conference: Messrs.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2268\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dust Off Crews of the \n     Vietnam War Congressional Gold Medal Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a United States Army Dust Off crewman is a helicopter \n     crew member who served honorably in the Vietnam War aboard a \n     helicopter air ambulance under the radio call sign ``Dust \n     Off'';\n       (2) Dust Off crews performed aeromedical evacuation for \n     United States, Vietnamese, and allied forces inside South \n     Vietnam from May 1962 through March 1973.\n       (3) nearing the end of World War II, the United States Army \n     began using helicopters for medical evacuation and years \n     later, during the Korean War, these helicopter air ambulances \n     were responsible for transporting 17,700 United States \n     casualties;\n       (4) during the Vietnam War, with the use of helicopter air \n     ambulances, United States Army Dust Off crews pioneered the \n     concept of dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and rescued \n     almost 900,000 United States, South Vietnamese, and other \n     allied sick and wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces;\n       (5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary tool to assist \n     those injured on the battlefield;\n       (6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dust Off crews were able \n     to operate the helicopters and land them on almost any \n     terrain in nearly any weather to pick up wounded, after which \n     the Dust Off crews could provide care to these patients while \n     transporting them to ready medical facilities;\n       (7) the vital work of the Dust Off crews required \n     consistent combat exposure and often proved to be the \n     difference between life and death for wounded personnel;\n       (8) the revolutionary concept of a dedicated combat life-\n     saving system was cultivated and refined by United States \n     Army Dust Off crews during 11 years of intense conflict in \n     and above the jungles of South Vietnam;\n       (9) innovative and resourceful Dust Off crews in Vietnam \n     were responsible for taking the new concept of helicopter \n     medical evacuation, born just a few years earlier, and \n     revolutionizing it to meet and surpass the previously \n     unattainable goal of delivering a battlefield casualty to an \n     operating table within the vaunted ``golden hour'';\n       (10) some Dust Off units in Vietnam operated so efficiently \n     that they were able to deliver a patient to a waiting medical \n     facility on an average of 33 minutes from the receipt of the \n     mission, which saved the lives of countless personnel in \n     Vietnam, and this legacy continues for modern-day Dust Off \n     crews;\n       (11) the inherent danger of being a member of a Dust Off \n     crew in Vietnam meant that there was a 1 in 3 chance of being \n     wounded or killed;\n       (12) many battles during the Vietnam War raged at night, \n     and members of the Dust Off crews often found themselves \n     searching for a landing zone in complete darkness, in bad \n     weather, over mountainous terrain, and all while being the \n     target of intense enemy fire as they attempted to rescue the \n     wounded, which caused Dust Off crews to suffer a rate of \n     aircraft loss that was more than 3 times that of all other \n     types of combat helicopter missions in Vietnam;\n       (13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified the constant \n     heroism displayed by Dust Off crews in Vietnam, over the span \n     of a 10-month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters and 40 \n     soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 patients in 8,644 \n     missions while being airborne for 4,832 hours;\n       (14) collectively, the members of the 54th Medical \n     Detachment earned 78 awards for valor, including 1 Medal of \n     Honor, 1 Distinguished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, \n     26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze Star Medals for \n     valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 4 Soldier's Medals, and 26 \n     Purple Heart Medals;\n       (15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed heroism on a \n     daily basis and set the standard for all Dust Off crews in \n     Vietnam;\n       (16) 5 members of the 54th Medical Detachment are in the \n     Dust Off Hall of Fame, 3 are in the Army Aviation Hall of \n     Fame, and 1 is the only United States Army aviator in the \n     National Aviation Hall of Fame;\n       (17) Dust Off crew members are among the most highly \n     decorated soldiers in American military history;\n       (18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly was the \n     Commanding Officer of the 57th Medical Detachment (Helicopter \n     Ambulance), Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam;\n       (19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dust Off call-sign \n     into history as one of the most welcomed phrases to be heard \n     over the radio by wounded soldiers in perilous and dire \n     situations;\n       (20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in action as he \n     gallantly maneuvered his aircraft to save a wounded American \n     soldier and several Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, \n     after being warned to stay away from the landing zone due to \n     the ferocity of enemy fire, ``When I have your wounded.'';\n       (21) General William Westmoreland, Commander, Military \n     Assistance Command, Vietnam (1964-1968), singled out Major \n     Kelly as an example of ``the greatness of the human spirit'' \n     and highlighted his famous reply as an inspiration to all in \n     combat;\n       (22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmoreland's successor \n     (1968-1972), and former Chief of Staff of the United States \n     Army, highlighted the heroism of Dust Off crews, ``A special \n     word about the Dust Offs . . . Courage above and beyond the \n     call of duty was sort of routine to them. It was a daily \n     thing, part of the way they lived. That's the great part, and \n     it meant so much to every last man who served there. Whether \n     he ever got hurt or not, he knew Dust Off was there.'';\n       (23) Dust Off crews possessed unique skills and traits that \n     made them highly successful in aeromedical evacuation in \n     Vietnam, including indomitable courage, extraordinary \n     aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, high-level \n     medical expertise, and an unequaled dedication to the \n     preservation of human life;\n       (24) members of the United States Armed Forces on the \n     ground in Vietnam had their confidence and battlefield \n     prowess reinforced knowing that there were heroic Dust Off \n     crews just a few minutes from the fight, which was \n     instrumental to their well-being, willingness to fight, and \n     morale;\n       (25) military families in the United States knew that their \n     loved ones would receive the quickest and best possible care \n     in the event of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dust Off \n     crews;\n       (26) the willingness of Dust Off crews to also risk their \n     lives to save helpless civilians left an immeasurably \n     positive impression on the people of Vietnam and exemplified \n     the finest American ideals of compassion and humanity; and\n       (27) Dust Off crews from the Vietnam War hailed from every \n     State in the United States and represented numerous ethnic, \n     religious, and cultural backgrounds.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate \n     design in honor of the Dust Off crews of the Vietnam War, \n     collectively, in recognition of their heroic military \n     service, which saved countless lives and contributed directly \n     to the defense of our country.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense.\n       (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n       (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \n     honor of the Dust Off\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\n     Crews of the Vietnam War, the gold medal shall be given to \n     the Smithsonian Institution, where it will be available for \n     display as appropriate and available for research.\n       (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the Smithsonian Institution should also make the gold medal \n     awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere, \n     particularly at appropriate locations associated with the \n     Vietnam War, and that preference should be given to locations \n     affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n     SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 3 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 5. NATIONAL MEDALS.\n\n       The medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national medal \n     for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Reed, Ms. Warren, and Mr. \n        Blumenthal):\n  S. 2272.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide \nenhanced safety in pipeline transportation, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleagues \nSenators Fischer, Booker, and Peters to introduce the Securing \nAmerica's Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and \nEnhancing Safety, SAFE PIPES, Act, reauthorizing the Pipeline and \nHazardous Material Safety Administration, PHMSA. Safe and secure \npipeline infrastructure is critical to our nation, and is especially \nimportant to Montanans--for economic opportunity and environmental \nprotection.\n  We had a great bipartisan group of Senators working on this \nlegislation. I\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nwould like to thank Senator Fischer for traveling to Billings, Montana \nto chair the first in a series of hearings on pipeline safety and \ncoordinating efforts to write this important legislation. Additionally, \nI thank Senators Booker and Peters for their work drafting this \nlegislation.\n  In Montana, we have some of the country's most pristine wild spaces \nalong with an abundance on natural resources. Montana produces \napproximately 30 million barrels of crude oil, 63 billion cubic feet of \nnatural gas, and 42 million short tons of coal annually. We export 60 \npercent of this energy. The oil and gas industries support the \nemployment of over 43,000 Montanans. Likewise, Montana's unspoiled \nmountains and streams is the main motivator for many visiting Montana. \nThe tourism industry supports the employment of over 53,000 Montanans.\n  It is needless to say, but it is imperative that both jobs are \nprotected. This legislation does just that, by improving pipeline \ninspection report turnaround times, increasing focus on pipeline river \ncrossings, helping fill vacant inspector positions, facilitating \ncommunications between PHMSA and State agencies, and enabling PHMSA to \nconduct safety research with industry experts.\n  I look forward to continue my work, along with my colleagues, on \nenhancing pipeline safety, protecting our economic and environmental \nresources, and shepherding this legislation across the finish line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7917-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7917-S7918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 312--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING NOVEMBER 8, 2015, \nAS ``NATIONAL PREGNANCY CENTER WEEK'' TO RECOGNIZE THE VITAL ROLE THAT \nCOMMUNITY-SUPPORTED PREGNANCY CENTERS (ALSO KNOWN AS PREGNANCY CARE AND \nPREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTERS) PLAY IN SAVING LIVES AND SERVING WOMEN AND \n              MEN FACED WITH DIFFICULT PREGNANCY DECISIONS\n\n  Mr. LEE (for himself, Mrs. Ernst, Mr. Risch, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Grassley, \nMr. Rounds, Mr. Blunt, Mr. Daines, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Scott, Mr. Coats, \nMr. Portman, Mr. Moran, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Lankford, Mr. Sasse, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Rubio, and Mr. Cruz) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pro bono Work to Empower and \n     Represent Act of 2015'' or ``POWER Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Extremely high rates of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, and stalking exist at the local, \n     State, and national levels and such violence or behavior \n     harms the most vulnerable members of our society.\n       (2) According to a study commissioned by the Department of \n     Justice, nearly 25 percent of women suffer from domestic \n     violence during their lifetime.\n       (3) Proactive efforts should be made available in all \n     forums to provide pro bono legal services and eliminate the \n     violence that destroys lives and shatters families.\n       (4) A variety of factors cause domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, and stalking, and a variety of \n     solutions at the local, State, and national level are \n     necessary to combat such violence or behavior.\n       (5) According to the National Network to End Domestic \n     Violence, which conducted a census including almost 1,700 \n     assistance programs, over the course of 1 day in September \n     2014, more than 10,000 requests for services, including legal \n     representation, were not met.\n       (6) Pro bono assistance can help fill this need by \n     providing not only legal representation, but also access to \n     emergency shelter, transportation, and childcare.\n       (7) Research and studies have demonstrated that the \n     provision of legal assistance to victims of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking \n     reduces the probability of such violence or behavior \n     reoccurring in the future and can help survivors move \n     forward.\n       (8) Legal representation increases the possibility of \n     successfully obtaining a protective order against an \n     attacker, preventing further mental and physical injury to a \n     victim and his or her family, demonstrated by a study that \n     found that 83 percent of victims represented by an attorney \n     were able to obtain a protective order compared to 32 percent \n     of victims without an attorney.\n       (9) The American Bar Association Model Rules include \n     commentary that ``every lawyer, regardless of professional \n     prominence or professional workload, has a responsibility to \n     provide legal services to those unable to pay, and personal \n     involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one \n     of the most rewarding experiences in the life of a lawyer''.\n       (10) As representatives of the Department of Justice, the \n     duty of United States Attorneys is to present ``equal and \n     impartial justice to all its citizens,'' which should \n     include, especially, survivors of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, and stalking who might not \n     otherwise know how to seek advice and protection.\n       (11) As Federal leaders who have knowledge of domestic \n     violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking in \n     their localities, United States Attorneys should encourage \n     lawyers to provide pro bono resources in an effort to help \n     victims of such\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\n     violence or behavior to escape the cycle of abuse.\n       (12) A dedicated army of pro bono attorneys focused on this \n     mission will inspire others to devote efforts to this cause \n     and will raise awareness of the scourge of domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking throughout the \n     country.\n       (13) Communities, by providing awareness of pro bono legal \n     services and assistance to survivors of domestic violence, \n     dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking, will empower \n     those survivors to move forward with their lives.\n\n     SEC. 3. U.S. ATTORNEYS TO PROMOTE EMPOWERMENT EVENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and not less often than once each year \n     thereafter, each United States Attorney, or his or her \n     designee, for each judicial district shall lead not less than \n     1 public event, in partnership with a State, local, tribal, \n     or territorial domestic violence service provider or \n     coalition and a State or local volunteer lawyer project, \n     promoting pro bono legal services as a critical way in which \n     to empower survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, \n     sexual assault, and stalking and engage citizens in assisting \n     those survivors.\n       (b) Districts Containing Indian Tribes and Tribal \n     Organizations.--During each 3-year period, a United States \n     Attorney, or his or her designee, for a judicial district \n     that contains an Indian tribe or tribal organization (as \n     those terms are defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b)) \n     shall lead not less than 1 public event promoting pro bono \n     legal services under subsection (a) in partnership with an \n     Indian tribe or tribal organization with the intent of \n     increasing the provision of pro bono legal services for \n     Indian or Alaska Native victims of domestic violence, dating \n     violence, sexual assault, and stalking.\n       (c) Requirements.--Each United States Attorney shall--\n       (1) have discretion on the design, organization, and \n     implementation of the public events required under subsection \n     (a); and\n       (2) in conducting a public event under subsection (a), seek \n     to maximize the local impact of the event and the provision \n     of access to high-quality pro bono legal services by \n     survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual \n     assault, and stalking.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Report to the Attorney General.--Not later than October \n     30 of each year, each United States Attorney shall submit to \n     the Attorney General a report detailing each public event \n     conducted under section 3 during the previous fiscal year.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than January 1 of each year, the \n     Attorney General shall submit to Congress a compilation and \n     summary of each report received under subsection (a) for the \n     previous fiscal year.\n       (2) Requirement.--Each comprehensive report submitted under \n     paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of how each public \n     event meets the goals set forth in this Act, as well as \n     suggestions on how to improve future public events.\n\n     SEC. 5. FUNDING.\n\n       The Department of Justice shall use existing funds to carry \n     out the requirements of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7955-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed several \nlists for more than 600 career promotions in the Foreign Service. I \nspoke earlier this week about these promotions, and I am pleased that \nSenator Grassley has allowed these lists to pass this evening.\n  Regardless of which party controlled the Senate, Foreign Service \npromotion lists have moved without political interference. That is \nuntil recently. In August, Senator Grassley decided to block the \npromotions of more than 20 career officials in order to pursue the same \nagenda we saw the Republicans go after with the Benghazi committee.\n  I have spoken with Senator Grassley about this issue. Holding back \nthe promotions of career Foreign Service officers is not the way the \nSenate should be operating. The 20 officials that are still being \nblocked include officers stationed in Cambodia, Kenya, Rwanda, \nEthiopia, and other nations.\n  Although I am pleased about the Senate passing more than 600 \npromotions this evening, the senior Senator from Iowa should drop his \nholds on career diplomats and give these 20 officials the promotions \nthey have earned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7955-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 302\n\n       Whereas Israel is a democratic ally and major strategic \n     partner of the United States, as codified by the United \n     States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (Public Law \n     113-296), and cooperation between Israel and the United \n     States continues to increase in importance with a swiftly \n     shifting security situation in the Middle East and North \n     Africa;\n       Whereas Jerusalem is an undivided city, eternal capital of \n     Israel, holiest city for the Jewish people, central to the \n     worship of three monotheistic religions, and unique in the \n     Middle East region as a city of religious tolerance where \n     Israel guarantees access, security, and respect for the three \n     monotheistic religions to worship in peace at holy sites;\n       Whereas, upon Israel securing control of Jerusalem in 1967, \n     it has maintained a policy of keeping the Haram Al Sharif \n     specifically open for Muslim prayer, welcoming over 3,500,000 \n     regular worshipers annually;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel upholds the 1994 Treaty of \n     Peace Between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom \n     of Jordan, which states in Article Nine that each party \n     ``will provide freedom of access to places of religious and \n     historical significance,'' as well as ``act together to \n     promote interfaith relations among the three monotheistic \n     religions, with the aim of working toward religious \n     understanding, moral commitment, freedom of religious \n     worship, and tolerance and peace'';\n       Whereas Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation \n     Organization (PLO), committed in his exchange of letters with \n     Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on September 9, 1993, \n     that ``the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts \n     of violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO \n     elements and personnel in order to assure their compliance,'' \n     and under the subsequent 1995 Oslo II Accord, the \n     Palestinians pledged to ``abstain from incitement, including \n     hostile propaganda . . . [and to] take legal measures to \n     prevent such incitement by any organizations, groups or \n     individuals within their jurisdiction'';\n       Whereas the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud \n     Abbas, wrongly announced during the tenth anniversary of \n     Yasser Arafat's death in November 2014 that Israel has no \n     claim to Jerusalem, that the Temple Mount will not be allowed \n     to be ``contaminated'' by Jews, and that Jewish prayer on the \n     Temple Mount would lead to a ``devastating religious war'';\n       Whereas President Abbas falsely claimed during his address \n     to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2015 that \n     the Government of Israel has used ``brutal force to impose \n     its plans to undermine the Islamic and Christian sanctities \n     in Jerusalem'' and announced that the Palestinian Authority \n     is no longer bound by the Oslo Accords;\n       Whereas Israel has in recent weeks been subjected to an \n     alarming wave of terrorism directed against innocent \n     civilians by Palestinians armed with knives, meat cleavers, \n     guns, and cars;\n       Whereas there have been approximately 69 such attacks since \n     the beginning of October 2015, leaving 11 Israelis dead and \n     another 145 wounded;\n       Whereas United States citizens have lost their lives as a \n     result of these terrorist attacks, including Richard Lakin \n     and Eitam Henkin;\n       Whereas these random, gruesome attacks are intended to \n     instill a sense of fear among the people of Israel leading \n     their normal lives, and also destabilize security for both \n     Palestinians and Israelis;\n       Whereas President Barack Obama condemned in the strongest \n     terms Palestinian violence against innocent Israeli citizens \n     and expressed his ``strong belief that Israel has not just \n     the right, but the obligation to protect itself'';\n       Whereas Israel, Jordan, and the United States have reached \n     an agreement regarding the installation of surveillance \n     cameras on the Temple Mount in accordance with the respective \n     responsibilities of the Israeli authorities and the Jordanian \n     Waqf;\n       Whereas President Abbas has helped to fuel the current \n     violence in recent weeks by falsely casting Israel as the \n     brutal aggressor in multiple public speeches, refusing to \n     condemn the lethal terror attacks, and failing to acknowledge \n     Israel's right to self-defense;\n       Whereas President Abbas' statements are part of a pattern \n     of incitement among Palestinian leaders that includes denial \n     of the Jewish heritage of Jerusalem, paying monthly salaries \n     to the families of imprisoned Palestinian terrorists, \n     praising slain terrorists as martyrs, demonizing Jews in \n     official Palestinian Authority media, and encouraging attacks \n     on social media; and\n       Whereas Palestinian leaders have repeatedly threatened to \n     suspend cooperation and further encouraged violence by \n     blaming Israel for killing Palestinian perpetrators of these \n     heinous crimes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns these brutal attacks in the harshest terms \n     possible;\n       (2) welcomes Israel's commitment to the continued \n     maintenance of the status quo on the Temple Mount;\n       (3) urges the international community to join in forcefully \n     condemning these Palestinian terror attacks;\n       (4) clarifies that there is no justification for these \n     types of attacks and that there is a direct correlation \n     between the recent upsurge in violence and Arab incitement \n     regarding the Temple Mount;\n       (5) stands with the people of Israel during these difficult \n     days;\n       (6) supports Israel's right to self-defense and rejects any \n     suggestion of the moral equivalence of Israeli security \n     personnel protecting its citizens from senseless violence and \n     terrorists intent to deliberately take innocent lives;\n       (7) supports the agreement reached to install surveillance \n     cameras on the Temple Mount according to the arrangements to \n     be determined between the parties;\n       (8) calls upon President Abbas to stop all incitement by \n     Palestinian officials and by Palestinian media, to strongly \n     and unequivocally demand an end to the violence, and to take \n     all steps necessary to halt these attacks;\n       (9) expresses support and admiration for individuals and \n     organizations working to encourage cooperation between \n     Israelis and Palestinians;\n       (10) encourages President Abbas to continue strengthening \n     and maintaining security cooperation with Israel;\n       (11) reiterates that Palestinian political goals will never \n     be achieved through violence; and\n       (12) calls on all parties to return to the negotiating \n     table immediately and without preconditions, as direct \n     discussions remain the best avenue to ending the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7956-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2015\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, we had a very important court of appeals \nruling last night. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed the \ninjunction that had been issued by Judge Hanen in Texas, that blocked \nthe President's determination to carry out his DAPA Executive amnesty \nplan. The court found it improper and unlawful, and ordered it to be \nstopped.\n  It recalls for us the fact that when the President announced he was \ngoing to do this no matter what--before the election--great public \noutcry arose. Then he said--for political reasons, obviously--well, I \nam not going to do it before the election, but I will do it after the \nelection. That is when I will issue this Executive amnesty and give \nlawful presence and Federal benefits and Social Security cards and work \nauthorization to millions of people--4.3 million here in the country \nillegally. It is a dramatic thing. So the country was in an uproar \nabout it. It was a big\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\nfactor in the Republicans winning a huge majority in the House and a \nsurging majority in the Senate.\n  So what was this all about? Well, Judge Hanen found that this was \nwrong. The President didn't have authority to take people Congress has \nsaid are here illegally and give them food stamps, health care, \nMedicaid, and work authorization. It went against the law. He couldn't \ndo that. And he found that this was such an egregious action that it \nneeded to be stopped now through an injunction before the trial even \ncompleted. So it was that injunction, that blocking of the President's \namnesty, that went up on appeal to the Fifth Circuit, and they upheld \nJudge Hanen's decision.\n  First, 26 States--over half the States--participated in this \nlitigation against the President's order, and they were found to have \nlegal standing.\n  Then the court found this critical legal fact: They found that the \nStates that were objecting to the President's order were likely to \nsucceed in the final court ruling and on appeal. They found that it \nwould likely succeed. And they noted this, referring to the Secretary \nof Homeland Security:\n\n       At its core, this case is about the Secretary's decision to \n     change the immigration classification of millions of illegal \n     aliens on a class-wide basis.\n\n  The Court went on to say:\n\n       DAPA would make 4.3 million otherwise removable aliens \n     eligible for lawful presence, employment authorization, and \n     associated benefits, and we must be guided to a degree by \n     common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to \n     delegate a policy decision of such economic and political \n     magnitude to an administrative agency.\n\n  They basically were saying that they see no evidence that such a huge \nevent would be delegated to the administrative bureaucrats at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Congress, in fact, I believe--and the \ncourt went on to say--explicitly laid out how we deal with this.\n  The Fifth Circuit rejected President Obama's claim that he could \nissue employment documents--the right to work in America--to persons \nillegally here in any way he sees fit. That is what the administration \nargued.\n  The court condemned that interpretation, saying:\n\n       The interpretation of those provisions that the Secretary \n     advances would allow him to grant lawful presence and work \n     authorization to any illegal alien in the United States--an \n     untenable position in light of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act's intricate system of immigration \n     classifications and employment eligibility. Even with \n     ``special deference'' to the Secretary, the INA flatly does \n     not permit the reclassification of millions of illegal aliens \n     as lawfully present and thereby make them newly eligible for \n     a host of federal and state benefits, including work \n     authorization.\n\n  That is an absolute refutation of the President's position, as well \nit should be, because anybody who is familiar with that debate last \nyear knew that it was bogus. The American people knew that argument was \nbogus, and the court affirmed it just last night with clarity and \nconsistency.\n  They said: Well, historically, the Secretaries have done some of \nthese things.\n  The court doubted that.\n  Quote:\n\n       Historical practice that is so far afield from the \n     challenged program sheds no light on the Secretary's \n     authority to implement DAPA. Indeed, as the district court \n     recognized, the President explicitly stated that ``it was the \n     failure of Congress to enact such a program that prompted him \n     . . . to `change the law.' ''\n\n  He asked for this. He asked for legislation to do this, and the House \nof Representatives said no. And he did it anyway. And the court of \nappeals slapped that down as being above the powers of the President of \nthe United States, as indeed it is.\n  The court found that this DAPA Program is foreclosed by Congress's \ncareful plan. Quote: ``The program is `manifestly contrary to statute' \nand therefore was properly enjoined.''\n  The President of the United States has a duty to the law, a duty to \nenforce the law whether he likes it or not, and he has a duty to carry \nout the law. That is his oath. He is the Chief Executive. He is the \nperson responsible for ensuring that the laws of the United States are \ncarried out, and he breached his duty and took steps to absolutely \neviscerate law passed by Congress. And being unhappy that Congress \nrefused to change it as he wished it to be changed, he just did it \nanyway. And that is wrong. The court has slapped him down, as they \nshould.\n  I hope the American people understand that somewhere in this system \nthere is a commitment to law and to propriety and to the right of \nCongress. Congress is going to have to continue to work on this. It \nshould boldly assert its prerogative to pass laws and its prerogative \nnot to fund Executive amnesties, or any other program we don't think is \nworthy of being funded.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/10/senate-section/article/S7957-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2015, AT 3 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
