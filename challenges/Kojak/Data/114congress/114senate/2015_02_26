Mr. President, the essential Department of Homeland \nSecurity faces a shutdown in less than 48 hours. At 12:01 a.m. Saturday \nmorning the government will be forced to shut down the most essential \npart of our government set up to protect the homeland.\n  It is really unthinkable that America is less than 2 days away from \nletting its guard down in the midst of such rampant global terrorism. \nYesterday, three Brooklyn men were arrested for joining ISIS. FBI \nDirector Comey said yesterday that his agency is investigating \nsuspected ISIS supporters in every State--all 50 States.\n  As Republican Congressman Peter King said:\n\n       We can't allow DHS not [to] be funded. People think we're \n     crazy. There are terrorist attacks all over the world, and \n     we're talking about closing down Homeland Security.\n\n  And listen to this sentence:\n\n       This is like living in the world of the crazy people.\n\n  Republican Congressman Peter King of New York has said that what is \ngoing on with the work of the Republicans here in the Senate and the \nHouse is like living in the world of crazy people.\n  Yesterday the Senate voted to begin the process of considering \npassing a clean Homeland Security funding bill. Without an agreement to \nspeed up the process, a vote on final passage would take place on \nSunday. As I said yesterday, we on this side of the aisle are willing \nto expedite passage of this bill by consent. We are ready to do it \nright now.\n  Once a clean full-year funding bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity is passed and signed into law, we look forward to debating how \nto best fix our Nation's broken immigration system, just as we did 20 \nmonths ago with the help of the Presiding Officer and others.\n  Would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1128-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio).

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I will be speaking on the bill before us.\n  Madam President, we are just days away from an unthinkable government \nshutdown of the Department of Homeland Security. A government shutdown \nof the Department whose mission is to protect the citizens of this \ncountry is reckless and dangerous while we are under threat of attack \nby terrorist groups.\n  What kind of message does it send to ISIS, to cyber criminals, and to \ncriminal drug gangs if Congress can't keep the Department of Homeland \nSecurity open?\n  This weekend we learned that a terror group from Somalia, al-Shabaab, \nreleased an online video calling for attacks on the Mall of America in \nMinnesota, as well as malls in Canada and England.\n  Just yesterday we learned that three Brooklyn, NY, men were arrested \nfor plotting to travel to Syria to join ISIS. If they weren't \nsuccessful in getting to Syria, they allegedly planned to commit an act \nof terrorism in the United States, and one even offered to kill \nPresident Obama if ordered to do so.\n  The role of the Department of Homeland Security in protecting our \ncountry from these threats and from so many others cannot be \noverstated. It is DHS that is working with State and local officials in \nMinnesota to coordinate a response to the Mall of America threat, and \nit is DHS and the Secret Service that help provide the counterterrorism \nand intelligence-gathering efforts that led to the arrests of the \nBrooklyn men who wanted to do harm in this country.\n  Referencing yesterday's arrests in Brooklyn, New York City Police \nCommissioner Bill Bratton said that this is not the time to engage in \nactivities that would threaten our counterterrorism capabilities and \neffectively hold our counterterrorism agencies hostage to political \nmachinations. This is not the time to be engaging in political rhetoric \nand political grandstanding.\n  I think Commissioner Bratton is right. Our Nation is already on high \nalert for terror threats after attacks in Sydney, Australia, and \nOttawa, Canada, and in Paris. The Mall of America threat and the \nBrooklyn arrests reinforce the fact that we need our law enforcement \ncommunity operating on all cylinders. Sadly, these aren't isolated \nthreats.\n  A few weeks ago I spoke with the deputy commissioner of the New York \nCity Police Department. He told me about the many terror attacks that \nhave been thwarted in New York City since 9/11. He credited DHS, the \nfunding, and programs that are coordinated through DHS and the \npersonnel there for helping New York to prevent attacks from happening.\n  I have heard the same thing at home in New Hampshire from our law \nenforcement and first responders. I was in the town of Hampton, which \nis a coastal community, on Monday of this week. They talked about the \nimportance of DHS support in developing a unified command for all of \nlaw enforcement in New Hampshire. They talked about the importance of \nthe fusion center that is funded through the Department of Homeland \nSecurity because of the intelligence-gathering they do there and how \nthey share that information with law enforcement agencies all across \nNew Hampshire. Then they took me in and showed me a diagram of a human \ntrafficking case that they are working on with the help of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n\n  So this is not just about the big cities in the United States, it is \nabout our rural communities, and it is about States across this country \nthat rely on the Department of Homeland Security to help with their \ninternal security. Yet here we are, less than 2 days away from shutting \ndown the Department of Homeland Security because of unrelated \nideological disagreements.\n  I am, however, very encouraged by recent developments here in the \nSenate, with yesterday's 98-to-2 vote to allow the Senate at some point \nin the future--hopefully sometime today--to pass a clean, full-year \nfunding bill for DHS. I again applaud Senators McConnell and Reid for \ntheir efforts to get us to this point. I think we need leaders who are \nwilling to work together, who are willing to encourage us here in the \nSenate. We saw that in the last few days with Senators McConnell and \nReid.\n  Once the Senate acts, however, we will need the House of \nRepresentatives to join us in putting aside our ideological and \npolitical differences and passing a bill without controversial riders, \na bill that will fund the Department of Homeland Security.\n  As we have discussed in this Chamber, there are disagreements about \nimmigration and about the President's Executive action. I am certainly \nhappy to have debate about that. I know there are others who are happy \nto have a debate. But first we need to fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We need to put safety and security ahead of our ideological \ndifferences. We are just 2 days away from a devastating shutdown of \nDHS. We do not have time to waste. I certainly hope that we will act \nquickly here and that the House will also act quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, a battle has been raging online in the \npast year. Millions of citizens, companies, innovators, and \nentrepreneurs have been sounding an alarm calling us to electronic \narms. These 21st-century Netizens took to the street and they took to \nthe Net. They raised their voices and demanded that the FCC protect the \nworld's greatest platform for communications and commerce.\n  Today we declare victory. Today we say the economy and the free \nexpression of ideas depend on Net neutrality. Today we say an open and \nfree Internet is as important as keeping our air and water clean and \nour roads and highways safe. Today we say Net neutrality is here to \nstay. Today is Internet freedom and innovation day.\n  Just today the Federal Communications Commission is making historic \ndecisions to enshrine Net neutrality protections. The Commission is \nvoting to use its power to protect the tremendous power of the \nInternet. This battle for Net neutrality means that the Internet is \nprotected for decades to come. It is protected for all the students and \nstartups, for all the businesses and online buyers, for all of the \ninventors, the innovators, and the Internet users.\n  By banning paid prioritization, blocking, and throttling, the FCC is \napplying the principles of nondiscrimination--which is what Net \nneutrality really is--nondiscrimination to the\n\n[[Page S1129]]\n\nbroadband world. This is the next chapter in the history of American \ninnovation. It is our country's declaration of innovation. Chairman \nWheeler and the FCC are on the right side of history.\n  This battle for Net neutrality was not fought without opposition. The \ndeep-pocketed broadband barons want to turn the Internet into a set of \ngated communities. They say it will raise taxes. They say it is an \noverreach. They say it will not stand up in court. Some claim it will \nharm investment. But then companies such as Sprint and Verizon say it \nwill not, in fact, influence how they invest. So I say to the critics: \nDo you want to return to the days when a few telecommunications \ngiants--which today we would call big broadband barons--control the \nvital wires and spectrum we use to communicate or do we want a free, \ndynamic, open market where the best in ideas survives and thrives? The \nchoice is clear.\n  The FCC Commissioners supporting the open Internet order have made \nthe right choice. Today the people won. I applaud the FCC and Chairman \nWheeler for standing up for students in their dorm rooms, engineers in \ntheir basements, and innovators in their garages. I applaud the FCC for \nstanding up for the best ideas, not merely the best funded ideas. The \nFCC has chosen the right path forward. I commend the Commission for \nthat action.\n  Reclassifying broadband under title II is a major victory for \nconsumers, for our democracy, and for our economy. Consider that in \n2013, 62 percent of the venture capital funds invested in this country \nwent toward Internet-specific and software companies. The free flow of \nideas supported by the Internet are creating the companies launching \nthe global revolution and supporting the communications that we rely on \nevery day. We want a free, dynamic, open market where the best in ideas \nsurvives and thrives.\n  Today is a historic, revolutionary day for consumers, innovators, \nentrepreneurs--anyone who counts on the Internet to connect to the \nworld. I applaud and I thank the millions of American revolutionaries \nwho stood up and fought for Net neutrality. The fight is not over. \nThere is much more work to be done. But today is a historic victory. It \nis Internet freedom and innovation day.\n  Let's celebrate this transformative power of the Internet today and \nfor generations to come. We are going to ensure that the architecture \nof the Internet remains one where the smallest entrepreneurs who can go \nto the capital markets and raise the funding for the new ideas, for the \nfollow-on ideas to Google and eBay and Amazon and Hulu and YouTube, are \nable to be joined by new companies like Dwolla, like Etsy, like Vimeo, \nand like hundreds and thousands of others whose names we do not yet \nknow, because now they are going to have the capacity to be able to say \nto their investors: We now have the capacity to reach a market. With \nour ideas, we can transform some part of the way in which people \ncommunicate in this country and on this planet.\n  That is what we are celebrating today--the power of the Net, the \npower of individuals to come up with the capital so they can then \ntransform some part of the way in which we communicate in this life.\n  So just remember that when the 1996 Telecommunications Act passed, \nthere were no companies like the ones I just mentioned. That was \nbecause it was an old world. But in the blink of an eye, a \ntechnological eye, we have moved to this new world where each of us is \ncarrying a device in our pockets. Each of us is wondering how we ever \ngot along without the capacity to be able to tap into all of these \nwonderful new companies and the products they provide. That is what \ntoday is all about--Net neutrality day. It will not impact the \ninvestments of the big companies, but it will ensure that the small \ncompanies--those that received 62 percent of all venture capital in \nAmerica in the last year--will be able to provide their new products, \ntheir new innovations, their new challenges to the way in which we \ncommunicate. I think that is the whole key. We need to maintain the \nDarwinian paranoia-inducing competition that the Net has introduced. If \nwe do that, then I think America will be No. 1, looking over its \nshoulder at Nos. 2, 3, and 4 in the world in terms of our innovation in \nthe communications sector.\n  Congratulations to the Federal Communications Commission, and \ncongratulations to all entrepreneurs across America. Today is a day \nwhen you should be celebrating.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1129-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. MARKEY.

The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, with 1 day before the funding expires for \nthe Department of Homeland Security, I rise to urge the adoption of a \nclean funding bill.\n  It seems we are on a path to ensure that, at least in the Senate, we \nare going to adopt a bill that funds the critical safety and national \nsecurity functions of the Department of Homeland Security without \nextraneous immigration riders. I encourage my colleagues in both \nChambers to embrace what Members on both sides of the aisle have \nacknowledged is the best way to resolve this issue--avoid a shutdown, \nenact the clean bipartisan Homeland Security bill, and address the \nimmigration policies through regular order on the floor.\n  By now, we have all heard from a host of people spelling out the many \nnegative impacts of a shutdown--our colleagues, Secretary Johnson, \nprevious Secretaries, and many of our Nation's mayors. We would be \nunnecessarily disrupting funding which all of our States' emergency \nmanagers rely on and which allows for programs that function to keep us \nsafe and keep people and goods moving securely and efficiently \nthroughout our country.\n  My home State of Hawaii is 2,500 miles from the closest landmass. It \nhosts the Nation's fourth largest airport for international arrivals \nand is currently responding to and recovering from presidentially \ndeclared disasters related to lava threats and tropical storms.\n  For these and many other reasons, I am concerned that Congress would \nconsider risking timely funding for the agencies that keep our airports \nsafe, our coasts and waters secure, and provide for critical planning \nand response support to our States' first responders.\n  Additionally, I don't think anyone should attempt to trivialize a \nshutdown based on the argument that many Department of Homeland \nSecurity employees will have to report to work regardless. What an \ninsult. For the thousands of Hawaii residents employed by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, this is significant. These are middle-\nclass jobs helping to support middle-class families. These employees \nwill still have to make rent, pay a mortgage, buy gas, food, childcare \nand the like, and the Coast Guard's men and women will have to report \nfor duty--not for pay. We owe them better than that. We shouldn't \nsubject these families to uncertainty about their next paycheck.\n  Our path forward is actually totally simple: pass the original \nfunding bill that was negotiated in good faith by both parties and both \nChambers last December. Because of where we are right now, it is \nimportant to remember that the underlying Department of Homeland \nSecurity funding bill was the result of a bipartisan negotiation and \ncompromise between both Chambers and both parties.\n  That means we have to resist the temptation in either Chamber to make \npolitical decisions that have no chances of success in the Senate or \nwould be vetoed by the President. For example, reinserting partisan \nimmigration riders into this bill is a nonstarter. The Senate has not \nwavered on this point, and that dynamic is not going to change.\n  Let's just do our jobs. Let's fund the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and\n\n[[Page S1130]]\n\nthen we can debate comprehensive immigration policy any time the \nleadership desires to bring it to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hoeven). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, tomorrow, on February 27, the Department \nof Homeland Security will run out of money and be forced to at least \npartially shut down. This is the Department responsible for protecting \nAmerica against terrorism. It faces a government shutdown in about 24 \nhours.\n  Last year the congressional Republicans insisted that when we pass \nthe overall Federal budget we cut out of it the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and not fully fund the Department. They insisted on this so \nthey could enter into a debate with the President over the issue of \nimmigration, and the House of Representatives sent us funding for this \nDepartment contingent on five anti-immigration riders going after the \nPresident's position on immigration. They have created an artificial, \nunnecessary, dangerous funding crisis.\n  I have come to the floor over the last several weeks while this has \nbeen under consideration in the Senate urging the passage of a clean \nappropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security. I was \nheartened yesterday by the overwhelming vote of 98 to 2 to move toward \npassing this clean appropriations bill. It appears we have finally come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis to fund this critical agency at the \neleventh hour.\n  Sadly, there is no response from the House of Representatives as to \nwhether they will even consider the timely funding for this Department, \nso we run the real risk we will have to shut down this Department and \nput America at risk as a result. That is unfortunate because we know \nhow important this Department is and we know the threats are real.\n  It was just last weekend when we disclosed intelligence gathered that \nthere were extremist groups threatening the malls of America. There \nwere specific threats to malls that were owned by Jewish enterprises, \nwhatever that meant, but that is what they said. That is what we are up \nagainst. We see it around the world, real terrorism and real extremism, \nand now the question is, Does the Speaker of the House see this threat? \nDo the Republicans who are in the majority in the House see this \nthreat? Do they see it enough to want to fund this critical agency?\n  This morning on television there was an interview of one of the \nRepublican Congressmen from Alabama. He said: No, this is really a \ndebate about the Constitution, not about convenience.\n  Convenience? I don't understand that word when we talk about \nprotecting America from terrorism. This is not a convenience, this is a \nnecessity. This is part and parcel of why we exist as a Congress--to \nkeep America safe.\n  So now the ball is in the court of the Republicans in the House. I \nthink we will pass a clean bill here, and I think it will be \noverwhelmingly positive and bipartisan.\n  What is the issue that is sticking in their craw over there that \ntroubles them so much that the House Republicans would jeopardize \nfunding the agency assigned to keep America safe? It is the issue of \nimmigration, particularly Executive orders issued by the President.\n  One particular part just absolutely gnaws at them as they think about \nthe possibility the President's order of 2012--the so-called DACA \norder--will be carried out in the future. What is that order? It is an \norder which said: If someone was brought to the United States as a \nchild--an infant, a toddler, a small child--undocumented, and they went \nto school in this country and they have no criminal record, we are \ngoing to give them a chance to stay here and not be subject to \ndeportation. They can go to school here, they can work here, and they \nare protected by the President's Executive order--the so-called DACA.\n  The Republicans in the House hate this idea like the devil hates holy \nwater. They can't understand why these young people who had no \nwrongdoing in coming to this country should be given this chance, and \nthey are prepared to shut down the Department of Homeland Security if \nwe don't relent.\n  I come to the floor regularly to tell stories about these young \npeople, and today I want to tell you the story of one of these \nDREAMers. Her name is Maria Ibarra-Frayre. She was brought to the \nUnited States from Mexico at the age of 9, grew up in Detroit, MI, and \nis an excellent student. She spent a lot of her spare time in community \nservice and as a member of the National Honor Society, the Key Club, \nand the school newspaper. She volunteered twice a week tutoring middle \nschool students, performed over 300 hours of community service, and \ngraduated from high school with a 3.97 grade point average. There \naren't too many of us in the Senate who can boast that kind of grade \npoint average.\n  Maria was admitted to the University of Michigan, one of the top \nState colleges in the Nation. She couldn't attend because she is \nundocumented. Instead, she entered the University of Detroit Mercy, a \nprivate Catholic school. She was elected vice president of the student \nsenate. She also helped found the Campus Kitchen, taking leftover meals \nfrom the school cafeteria and delivering them to seniors who had \ndifficulty staying in homes.\n  She participated in the alternative spring break, where she spent her \nvacation time helping those in need. One year, she went to South \nCarolina and helped rebuild an elderly couple's house, and another year \nshe worked with the homeless in Sacramento, CA.\n  Maria graduated as valedictorian of her class, with a major in \nEnglish and social work. After graduation, her options were limited \nbecause she was undocumented. I might add that she didn't have a penny \nof government assistance going through college--undocumented students \ndon't qualify. But she dedicated herself to community service and \nvolunteered for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, a Catholic nonprofit \norganization.\n  Then in 2012 President Obama issued his order to give protection to a \nyoung person like herself. She was able to get a temporary work permit \nto work in the United States. She didn't run out and get a high-paying \ncorporate job. She continued her community service, and now she is a \nfull-time program coordinator for the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. She has \napplied to graduate school for social work. She wants to become an \nadvocate for victims of domestic violence.\n  She wrote me a letter and talked about this Executive order which \nmany House Republicans can't wait to rescind and defund. Here is what \nshe said:\n\n       DACA means showing the rest of the country, society, and my \n     community what I can do. I have always known what I'm capable \n     of, but DACA has allowed me to show others that the \n     investment and opportunity that DACA provides is worth it.\n\n  If the Republicans have their way, Maria will be deported. Having \nspent the majority of her life in this country, pledging allegiance to \nthat flag, singing our national anthem--the only one she knows--they \nwant her out of this country as quickly as possible.\n  America is better if Maria can stay. People will get a helping hand \nfrom her as they have throughout her entire life. I cannot understand \nthis mean-spirited political strategy that cannot wait to deport this \nwonderful, amazing young woman from America. And 600,000 young people, \nmany just like her, are only asking for a chance to make this a better \nNation.\n  I hope that we do have a debate on immigration. I hope Members of the \nSenate and Congress will reflect on the fact that we are a nation of \nimmigrants. Our diversity is our strength. Young people such as this \nwho come to America make us a better Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago I came to the Senate floor to \nspeak on an amendment which I had hoped would provide a framework that \nwould accomplish three goals:\n  First, to provide funding for the Department of Homeland Security so \nthat it could perform its vital mission of protecting the people of our \ncountry;\n  Second, to put the Senate on record as opposing the President's \nextraordinarily broad immigration actions\n\n[[Page S1131]]\n\nissued by Executive order in November of 2014;\n  And, third, to ensure that individuals who were brought to this \ncountry as children and qualify for treatment under the June 2012 \nExecutive order on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--the so-\ncalled DREAMers that Senator Durbin has just spoken of--could continue \nto benefit under that program.\n  I am very pleased that it looks like we are moving forward on a bill \nto fully fund the Department of Homeland Security. We had a very strong \nvote on that yesterday. Indeed, I have not heard a single Senator on \neither side of the aisle say that we should shut down the Department of \nHomeland Security. Each of us recognizes its vital mission.\n  As someone who served as the chairman or ranking member of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for a decade, I \ncertainly understand how vital the mission of this Department is.\n  I am keenly aware, as a member of the Intelligence Committee, of the \nthreats against our country and the risks that we face from those who \nwould do us harm.\n  At the same time, as members of the legislative branch, we have an \nobligation to speak out and to register our opposition when we believe \nthat the President has exceeded his grant of Executive authority under \nthe Constitution in a way that would undermine the separation of powers \ndoctrine. I wish to read what a constitutional scholar has said about \nthe President's Executive order and how far the President could or \ncould not go. This is what this constitutional scholar says:\n\n       Congress has said ``here is the law'' when it comes to \n     those who are undocumented. . . . What we can do is to carve \n     out the DREAM Act, saying young people who have basically \n     grown up here are Americans that we should welcome. . . . But \n     if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be \n     ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very \n     difficult to defend legally. So that's not an option.\n\n  Who was that constitutional scholar? It was the President of the \nUnited States, Barack Obama. He said this in September of 2013. \nPresident Obama got it right back then. I believe that he was within \nthe scope of his Executive authority when he issued the 2012 Executive \norders that created DACA, which allowed for the DREAMers to stay here.\n  Let me also make clear that I am a supporter of comprehensive \nimmigration reform. While I was disappointed that immigration reform \nlegislation of some sort did not become law when we passed it a few \nyears ago, I reject the notion that its failure can serve as \njustification for the actions taken by the President last November. He \nsimply cannot do by Executive fiat what Congress has refused to pass \nregardless of the wisdom of Congress's decision. Such unilateral action \nis contrary to how our constitutional system is supposed to work, and \nit risks undermining the separation of powers doctrine, which is \ncentral to our constitutional framework.\n  That is really what this debate is about. It is about the proper \nconstitutional constraints on unilateral Executive action. It happens \nto be an Executive action that deals with immigration, but it could be \nan Executive action on any other issue. That is why it is important \nthat we draw those lines.\n  Indeed, the legislation I proposed, which we will be voting on at \nsome point, is fully consistent with the court ruling in Texas, which \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, is very familiar with and \nknows much more about than I do. But it is fully consistent with that \nruling which lets stand the 2012 Executive order but stayed the \nimplementation of the 2014 Executive order. There is a difference.\n  Now, I consider the Senator from Illinois to be an excellent Senator \nand a dear friend, and it truly pains me to disagree with his analysis \nof my amendment. I know that he acts in good faith. But there are \neither misunderstandings or misinterpretations or just plain \ndisagreements. So I would like to go through some of the points that he \nhas made about my amendment.\n  One of the chief objections of the Senator from Illinois to my bill \nis that it strikes provisions of the November 2014 immigration action \nthat would expand--that is the key word; it would expand--the 2012 DACA \nProgram to add certain individuals who are not eligible under that \nprogram.\n  He talks about expanding the age limit, for example.\n  Now, let's take a look at exactly what the criteria are for DREAMers \nunder the 2012 Executive order. These are criteria that were praised by \nmy friend from Illinois and numerous other Senators on the Democratic \nside of the aisle when the President issued his Executive order. I, \ntoo, agree with these criteria.\n  In order to qualify, an individual has to have come to the United \nStates under the age of 16, has to have continually resided in the \nUnited States for at least 5 years preceding the date of this \nmemorandum, and has to be present on the date of the June 15, 2012, \nmemorandum.\n  The individual has to be currently either in school, have graduated \nfrom high school, have obtained a general education development \ncertificate or has to be an honorably discharged member of the Coast \nGuard or our military. In addition, the individual has to have a pretty \ngood record. The person cannot have been convicted of a felony offense, \na significant misdemeanor offense, multiple misdemeanor offenses or \notherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety. And they \ncannot be above the age of 30.\n  These are reasonable criteria that the President came up with.\n  Frankly, I am not enthralled with the one that allows for multiple \nmisdemeanors, and the Executive order also states that the individual \ncannot have multiple misdemeanors. The form that is used by DHS says \nthe individual can have up to three misdemeanors. I personally would \nrequire an absolutely clean record. But these are reasonable criteria, \nand these are not changed by the Collins bill in any way. The 2012 \nExecutive order stands.\n  So the argument of my friend from Illinois is focused on the fact \nthat he wants an expansion of these criteria and to add other \ncategories of individuals, and that is what the November 2014 \nimmigration action does. It has nothing to do with the status of the \nindividuals who were allowed to stay in this country as a result of the \n2012 Executive order. My amendment protects the 2012 Executive order \nand those who benefited from it.\n  So we have a sincere disagreement over what is appropriate to be done \nby Executive action and what needs to be done by legislation. Even \nthough I support many of the policies that are in the 2014 Executive \norder, I just don't think the President can unilaterally proclaim those \nchanges.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. If the Senator's question is a brief one, I will be very \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will make it very brief. If the Senator acknowledges--\nand I believe she does--that the President had the authority in 2012 to \nissue an Executive order under DACA and to spell out the criteria, \nwhich includes, at the very bottom of her chart, that the person is not \nabove the age of 30, why does the Senator disagree with this situation: \nsomeone who was 29 years old in June 2012, eligible for DACA, the \nExecutive order, and now it is 2\\1/2\\ years later, and the President \ntried to amend in November 2014 that last line to expand it so that \nthose who have aged out would still have a chance because Congress has \nnot acted otherwise. Why would the Senator from Maine draw that \ndistinction saying that the President has the authority to write this \norder but not the authority to amend this order?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am happy to respond to the point made \nby the Senator from Illinois.\n  The point is that the President's 2014 Executive order goes far \nbeyond those who would ``age out,'' in his words; it adds entirely new \ncategories of people. In fact, the estimates are that some 5 million \nundocumented individuals would be covered by the 2014 Executive order. \nShould the President unilaterally be allowed to make that kind of \nExecutive order, that kind of change in our immigration law? The court \nhas said no, and I believe the court is right about that. In fact, when \nthese criteria were issued in 2012, the Senator from Illinois said in a \npress release as recently as June of last year, before the November \nExecutive order, that this was a smart and lawful approach.\n\n[[Page S1132]]\n\n  So the answer is, how do you draw the line, and what is the \nappropriate role of the executive branch vis-a-vis the legislative \nbranch? And I say that as someone who believes and hopes that later \nthis year we will take up a comprehensive immigration bill, and I hope \nto be able to support it again. But this is an issue of what is the \nproper role of Congress vis-a-vis the President under our \nconstitutional system. And I was not surprised when the Texas court \nkept the 2012 Executive order but blocked the 2014 Executive order.\n  There is another issue the Senator from Illinois has raised that I \nthink is a very important point to make. He has said that my bill could \nbar some of those who received the ability to stay in this country \nthrough the 2012 Executive order from renewing their status.\n  That is simply not how I read the Executive order, and I think it is \nvery clear. Let's look at the 2012 Executive order. This is what it \nsays. This is what Janet Napolitano talked about in ``exercising \nprosecutorial discretion.'' The June 15, 2012, DACA Executive order \ngrants deferred action ``for a period of two years''--here are the key \nwords--``subject to renewal.'' So there is nothing in my amendment that \nprevents children and young adults--people up to age 30--from getting a \nrenewal of the deferred status that they have been granted through this \nExecutive order. It says it right there: ``subject to renewal.''\n  But let's look further at the data. This is on DHS's Web site. \nAccording to the data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nthe government has renewed more than 148,000 2012 applications as of \nthe first quarter of this fiscal year, and many of them were completed \nbefore the November 2014 Executive orders were even issued.\n  So there is nothing in my bill that prevents the renewal of those \nindividuals who received this status. It is very clear--148,000 of them \nhave had their applications renewed.\n  The Senator from Illinois has said that I would prevent DHS from \nissuing a memorandum that allows for the renewal. There is no need for \nsuch a memorandum; otherwise, 148,000 of these young people would not \nhave been able to get a renewal--and before the 2014 Executive order \nwas even issued.\n  The Senator has also said that my bill calls into question the very \nlegality of the 2012 DACA order because it is a ``very similar program \nto the 2014 Executive action.''\n  To restate my basic point, my bill does not affect the 2012 DACA \nProgram. It is substantially different from the 2014 Executive order. \nIn fact, if you read the language of the 2014 Executive order, it \nembraces that distinction. It specifically states that it does not \nrescind or supersede the 2012 DACA order.\n  Let me say that again. The 2014 Executive order specifically states \nthat it does not rescind or supersede the Executive order that was \nissued in 2012. Instead, it says it seeks to supplement or amend it.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. The Senator from Texas.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Maine on \nthis issue, and in her typical diligence and attention to detail, I \nthink she has shown that the objections to a vote on the Collins \namendment, which would be scheduled for Saturday unless moved up, are \nnot well-taken.\n  I would ask the Senator from Maine whether her interpretation of the \nPresident's Executive action in November of 2014 is any different from \nwhat the President himself said 22 different times, when he said he did \nnot have the authority to issue such an Executive action?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I could respond to the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, he raises an excellent point. I would bring up a quote that \nis just one of those 22 quotes in which the President has said over and \nover again that he would like to do more on immigration, that he was \nvery disappointed the House didn't take up the comprehensive \nimmigration bill but that his hands were tied. I believe at one point \nhe even said, ``I am not a king.''\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Maine--you \nare not alone--and the President is not alone--in stating your \nobjections to the 2014 order. Your amendment would seek to get a vote \nand to put Senators on record. Is the Senator aware that there are a \nnumber--perhaps seven or eight Senators on the other side of the aisle \nwho at different times around the November 2014 order said they were \nuncomfortable with the President taking this authority unto himself? In \nother words, I think the junior Senator from Maine was one who said \nthat while he may agree with the outcome, this is not the right way to \ndo it. Are you familiar with the fact that there are many of our \nDemocratic friends who have expressed similar concerns about the \nillegality of the President's Executive action?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it doesn't surprise me that there are \nboth Democratic Senators and Republican Senators who are extremely \nuncomfortable with what the President did last November because it is \nso outside of the scope of his authority as President that I think that \nmost of my colleagues, in their hearts, on the other side of the aisle \nmust have qualms and misgivings about what the President did. In fact, \nI would almost guarantee that if a Republican President had exceeded \nhis Executive authority to that degree, there would have been an \nuproar. So I think this is important in terms of our protecting the \nchecks and balances that our Founding Fathers so wisely incorporated \ninto the Constitution. And I do believe there are even more Senators on \nthe other side who may not have said what they were thinking but who \nreally do have qualms about it even if they agree with the policy.\n  We need to distinguish between the policy--whether or not some \nMembers agree with the policy; some Members don't--but the question is, \nDoes the President's frustration with Congress's failure to pass \nimmigration reform allow him to unilaterally write the law?\n  The Senator from Texas is a former Supreme Court justice in Texas, \nand through the Chair I would pose that question to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have to say to my friend, the Senator from Maine, that \nthe Constitution is written in a way that divides government's \nauthority between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. \nAnd I, of course, agree that there can be no justification on the part \nof the President that somehow Congress hadn't acted enough or quickly \nenough or expansively enough to justify the extension of his authority \nunder the Constitution.\n  I wish to ask my friend from Maine another question in order to drill \ndown on her earlier point. It seems to me that the Senator from \nIllinois, the distinguished minority whip, is making the suggestion \nthat we are mad about people benefiting from this Executive action, \nwhich, to my mind, could not be further from the truth. We all \nunderstand the aspirations of people wanting a better way of life and \nto have opportunities, but isn't it true that when we all take an oath \nto uphold the constitutional laws of the United States--whether you are \nthe President or a Senator--we have a sacred obligation to make sure no \nbranch, including the President, usurps the authority of another branch \nor violates those constitutional limitations?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas, who has a fine \nlegal mind and has served on the Texas Supreme Court, is exactly right.\n  Moreover, I wish to read what President Obama himself said about the \nvery point the Senator from Texas made about the oath when we held up \nour right hand and were sworn into this body, and the oath the \nPresident took when he became President. Here is what the President \nsaid in July 2011:\n\n       I swore an oath to uphold the laws on the books . . . Now, \n     I know some people want me to bypass Congress and to change \n     the laws on my own . . . But that's not how our system works. \n     That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our \n     Constitution is written.\n\n  President Obama had it exactly right when he stated that reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S1133]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. The Senator from Maine has been very patient with me. If \nI could ask two final questions.\n  Given the 22 different public statements the President of the United \nStates himself said about his lack of authority to do what he did in \nNovember of 2014, given the reservations publicly expressed and \nreported by a number of Members on that side of the aisle about what \nthe President has done, and given the fact there are 11 Democratic \nSenators who come from States that filed a lawsuit to block the \nPresident's Executive action, can the Senator from Maine understand why \nthe Democratic minority would try to block the Senator's amendment, \nwhich would put all Senators on record as to whether they agree with \nthe President when he said that 22 times, whether they agree with the \ncourt that issued the preliminary injunction, and whether they agree \nwith their own States that participated in this litigation to block the \nimplementation of this unlawful order?\n  Can the Senator think of any reason why they would try to block or \ndefeat the Senator's amendment and put all Members of the Senate on \nrecord?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to respond to the Senator from Texas, I \nhope that will not happen. I have put forth a way forward for this \nbody. I want to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is \nfully funded throughout the fiscal year. I want to ensure that we do \nnot overturn the 2012 DACA Executive order, which is narrow enough that \nit does not raise the very troubling issues the Senator from Texas has \nso eloquently outlined. But I do believe it is important for each of us \nto take a stand against the President's overreach here. This is \nimportant. This matters.\n  It is our job to protect the Constitution and to uphold our role, and \nthat is what I am trying to do here--accomplish those three goals--and \nthat is what the Senator from Texas is discussing.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator from Maine one \nfinal question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. My friend has been enormously patient with me. We are \ntrying to drill this issue down here so all of the Members of the \nSenate understand exactly what the Collins amendment does and does not \ndo.\n  We have talked about the fact that not only are there Members of the \nSenate who are on record saying what the President did was an \noverreach, there are 11 Democratic Senators who come from States that \nfiled a suit claiming irreparable damages to their States and will have \nan opportunity to vote for the Collins amendment--hopefully here soon.\n  I wish to ask the Senator: There is one part of what the President's \nExecutive order does that, to me, stands out above and beyond the \nconstitutional issues, and that is the ability of people who have \ncommitted domestic violence, child exploitation, sexual abuse, and \nchild molestation to somehow get kicked back to the end of the line \nwhen it comes to being repatriated to their state.\n  For example, we all understand, as I said earlier, immigrants come \nhere for a better life. We all understand that. We would hope they \nwould come and play by the rules as opposed to not playing by the \nrules. Why in the world would the President want to reward, in effect, \npeople who have committed domestic violence, child exploitation, sexual \nabuse, and child molestation by moving them down to a second-tier \nstatus of priority when it comes to repatriation?\n  Is the Senator familiar with what I am referring to? Perhaps my \nfriend can enlighten us further on that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am familiar with the issue the Senator \nfrom Texas refers to, and I kept a provision included in the bill that \nwe will be voting on at some point, on that issue. It seems to me, if \nyou are a convicted sex offender, why do we want you in this country?\n  The irony is that just this week the Senate Judiciary Committee held \na hearing on sex trafficking, and we heard heartbreaking stories of \nvery young girls who had been abused by men, who had been taken from \nState to State, coerced into prostitution. I do not want \nthose individuals, if they come from another country, to be allowed to \nstay here. All 20 of the women of the Senate requested this hearing \nfrom the Judiciary Committee, and the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Minnesota have bills that deal with this kind of human \ntrafficking. We are trying to send a message that these individuals \nshould be a high priority for deportation, but I want to make it clear \nthat contrary to allegations that have been made about my bill--and, \nfrankly, it is a completely specious argument--there is nothing in my \nbill that deprives the Department of Homeland Security of the authority \nit needs to pursue those who would seek to harm our country--those, for \nexample, who are terrorists or belong to gangs or pose some sort of \npublic safety or national security threat.\n\n  Indeed, the public safety threat is big enough to cover the people we \nare talking about, but we think they merit special mention in our bill. \nWhy would we want to keep someone in our country who is deportable, who \nis a sex offender, who has been convicted of child molestation or \ndomestic violence? It makes no sense.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I could close with a followup question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator from Maine for her leadership on this \nimportant amendment. To me it is unthinkable that Senators would block \na vote on the Collins amendment at some point in the process this week \nbecause what it does, as the Senator has pointed out, is basically \nreinforce what the President said himself 22 different times when he \nsaid he didn't have the authority. It reaffirms what the Federal \nDistrict Court held in Brownsville recently, and which 26 States filed \nsuit on. I share the Senator's bewilderment, really, at how on one hand \nwe can be condoning people coming into the country and showing \ndisrespect not only for our immigration laws but compounding that \ndisrespect with these heinous offenses, such as domestic violence, \nchild exploitation, sexual abuse, and child molestation, particularly \nafter we voted unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a \nbipartisan basis these anti-trafficking bills the Senator spoke about.\n  I want to close by thanking the Senator and the women of the Senate \nfor leading us toward passage of this anti-trafficking legislation, but \nto also point out, once again, the complete unacceptability of this \nidea that somehow we are going to play games by blocking the Collins \namendment vote and somehow condoning the same conduct on one hand and \non the other hand we are condemning them through the passage of this \nanti-trafficking legislation.\n  I thank the Senator and the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for his \ncontributions to this very important debate. I believe he helped to \nclarify a lot of important issues that I hope Members on both sides of \nthe aisle will consider as they cast their votes.\n  I am for comprehensive immigration reform. I have voted that way. \nThat is not what this is about. My bill simply prevents the executive \nbranch from usurping the legislative power by creating categorical \nexceptions from the law for whole classes of people. That power belongs \nto Congress. Whether Congress was wrong or whether Congress was right, \nit does not give the President the authority to write the law on his \nown, and that is what he has done with his November 2014 Executive \norder.\n  I wish to make two other points before I close. The first point is \nthere is nothing in my legislation that in any way undoes the more \nlimited 2012 Executive order that applies to the DREAMers--nothing. It \ndoesn't prevent them from being renewed nor does it take away their \nstatus. There is nothing that changes that Executive order. The first \nversion of the House bill did, and I opposed that provision and it is \nnot in my bill.\n  The second point I will make is that this debate is not about \nimmigration. It really is about the power of the President versus the \npowers delineated in our Constitution for Congress and the judicial \nbranch.\n  I will close, once again, with President Obama's own words, because \nhe\n\n[[Page S1134]]\n\ngot it right back in September of 2013. He said:\n\n       Congress has said ``here is the law'' when it comes to \n     those who are undocumented . . . What we can do is to carve \n     out the DREAM Act--\n\n  And that is what he did with his 2012 Executive order.\n\n     saying young people who have basically grown up here are \n     Americans that we should welcome . . . But if we start \n     broadening that--\n\n  Which is exactly what he did in his 2014 Executive order.\n\n     then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I \n     think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that's \n     not an option.\n\n  That is why the court stayed the implementation of the 2014 Executive \norder.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a historic \ndecision by the Federal Communications Commission. It was a 3-to-2 \ndecision in a landmark case that will go down as a way to protect an \nopen Internet economy. Consumers all across America should applaud this \ndecision--and I know they will in the Pacific Northwest--because we \nwill be protecting an aspect of our economy that has created thousands \nof jobs and millions of dollars.\n  This decision, known as Net neutrality, simply says that cable \ncompanies and telecom companies cannot artificially charge more on the \nInternet, thereby slowing down traffic or making a two-tier system in \nwhich some applications would be given access to faster service and \nothers not, based on what they paid for.\n  This is an important decision because it champions an open Internet \neconomy that has built so many new aspects of the way we communicate, \nthe way we educate, and the way we continue to transact business around \nthe globe. In 2010 the Internet economy accounted for 4.7 percent, or \napproximately $68 billion, of America's gross domestic product. Next \nyear that Internet economy is expected to pass $100 billion and \ncomprise 5.4 percent of our country's estimated $18 trillion GDP. So in \n6 years the Internet's value has climbed over 30 percent.\n  What this decision says is: Let's protect the Internet. Let's not \nartificially tax it, let's not artificially slow it down, and let's not \nartificially create two tiers of an Internet system and stymie \ninnovation. So many of us now know and enjoy the benefits the Internet \nprovides when we buy a Starbucks coffee and use an app to pay for it or \nuse an app to get on an airplane--and so many other ways that we \ncommunicate in an information age. Slowing all that down by just one \nsecond causes big problems and curtails an economy of growth.\n  We all know we have questions about the way cable companies and phone \ncompanies charge us for data. Let's make sure the Federal \nCommunications Commission does its job by overseeing those companies \nthat might want to charge more for those services than they need to \ncharge. Let's keep an open Internet. Let's have Net neutrality be the \nlaw of the land.\n  I applaud the FCC for this historic decision today.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1134-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1134-S1135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise today in partnership with Senator \nThad Cochran from Mississippi having just submitted a resolution \nrecognizing and celebrating Black History Month here in the United \nStates of America.\n  I wish to take a few moments before that to address an issue that \nvery poignantly has been anguishing my heart for my entire life. From \nthe time I was growing up in the small town of Harrington Park, NJ, \nthrough my career in school and college, this has been grieving my \nheart. It has been grieving my heart since I started working in a \npredominantly minority city--a city I love--Newark, NJ.\n  I bring this up in the context of a previous speech I gave about our \nbroken criminal justice system that makes us singular, among all of \nhumanity on planet Earth, for the amount of our population that we \nincarcerate. We have 5 percent of the globe's population but about 25 \npercent of all of the globe's imprisoned people. This explosion is not \nconsistent with our history. In fact, it is inconsistent with our \nhistory. It is incongruent with our values. To be very specific, the \nexplosion of our prison population is because of the war on drugs.\n  The bottom line is that there were fewer people incarcerated in 1980 \nfor any reason than there are today in prison and jails for drug \noffenses alone. Let me say that again, we have more people incarcerated \ntoday, either in prisons or in jails, just for drug crimes than all of \nthe people incarcerated in the year 1980. In fact, due to this drug war \nour Federal prison population has exploded about 800 percent.\n  In the context of what I am about to talk about in this resolution \nrecognizing African-American history, I wish to particularly point to \ntoday this grievous reality that our war on drugs has \ndisproportionately affected African Americans, Latinos, minorities, and \nthe poor in general.\n  It is painful for me to have seen in my lifetime, in the town I grew \nup in or at Stanford or Yale, many of my friends using drugs such as \nmarijuana, many of them buying drugs such as marijuana, and many of \nthem selling drugs such as marijuana. But the reality is the justice \nsystem they experienced for breaking the law was very different than \nthe justice system I saw in Newark, NJ. The reality is we don't have a \nsystem of equal justice under law, but a system that disproportionately \naffects minorities in a way that is stunning and an affront to our \nnation's values. Arrest rates for drug use have a disparate impact on \npeople of color. There is no questioning that. This is unacceptable. \nWhen it comes to people who break the law in America, there is actually \nno difference between blacks and whites who have committed drug \ncrimes--none whatsoever, but African Americans, for example, when it \ncomes to marijuana, are arrested at 3.7 times the rate that whites are \nin this country. While their usages were similar in Newark or Stanford, \nlaw enforcement has arrested and incarcerated far more minorities \nliving in urban communities than whites living in suburban communities.\n  Between 2007 and 2009, drug sentences for African American men were \nlonger than those for white men. Drug sentences for black men were 13.1 \npercent longer for the same crime than those for white men. So not only \nare more African Americans and Latinos and people of color being \ntargeted and arrested at higher rates than whites for the same crimes, \nbut they are also getting and serving longer sentences.\n  Human Rights Watch put it simply. They found that even though the \nmajority of illegal drug users and dealers nationwide are white, three-\nquarters of all people imprisoned for drug offenses are minorities. \nThis should call out to the conscience of everyone in our country.\n  We believe fundamentally, at the core of our American values, in this \nideal of equal justice under the law. The punishing thing about this is \nthat not only are arrest rates higher, not only are they receiving \nlonger sentences, but when we get such a disproportionate amount of \npeople being arrested and incarcerated, the collateral consequences \nwhich they see at the end of the system become even more punishing on \nthose communities. We now have cities in America that for certain age \ndemographics, almost 50 percent of African American men have been \narrested, and over 40 percent of Latino men have been arrested. And \nwhat that means is that once someone has a felony conviction for the \nnonviolent use of drugs, one's ability to go to college, to get a Pell \ngrant, to get a job, and even to get many business licenses, is \nundermined.\n  Right now we see this punishing impact destroying many communities. \nInstead of empowering people to succeed, we are getting people trapped \nin our criminal justice system. Instead of the solid rock of success, \npeople are being sucked into the quicksand of a broken criminal justice \nsystem. For example, the blacks and Latinos in the United States are 29 \npercent of the population but make up almost 60 percent of the prison \npopulation. In New Jersey, blacks and Latinos are 32 percent of\n\n[[Page S1135]]\n\nthe total State population, but blacks and Latinos make up 81 percent \nof our prison population.\n  An often overlooked group in this discussion on the disproportionate \nimpact on minorities is Native Americans. For instance, in North \nDakota, Native Americans make up 5 percent of the total State \npopulation but 29 percent of the prison population. These numbers, \nagain, go against the truth of who we are as a country.\n  So at this moment, when we are celebrating our history, when blacks \nand whites and Christians, Jews, and Muslims come together to advance \nour Nation--indeed, I stand here today because of the collective \nconviction of this country to live up to its values and ideals that all \nof us are created equal under God and that all of us should have an \nequal opportunity to succeed and be seen equally by our government.\n  It is at this moment that I say we can and must do better. In fact, \nmany States, including red States, led by Republicans, are showing that \nthere is a different way. For example, States such as Texas, Georgia, \nand North Carolina are leading on this issue. Texas is known for its \nlaw and order, but it has made tremendous strides in adopting policies \nthat have decreased its prison population and positively affected \nminorities in the State. In fact, the Governor of Georgia continually \ntalks about the fact that he has been able to lower his black male \nincarceration rate by about 20 percent over the past 5 years.\n  So as I prepare to join with the great Senator from Mississippi, I \njust want to say from the bottom of my heart that it is time to reform \nour legal system to make it truly a justice system. We want it so that \neveryone under the law faces equal treatment and so that we empower our \nentire community in America to be successful, not tie them up \nunnecessarily when even though they have paid the price for their \ncrime. Punishment should not haunt someone for the rest of their \nexistence.\n  I remember these words spoken by the great Langston Hughes, one of \nour great American poets, an African-American man who once said: There \nis a dream in this land with its back against the wall; to save this \ndream for one, we must save it for all.\n  This is the dream of America. We can do better. Indeed, many \ncommunities are committing themselves to creating a justice system \nwhich we can be proud of. We know in the Senate--Members on both sides \nof the political aisle; whether it is Senator Lee or Senator Durbin or \nwhether it is Senator Cornyn or Senator Whitehouse--that together we \ncan evidence these values.\n  With that, I recognize and yield for a moment to a friend and an \nally, the Senator from Mississippi, Thad Cochran.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my friend in \nintroducing legislation celebrating Black History Month. This \nopportunity provides us with an excuse, if we need one, to remember the \nchallenges and the failures of the past, and the embarrassments and the \ncriminalities, and so many challenging and horrible things that have \ncharacterized the treatment of citizens in the United States with \ninjustice, with discrimination, with segregation, and all of the \nhorribles we can remember as we contemplate this subject.\n  Today, the Senator from Mississippi is joining the Senator from New \nJersey and others in giving us another opportunity to not only remember \npast injustice and celebrate victories over it but also to commemorate \ncontributions being made today throughout our country to ensure \nequality and justice and opportunity for all Americans.\n  The rich history we have as a nation should include a promise for the \nfuture carved by African Americans as central contributors. They were \nhere during the darkest times. They are still here, and they are \ncontinuing to make huge and important contributions to our Nation.\n  So I am pleased to join my friend, the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, to support the adoption of our resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how grateful I am for \nthose good words from my colleague. Truly, they resonate with my heart \nand my spirit. The gravity of this historic moment is not lost on me. \nIt is a tribute to his character that he cosponsored this with me, as \nhe understands, as he said so clearly, that American history is a \nbeautiful mosaic, with contributions from every corner of the globe \nbeing made in this great country that we call the United States of \nAmerica.\n  It is with that spirit and that recollection of our past, with a \ncommitment to forge an even brighter future, that I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. \nRes. 88, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 88) Celebrating Black History Month.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOOKER. I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 88) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  (The resolution, with its preamble, is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I am grateful for that. Again, I thank my \ncolleague for his partnership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1135-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1135-S1137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO \n                           PROCEED--Continued\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublicans control the next hour and that the Democrats control the \nfollowing hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the majority will control the next hour, \nand the Democrats will control the following hour.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on July 14 of last year, I wrote a \nletter to lawmakers on both sides of the aisle warning that the \nPresident was planning to issue an Executive amnesty for 5 million \nillegal aliens--people unlawfully in America. Congress was at the time \nconsidering a supplemental funding measure for the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  I wrote:\n\n       Congress must not acquiesce to spending more taxpayer \n     dollars until the President unequivocally rescinds his threat \n     of more illegal executive action... If Congress simply passes \n     a supplemental spending bill without these preconditions, it \n     is not a question of if the President will suspend more \n     immigration laws, but only how many he will suspend.\n\n  Executive amnesty became a major issue in the election last November. \nMany Members of the Senate and House who had supported these \nimmigration policies of the President didn't come back. They were sent \nhome, and many returning on both sides of the aisle said during their \ncampaigns that they opposed these policies.\n  Still, on November 20, after a historic midterm election defeat, \nPresident Obama defied the will of the American people and Congress and \nissued his Executive amnesty for 5 million persons. This amnesty \nincluded not just the right to stay in America but an explicit photo \nID, work authorization, work permits, Social Security numbers and \nSocial Security benefits, Medicare benefits, cash tax credits, and the \nright to basically take any job in America--at a time of high \nunemployment and falling wages, as economists have told us is \nhappening.\n\n[[Page S1136]]\n\n  Each of these measures had been considered and explicitly rejected by \nCongress. It wasn't as if this was something the President just \nconceived. It had been considered and rejected. Congress acted \ndecisively to oppose the President's legislation and to maintain in \neffect the current laws of the United States as codified in the \nImmigration and Nationality Act. President Obama's Executive action \nnullified the immigration laws we do have and replaced them with the \nvery measures Congress and the American people have time and time again \nrejected.\n  Not even King George III had the power to act without Parliament. \nPresident Obama himself described such an action as being something \nonly an emperor could do. Those were his words. Twenty-two times the \nPresident declared such an action would be illegal. President Obama \nignored his own warnings and issued an edict that defies the Congress, \nthe Constitution, and centuries of legal heritage that gave birth to \nour present Republic.\n  The Founders, in their wisdom, gave the Congress the tools it would \nneed to stop a President who overreaches. First, it gave the power to \npass laws to the Congress, as every child in school knows. Congress \npasses the laws, not the President. This is a matter of great \nfundamental importance. Then it gave the Congress the tools it would \nneed to stop a President because they anticipated Presidents may \noverreach in the future. Chief among those powers is the power of the \npurse, and that is what we are talking about today: Should Congress \nfund the President's actions that are contrary to law, contrary to \ncongressional wishes, and contrary to the American people's wishes? \nThat is the question.\n  Let me now read from the Federalist Papers, Federalist 58, authored \nby the great Father of the Constitution, James Madison. He is talking \nabout the House of Representatives, and the House of Representatives \nnow has funded Homeland Security fully. Everything that needs to be \npassed to fund the Homeland Security operations they passed. They \nsimply said: You cannot spend money to provide amnesty and these \nbenefits and these Social Security and ID cards. You can't spend money \non that. We don't approve spending money on that.\n  So what has happened in the Senate? Our Democratic colleagues have \nfilibustered the bill. They will not even let it come up on the floor, \nnot even to vote on amendments. Senator McConnell told them they would \nhave amendments. It has put the Congress and the country in a very \ndifficult position.\n  This is what Madison said:\n\n       The House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but they \n     alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the support of \n     government. They, in a word, hold the purse, that powerful \n     instrument, by which we behold, in the history of the British \n     Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the \n     people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and \n     importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have \n     wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches \n     of government. This power over the purse may, in fact, be \n     regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which \n     any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  It is a complete power of the elected representatives by the people \nof America. First of all, the American people through their elected \nrepresentatives rejected the President's policies on immigration. They \nchose to keep current law, but this did not satisfy the President. He \nasked Congress to change it, and Congress refused. They refused in \n2006, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2014. It has been rejected by Congress \nrepeatedly. So that is where we are.\n  Congress has no duty to do this. Congress has no obligation to fund \nthose actions which it believes simply are unwise. It has an absolute \nduty, it seems to me, not to fund actions which are unlawful and \nunconstitutional. Congress cannot fund an action which dissolves its \nown powers.\n  Congress shouldn't fund Presidential actions that are against the \nlaw, and Congress certainly cannot fund an action which dissolves its \nown powers. Congress cannot become a museum piece, a marble building \nthat tourists visit to hear about great debates from long ago, but \nwhich now exists merely to approve that which the President demands. It \ndoesn't have to approve one thing the President asks for if it is not a \ncorrect thing.\n  So consider the precedent being established here: Congress passes a \nlaw, just as Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act. A \nPresident proposes a new law to replace the current one. Hearing vast \npublic opposition, Congress rejects the new law the President has \nproposed. Frustrated, the President then issues an edict eliminating \nthe current law and replacing it with measures he has proposed but \nwhich the people's representatives had rejected. The President then \ndemands Congress provide him with the money to execute his unlawful \nprogram. The Congress says no. The President then accuses Congress of \nshutting down the government for not funding his unlawful program. \nCongress surrenders, quits, gives up, and the President gets what he \nwants.\n  Have the people of the United States been served in that fashion? Has \nthe Constitution of the United States been served? Has the Congress of \nthe United States not acquiesced in its own diminishment, violating its \nduty to ensure that every dollar spent by the Government of the United \nStates is spent on policies that are appropriate?\n  Well, is this to be the new normal? Congress must provide the \nPresident with the funds he wants for any project he dreams up, no \nmatter how illegal or unconstitutional? Is the power of the purse now a \nhistoric concept never to be used again when it is needed most? There \nis no more basic application of congressional power than to establish \nwhere funds may or may not be spent. Indeed, that is the very \ndefinition of an appropriations bill. There could never be a more \nimportant time to exercise such a power than when free government, our \nrepublican heritage itself, is at stake.\n  We cannot let this Congress go down in the history books as the \nCongress that established a new precedent that we will fund any \nimperial decree that violates established American law.\n  And this is not a minor constitutional violation; it is an explosive \nviolation. It threatens our very sovereignty, the extent of which \nexceeds anything I have ever seen in my time in the Senate. I cannot \nimagine and cannot recall one in the past--so blatant a violation. \nEssential to any sovereign nation is the enforcement of its borders, \nthe application of uniform rules for exit and entry, and the delivery \nof consequences for any who violate those rules.\n  But the President has suspended those borders, erased those rules, \nand replaced consequences with rewards. People who have entered \nunlawfully, stayed here unlawfully, are being rewarded with work \npermits, Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits, ID cards, \nlegal status. He has arrogated for himself the sole and absolute power \nto decide who comes to the United States. That is, in effect, what it \nis. He gets to decide unilaterally who can stay and live in the United \nStates and who works in the United States.\n  At this very moment, he continues--despite a court order--to allow \nnew illegal immigrants by the thousands to stream across the border, to \nviolate their visas, and to wait for their amnesty too, which they \nexpect will occur sometime in the future. Why not? Every officer and \nexpert in the Border Patrol and USCIS has told us if this stands, it \nwill encourage more illegal immigration in the future.\n  I cannot vote for any legislation that funds this illegal amnesty. \nThere must be a line in the sand and a moment where people say: This is \nwhere it stops. That is why I will oppose the legislation if these \namnesty restrictions are removed from the House bill. I will support \nthe House bill, but I cannot support the bill if the restrictions are \nremoved. I will urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Look, the American people are right and just and good and decent \npeople. They have asked of Congress, begged of Congress, pleaded with \nCongress for years for our laws to be enforced. They want us to have a \nlawful system of immigration that serves the national interests, one \nthey can be proud of, one that people can rely on when they apply to \ncome to the United States.\n  They have demanded--and Congress responded and has passed laws over \nthe years to protect the jobs and the wages of the American people. \nThey have elected lawmaker after lawmaker,\n\n[[Page S1137]]\n\nhowever, who has pledged to do this and make this system work, and to \nend the lawlessness.\n  But each time their will has been nullified. Each time their laws \nthat have been passed have been ignored. Each time the special \ninterests, the open-border billionaires, the global elites, get their \nway.\n  In the simplest of terms, here is where we stand now, truly: Six of \nour Democratic colleagues need to switch their votes and end the \nfilibuster of the House bill. Six Senate Democrats are standing in the \nway of the interests of 300 million Americans. Six Senate Democrats are \nkeeping from protecting American workers and American borders.\n  They are uniform, in lockstep, blocking the consideration of the \nHouse bill that funds Homeland Security but does not fund the unlawful \nactions of the President. So we will have to take this case to the \nAmerican people and see whether it is indeed possible these Democrats \nare able to defy the hopes, dreams, and sacred rights of every law-\nabiding American citizen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1137-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1137-S1138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AWARDING A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO THE FOOT SOLDIERS WHO \n PARTICIPATED IN BLOODY SUNDAY, TURNAROUND TUESDAY, OR THE FINAL SELMA \n           TO MONTGOMERY VOTING RIGHTS MARCH IN MARCH OF 1965\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) March 7, 2015, will mark 50 years since the brave Foot \n     Soldiers of the Voting Rights Movement first attempted to \n     march from Selma to Montgomery on ``Bloody Sunday'' in \n     protest against the denial of their right to vote, and were \n     brutally assaulted by Alabama state troopers.\n       (2) Beginning in 1964, members of the Student Nonviolent \n     Coordinating Committee attempted to register African-\n     Americans to vote throughout the state of Alabama.\n       (3) These efforts were designed to ensure that every \n     American citizen would be able to exercise their \n     constitutional right to vote and have their voices heard.\n       (4) By December of 1964, many of these efforts remained \n     unsuccessful. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., working with \n     leaders from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee \n     and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, began to \n     organize protests throughout Alabama.\n       (5) On March 7, 1965, over 500 voting rights marchers known \n     as ``Foot Soldiers'' gathered on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in \n     Selma, Alabama in peaceful protest of the denial of their \n     most sacred and constitutionally protected right--the right \n     to vote.\n       (6) Led by John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent \n     Coordinating Committee and Rev. Hosea Williams of the \n     Southern Christian Leadership Conference, these Foot Soldiers \n     began the march towards the Alabama State Capitol in \n     Montgomery, Alabama.\n       (7) As the Foot Soldiers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, \n     they were confronted by a wall of Alabama state troopers who \n     brutally attacked and beat them.\n       (8) Americans across the country witnessed this tragic turn \n     of events as news stations broadcasted the brutality on a day \n     that would be later known as ``Bloody Sunday.''\n       (9) Two days later on Tuesday, March 9, 1965, nearly 2,500 \n     Foot Soldiers led by Dr. Martin Luther King risked their \n     lives once more and attempted a second peaceful march \n     starting at the Edmund Pettus Bridge. This second attempted \n     march was later known as ``Turnaround Tuesday.''\n       (10) Fearing for the safety of these Foot Soldiers who \n     received no protection from federal or state authorities \n     during this second march, Dr. King led the marchers to the \n     base of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and stopped. Dr. King \n     kneeled and offered a prayer of solidarity and walked back to \n     the church.\n       (11) President Lyndon B. Johnson, inspired by the bravery \n     and determination of these Foot Soldiers and the atrocities \n     they endured, announced his plan for a voting rights bill \n     aimed at securing the precious right to vote for all citizens \n     during an address to Congress on March 15, 1965.\n       (12) On March 17, 1965, one week after ``Turnaround \n     Tuesday'', U.S. District Judge Frank M. Johnson ruled the \n     Foot Soldiers had a First Amendment right to petition the \n     government through peaceful protest, and ordered federal \n     agents to provide full protection to the Foot Soldiers during \n     the Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March.\n       (13) Judge Johnson's decision overturned Alabama Governor \n     George Wallace's prohibition on the protest due to public \n     safety concerns.\n       (14) On March 21, 1965, under the court order, the U.S. \n     Army, the federalized Alabama National Guard, and countless \n     federal agents and marshals escorted nearly 8,000 Foot \n     Soldiers from the start of their heroic journey in Selma, \n     Alabama to their safe arrival on the steps of the Alabama \n     State Capitol Building on March 25, 1965.\n       (15) The extraordinary bravery and sacrifice these Foot \n     Soldiers displayed in pursuit of a peaceful march from Selma \n     to Montgomery brought national attention to the struggle for \n     equal voting rights, and served as the catalyst for Congress \n     to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which President \n     Johnson signed into law on August 6, 1965.\n       (16) To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting \n     Rights Movement and the passage of the Voting Rights Act of \n     1965, it is befitting that Congress bestow the highest \n     civilian honor, the Congressional Gold Medal, in 2015, to the \n     Foot Soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, Turnaround \n     Tuesday or the final Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March \n     during March of 1965, which served as a catalyst for the \n     Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to \n     the Foot Soldiers who participated in Bloody Sunday, \n     Turnaround Tuesday, or the final Selma to Montgomery Voting \n     Rights March during March of 1965, which served as a catalyst \n     for the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (c) Award of Medal.--Following the award of the gold medal \n     described in subsection (a), the medal shall be given to the \n     Selma Interpretative Center in Selma, Alabama, where it shall \n     be available for display or temporary loan to be displayed \n     elsewhere, as appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this marks the 50th anniversary of the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, and that historic event in Selma, AL, in \nMarch of 1965. So this bill, I believe, is a fitting honor that \nrecognizes the courage and determination of the civil rights marches at \nSelma 50 years ago.\n  The Selma-to-Montgomery march was a pivotal event in the drive to \nachieve the right to vote for all Americans, a right which was being \nsystematically denied in that area and other places in the country. \nThis action was historic. It dealt a major blow to deliberate \ndiscrimination. It produced a positive and lasting change for \nAmericans.\n  Those who stood tall for freedom on that fateful day deserve to be \nhonored with the Congressional Gold Medal. It is a rare thing. We do \nnot give it out often. But this is a very special occasion. I think \nthese courageous individuals are greatly worthy of this high \nrecognition from the Congress.\n\n[[Page S1138]]\n\n  I would note that two Alabama Congresswomen, new, younger Members of \nthe House of Representatives, Martha Roby, a Republican, and Terri \nSewell, a Democrat, introduced similar bills in the House of \nRepresentatives, which passed unanimously, 420 to 0. The Senate bill \ntoday that Senator Booker and I have moved out of the Senate banking \ncommittee, which my colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, chairs--it \nmoved out of that committee unanimously. It now has been passed through \nthe Senate.\n  It was a very historic day. It marked an alteration in the history of \nAmerica. It changed an unacceptable abuse of American rights, the right \nto vote, and it created a more positive world, country, and region. I \ngrew up not too far from there. I was in high school or junior high \nschool when that happened. I remember reading about it, thinking about \nit, but I do not think I fully understood the significance of it until \ntime had gone by.\n  I think this is a very fitting honor. I am pleased it has passed \ntoday. I am pleased for those who will receive the honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I support S. 527, a bill to honor the \nfoot soldiers of the historic civil rights march that led thousands \nfrom Selma to Montgomery in a peaceful protest for their right to vote.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill, which would award the \nCongressional Gold Medal to those who gave their blood, sweat, and \ntears in the name of ending unfathomable injustices in our country. In \nhonor of the 50th anniversary of the march, this award will recognize \nthose whose groundbreaking efforts acted as a catalyst for the Voting \nRights Act and made our Nation a more free and equitable place.\n  Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, and the final 54-mile march from \nSelma to the Alabama state capitol in Montgomery were defining moments \nin the never-ending struggle for equal treatment under the law. On \nBloody Sunday, peaceful marchers at the Edmund Pettus Bridge by Selma \nwere met by State troopers and locals, resulting in a brutal conflict. \nSeventeen members of the march were hospitalized, and shameful images \nof protesters being beaten with nightsticks focused national and \nworldwide attention on the event. Following Turnaround Tuesday, in \nwhich 2,500 marchers held a silent prayer at the same bridge, and a \ncourt battle to stop police interference with the march, a final march \ntook place with over 25,000 people flooding the State capitol.\n  The Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, and Montgomery marches created \nundeniable momentum for change, and the events left an indelible mark \non our national consciousness. President Johnson presented the Voting \nRights Act to Congress shortly after Turnaround Tuesday, and by August \nof the same year, the bill passed Congress.\n  This bill would provide the plainly warranted recognition to these \nbrave men and women. It would provide a Congressional Gold Medal to be \ndisplayed at the Selma Interpretive Center near the Edmund Pettus \nBridge, a fitting tribute to the Foot Soldiers who made that fateful \nmarch.\n  Our country was founded on the precept that the power of government \nis derived from the people it governs. The primary form of expressing \nopinions in our democracy is through voting. The marchers who risked \neverything were committed to ensuring our democracy was truly \nrepresentative, leaving a lasting and positive effect on our Nation. I \nsalute these Foot Soldiers today, and I urge the Senate to swiftly pass \nthis important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1138-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1138-S1150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2015--MOTION TO \n                           PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to use a visible example of the cold weather during my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am reminiscent, with the snow on the \nground, of 5 years ago. The Presiding Officer was not here at that \ntime. He does not have the advantage of knowing the story of what is \nbehind this. The story that is behind this is that back when they \nstarted all the hysteria on global warming, there happened to be \nanother snowstorm that was unprecedented. It set a record that year.\n  There is a charming family of six, I say to my friend in the chair, \nwho built this. Their picture is here. That happens to be my daughter \nand her family of six. At that time it got a lot of attention. It \nactually got a lot of national attention.\n  In case we have forgotten, because we keep hearing that 2014 has been \nthe warmest year on record, I ask the Chair: Do you know what this is? \nIt is a snowball. That is just from outside here. So it is very cold \nout, very unseasonable. So, Mr. President, catch this.\n  We hear the perpetual headline that 2014 has been the warmest year on \nrecord. Now the script has flipped. I think it is important, since we \nhear it over and over and over again on the floor of this Senate. Some \noutlets are referring to the recent cold temperatures as the ``Siberian \nExpress,'' as we can see with the snowball out there. This is today. \nThis is reality.\n  Others are printing pictures of a frozen Niagara Falls. And 4,700 \nsquare miles of ice have formed on the Great Lakes in 1 night. That has \nnever happened before.\n  Let's talk more about the warmest year claim. On January 16, NASA's \nGoddard Institute for Space Studies and the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, concluded that 2014 was the warmest \nyear in modern record, which starts in 1880.\n  NASA relied on readings from over 3,000 measuring stations worldwide, \nand only found an increase of just two one-hundredths of a degree over \nthe previous record. Now an important point that was left out of the \nNASA press release was that the margin of error, which on average is \n0.1 degree Celsius, was several times greater than the amount of \nwarming. So, in reality, it is so far within the margin of error that \nit is not really recordable. This discrepancy was questioned at a press \nconference, and NASA's GISS Director backtracked.\n  This is the Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He backtracked on \nthe warmest year headline saying there was only a 38-percent chance \nthat 2014 was the warmest year on the record. Another recent report \nissued by the Berkeley Earth surface temperature project, using data \nfrom more than 30,000 temperature stations, concluded that if 2014 was \nthe warmest year on record, it was by less than 0.01 degrees Celsius--\nagain, below the margin of error ultimately making it possible to \nconclude that 2014 was the warmest record on year.\n  Additional climate experts, including University of Oklahoma \ngeophysicist David Deming, have stated that the warmest year on record \nstatement is only as relevant as when the record actually began. Others \nstate that record-setting conclusions issued in January require the use \nof incomplete data because the preponderance of the data arrives much \nlater from underdeveloped and developing nations.\n  The media was quick to ditch the warmest year on record claim as cold \nweather has left most of the country experiencing record low \ntemperatures.\n  Tuesday's Washington Post highlighted all of the longstanding records \nthat were broken in the Northeast and Midwest.\n  My State is Oklahoma and that is not even included in this article. \nBut we set 146 records--alltime records--in my State of Oklahoma just \nduring that time.\n  According to the National Weather Service, 67 record lows were broken \non Monday and Tuesday of this week.\n  Whether news cycles or climate cycles, variations in hot and cold are \nreally nothing new. Recent climate change discussions like to focus on \nclimate trends post-1880, but the reality is that climate change has \nbeen occurring since the beginning of time.\n  The chart behind me is very interesting because it shows two things \nthat everyone agrees with. The first is that we had the medieval warm \nperiod. This\n\n[[Page S1139]]\n\nis a period of time starting about 1000 A.D. and going to about 1400 \nA.D. This is a major warming period that led into what they call the \nlittle ice age, which was about 1500 A.D. to about 1900 A.D.\n  The interesting thing is that many of us in this room remember that \nwhen they first started talking about global warming, a scientist named \nMichael Mann developed what they call the hockey stick theory, and that \nhad a hockey stick showing that for a long period of time we had \ntemperatures that were level, and then all of a sudden they started \ngoing up like the blade of a hockey stick.\n  The problem was they neglected to note that the two periods were, in \nreality, in his sketch of a hockey stick. So in his opinion then, as \nportrayed by the hockey stick, there was no medieval warm period or \nlittle ice age.\n  By the way, this Michael Mann is the same one who was featured as the \nmain person who was guilty of violations that created this term called \nthe climate change, which was characterized as the most outrageous. I \ndon't have it in my notes, but one of the publications in England \ntalked about the worst scientific disgrace in national history.\n  Time magazine had a chart, and this is interesting because people who \nlook at the weather and get concerned about all the warming periods and \nthe cold, to them the world is coming to an end. This one shows that in \n1974 another ice age was coming. That is the actual cover of the \nmagazine. So everyone is concerned that the world is coming to an end, \nand at the same time they were talking about the fact that there is \ngoing to be another ice age.\n  In the past 2000 years there was the medieval warm period followed \nimmediately by the little ice age. These two climate events are widely \nrecognized in scientific literature. No one has refuted these. These \nare incontrovertible.\n  In 2006 the National Academy of Sciences released its study ``Surface \nTemperature Reconstructions for the Last 2000 Years,'' and that \nacknowledged that there were relatively warm conditions during that \nperiod of time.\n  So that is history, and that is behind us.\n  While that is still up, I will go on and fast forward. That same \nmagazine, Time magazine, had as its cover a short time after that this \npoor, typical, polar bear that is standing on the last piece of ice--\nand we are all going to die because global warming is coming.\n  This is something that has been happening over long periods of time. \nEvery time it does, everyone tries to say that the world is coming to \nan end and that somehow man is so important and so powerful that he can \nchange that.\n  In 1975 Newsweek published an article titled ``The Cooling World,'' \nwhich argued that global temperatures were falling and terrible \nconsequences for food production were on the horizon--and all of that. \nWell, we know about that.\n  This highlights that the climate is changing, and it always has been \nchanging.\n  In fact, our recent vote during the Keystone XL Pipeline debate \nshowed that 97 of us in this Chamber--Democrats and Republicans--agreed \nthat climate has always been changing. I made a little talk on the \nfloor at that time and I said: You know, I think this is something on \nwhich we can all agree. If we look at archaeological diggings, history, \nthe Scriptures, climate has always been in changing.\n  Despite a long list of unsubstantiated global warming claims, climate \nactivists and environmental groups will cling to any extreme weather-\nrelated headline to their case for global warming and to instill the \nfear of global warming in the American people. People sometimes ask me \nwhy. Why do you suppose they are doing this, spending all this time?\n  They tried it through legislation. We defeated it. Now it is through \nregulations that would cost between $300 billion and $400 billion a \nyear. Yet it wouldn't have any effect on what they perceive to be \nglobal warming. So that is the question. Why is it?\n  There is a scientist by the name of Richard Lindzen. Richard Lindzen \nis with MIT. Some of us have argued he is the most knowledgeable of all \nthe climate scientists. He answered that question. He said: You know, \nregulating carbon is like regulating life. If you regulate carbon, it \nis a bureaucrat's dream, because regulating carbon regulates life. So \nit is a power struggle.\n  I think that is probably the best answer. I am not a scientist. I \ndon't claim to be. But I quote scientists, and they have the answers to \nthese questions.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  Now, President Obama is using a similar tactic in order to scare \nAmericans into supporting his extreme climate change agenda. In a \nrecent interview, President Obama agreed that the media overstates the \ndangers of terrorism while downplaying the risks of climate change. His \nPress Secretary, Josh Earnest, later reiterated that President Obama \nbelieves climate change affects far more Americans than terrorists.\n  Now, that is the first time we heard that. But wait until we hear \nlater what the President himself and his Secretary of State said. \nAccording to the President, the biggest challenge we face is not the \nspread of Islamic extremist terrorism in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Algeria, \nLibya, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen or Nigeria. The \ngreatest threat that we face is not Russian aggression in NATO and the \nUnited States, as well as its invasion of Georgia and Ukraine. It is \nnot the expansion of Iranian influence and sponsorship of terrorism \nthroughout the Middle East or its pursuit of a nuclear weapons system \nto deliver it and to be able to hit the United States of America. The \ngreatest threat is not North Korea's continued development of its \nnuclear weapons stockpile and the improving of their delivery systems \nto include the January 23 launch of a sea-launched ballistic missile \nthat was called the KN-11. I think we are all aware of that. And the \ngreatest threat is not the continued capture and killing of reporters, \nmissionaries, businessmen, Christians, and other non-Muslims in what \nhas clearly been a religious confrontation being pursued. The \nPresident's position is that global warming is our greatest threat--\ngreater than all the things I just mentioned. It is underscored by the \nfact that he won't even publicly state that the 21 Egyptians executed \nby ISIL in Libya were Christians. He won't recognize that, and he won't \nrecognize that it has anything to do with radical Islam.\n  He goes out of his way to downplay the actions and dangers of ISIS \neven though the group continues to terrorize the world. Just this past \nweekend, ISIS abducted over 70 Syrian Christians, including women and \nchildren from villages in eastern Syria. To my knowledge, we don't know \nwhat they have done with them yet. But there are 70 of them, and the \nprevious 21 were killed because of their Christianity.\n  According to the President, our biggest threat is not the continued \nthreats made by extremists against the United States and its citizens. \nIt is not the successful attacks carried out in the United States and \nother places such as New York, Boston, Fort Hood or potential attacks \nof lone wolves or sleeper cells against soft targets such as the Mall \nof America, which is the most recent subject of an ISIL threat. Even as \nthese atrocities are taking place, President Obama is telling the world \nthat climate change is a greater threat to our Nation than terrorists. \nThis is just another illustration that this President and his \nadministration are detached from the realities that we are facing today \nand into the future.\n  His repeated failure to understand the real threat to our national \nsecurity and his inability to develop a coherent national security \nstrategy has put this Nation at a level of risk that has been unknown \nfor decades.\n  His failure of leadership and his gutting of our military have \nweakened our ability to influence and respond to crises. This all comes \nat a tremendous cost to our national security.\n  The President has accused the media of overstating the problem, \nheightening the fears of the population. As he downplays the threats, \nwe see photos of young children standing in military-like formation, \nbeing brainwashed into ISIS or ISIL extremism. We shouldn't be \nsurprised. It is a natural outgrowth of the President's failed \nleadership.\n  In 2012 and 2013 President Obama spoke of helping Libya and Yemen \nfight terrorism. Yet as he addressed\n\n[[Page S1140]]\n\nthis Nation, both countries spiraled toward chaos, creating terrorist \nsafe havens. Just days after his speech, Yemen's Prime Minister and his \nCabinet resigned amidst a coup by the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.\n  The administration aided instability in Afghanistan by releasing the \nmost senior leaders of the Taliban, the Taliban dream team. We all \nremember that.\n  We had just passed a law saying that the President cannot release \nanyone from Gitmo--from Guantanamo Bay--without giving 30 days' notice \nto Congress. Yet he totally ignored that and let these people go. Some \nof the terrorists out of Gitmo--I carry this card with me because it is \nreally not believable. Of the five that he turned loose, one was named \nMohammed Fazil, and the Taliban commander said that Mohammed Fazil's \nrelease ``is like pouring 10,000 Taliban fighters into the battle on \nthe side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right lion to lead them in \nthe final moment before victory against Afghanistan.''\n  Now, I don't know where these are. I suggest that all five have \nreturned to the battle. The record is that of those who have been \nreleased, some 29 percent have gone back to the battle.\n  So that is taking place. Mullah Omar, the Taliban's leader, called \nthe release a great victory.\n  This action allowed these men to rejoin the fight against our service \nmen and women. This is a big deal.\n  The President quickly withdrew from Iraq, leaving a vacuum for ISIS \nto fill, which is now requiring our military to return. The President \nwants to repeat our errors with a speedy withdrawal from Afghanistan, \nand that is despite the advice of his commanders on the ground and the \nrequest by Afghanistan's newest President, Ashraf Ghani, to reexamine \nour withdrawal plan.\n  He has de-Reaganized Europe by drastically cutting our forces, \nacquiescing to Russian influences by cutting our ballistic missile \ndefense site in Poland and our radar in the Czech Republic. I remember \nwhen that happened. I was so concerned about that because we put the \nradar site and the ballistic missile defense site in Poland and the \nCzech Republic because--that was for the protection of Western Europe \nand Eastern United States because we don't have the capacity to offer \nprotection the American people should expect. But the President did \nthat anyway. He failed to provide assistance--apart from the MREs and \nblankets. Instead of sending weapons to the Ukrainians, he sends \nblankets.\n  We had Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, come in and give a \nspeech to a joint session of Congress. In that speech he said we need \nto have some defense against what Putin and the Russians are doing with \nthe separatists in his country of Ukraine.\n  I happened to be over there. I was over there during the \nparliamentary elections. Not many people in America realize that in the \nUkraine--our very good friends in Ukraine had their parliamentary \nelections in October, and President Poroshenko looked me in the eyes \nand said very proudly how good the outcome was. This was the first time \nin 96 years that the Ukraine had parliamentary elections and didn't \nelect one Communist to a seat in the Parliament. That was the first \ntime that had ever happened. Yet the President said in his State of the \nUnion message:\n\n       We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't \n     bully the small--by opposing Russian aggression, supporting \n     Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.\n\n  That is what he said, standing in the House Chamber, in his State of \nthe Union speech. Yet, under the President's failed leadership, we have \nseen two ceasefire failures in the Ukraine, thousands of civilians \ndisplaced, and approximately 5,000 people killed.\n  America's assistance is vital to denying Putin's attempts to \ndestabilize the region. Yet it is not happening. It is not happening \nunder the Obama administration. This administration is overwhelmed by \nworld events and blind to the fact that terrorists are at war with \nAmerica and our way of life. We now live in a world where our allies \ndon't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. When will the President \nand his administration take the steps required to minimize the risk to \nAmericans and our allies by providing this country with a national \nsecurity strategy--one that addresses today's global security \nenvironment, grows back our military and its readiness, and deals with \nour enemies from a position of strength, not weakness and not \nappeasement?\n  These are the biggest threats facing our Nation today. It is \ndecidedly not global warming. The threat of war, terrorism, and \nextremism has plagued the Earth for centuries. The United States is not \nimmune. We must take all threats seriously and take every responsible \naction to secure our freedom. Threats to our national security are \nalways the most serious threats we face. Issues such as global warming \nor global cooling 40 years ago are simply not what we need to be \nworrying about in the same breath when we are talking about national \ndefense.\n  I say this because I have a deep concern. I was the ranking member on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee, and I am in a position to see what \nis happening around the world. The threats we are facing are \nunprecedented.\n  Just yesterday we had a hearing, and we had James Clapper, the \nDirector of National Intelligence. This is one of the things he has \nbeen quoted as saying:\n\n       Looking back over my now more than half a century in \n     intelligence, I've not experienced a time when we've been \n     beset by more crises and threats around the globe.\n\n  In the hearing we held yesterday, the Director said:\n\n       When the final accounting is done, 2014 will have been the \n     most lethal year for global terrorism in the 45 years such \n     data has been compiled.\n\n  So this goes on and on. This is what the military says. This is the \nthreat we face. Everyone understands it except the White House.\n  On February 25, just yesterday, Secretary of State Kerry said--and \nkeep in mind he said this with all these threats we are facing:\n\n       Today is actually, despite ISIL, despite the visible \n     killings that you see and how horrific they are, we are \n     actually living in a period of less daily threat to Americans \n     and to people in the world than normally--less deaths, less \n     violent deaths today than through the last century.\n\n  We all know better than that. We know how threatened we are. Everyone \nknows it except the White House, and they are going to have to wake up \nto save our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 3 minutes notwithstanding the previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute To Louis Stokes\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, at a quarter after, I am leading a group of \nseven or eight Senators to talk about the trade promotion authority and \nthe transpacific partnership, but I would like to take this opportunity \nwhile the floor is empty--and I thank my Republican colleagues--to talk \nabout Ohio civil rights pioneer Congressman Louis Stokes. I have known \nhim for 35 years. We celebrated his 90th birthday on Monday, and I had \nthe opportunity to speak to him.\n  Lou Stokes is a proud son of Cleveland, the city in which I live. He \nwas born in that city nine decades ago and grew up in one of the first \nFederal housing projects in the country.\n  Lou rose to prominence as a lawyer and a legislator. His father \nworked in a laundromat and his mother cleaned houses. Lou himself \nshined shoes to earn extra money. He served in the Army during World \nWar II and went to college at night on the GI bill. He is the American \nsuccess story.\n  Lou was stationed in the Deep South during segregation. He was \nappalled by the discrimination he witnessed, even for those wearing the \nuniform and serving our country. That experience compelled him to \ndedicate his life to fighting injustice.\n  He handled matters big and small in his legal practice. He argued the \nlandmark case of Terry v. Ohio before the U.S. Supreme Court. The \nCourt's ruling\n\n[[Page S1141]]\n\nin Terry addressed the police stop-and-frisk policy and defined what \nconstitutes a reasonable search and seizure.\n  As the first African American to represent Ohio in the U.S. Congress \nand the first African American to serve on the Committee on \nAppropriations, his mere presence was groundbreaking. But Lou never \nrested on his laurels. While serving as a Congressman for 15 terms, he \nwas a fierce advocate for the city he loves and for civil rights. Lou \ndidn't use his success to seek glory for himself; he used his powerful \nposition to expand opportunities for men and women, for people of all \ncolors, and young people and old people.\n  After retiring from Congress, he didn't retire; he returned home to \nCleveland and played a key role in Cleveland's civic life. His role at \nSquire Sanders was instrumental in the firm's growth. Working alongside \nhis longtime friend and my friend John Lewis--the lawyer John Lewis in \nCleveland, not Congressman John Lewis in Washington--he made a \ndifference in so many ways.\n  Lou served on the Ohio Task Force on Community-Police Relations. He \nis known always to fight for his neighborhood, the projects where he \nand his brother Carl, who was the first Black mayor of a major American \ncity, grew up. Carl was elected as mayor right before Lou was elected \nto Congress. It has been their labor of love to work to improve schools \nand opportunities in Cleveland.\n  The Cleveland VA center is named after Lou Stokes, as are buildings \nthroughout the Nation. They illustrate his hard work and his \ndedication. It is fitting that as we celebrate his milestone birthday \nthis week, the final week of Black History Month, we renew our \ncommitment to the cause of Lou Stokes's 90 years.\n  Lou means so much to me personally, he means so much to Cleveland, \nand he means so much to our country. I know the Presiding Officer, \nSenator Inhofe, got to serve with him in the House, as I did, and it \nwas an honor to do that and a privilege to call Lou Stokes my friend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, before we get underway with this \ncolloquy on trade, I wish to respond briefly to what I understand was a \npresentation made by one of the Republican Senators suggesting that the \ncontinued existence of snow disproves climate change.\n  First, that is not the only measure. We can take a look at sea-level \nrise, which we can measure from Fort Pulaski in Georgia up to Alaska \nwhere Lisa Murkowski has acknowledged that climate change is causing \nsea-level rise, eroding her native villages, to the sea-level rise in \nmy hometown State at the naval station. We can look at the pH changes \nin the ocean which we actually measure. It is not complicated. Kids \nmeasure the pH in their aquarium all the time. We can measure ocean \ntemperature, which is absolutely clear. It involves something called a \nthermometer. It really isn't all that complicated.\n  And if we want to understand why the existence of snow might actually \nbe consistent with climate change, I urge people to get their personal \ndevice here--their iPad, whatever it is they have--and load up the \nEarthNow! app. The EarthNow! app is run by a group called NASA. NASA is \npretty capable. They are driving a rover around on Mars right now. \nThese are folks who know a little bit about what they are talking \nabout. They map the temperature of the planet, and we can see the cold \narctic air drawn down to New England, drawn down to our area, and it is \nin large part because the ocean is warming offshore that we have this \nsnow.\n  So not only does the continued existence of snow not disprove global \nwarming--if you actually know what is going on and take the least bit \nof effort to understand it--you would see it is completely consistent \nwith global warming as it is understood by scientists such as those \nfrom NASA.\n  I will have more later, but let's get on with this other business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n      Trade Promotion Authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I know there is a UC order for seven or \neight Senators. Senators Casey, Merkley, Whitehouse, Markey, Warren, \nBaldwin, and Sanders we believe will be here for the next 45 minutes \nunder an agreed-to order to talk about our concerns with trade \npromotion authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I will lead off, \nthen Senator Casey will speak, and then Senators Merkley and \nWhitehouse. \n  We know a number of things. We know that American workers are the \nmost competitive and productive in the world. We also know that far too \nmany have been left behind because of wrongheaded trade deals.\n  In the 20th century, we built the strongest economy in the history of \nthe world by building the strongest middle class in the history of the \nworld. We invested in the health and safety of our workforce, \nguaranteed workers the right to bargain for fairer pay and reasonable \nhours. It was a fight to do so and more remains to be done. We expanded \nopportunity for women and people of color, which society had never \ndone, to realize their full potential in the labor force.\n  Americans up and down the income spectrum reaped the awards. Workers \ngot more productive, wages went up, profits were good, communities were \nstrong. We led the world with a booming economy fueled by a skilled and \npowered workforce.\n  The talent and tenacity of American workers has not changed, but our \nleaders'--including in this body--commitment to those workers, frankly, \nand, unfortunately, has.\n  Nowhere has that abandonment been more clear than the free trade \nagreements we now approve with little oversight and minimal debate. \nThese binding trade agreements affect all American workers. They cut \ninto small business and industry, and they cut to the heart of the \nvalues we hold dear--or say we hold dear--as a sovereign democracy. Too \noften they are pushed through this body so quickly that the \ncorporations pushing them hope we won't notice these agreements are \nloaded with corporate handouts that weaken our Nation's ability to \nchart its own course.\n  The last thing we need is another NAFTA. We know what the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement did to us 20 years ago when it passed. We \nknow the damage it did to workers in Philadelphia. We know the damage \nit did to small companies in Oregon. We know what it did to communities \nin Rhode Island. And I know up close what it has done to far too many \ncommunities--from Troy to Piqua to Toledo to Dayton--in my State.\n  We always talk about American exceptionalism. We give lip service to \nAmerican exceptionalism. Our Nation is exceptional. We see these same \npeople who always talk about American exceptionalism--and criticize \nanyone who doesn't talk about it--pushing trade agreements that \nundermine American laws and bypass our legal system. For what end? To \nbenefit big companies that can't get what they want through our \ndemocratic system.\n  I urge my colleagues and anyone else to read the article today \nwritten by Senator Warren of Massachusetts about something called \n``investor-state dispute settlement.'' This is what I want to talk \nabout for a moment.\n  Take the issue of tobacco. Tobacco use is the world's leading cause \nof preventable death. Tobacco companies have been one of the most \nsuccessful group of companies of any in American history. More trade \ndeals give Big Tobacco a new tool to peddle its poison.\n  How does that work? Big Tobacco turns to trade deals as the most \nfertile avenue for defeating international public health efforts. Big \nTobacco knows it can't win in this body, even with a conservative \nmajority that too often does the bidding of Wall Street and large \ncompanies. Senator Merkley and Senator Blumenthal have helped to lead\n\n[[Page S1142]]\n\nthis charge to make our tobacco law strong.\n  So what do tobacco companies do if they can't win in a democratic \nbody here? They use a trade provision called investor-state dispute \nsettlement. In the case of Big Tobacco, it uses ISDS to challenge \npublic health measures around the globe. Let me give an example.\n  Big Tobacco and its supporters are suing Australia for its Tobacco \nPlain Packaging Act 2011. They are challenging under Australian-Hong \nKong bilateral investment. They have good lawyers. They know how to do \ndarned near anything to use these laws--that they helped write under \ntrade policy--to benefit them and sell more cigarettes and poison our \nyoung people in far too many cases.\n  The Tobacco Plain Packaging Act in Australia--passed by a \ndemocratically elected legislative body, signed onto by the executive \nbranch in Australia--simply says that tobacco companies can't use their \nmarket-tested logos; they have to use plain black-and-white packaging. \nAlso on the tobacco packet they put pictures of diseased lungs or \npictures of people who have been sick from tobacco, so when people pick \nthat packet up, they get the message.\n  Big Tobacco sued Australia under the World Trade Organization despite \nthe fact that the Australian courts had already ruled in favor of the \ncountry of the public health law.\n  Tobacco companies have launched similar cases against Uruguay over \nits proposed graphic warnings on cigarette packages. Think about this: \nA big tobacco company is threatening to sue a small, relatively poor \ncountry such as Uruguay, saying: If you pass a public health law, we \nare going to sue you in court--not in one of your courts, but in some \ninternational court made up of mostly trade lawyers.\n  So what does a country the size of Uruguay often do? They give up. \nThey say: We can't afford to defend ourselves in an expensive court \nproceeding. Fortunately for Uruguay, Michael Bloomberg--one of the \nrichest men in the world--stepped in and helped them fight back.\n  Togo--one of the ten poorest countries in the world, West Africa--\nsimply gave up when Philip Morris sued them. The people of Togo wanted \na law to protect their children from the big marketing of tobacco \ncompanies. Philip Morris came in, threatened to sue them, and the \nGovernment of Togo backed off. What is good about that? It is \nappalling. It is antidemocratic. It has been left to a comedy show to \nexpose the practice of Big Tobacco. Watch John Oliver talk about this \non HBO.\n  Trade policy should ensure a level playing field for all companies \ncompeting in a global economy, not serve as a tool for the richest \ncorporation to overturn laws enacted by sovereign governments--\nparticularly not when, in this country, we are facing stagnating wages, \nincreased middle-class anxiety and insecurity, and rising inequality at \nhome.\n  So we are going to pass a trade agreement as CEOs' pay reaches record \nhighs, as average wages stagnate, as profits go up, as unionization \ngoes down, as wages fall as a share of GDP.\n  Think about this. Productivity has increased in our country 85 \npercent in the past 30 years. It used to be, as productivity went like \nthat, wages went like that. But now, productivity goes up 85 percent, \nwages went up 6 percent. The minimum wage in the United States today \nhas 30-percent less buying power than it had 35 years ago. That is why \nthis trade agreement is a bad idea. We know what has happened to \nmanufacturing. We lost 5 million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and \n2010.\n  Just look at the impact of trade on U.S. manufacturing for more than \n16 million jobs. It dropped here. We had the auto rescue here, which \nmeant a little bit of an increase, but it increases only back to 12 \nmillion manufacturing jobs.\n  We know bad trade agreements, bad policies on globalization, bad \npolicies on taxes, mean lost jobs--lost manufacturing jobs. That is the \nticket to the middle class.\n  Ever since NAFTA in 1993, taking effect in 1994, we have seen the \nacceleration of that decline in manufacturing jobs. It is bad for our \ncommunities, it is bad for our families, it is bad for our workers, it \nis bad for the States of Pennsylvania and Oregon and Ohio and Rhode \nIsland, and it is bad for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the same topic \nSenator Brown just spoke to. I appreciate what my colleague from Ohio \nbrought to this Senate floor today when talking about trade. I \nespecially commend him for not just his advocacy and his passion for \nstanding up for workers, but for the persuasive case he makes against \nsome of our trade policies--not just now but over time.\n  We stand now poised to debate a set of issues which we haven't \ndebated all that much in the 8 years I have been in the Senate--in this \ncase first trade promotion authority, and then of course the Trans-\nPacific Partnership.\n  The people I represent in Pennsylvania know what is at stake here. \nEach of us, as American people, will have the chance to review the \ndetails of these proposals. But based upon past experience with trade \nagreements in our lifetime, and especially in the last 25 years, that \npast experience causes me grave concerns about what is in store, first \nand foremost for our workers, which of course means our economy. Time \nand again Pennsylvania workers and Pennsylvania businesses of all sizes \nhave ended up with the short end of the stick on trade deals. The \nquestion they ask now is, what is in it for them? What is in it for \nworkers? What is in it for companies across Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry? And, therefore, what is in it for all of us when it comes to \nour economic bottom line?\n  Take the free trade agreement with South Korea just as a recent \nexample. That was passed in 2011. I didn't support it. But here is what \nwe were told before that. In December of 2010, the administration said \nthe agreement would support 70,000 additional American jobs, and it \nwould increase American exports by $10 billion to $11 billion.\n  During the first 2 years that the agreement took effect, exports \nactually fell by $3.1 billion and imports grew by $5.6 billion, \ncontributing to the loss of thousands of jobs. So that is one \nagreement, one example.\n  Let's take the impact on a particular industry, the steel industry. \nBy any measure, any review of World War II would indicate very clearly \nthat the American steel industry and steelworkers played a substantial \nrole in our ability to win World War II, to prevail in the most \ndifficult of conflicts. What has happened since then? Well, we know \nthat, for example, import surges from South Korea caused real damage to \nthe steel industry in recent years, which has led directly to job \nlosses in places such as Pennsylvania, for example.\n  So workers want to know where the benefit is that is promised to \nthem. Over and over again we hear these assertions: ``If we pass this \nagreement, this will be the impact on exports and imports'' and ``If we \npass this agreement, this will be the net benefit to job creation and \ntherefore to workers.'' Too often the result is otherwise.\n  If you look at the numbers--if you look at the agreement, the \nindustry, and then look at the numbers, in the United States we had a \n$66.5 billion deficit with free trade agreement partners in 2013. Our \ntrade balance with our largest free trade agreement partners--Canada, \nMexico, and Korea--is decidedly negative, not positive. So how is this \ntime going to be different?\n  I am concerned and a lot of Americans are concerned that past \nexperience suggests broadly negative impacts on jobs, especially--as \nSenator Brown made reference to by way of the chart and in other ways--\nespecially as it relates to manufacturing jobs, the ones on which you \ncan support a family, the jobs that lead to the kind of innovation that \nallows us to be one step ahead of the world.\n  The Economic Policy Institute, for example, estimates that 26,300 \njobs were lost due to the trade deficit with Mexico between 1994 and \n2011 in the aftermath of NAFTA, as Senator Brown referred to, and \n122,600 jobs were lost to China in the 12 years since China joined the \nWorld Trade Organization. Between these two countries alone, the \naverage impact on Pennsylvania was some 148,900 jobs lost in \nPennsylvania. So we have lost almost 150,000 jobs in Pennsylvania \ndirectly attributable to two factors: the impact\n\n[[Page S1143]]\n\nof China joining the World Trade Organization and the impact of the \ntrade deficit with Mexico.\n  When we look at the big picture, we have two possible areas of \nconcern with the so-called TPP--the Trans-Pacific Partnership--and by \nproxy the trade promotion authority as a part of that. There are labor \nand human rights concerns as well as currency manipulation.\n  Members of Congress and labor groups across the country have \nexpressed concerns about the so-called TPP and the countries we are \nnegotiating with, in particular Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, and Mexico. \nVietnam, as an example, does not offer the establishment of independent \nlabor unions and has opposed the inclusion of any provision that would \nchange this aspect of domestic law. The State Department has noted that \nbasic labor freedoms are often restricted in both Mexico and Malaysia. \nBrunei has recently implemented a harsh form of sharia law that \nviolates basic human rights standards.\n  How about currency manipulation? American manufacturers feel the pain \nfrom undervalued foreign currencies all the time, and they time and \nagain have demanded action from both parties and both Houses of \nCongress. Currency manipulation concerns are urgent not just because of \nJapan's policies and the potential future inclusion of China in TPP \ndown the road but also because virtually every negotiating partner has \na currency that is undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar--every \npartner in the proposed TPP.\n  As of January of this year, according to the Economist, 10 of the 11 \nnegotiating partners of the United States had undervalued currency. \nSeven of those countries, including Japan, had currencies that were at \nleast 25 percent undervalued relative to the U.S. dollar.\n  For far too long this administration has allowed foreign countries to \nstack the deck against U.S. workers when it comes to currency policies \nby manipulating their currencies. We have a chance in the TPP \nnegotiations to do something about this. All of us believe our workers \ncould out-compete any workers in the world if they were given the \nchance, if they were given basic fairness and a level playing field.\n  Pennsylvanians want Congress and the administration to focus on \npolicies that lead to both good jobs and good wages. So let's give our \nworkers the kind of support we gave past generations. Give our workers \na level playing field so that they can out-compete and therefore out-\nproduce any workers in the world. I am afraid these agreements are not \na step in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the points that have been made by my colleagues from \nOhio and Pennsylvania and the remarks yet to be made by my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  We are here on the floor together to raise fundamental issues that \nshould be part of the discussion about a proposed trade deal or a fast \ntrack to a trade deal.\n  I love the concept of trade, the idea that our particular economy, \nbased on our natural resources and based on our skills, can do certain \nthings very well, and we would like to be able to sell those products \nto the world. Other nations do other things very well, and we can \nbenefit from their expertise and their products. That is a win-win on a \nlevel playing field between nations that have roughly the same \nstructure of environmental laws, roughly the same structure of labor \nlaws, and roughly the same level of wages. That is a win-win for \nnations involved in agreements.\n  Indeed, our trade agreements after World War II were very much along \nthose lines as we expanded to the economies of Europe. We saw \nsubstantial prosperity that affected people throughout our economy.\n  My parents couldn't believe the difference between their experience \nas children and their experience during the 1950s and 1960s as they \nstarted to raise children in terms of going from extraordinarily humble \nmeans--lack of electricity, running water, insulation, and all the \nthings that became a part of the basic housing structure in post-World \nWar II when they were raising their children. That prosperity came from \na nation producing things and sharing the wealth throughout its \neconomy. My father was a working man, a blue-collar mechanic. He \nbrought those mechanical skills to the mill and became a millwright. He \nloved that job keeping the machinery in the mill running and loved \nother jobs. He was able to live the American dream.\n  Our recent trade deals have created something quite different. They \nhave been based on an unequal relationship. They have been based on a \nrelationship between our Nation with strong environmental and labor \nlaws and good wages and high enforcement and countries with the exact \nopposite--such as China, for example. Indeed, the result in the period \nsince NAFTA--and my colleagues spoke to it, but let me reemphasize it--\nthere has been a loss of 50,000 factories, a loss of 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs. That is logical. If you are a manufacturing company \nmaking products, you will move that manufacturing to the places where \nit is cheapest to make them.\n  This is how the vision works out. There is a conversation about \nreducing barriers, and companies say: Look at all the additional \nproducts we can sell to that emerging economy in China. We can make a \nlot more in the United States and sell to China.\n  That is stage one.\n  Stage two: Hey, now we can move our manufacturing overseas and \nproduce things at a much lower price and not only sell them to the \nforeign nation but also sell them back to the customers in the United \nStates.\n  That is exactly what we have seen, and that is why we have lost these \n5 million jobs.\n  So the initial publicity campaign is all about creating jobs through \nincreasing American manufacturing, but the reality in an unequal \nrelationship is the opposite.\n  Let's make sure we create a standard for the consideration of future \ntrade deals, a standard that will evaluate whether this deal will \ncreate good-paying jobs here in America, will expand prosperity to the \nmiddle class in America or will do the opposite. This is the standard \nwe should apply. I would like to evaluate the provisions of the \nproposed deal in that light, but I can't because the negotiations are \nsecret. The draft text is secret. We need to demand that there not be \nsecrecy about something as important as creating jobs or destroying \njobs in America--my standard for evaluating what is to come.\n  Let's talk for a minute about these eroding promises of enforcement. \nA couple of years ago a group of 10 U.S. Senators took a trip to China \nto meet with the Ambassador. We asked how the Ambassador felt about \nenforcement against China and their currency manipulation. He basically \nsaid: Here is the deal. We have broad strategic concerns that involve \nChina, and we don't want to put ripples in the water.\n  So can you really have a level playing field in a situation where you \nare not willing to enforce even the provisions that are on the books? \nCan you really have a fair deal for America?\n  During the conversations a couple years ago, I proposed legislation \nthat would require China to actually honor what it was responsible for \ndoing under the WTO. Under the WTO, it was to notify Americans about \nall the subsidies it provided for items of export, deductions and \ncredits. But China had not honored that responsibility. So I proposed \nthat we exercise another part of WTO, which was counter-notifications \nby our Trade Representative. Within 2 weeks of putting this idea \nforward, guess what. Our Trade Representative put forward a list of 200 \nsubsidies through the counter-notification process.\n  Looking at those notifications carefully revealed a vast strategy in \nrenewable energy to subsidize exports--not allowed under the WTO; to \nsubsidize paper--not allowed to subsidize exports of paper under the \nWTO. The result is that paper plants are going out of business in the \nUnited States of America. The Blue Heron plant most recently has gone \nout of business on the Willamette River at a place where paper has been \nmade for a very long period of time. In fact, the energy from the water \nwheel that was first there provided some of the first electricity in \nAmerica. Longtime industrial production, but those jobs are gone. So \nthat is a real concern.\n\n[[Page S1144]]\n\n  My colleague mentioned the interstate dispute settlement and the fact \nthat it gives a foreign investor rights that a domestic investor does \nnot have. It puts constraints on consumer protections that can be \noverrun--consumer protections done by a State can be overrun by an \ninvestor from a foreign nation.\n  For example, you have a bill in America to stop producing toxic flame \nretardants and putting them into our carpet. Well, the foreign investor \nsays: We built a plant to produce that chemical. Sorry, you can't have \nthat consumer protection even though the result would be a lot more \ncancer for American citizens. That is an example of the concerns about \nhanding over the sovereignty of our Nation, of our consumer law, our \nenvironmental law, to an independent board that operates outside of our \nconstitutional framework. That is a legitimate concern which needs to \nbe addressed in this conversation.\n  So on issues of enforcement and issues of secrecy, issues of whether \nwe are creating jobs or destroying jobs, I encourage Americans to \nbecome as familiar as possible with the provisions that have been \nleaked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and to think carefully and \ngive concerns to us here in Congress that we will work to address. When \nwe have the legitimate text before us, then we can engage in a more \ndetailed debate. But right now we need to push to end this secrecy on \nan issue that is so important to the future prosperity of our Nation \nand of our families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. It is my pleasure to yield the floor in \nanticipation of remarks from my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon.\n  I wish to start by sharing the experience I had when I first started \nrunning for the Senate and asking people around Rhode Island to give me \nthe chance to represent them here.\n  One unforgettable day was when I was walking along a factory floor \nand, as I was walking along, I looked down and I noticed there were \nholes in the concrete pad of the factory floor, and I asked: Why are \nthe holes there?\n  They explained: Oh, well, we used to have manufacturing machinery \nhere. Those are the bolt holes, and we unbolted the machinery and \nshipped it overseas to a Central American country where the same \nproduct is made for the same buyers on the same machine, but it is made \nby foreign workers.\n  That is the memory I have when I think about these trade agreements, \nand it is not just that one machine that went overseas. Rhode Island, \nnot a big State, has lost more than 50,000 good-paying manufacturing \njobs since 1990. Our State has been on the losing end of these trade \ndeals.\n  People say they are going to enforce the environmental and human \nrights and labor and safety requirements of these agreements. I have \nnot seen it. I am at the stage where I don't believe it. You will have \nto prove it to me. You will have to establish a record of enforcing \nthese things before I will believe it. I have been told that for too \nlong. I don't believe the enforcement any longer.\n  I have to say I don't like the process very much either. It is \nsecret. We are kept out of it. Who is in it are a lot of big \ncorporations, and they are up to, I think, no good in a lot of these \ndeals. Look at these private deals in private forums where they can \nlitigate against a government. They secure that right through these \ntreaty agreements. It is outrageous.\n  First of all, a lot of it is done for the sake of pollution. It is \nthe big folks, such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, Dow Chemical, and Cargill, \nthat brought nearly 600 disputes, pursuing billions of dollars in \ndamages against governments.\n  A former member of the WTO's appellate body said in 2005 the WTO \nagreements ``allow Member Nations to challenge almost any measure to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions enacted by any other Member.'' So the \nwar on the environment continues through this mechanism.\n  In March 2013, more than one-third of the disputes pending before the \nWorld Bank's investment dispute settlement tribunal were related to \noil, mining, or gas. Guess what they want. The public health around the \nworld is suffering because of this.\n  In Africa, the tobacco industry has brought these types of claims \nagainst the Governments of Gabon, Namibia, Togo, and Uganda. They \nprobably add up to about $100 billion in total GDP--all 4 countries--\nwhich is probably about a quarter of the revenues of Big Tobacco \nworldwide. So this is a question of pure, raw economic power by massive \ncorporate interests being used to make governments knuckle under on \npublic health issues such as tobacco. That is just wrong. And it can \ndisplace the regular governing systems of courts.\n  Chevron was asked to clean up contamination it left behind. It lost \nin the courts in Ecuador, it lost in the courts in America, and so it \nwent and got a third bite at the apple in front of three private \nlawyers in one of these forums.\n  Where do you think the motivation is of private lawyers? Who are \ntheir clients going to be next? Another government? I don't think so. \nIt will be the big corporate companies.\n  After many States in the United States created a ban on something \ncalled MMT, a gasoline additive, as a probable carcinogen, U.S. Ethyl \nCorporation filed a NAFTA investor-state case against Canada which then \nreversed its national ban on the potentially carcinogenic chemical.\n  They pick on themselves as well. Under NAFTA provisions, a Canadian \ncompany sued the Quebec government over a decision to put a moratorium \non fracking. I guess Quebec can't make a decision about fracking any \nlonger because some company can sue it under these agreements which \ninvolve private lawyers and were cooked up in the dark in these trade \nagreements. It is preposterous.\n  Mr. BROWN. Think about what Senator Whitehouse just said. A U.S. \ncompany that made an additive to gasoline filed suit against a public \nhealth law that the Canadian legislative body passed because they \nbelieved in clean air, and under NAFTA that company in the United \nStates sued the Canadians. The Canadian taxpayers had to pay the \ncompany and repeal their public health law.\n  I thought this was a democracy. Think about that multiplied by how \nmany times--about what Senator Warren talked about her in piece in the \nWashington Post today.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. How long is it until they sue the State of Louisiana \nor the State of Rhode Island or the State of Massachussetts or the \nState of Ohio? It is up for grabs. This is just a private remedy.\n  Since I am on Senator Warren's subject, and since her piece in the \nWashington Post is something we have all read today, I yield to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, the United States is in the final stages \nof negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive free-trade \nagreement with Mexico, Canada, Japan, Singapore, and seven other \ncountries.\n  I come to the floor today to ask a fundamental question: Who will \nbenefit from the TPP? American workers, consumers, small businesses, \ntaxpayers, or the biggest national corporations in the world?\n  One strong hint is buried down in the fine print of the closely \nguarded draft. The provision, an increasingly common feature of \ninternational trade agreements, is called investor-state dispute \nsettlement, or ISDS. The name may sound mild, but this provision \nfundamentally tilts the playing field further in favor of big \nmultinational corporations. Worse yet, it undermines U.S. sovereignty.\n  ISDS allows foreign companies to challenge American laws and \npotentially pick up huge payouts from taxpayers without ever stepping \nfoot in an American court.\n  Here is how it works. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic \nchemical that is often added to gasoline. We ban it because we believe \nit is dangerous for people's health or harmful to the environment. If a \nforeign company that makes this toxic chemical wants to sell it in the \nUnited States, it would normally have to challenge that in a U.S. \ncourt. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. court and go \nbefore an international panel of arbitrators. If the company wins, the \nruling cannot be challenged in U.S.\n\n[[Page S1145]]\n\ncourts, and the arbitration panel could require the American taxpayers \nto cough up millions, even billions, of dollars in damages.\n  ISDS has the power to impose gigantic fines, but it doesn't have \nindependent judges. Instead, highly paid corporate lawyers go back and \nforth between representing corporations one day and sitting in judgment \nof corporations the next day.\n  Now I don't know, maybe that makes sense in an arbitration between \ntwo corporations, but not in cases between corporations and \ngovernments. We should have real doubts about how likely it is that a \nlawyer looking to attract high-paying corporate clients will rule \nagainst those corporations when it is his or her turn to sit in the \njudge's seat.\n  It is also a real problem that only international investors--only \ninternational investors--get to use these courts, investors that are, \nby and large, large corporations.\n  If a Vietnamese company with American operations wants to challenge \nan increase in the U.S. minimum wage, it can use ISDS, but if an \nAmerican labor union believes the Vietnamese companies are paying slave \nlabor wages in violation of trade commitments, the union has to try to \nwind itself through the Vietnamese courts. Good luck with that.\n  These rigged pseudocourts were created after World War II because \ninvestors worried about putting money into developing countries where \nthe legal systems were not as dependable. They were concerned that a \ncorporation might build a plant today only to watch a dictator \nconfiscate it tomorrow. ISDS was born to encourage foreign investment \nin countries with weak legal systems.\n  Now, look, I don't know if these justifications made sense back then, \nbut they sure don't make sense now. Countries in the TPP are hardly \nemerging economies with weak legal systems. Australia and Japan have \nwell-developed and well-respected legal systems, and multinational \ncorporations navigate those legal systems every single day, but ISDS \nwould preempt their courts too. And to the extent there are countries \nthat are riskier politically, market competition can solve that \nproblem.\n  Countries that respect property rights and the rule of law, such as \nthe United States, should be more competitive. If a company wants to \ninvest in a country with a weak legal system, then it should buy \npolitical risk insurance, which is available.\n  The use of ISDS is on the rise. From 1959 to 2002, there were fewer \nthan 100 ISDS claims worldwide, but by 2012 alone, there were 58 cases. \nThat was in 1 year.\n  Here are some examples of recent cases under various treaties with \nISDS provisions:\n  A French company sued Egypt because Egypt raised its minimum wage.\n  A Swedish company sued Germany because Germany decided to phase out \nnuclear power after the Fukushima disaster.\n  A Dutch company sued the Czech Republic because the Czech Republic \ndidn't bail out a bank the Dutch company partially owned.\n  American corporations are getting in on the action too. Philip Morris \nis trying to use ISDS to stop Uruguay from implementing new tobacco \nregulations aimed at cutting domestic smoking rates.\n  ISDS advocates point out that so far this process has not hurt the \nUnited States. Our negotiators, who refuse to make the text of this \ntrade agreement public, claim it will include a bigger, better version \nof ISDS that will protect our ability to regulate in the public \ninterest.\n  But with ISDS cases exploding in the last several years and more and \nmore multinational corporations headquartered abroad, it is only a \nmatter of time before such a challenge does serious damage here. \nLetting a panel of arbitrators replace the U.S. legal system with a \ncomplex and unnecessary alternative on the assumption that nothing \ncould possibly go wrong seems like a really bad idea.\n  This is not a partisan issue. I don't often agree with the \nconservative Cato Institute, and I suspect they don't often agree with \nme, but this morning the head of Cato's trade policy program said that \nISDS ``raises serious questions about democratic accountability, \nsovereignty, checks and balances, and the separation of power.'' He \nwent on to say that these concerns about ISDS are ``one[s] that \nlibertarians and other free market advocates should share.'' I think \nthat is right.\n  Conservatives who believe in American sovereignty are outraged that \nISDS shifts power from American courts as envisioned by our \nConstitution to unaccountable international tribunals. Libertarians are \noffended that ISDS effectively offers a free taxpayer subsidy to \ncountries with weaker legal systems, and progressives should oppose \nISDS because it allows big multinationals to weaken labor and \nenvironmental rules.\n  Giving foreign corporations special rights to challenge our laws \noutside of our legal system is a bad deal. So long as TPP includes \ninvestor-state dispute settlement, the only winners will be \ninternational corporations.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Brown for putting this \ngroup together to discuss the important trade issues facing our Nation.\n  In Massachusetts, we know what a good trade deal looks like and what \na bad trade deal looks like. Remember, we are the ones that traded Babe \nRuth, so we know a bad trade deal when we see one. Right now in \nMassachusetts, we are seeing the United States negotiate two \nsignificant agreements--the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Asia and the \nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership in Europe.\n  Both of these agreements would establish binding rules on a wide \nrange of issues, such as labor rights, energy, the environment, \nmedicine pricing, patents, Internet freedom, and innovation. The scope \ngoes far beyond the previous trade deals that focused on tariffs or \naccess to markets.\n  These trade deals need to meet several criteria in order to be \nacceptable:\n  No. 1, workers rights. It is critically important that both trade \ndeals protect workers rights. When we put goods on a ship, we can't do \nit by casting off workers rights. These deals need to benefit the \nmiddle class in our country and protect the rights of workers of our \ntrading partners. They must also have robust and fully enforceable \nlabor provisions that ensure compliance with international core labor \nstandards.\n  No. 2, protect our environment. If companies want to make more green, \ngreat, but they have to be green, too, and follow the environmental \nlaws to protect our resources and our planet. Both trade deals must \ninclude new and robust commitments from member countries to protect and \nconserve forests, oceans, wildlife, and obligate member companies to \ncomply with both domestic environmental laws and meet their commitments \nunder multilateral environmental agreements. These commitments must be \nstrong and binding and enforceable.\n\n  No. 3, don't export our oil. Longstanding U.S. law prohibits the \nexport of crude oil except in instances in which the President \ndetermines that exports are consistent with the national interests. \nThere should not be any language in the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nagreement requiring the United States to automatically approve exports \nof oil without such a determination. We shouldn't be sending oil abroad \neven as we send young men and women in the military to dangerous \nregions of the world to protect oil shipments coming into our country. \nWe still import 5 million barrels of oil a day. We are the largest \nimporter in the world. We should not be exporting oil.\n  No. 4, no fishy stuff. The Trans-Pacific Partnership should eliminate \nharmful fishery subsidies. It should maintain the ability of \ngovernments to support conservation of ocean resources, promote \nsustainable development and viable fishing industries and the coastal \ncommunities that depend on them, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nshould include strong measures that address illegal fishing.\n  No. 5, don't try to sneak through bad sneaker deals. It is my \nunderstanding that the current Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement \nincludes a provision that eliminates all trade barriers for sneakers \nand shoes. This provision would endanger more than 1,350 critical\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nmanufacturing jobs at the New Balance facilities in Massachusetts and \nMaine. New Balance has decided to keep its manufacturing in the United \nStates, despite economic pressures and additional costs. As the last \nremaining U.S. manufacturer of running shoes, New Balance already has \nsmaller profit margins on the U.S.-made shoes than most of its \ncompetitors have on their imported shoes. They should be congratulated \nfor making a commitment to American workers, but if the TPP agreement \nis passed by the Congress in its current form, we will not be making \nthat same commitment and that is because New Balance will be forced to \nimmediately compete with Vietnam running shoe companies which have a \ndramatic advantage with low hourly wages and subsidized businesses. \nThose 1,350 jobs might be lost. That is wrong, and we must do better \nfor our manufacturers.\n  No. 6, don't go around the U.S. courts. Both the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership have \nprovisions to allow other countries to take legal action if they do not \nlike the decisions made by our government and do it outside of our own \ncourts. These separate panels could subject American taxpayers to \nbillions in taxes, and when they have a problem with decisions in other \ncountries, we will have to argue in an independent court or even in \ntheir home country courts. This double standard is wrong and it should \nnot be included. We need trade deals that don't ship workers' rights \noverseas along with their jobs. We need trade deals that don't cloud \nour skies with more pollution or plunder our seas with illegal fishing. \nWe need trade deals that keep our oil and manufacturing jobs here at \nhome. We need trade deals that don't outsource justice or jobs \noverseas.\n  That is why we need to make sure, just as when Babe Ruth was traded, \nthat we don't put a curse on our own economy by passing trade bills \nthat do not protect the American worker.\n  Finally, I understand my good friend from Oklahoma Senator Inhofe \ncame to the floor to argue that the existence of winter disproves \nglobal warming. I know some in my home State of Massachusetts might be \nthinking the same thought right now, because after the first snowstorm \npeople look for a good place to sled. After the second snowstorm, \npeople look for a place to pile the snow. After the third and fourth \nsnowstorms, people stop looking for things to do and just start asking, \nWhy? Why so much snow? Why such intense storms? Why won't it stop?\n  What if I told my colleagues that it was all part of climate change; \nthat the winters we have known have now been supercharged by warmer \nwaters and stronger storms; that the carbon pollution that is making \nour summers hotter is also making our winters more unpredictable.\n  Here are three facts I want my colleagues to know.\n  No. 1, the waters off Massachusetts--and indeed up and down the \nAtlantic coast--have been at record warm levels; in one case, off Cape \nCod, 21 degrees warmer than normal. Warmer water gives storms more \nmoisture. That moisture has to drop at some point, and when it does, it \nmeans more snow. That is what is going on.\n  No. 2, cold air is part of winter. We are New England, after all. But \nnew research is suggesting that the melting of the Arctic icecap is \ncausing more of those polar vortex situations that send frigid air \nrushing down to Canada and then down to us. That is global warming.\n  No. 3, more intense precipitation events have increased by 71 percent \nin New England since 1958--71 percent more intense precipitation. \nSupercharged storms from climate change are a little like Rob \nGronkowski. They are bigger, they are stronger, and whether they spike \nthe ball or drop their snow, it is going to come down harder--a lot \nharder.\n  Across the globe temperatures are going up. It is called global \nwarming. This last year was the warmest on record across the globe. A \nfew weeks of cold in one place does not mean global warming isn't \nhappening. That is the difference between weather and climate. Global \nwarming does not cancel the seasons. We will still have winter. \nSometimes it will be still very cold, but overall it is going to be \nwarmer--a lot warmer. When warmer water makes more moisture and it goes \ninto the clouds, it has to come down, and when it does and it is cold, \nit should be no surprise that we will get more snow. If there is one \nissue we can all agree on regarding the climate, it is that every \nperson in Massachusetts would rather be in Florida at Red Sox spring \ntraining camp right now because this snow is still coming down. But it \nis not just weather, it is climate change as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me congratulate and applaud Senator \nBrown of Ohio for organizing this colloquy on trade. In my view, if we \nlook at why the middle class of this country has been in decline for \nthe last 40 years, why millions of Americans are working longer hours \nwith lower wages, why we have seen a huge shift in the economy from a \nmanufacturing economy where people earn good wages to a Walmart economy \nwhere people are working for very low wages and minimal benefits, one--\nnot the only one, but one of the significant factors has been our \ndisastrous trade policies for a number of decades.\n  If people are watching this discussion, there may be some people who \nwill say, Trans-Pacific Partnership, what is that? What is that trade \nagreement? What are they talking about? One of the reasons they may ask \nthat question is that a study came out recently which looked at how the \nmajor networks are covering the TPP--the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It \nturns out the major television networks are not covering the TPP. \nIncredible as it may sound, this trade agreement--the largest trade \nagreement in the history of the United States of America--has received \nvirtually no coverage--no coverage--on the major networks. That, to me, \nis very amazing.\n  I think it was Albert Einstein who made the point that doing the same \nthing over and over again and expecting different results is sometimes \ncalled insanity. If we think a new trade agreement, based on the same \nprinciples of the old trade agreements, is going to bring different \nresults, I think we are very wrong.\n  I remember, because I have been in Congress for many of the major \ndebates on trade, that way back when we had a discussion about \nunfettered free trade with China and the argument was, well, look at \nthe huge market in China, look at all the jobs we will create in \nAmerica selling to China. In fact, we were told that permanent normal \ntrade relations with China would create hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs. Well, not quite. It turns out, as everybody who goes \ninto a department store knows, most of the products we buy are made in \nChina, and it turns out the permanent normal trade relations trade \nagreement with China has led to the loss of more than 3 million good-\npaying American jobs. The reason for that is obvious. Why is a major \ncorporation going to pay an American worker $15, $20 an hour, provide \ndecent benefits, and obey environmental laws when that corporation can \nshut down here, go to China, pay people very low wages, and bring their \nproducts back to America? That is why, when we go shopping, most of \nwhat we buy is made in China.\n  We were told that the North American Free Trade Agreement--NAFTA--\nwould create at least 200,000 American jobs in just a few years. Well, \nnot quite. It turns out that NAFTA has led to the loss of about 1 \nmillion American jobs.\n  We were told that the Korean Free Trade Agreement would increase \nAmerican jobs. Well, it turns out that it has led to the loss of over \n60,000 American jobs.\n  Since we signed NAFTA, the United States has a cumulative trade \ndeficit of $8.8 trillion--$8.8 trillion. That is wealth that has left \nthe United States and gone overseas.\n  While the full text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership has not been \nmade public, there have been some leaks of what is included in it, and \nwhat these leaks tell us is in fact very disturbing. I think it is \nobvious to anyone who has taken a look at this issue that the TPP is \njust a new, easy way for corporations to shut down in America and to \nsend jobs abroad. It is estimated the United States would lose more \nthan 130,000 jobs to Vietnam and Japan alone if the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership goes into effect. The reason for that is, when we\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\nare dealing with a country such as Vietnam, my understanding is the \nminimum wage there is 56 cents an hour--56 cents an hour. Maybe I am \nold-fashioned, but I don't think American workers should be forced to \ncompete against people who are working for 56 cents an hour.\n  At a time when corporations have already outsourced over 3 million \nservice sector jobs in the United States, the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nincludes rules that will make it easier for corporate America to \noutsource call centers, computer programming, engineering, accounting, \nand medical diagnostic drugs. Under the TPP, Vietnamese companies will \nbe able to compete with American companies for Federal contracts funded \nby U.S. taxpayers, undermining ``Buy American'' laws.\n  If the United States is to remain a major industrial power, producing \nreal products and creating good-paying jobs, we must develop a new set \nof trade policies which work for the ordinary American worker and not \nfor large corporations and big campaign donors.\n  Let me be very frank as an Independent. This is not just the \nRepublicans who have been supporting these unfettered free-trade \nagreements; there have been Democratic Presidents as well. Corporate \nAmerica has said we want these trade policies, and the leaders of both \npolitical parties have said, yes, that is what we will do. But I think \nit is time to stand up and say enough is enough.\n  This country now is in a major race to the bottom. Workers are \nworking longer hours for lower wages. No American worker should be \nforced to compete against desperate people around the world who are \nmaking pennies an hour. Corporate America, every night on television in \nevery ad we see, tells us buy this product, buy that product. Well, you \nknow what. If they want us to buy these products, maybe it is high time \nthey started manufacturing those products in the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  I am opposed to the TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. \nThat is my view, but I would hope every Member is opposed to the fast-\ntrack process which gives the authority to negotiate these agreements \nin the final terms. That is because nobody has had the opportunity to \neven see what is in the proposed agreement right now. Transparency has \nbeen minimal, absolutely minimal.\n  I think if we are serious about creating decent-paying jobs in this \ncountry, if we are serious about raising wages, if we are serious about \ndealing with the other issues that have surfaced in terms of \nsovereignty, the idea we would make it easier for tobacco companies to \nsell their deadly products to children around the world and make it \nharder for governments to protect the health of their citizens is an \nabsolute outrage. It is an outrage.\n  I again thank Senator Brown for helping to organize this event. I \nhope the American people stand and tell the Congress enough is enough. \nWe need to create decent-paying jobs in this country for a change and \nnot just in other countries around the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, as President Obama has noted in his State \nof the Union, the American economy is growing again. We are creating \njobs at the fastest pace since 1999, and unemployment is lower than \nbefore the financial crisis. American businesses are posting large \nprofits and boosting the stock market along with them.\n  Yet for many working Americans, this good news is only that, news--\nsomething they see in the paper or on TV, not in their paychecks or at \nthe kitchen table. Many of the Wisconsin workers I hear from every day \nare struggling to make ends meet. They are working more, taking home \nless, and worried that for the first time in American history their \nkids will have fewer opportunities than they did.\n  For the last 5 years the Obama administration has been negotiating \nwith 11 nations in the Asia-Pacific region on a free-trade agreement \nknown as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some of these countries have \nvalues similar to ours and some do not. I fear this agreement could \nallow some nations to take advantage of the values we as Americans \nplace on our environment, on labor laws, on human rights, and on free \nenterprise rules. These nations would be competing against American \nworkers on an uneven playing field. This unfair game would continue the \ndownward pressure on wages that has plagued American workers since \nbefore NAFTA.\n  The interests of Wisconsin workers are being represented in these \nnegotiations by unelected officials in the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. I am here to let these negotiators know that \nWisconsinites don't want more of the same failed promises from free-\ntrade deals.\n  Wisconsin workers make things. We have been one of the top \nmanufacturing States for generations. If we hope to continue making \nthings, we think we should continue to have our own government as a \ncustomer. That is why I have been a big and strong supporter of ``Buy \nAmerican'' provisions that require Federal agencies that use taxpayer \ndollars to purchase American-made products.\n  Free-trade agreements have historically allowed foreign nations too \nmuch leeway when bidding for our government projects and contracts, \nwhile not affording American companies that fair access, that same \naccess. I have asked the GAO to study this and report back to Congress \nso we can know the effect skirting ``Buy American'' laws have and the \ncost it has to American manufacturers.\n  Currencies that reflect their true value are also vital to the \nconduct of global trade. When foreign countries cheat by manipulating \ntheir currencies to price their goods cheaper, Wisconsin workers--in \nfact all American workers--lose.\n  Seven years ago, then-Senator Obama, speaking about the Bush \nadministration's inaction on currency manipulation said it best:\n\n       Refusing to acknowledge this problem will not make it go \n     away. . . . The Administration's refusal to take strong \n     action against China's currency manipulation will also make \n     it more difficult to obtain congressional approval for \n     renewed Trade Promotion Authority, as well as additional \n     trade agreements.\n\n  That statement is as true today with the Obama administration as it \nwas with the Bush administration. Currency manipulation is essentially \ncheating. That is why I support including strong and enforceable \ncurrency manipulation provisions in any trade agreement. Without these \nrules, we will allow countries to engage in a race to the bottom that \nleaves everybody worse off.\n  One of the things that has made America great is our entrepreneurial \nspirit. This spirit has attracted immigrant entrepreneurs from all over \nthe world, but all too often I hear from Wisconsin businesses whose \npatented ideas are being stolen and replicated in Asia.\n  I believe any agreement must include high standards for protecting \nintellectual property to encourage risk-taking investments that turn \ninto profitable companies and jobs in the United States. In the same \nway, I believe our ideas should be protected, I also believe that what \nwe call our foods should be protected from foreign interference.\n  Let me explain what I mean by that. In fact, the European Union has \nsought to restrict the use of cheese, meat, and alcohol names that \nAmerican producers have used for generations. For instance, cheese \nproducers in Wisconsin would not able to call their cheese ``feta'' \nbecause it is not made in Greece, while a brewer in Wisconsin couldn't \nlabel his dark beer a ``Bavarian Black'' because it isn't made in \nBavaria, in Germany.\n  I have worked hard to urge the U.S. Trade Representative to reject \nany attempt by the European Union or any foreign nation to restrict the \nuse of common food names in order to protect our food manufacturers and \nprocessors across this country--and especially as Wisconsin is a major \nproducer of beer and brats and cheese, this is an issue that is very \nclose to home.\n  Finally, I have concerns about the value systems of some of the \nnations that are party to the TPP. By way of example, Brunei recently \nadopted new sharia laws that include death by stoning for acts of \nadultery, homosexuality, and forced amputations for other offenses, \nincluding consuming alcohol. These laws go so far as to outlaw\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\npublic Christmas celebrations. In fact, the act of wearing a Santa \nClaus hat in public could lead to a fine of more than $15,000, a 5-year \nimprisonment sentence or both.\n  Amnesty International has called the new rules in Brunei \n``shocking.'' They have been declared illegal by the U.N. High \nCommissioner For Human Rights. We should not be affording our highest \ntrading privileges to nations that do not value basic human rights.\n  I have heard from so many constituents who are rightly skeptical of \nthe promises this new generation of trade agreements offer. I \nappreciate having this opportunity to express my concerns about free-\ntrade agreements that are currently under negotiation. After seeing \ndecades of jobs going overseas while the ones that are left pay less, \nwho can blame the critics? Until it is clear to me that the gains from \nthese agreements will go to the middle class and not just multinational \ncorporations, millionaires or billionaires, I will continue to oppose \nthem.\n  I thank my colleagues for organizing this opportunity to speak on \ntrade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the historic vote \nthe FCC took today to preserve Net neutrality and maintain a free and \nopen Internet. But before I turn to that exciting news, I want to take \njust a moment to talk about the urgent need to pass funding for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  The Republican leadership has wasted a lot of time over the past \nmonth politicizing this issue, and now we find ourselves on the brink \nof a completely preventable shutdown of DHS. I think every American \nagrees that funding for Homeland Security is too important to play \npolitics with. Last year Democrats and Republicans came together and \npassed a clean bill to fund the Department for a full year, and we \nshould do the same this year. I am pleased the Senate Republicans have \nagreed to take up a clean funding bill, and I hope the House \nRepublicans will quickly do the same.\n\n\n                             Net Neutrality\n\n  Turning to today's good news, I am thrilled to report that this \nmorning the Federal Communications Commission voted to adopt new rules \nto preserve a free and open Internet. This is a big win for the 280 \nmillion Americans who use the Internet. I want to congratulate FCC \nChairman Tom Wheeler and thank him for his leadership on Net \nneutrality.\n  The FCC has taken a crucial step to ensure that the Internet remains \nthe platform for free expression, innovation, investment, and economic \ngrowth that it has always been. The new rules will offer meaningful \nprotections for all Internet users. They promise to preserve the \nInternet's status as an open marketplace, a place where everyone can \nparticipate on equal footing, free from discrimination by broadband \nproviders--the companies such as Comcast, Verizon, and AT that \nprovide consumers with access to the Internet.\n  That is what Net neutrality is all about. Net neutrality isn't some \nradical new idea. It is the simple and longstanding principle that all \nlawful content on the Internet should receive equal treatment from \nbroadband Internet service providers, regardless of who owns the \ncontent or how much money he or she has in the bank. It means broadband \nproviders can't pick and choose which Internet traffic reaches \nconsumers and which doesn't. This idea has been part of the \narchitecture of the Internet from its very start.\n  Because of Net neutrality, an email from my constituent in rural \nMinnesota reaches me as quickly as an email from my bank. Because of \nNet neutrality, the Web site for my local pizzeria loads as quickly as \nthe Web site for a national chain. Because of Net neutrality I can \nstream videos of my amazingly cute grandson just as easily I can stream \na hit TV show, and he is amazingly cute. It is because of Net \nneutrality that companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and YouTube are \nhousehold names. Once startups, these are now billion-dollar companies \nemploying thousands. Net neutrality gave them the chance to compete on \na level playing field. Their success is a testament to both American \ninnovation and the power of a free and open Internet.\n  For me, the bottom line is this. The Internet is a vital part of our \ndaily lives. Net neutrality is at the core of how the Internet \noperates. It is critical to our democracy and to our economy that it \ncontinue to operate in this manner. All of the amazing innovation and \ngrowth on the Internet did not just happen while we had Net neutrality; \nit happened because of Net neutrality.\n  This is not the first time the FCC has sought to protect Net \nneutrality. Twice before they have tried to implement rules which were \nthen challenged by the big broadband providers and basically struck \ndown by the DC Circuit. It was not that the Court thought that the \nrules were bad policy, but rather that the FCC had not invoked the \nproper legal basis.\n  Since the second court decision last year, we have seen a lot of \ndebate about what the FCC should do. Many of us have called for \nstronger rules. We have argued that those rules must be grounded in the \nFCC's authority under title II of the Communications Act if they are \ngoing to survive judicial scrutiny and withstand the test of time.\n  Of course, the big broadband providers pushed for the FCC to move in \nthe opposite direction, to take a weaker approach. Why? Well, without \nNet neutrality they stood to make a ton of extra money. These guys \nwanted the FCC to allow them to charge Web sites access to fast lanes \nto reach consumers. Then only those sites that could afford to pay \nwould see their content delivered at the fastest speed ever. Everyone \nelse would be relegated to a slow lane. Only those with very deep \npockets would be able to afford to pay for the fast lanes, and the \nbroadband providers would have profited at the expense of everybody \nelse.\n  I fiercely opposed this. Millions and millions of my fellow Americans \ndid too. Consumers and business owners spoke out and urged the FCC to \nadopt rules that would protect--not destroy--Net neutrality.\n  They made the case for Net neutrality in clear and compelling terms, \narguing that strong rules are essential for the future of the Internet. \nWith today's vote, the FCC has provided those much-needed rules. The \nnew rules are strong, clear, and enforceable. They will prevent \nbroadband providers from blocking or throttling lawful online content.\n  The rules will stop providers from charging Web sites for access to \nfast lanes. The FCC is implementing these rules within a time-tested \nlegal framework that will allow the agency to respond to challenges to \nNet neutrality that arise in the future. Following the commonsense path \nthat I and a number of my colleagues have long urged, the FCC has \nrecognized that broadband Internet access is a title II service, a \ntelecommunications service.\n  Last spring, I could not have predicted that we would be celebrating \nthis victory today. The best principles of our democracy have won out. \nIt is clear that the voices of the American people have been heard. I \nhave often called Net neutrality the free speech issue of our time. I \nbelieve that exercising our free speech right has been key to our \nsuccess and will continue to be the key to our success.\n  Today does not mark the end of our work--the work of all Net \nneutrality supporters to safeguard our free and open Internet. Some of \nmy Republican colleagues have decried the very idea of Net neutrality. \nMore recently others have purported to embrace the concept but at the \nsame time have tried to stop the FCC from taking meaningful action.\n  My friend Senator John Thune has drafted legislation that would strip \nthe FCC of authority to regulate access to broadband Internet services. \nAlong with many of my colleagues, I made clear that I regard this as a \nnonstarter. In the weeks and months ahead, I and other Net neutrality \nsupporters will need to continue to speak out, to make sure everyone \nunderstands what is at stake, why we stand by the strong rules adopted \nby the FCC and why we oppose efforts to strip the FCC of its authority \nor to weaken Net neutrality protections.\n  This will take a lot of hard work. Some folks really just do not get \nit. Back in November, my friend Senator Ted Cruz referred to Net \nneutrality as ``ObamaCare for the Internet.'' It was a statement that \nseemed to demonstrate just a basic misunderstanding of what\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\nNet neutrality is and how the Internet works. For that matter, tens of \nthousands have seen a YouTube video of Senator Cruz attacking FCC \nefforts to protect Net neutrality.\n  I will just pause to note that the video reached many viewers, and \nthe reason it did was that it was uploaded to YouTube, a site that \nwould not have flourished were it not for Net neutrality. It was \nbecause of Net neutrality that YouTube, a company founded by three guys \nin an office over a pizzeria in San Mateo, CA, was able to compete \nagainst and ultimately overtake the well-funded competitor, Google \nVideo.\n  In his video Senator Cruz compared an old rotary phone to a modern \ncell phone. He claimed that the landline was an example of stagnation \ndue to FCC regulation under title II, while cell phone innovation was a \nproduct of noninvolvement by the government.\n  The attempted comparison fails for many reasons, not least because \nthe telephone services on cell phones have long been subject to title \nII. In fact, the FCC is taking the same kind of approach to applying \ntitle II to broadband access services as they have taken in applying it \nto mobile voice services, where I think we all agree there has been \nrobust investment and innovation under title II.\n  In the coming months, I expect that we are going to confront a lot of \nthis kind of confusion and misinformation or disinformation. We are \ngoing to encounter plenty of people who oppose Net neutrality because \nthey do not understand how the Internet works or do not understand the \nrelevant legal authorities or, frankly, are willing to personally \nobfuscate to advance their own agenda. I hope the American people will \nremain engaged on this issue, that they remain willing to speak up, to \nuse the Internet to spread solid information, to organize support, and \nultimately to counter the deep-pocketed ISPs and the politicians who \nmay seek to undermine Net neutrality.\n  I do believe that with the same energy and determination that has \ngotten us this far, Net neutrality supporters can make today's historic \nvote a lasting win for the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I will yield the floor when the next \nspeaker comes. But while we have a quiet moment, I just want to \ncomplete my remarks related to the Senator from Oklahoma and his \nsnowball.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show the Earth-Now Web site on the iPad \ndevice that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If you go to Earth-Now, it is actually quite easy to \nload. You can see how that polar vortex measurably brings the cold air \ndown to New England. If you do not want--this is produced by NASA. \nThese are pretty serious people. So you can believe NASA and you can \nbelieve what their satellites measure on the planet or you can believe \nthe Senator with the snowball.\n  The U.S. Navy takes this very seriously, to the point where Admiral \nLocklear, who is the head of the Pacific Command, has said that climate \nchange is the biggest threat that we face in the Pacific. He is a \ncareer military officer, and he is deadly serious. You can either \nbelieve the U.S. Navy or you can believe the Senator with the snowball.\n  The religious and faith groups are very clear on this, by and large. \nI would particularly salute the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nwhich has made very, very clear strong statements. We are going to hear \nmore from Pope Francis about this when he releases his encyclical and \nwhen he speaks to the joint session of Congress on September 24.\n  I think it will be quite clear that you can either believe the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops and Pope Francis or you can belief the \nSenator with the snowball.\n  In corporate America there is an immense array of major, significant, \nintelligent, and responsible corporations that are very clear that \nclimate change is real. They are companies such as Coke and Pepsi; \ncompanies such as Ford, GM, and Caterpillar; companies such as Walmart \nand Target; companies such as VF Industries, which makes a wide array \nof clothing products; Nike; companies such as Mars and Nestle.\n  So, we have our choice. We can believe Coke and Pepsi and Ford and GM \nand Walmart and Target and VF Industries and Nike and Mars and Nestle; \nor we can believe the Senator with the snowball.\n  Every major American scientific society has put itself on record--\nmany of them a decade ago--that climate change is deadly real. They \nmeasure it. They see it. They know why it happens. The predictions \ncorrelate with what we see, as they increasingly come true. The \nfundamental principles--that it is derived from carbon pollution, which \ncomes from burning fossil fuels--are beyond legitimate dispute to the \npoint where the leading scientific organizations on the planet calls \nthem ``unequivocal.''\n  So you can believe every single major American scientific society or \nyou can believe the Senator with the snowball.\n  I would submit the following. I would submit that, if you looked at \nthe American population and you removed the conspiracy theorists--there \nare always conspiracy theorists in the American population that come \nout and deny that the moon landing was real. They have their hobgoblins \nfrom time to time. If you remove the conspiracy theorists--and there \nare people who simply do not accept a lot of scientific truths. They \nthink the Earth is only 6,000 years old. They deny that evolution is \nreal. Fine, they are entitled to that point of view. But it is not one \nyou would want to make much of a bet on. It is not a point of view that \nis likely to get, for instance, a rover onto the surface of Mars and \ndriven around successfully by scientists. But if people want to have \nthat point of view, they have the right to do it. I just would not put \nvery many bets on how productive that point of view is when you are \ntrying to accomplish something important.\n  Also, remove the people who have financial ties to the fossil fuel \nindustry. So take out the conspiracy theorists, take out the evolution \ndeniers, take out the people who have a financial tie to the fossil \nfuel industry, and I would be very surprised if you found virtually \nanybody left who was not prepared to be responsible about climate \nchange.\n  Too many of us see it happening right in front of our faces. The \nscience has been too clear for too long. Frankly, what we are seeing is \nthe rollout of the famous tobacco strategy to delay and deny the day of \nreckoning because they are making money selling tobacco in the meantime \nwhile they create false doubt about the damage their product is doing.\n\n  Now is an interesting time for that because in Washington, at the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District, we just had oral argument on \nthe enforcement of a decision rendered by a U.S. district judge finding \nthat that tobacco scam--the deliberate pattern of lies by the tobacco \nindustry to convince people tobacco really wasn't responsible for \ncancer and other ill health effects--that that campaign was a civil \nracketeering conspiracy. That is the law of the United States of \nAmerica. I would submit that if we look at the civil racketeering \nconspiracy that the tobacco industry ran, that has been called out by a \ncourt of law, and we compare that to what the polluters are saying \nabout climate change, we will see more similarities than differences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Remembering Mike Perry\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear friend whom \nwe have just lost in West Virginia, Mr. Mike Perry. He was a beloved \ncommunity leader, a dear friend to all of us, and truly an inspiring \nWest Virginian.\n  Mike was a native of Huntington, WV, which is located in beautiful \nCabell County. He was a tireless champion for his community, for \nMarshall University, and for the entire State of West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\n  Upon graduating from Marshall University in 1958, Mike attended WVU \nSchool of Law and graduated first in his class. He then spent 20 years \nas a dedicated lawyer with the firm of Huddleston Bolen in his hometown \nof Huntington, becoming partner after only 5 short years. In 1981 he \nentered the banking business and was chairman of the board and CEO of \nthe First Huntington National Bank until his retirement in 2001.\n  Mike never failed to give back to the Huntington community that he \nloved, which had rewarded him with so much throughout the years--an \neducation, endless opportunities to make a successful life for himself \nand his family, and a truly special place he could always call home.\n  He served as interim president of Marshall University in 1999, \ndonating his entire salary to the university's general scholarship \nfund. His performance at the university was so highly regarded that the \nboard of trustees voted to remove the word ``interim'' from his title \nwhen listing Marshall's presidents.\n  Mike woke up every day aspiring to make his community an even better \nplace to work and live and consistently encouraged others to do the \nsame.\n  Throughout the years he was a great confidant of mine. I enjoyed \nspeaking to Mike on countless occasions on an array of issues, ranging \nfrom worldly national and State policies to very localized matters \nconcerning beautiful Cabell County.\n  Remarkably, despite battling cancer for 1\\1/2\\ years, Mike never \nstopped working on community projects. He served on countless boards \nthroughout the tristate area, including those for the Huntington Area \nDevelopment Council, the Tri-State Airport Authority, and St. Mary's \nMedical Center, among many others.\n  Above all, he was a dedicated family man who was truly devoted to his \nwife Henriella, his three children, and his eight grandchildren. Mike \nmet Henriella in the fifth grade, and he was certain then that he had \nmet the girl of his dreams. He knew even as a youngster that they would \nspend the rest of their lives together. The two married in 1958, and I \nthink Mike would agree that Henriella always brought out the best in \nhim and made him a better man.\n  Together, the Perrys moved to Harveytown in 1973, which was the \nfuture Heritage Farm Museum and Village. They transported old log \nstructures and began reassembling buildings and accumulating a unique \ncollection of antiques. Today the farm consists of five houses, a zoo, \na church, and several buildings that showcase rich Appalachian \nheritage.\n  In 2010 both Mike and Henriella were honored with the Donald R. Myers \nHumanitarian Award, which recognizes individuals who have enriched \nAppalachia through their extensive leadership and community service \nendeavors.\n  Heritage Farm Museum and Village has become a true mainstay within \nWest Virginia and will forever serve as a reminder of a man who lived \nto make his community and the Mountain State a better place, a man who \nwas an inspiring leader, a selfless friend, a loving husband, father, \ngrandfather, and so much more. He was a friend to all, and I personally \nwill always value his friendship and his guidance, as will everybody \nwho ever came in contact with Mike Perry.\n  So I say farewell to my dear friend and God bless to the State of \nWest Virginia and the Perry family.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan).

Mr. President, on Tuesday of next week, Israeli Prime \nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu will make an historic address before the \nCongress. This is his third address as Prime Minister of Israel. At the \ninvitation of Speaker Boehner, he is coming to discuss Iran's nuclear \nambitions and the ongoing P5+1 negotiations, as well as the rise of the \nIslamic State terrorist group and other jihadist groups across the \nMiddle East.\n  These are obviously serious issues of national security, both for \nIsrael but also for us here in the United States, and Prime Minister \nNetanyahu and the citizens of Israel have a unique perspective on those \nissues. In the interest of staying fully informed and aligned with our \nclosest ally in the region, Israel, Congress needs to listen to what \nPrime Minister Netanyahu has to say, and I look forward to doing so.\n\n  I believe the Prime Minister's speech will be both informative and \ntimely, as the Obama administration is reportedly trying to lock down a \nquestionable nuclear deal with the Iranians by the March 24 deadline.\n  That is why I have introduced S. Res. 76 that welcomes the Prime \nMinister of Israel to the United States for his address to Congress. \nThis resolution explains just a few of the reasons why the U.S.-Israel \nalliance is so powerful and so enduring, and it states in part that we \nwelcome the Prime Minister and eagerly await his address before \nCongress. This resolution reaffirms our commitment to stand with Israel \nin times of uncertainty, strongly supports Israel's right to self-\ndefense, and finally reaffirms our support and the friendship between \nour two countries. These sentiments are widely shared in Congress, but \nin an increasingly perilous global security environment in which we \nfind ourselves, I think it is important to remind people of how and why \nthe United States stands with Israel.\n  A majority of Senators have cosponsored this resolution, and I \nbelieve today it is time for the Senate to pass it, to reaffirm there \nwill be no daylight between the United States and Israel when it comes \nto common issues of national security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Foreign \nRelations be discharged from further consideration of and the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 76.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 76) welcoming the Prime Minister of \n     Israel to the United States for his address to a joint \n     session of Congress.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn \namendment be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the Cornyn amendment to the title be agreed to, \nand the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 76\n\n       Whereas, since its founding in 1948, Israel has been a \n     strong and steadfast ally to the United States in the Middle \n     East, a region characterized by instability and violence;\n       Whereas the United States-Israel relationship is built on \n     mutual respect for common values, including a commitment to \n     democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, free-market \n     principles, and ethnic and religious diversity;\n       Whereas the strong cultural, religious, and political ties \n     shared by the United States and Israel help form a bond \n     between our countries that should never be broken;\n       Whereas Israel continues to serve as a shining model of \n     democratic values by regularly holding free and fair \n     elections, promoting the free exchange of ideas, and \n     vigorously exercising a form of democratic government that is \n     fully representative of its citizens;\n       Whereas nations such as Iran and Syria, as well as \n     designated foreign terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah \n     and Hamas, refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist, \n     continually call for its destruction, and have repeatedly \n     attacked Israel either directly or through proxies;\n       Whereas, in particular, the Government of Iran's ongoing \n     pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a tremendous threat both to \n     the United States and Israel;\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\n       Whereas the negotiations between the so-called P5+1 \n     countries and Iran over its illicit nuclear weapons program \n     are entering a key phase, and Congress has heard the \n     perspectives, both publicly and privately, of a number of \n     close allies involved in the negotiations; and\n       Whereas the United States is committed to ensuring that \n     Israel, as a strong and trusted ally, maintains its \n     qualitative military edge: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) warmly welcomes the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin \n     Netanyahu, on his visit to the United States, which provides \n     a timely opportunity to reinforce the United States-Israel \n     relationship;\n       (2) eagerly awaits the address of Prime Minister Netanyahu \n     before a joint meeting of the United States Congress;\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to stand with Israel during \n     times of uncertainty;\n       (4) continues to strongly support Israel's right to defend \n     itself from threats to its very survival; and\n       (5) reaffirms its unequivocal and bipartisan support for \n     the friendship between the people and Governments of the \n     United States and Israel.\n\n  The amendment (No. 263) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To amend the title)\n\n         Amend the title so as to read: ``A resolution welcoming \n     the Prime Minister of Israel to the United States for his \n     address to a joint meeting of Congress.''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing of a \ngreat Kentuckian and an American hero, Col. Dewey Lee Smith. Colonel \nSmith of Fairdale, KY, was a U.S. Air Force veteran. He passed away on \nFebruary 9, 2015, and was 85 years old.\n  Colonel Smith bravely served his country during the Vietnam war and \nwas taken prisoner on June 2, 1967, as an F-105 pilot who was forced to \neject over North Vietnam. He was held as a POW and not released until \nMarch 4, 1973, near the end of the Vietnam war. He spent 2,103 days in \ncaptivity and was released during Operation Homecoming.\n  Colonel Smith was not reluctant to talk about his POW experience, and \noften spoke about it on Veterans Day at area churches. He also \nfrequently spoke to newly commissioned military officers at Fort Knox.\n  Among Colonel Smith's many various medals, awards, and decorations, \nhe received the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the \nPurple Heart. He later received a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, in lieu of a \nsecond Silver Star, for gallantry while a POW.\n  Colonel Smith was born, fittingly, on Veterans Day in 1929 in \nLouisville. He played football at Fairdale High School and was a \nlinebacker and a fullback on the football team at Western Kentucky \nUniversity.\n  He was commissioned as a second lieutenant through the Air Force ROTC \nprogram at Western Kentucky in 1953. He was awarded his pilot wings at \nVance AFB, OK, in June 1954. He served in South Korea, and at the time \nof his capture he was stationed in Thailand.\n  In his retirement, Colonel Smith could frequently be seen playing \ngolf at South Park Country Club, and he served at least once as the \ngrand marshal of the Fairdale Fair parade. He will be greatly missed by \nhis wife Elaine, his sons Dewey Smith Jr., Jonathan Smith, and Joshua \nRussell Smith, and his daughters Vicki Boyd and Sandra Smith. I know my \nU.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing condolences to Colonel \nSmith's family.\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal published an obituary for Colonel \nSmith. I ask unanimous consent that said obituary be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to appear as \nfollows:\n\n                        Colonel Dewey Lee Smith\n\n\n                                Obituary\n\n       Smith, Colonel Dewey Lee, 85, passed while in the nursing \n     home in Luverne, AL, on February 9, 2015. A highly decorated \n     veteran of the Cold War and the Vietnam War and a POW of the \n     Vietnam War, he was awarded numerous medals for valor and \n     citations for achievement including but not limited to the \n     Silver Star (2), Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross \n     for Valor (2), Bronze Star for Valor, Purple Heart (2), and \n     Prisoner of War Medal.\n       Colonel Smith was a courageous, honorable and loyal airman, \n     as well as a patient and loving father, a humble family man, \n     and a faithful servant of God. He married Elaine Hall in \n     Glenwood, Alabama in 1974. As a natural at the game of \n     football, he coached little league, played his senior year at \n     Fairdale High School in Fairdale, Kentucky and received a \n     scholarship to play at Western Kentucky, where he played from \n     1948 to 1953, and served as a student coach in 1953.\n       Colonel Smith was born on November 11, 1929 in Louisville, \n     KY, to John and Edna Smith.\n       He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Elaine Hall Smith; \n     his daughters, Vicki Boyd of Chattanooga and Sandy Smith of \n     Louisville; his sons, Lieutenant Colonel Dewey L. Smith, Jr. \n     ``Chip'' of Missoula, MT, Captain Jonathan Smith (April) and \n     Sergeant Joshua Smith (Samlong) of Louisville; his \n     grandchildren, Mike, Halle, Mahalia, Kaden, Kellan, Samara, \n     and Serena; his sister, Mildred Davis of Shepherdsville; and \n     many nieces and nephews who adored their Uncle Dewey. Colonel \n     Dewey was preceded in death by his parents, John and Edna; \n     his brothers, Homer Smith and Johnny Ray Smith (Louisville), \n     Cedar Smith of Charlestown, IN; his sisters, Alice Oney of \n     Louisville, Elizabeth Trotter of Chattanooga, and Mary \n     Stewart of Evarts, KY; daughter, Donna.\n       A viewing will take place at Fairdale-McDaniel Funeral \n     Home, Friday 3-8 p.m. and Saturday 11 a.m.--1 p.m., with the \n     burial immediately following at Bethany Cemetery at 2 p.m. \n     The service will be officiated by Brother David Brading and \n     Jack Davis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1152-5", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1152-S1154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI, paragraph 2 \nrequires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedure of the \ncommittee and to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not \nlater than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 24, \n2015, a majority of the members of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nadopted subcommittee rules of procedure.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record a \ncopy of the rules of procedure of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      RULES OF PROCEDURE FOR THE SENATE PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON \n INVESTIGATIONS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL \n                           AFFAIRS AS ADOPTED\n\n       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without the approval of either the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member or a majority of the Members of the \n     Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to all Subcommittee \n     Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at least \n     7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The Ranking \n     Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of preliminary \n     inquiries, investigations, and hearings. Preliminary \n     inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee Majority staff \n     upon the approval of the Chairman and notice of such approval \n     to the Ranking Minority Member,\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\n     Minority Staff Director, or the Minority Chief Counsel. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by the Minority staff \n     upon the approval of the Ranking Minority Member and notice \n     of such approval to the Chairman, Staff Director, or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman and the Ranking Minority Member with notice \n     of such approval to all Members of the Subcommittee.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the Minority Members of \n     the Subcommittee unanimously object, unless the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (the \n     ``Committee'') approves of such public hearing by a majority \n     vote.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him or her, \n     with notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice \n     of intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him or her, immediately upon such \n     authorization, and no subpoena shall be issued for at least \n     48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from delivery to \n     the appropriate offices, unless the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member of the Committee waive the 48 hour waiting \n     period or unless the Chairman certifies in writing to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee that, \n     in his or her opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena \n     immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file, in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that a special Subcommittee meeting will be \n     held, specifying the date and hour thereof, and the \n     Subcommittee shall meet on that date and hour. Immediately \n     upon the filing of such notice, the Subcommittee clerk shall \n     notify all Subcommittee Members that such special meeting \n     will be held and inform them of its date and hour. If the \n     Chairman is not present at any regular, additional or special \n     meeting, the Ranking Majority Member present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       One-third of the Members of the Subcommittee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee \n     business other than the administering of oaths and the taking \n     of testimony, provided that at least one member of the \n     minority is present.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     or her counsel, or any spectator conducts himself or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing, \n     the Chairman or presiding Member of the Subcommittee present \n     during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate, his or her representative, or any law enforcement \n     official to eject said person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing and to \n     advise such witness while he or she is testifying of his or \n     her legal rights; provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association, or by counsel representing another witness, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by Subcommittee staff or \n     during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal counsel \n     not from the government, corporation, or association, or by \n     personal counsel not representing another witness. This rule \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his or her counsel is ejected for conducting \n     himself or herself in such a manner so as to prevent, impede, \n     disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the hearings; nor shall this rule be \n     construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1 Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee \n     shall be kept fully apprised of the authorization for the \n     taking of depositions. Such notices shall specify a time and \n     place of examination, and the name of the Subcommittee Member \n     or Members or staff officer or officers who will take the \n     deposition. The deposition shall be in private. The \n     Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear unless the deposition notice was \n     accompanied by a Subcommittee subpoena.\n       9.2 Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3 Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him or her. If the \n     Chairman or designated Member overrules the objection, he or \n     she may refer the matter to the Subcommittee or he or she may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he or she has been ordered and directed to answer by \n     the Chairman or designated Member.\n       9.4 Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record of the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may \n     stipulate with the witness to changes in this procedure; \n     deviations from this procedure which do not substantially \n     impair the reliability of the record shall not relieve the \n     witness from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chairman, Staff Director, or Chief \n     Counsel 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights, shall not be directed at him or her. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his or her own testimony, whether in public or \n     executive session, shall be made available for inspection by \n     the witness or his or her counsel under Subcommittee \n     supervision; a copy of any testimony given in public session \n     or that part of the testimony given by the witness in \n     executive session and subsequently quoted or made part of the \n     record in a public session shall be made available to any \n     witness at his or her expense if he or she so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by \n     Subcommittee Members and authorized Subcommittee staff \n     personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman questions in \n     writing for the cross-examination of other witnesses called \n     by the Subcommittee. With the consent of a majority of the \n     Members of the Subcommittee present and voting, these \n     questions, or paraphrased versions of them, shall be put to \n     the witness by the Chairman, by a Member of the Subcommittee, \n     or by counsel of the Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     her or otherwise adversely affect his or her reputation, may \n     (a) request to appear personally before the Subcommittee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) \n     file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the testimony or \n     other evidence or comment complained of. Such request and \n     such statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman, Staff Director, or Chief Counsel in \n     writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the day \n     on which said person's name was mentioned or he or she\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\n     was otherwise specifically identified during a public hearing \n     held before the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests to file his or her sworn statement \n     pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his or her sworn statement, as well as any other matters \n     related to the subject of the investigation before the \n     Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Members of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the Minority Members of the Subcommittee.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the Minority \n     and such other professional staff and clerical assistants as \n     he or she deems advisable. The total compensation allocated \n     to such Minority staff shall be not less than one-third the \n     total amount allocated for all Subcommittee staff salaries \n     during any given year. The Minority staff shall work under \n     the direction and supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. \n     The Minority Staff Director and the Minority Chief Counsel \n     shall be kept fully informed as to preliminary inquiries, \n     investigations, and hearings, and shall have access to all \n     material in the files of the Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1154-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SUBCOMMITTEE ON FEDERAL SPENDING OVERSIGHT AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

HART\n\n  Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nChristopher A. Hart to serve as Chairman of the National Transportation \nSafety Board, NTSB. Today I joined the Commerce Committee's unanimous \napproval of his nomination and urge my colleagues to move quickly to \nconfirm Mr. Hart as Chair of the NTSB.\n  The NTSB plays a critical role in objectively evaluating accidents in \naviation, railroad, highway, marine, and pipeline transportation \nservices. The NTSB forms extensive recommendations on future \nenhancements in transportation safety and is a great asset in improving \nthe national standard for transportation security. Given how critical \nthe NTSB is to public safety, I cannot stress enough the importance of \nthe full Senate approving this role. As Chairman, Mr. Hart will provide \nneeded leadership to guide the NTSB's work.\n  In New Jersey, the NTSB serves an essential role in improving public \nsafety. Just last year, the NTSB moved quickly to launch a thorough \ninvestigation of a high-profile truck accident in June 2014. In \naddition, in response to the 2012 Paulsboro, NJ train derailment, the \nNTSB issued a comprehensive report with a number of needed safety \nrecommendations. The NTSB's thorough analysis and review of these \naccidents significantly aids local governments, first responders, and \nFederal lawmakers in making important policy decisions to avoid future \ncatastrophes.\n  Given the importance of the NTSB to New Jersey and across the \ncountry, I am proud to support a nominee to lead this organization with \na breadth of experience in senior leadership roles in aviation and \nhighway safety. Mr. Hart's proven leadership of the NTSB makes him \nuniquely qualified to lead this organization. I am proud to offer my \nfull support for Mr. Hart, who I am honored to note upon approval by \nthis body, will serve as the first African-American Chairman of the \nNTSB. Mr. Hart continues the tradition of his great uncle James Herman \nBanning, the first African American to receive a pilot's license issued \nby the U.S. Government in 1926. As a pilot himself, and a true public \nservant, Mr. Hart will help the NTSB continue making a substantial \npositive impact on American public safety. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1155-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TYLER STEPHENS\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I wish to pay special tribute to Tyler \nStephens, a key member of my staff on the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Tyler will leave us shortly to join the private sector. I \nam honored to have the opportunity to publicly thank Tyler and note my \nappreciation for his outstanding service to the United States Senate \nduring the past 8 years, including his last 4 years of dedicated \nservice to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  Tyler is one of the brightest and most talented individuals on \nCapitol Hill. He is also among the best connected, a testament to the \nhigh regard in which he is held. Beginning as a staff assistant for \nSenator Johnny Isakson in January 2007, he learned the Senate from the \nground up and quickly rose through the ranks to his current position as \na senior policy advisor on the Intelligence Committee. Tyler spent most \nof his time in the Senate as a close personal adviser to Senator Saxby \nChambliss, my dear friend and colleague, on both his personal staff and \nthroughout Saxby's tenure as the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Tyler worked hard to establish his expertise as a policy and \nappropriations advisor on foreign relations, defense, homeland \nsecurity, commerce, transportation, energy, environmental, and \ntechnology issues. On the Intelligence Committee, he quickly became a \nrespected subject matter expert on a wide range of national security \nissues, including counterterrorism, covert action, and cybersecurity. \nAs impressive as Tyler's resume and experience are, it is his personal \ndedication and quick wit that often carry the day. In an environment \nfilled with threat briefings, hostile nation states, and post-9/11 \nconflict, it is often easy for some to dwell on the negative. Not \nTyler--the consummate team player and totally mission-oriented--no \nchallenge has been too great and no objective too small. His great \nsense of humor, contagious chuckles, and mischievous grin often \nlightened the mood and helped those around him perform better during \nstressful situations. With his boundless energy and enthusiasm, he made \nit all look easy.\n  My colleagues and I trust Tyler's judgment implicitly. He has played \na key role in helping committee members develop successful legislative \nstrategies for resolving difficult national security issues. He was \nalso particularly helpful to me during my transition as the chairman of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence at the beginning of this Congress. \nTyler's dedicated public service and exceptional day-to-day performance \non the job have earned our respect and admiration, and it inspired a \ngeneration of staff who had the privilege to work alongside him. There \nis no doubt that Tyler has a bright future in the private sector; \nhowever, should the right opportunity present itself, I would strongly \nencourage my Senate colleagues to entice him back into public service. \nWe will miss Tyler deeply, but his legacy will remain a part of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1155-3", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NEIL ROBERTSON\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Officer Neil Robertson of the Norwalk Police Department \nwas on patrol this past Tuesday, February 24, when he drove by a \nrailroad crossing and noticed a vehicle partially stopped on the \ntracks. He also saw that a train was approaching. The driver of the \nvehicle, who may not have been aware of the train, was unable to move \nforward because of gridlock in the intersection ahead. Officer \nRobertson quickly and accurately judged the impending danger. He \nimmediately leapt from his car and directed traffic to move forward, \nallowing the driver of the stuck vehicle to escape the path of the \noncoming train just seconds before it passed through the crossing.\n  Officer Robertson is a 4-year veteran of the Norwalk Police \nDepartment. He deserves the highest praise not just for his choice to \nenter a career in public service but for his speedy and decisive \nactions to avert a potentially disastrous accident. I know that all of \nConnecticut joins me in honoring and thanking him for his exemplary \nperformance in the line of duty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1155-4", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1155-S1156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           INDIANAPOLIS CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DONNELLY. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate the \nhard-working members of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce as they \ncelebrate 125 years of creating jobs, building Indiana's economy, and \nimproving the lives of Hoosiers all across our State.\n  Originally called the Indianapolis Commercial Club, the Indianapolis \nChamber of Commerce was founded in 1890 by COL Eli Lilly to address \nneeds brought on by urban expansion in Central Indiana. The rapid \nexpansion of industry and transportation in the region at the time left \nwhat had been a rural population with insufficient infrastructure to \nmeet the needs of the growing city. The steadfast response of these \nleaders to remedy this situation represents the determination and \ningenuity that the Indy Chamber continues to exhibit today.\n  The 1912 merger of this group with like-minded business \norganizations, including the Manufacturers, Trade and Merchants \nAssociations, became what is today known as the Indy Chamber. While the \neconomic landscape has changed significantly, the Indy Chamber of today \nstays true to its earliest vision of boosting area businesses and \ngrowing industry and investment throughout the Indianapolis area.\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\n  With a bold civic agenda, Colonel Lilly and the early founders of the \nIndy Chamber invested their efforts in building up its membership and \nincreasing the quality of life for residents and businesses alike--\nincluding advocating for better roadways so citizens and visitors could \neasily travel to their jobs and places of leisure; providing relief \nprograms for citizens hit by economic depression; and serving as an \nadviser to elected and appointed officials on issues addressed at all \nlevels of governing.\n  In 2013, the Indy Chamber merged with three area economic development \norganizations--Indy Partnership, Develop Indy, and Business Ownership \nInitiative--putting an even greater emphasis on the organization's \nmission to strengthen the metro economy. Today, the Indy Chamber's \ncommitment to urban and rural metro strength can be seen in the ever-\nexpanding resources they offer to large corporations and \nentrepreneurial startups alike.\n  As a leading advocate for business in the Indy area today, the Indy \nChamber's mission remains true to its roots while at the same time \nadapting to accommodate the ever-growing landscape of today's business \nworld. Their core mission includes keeping a keen eye on education and \nworkforce development, supporting strong, fiscally responsible \ngoverning, and investment in regional infrastructure including roads \nand waterways--all areas that have an immense impact on the region's \nability to attract jobs, talent, and capital.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I sincerely congratulate each \nand every member of the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce team on their \n125th anniversary, and I wish them continued success and growth in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1156-1", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ED GUTHRIE\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Ed \nGuthrie, executive director at Opportunity Village, for his tireless \nefforts to enhance the lives of those around him. Mr. Guthrie has \ndedicated 20 years to working for Opportunity Village, helping \nthousands with disabilities. The organization gives students a positive \nsocial environment and provides support to families and loved ones. Mr. \nGuthrie has contributed greatly to the city of Las Vegas by working to \nmake Opportunity Village the best it can be.\n  He stands as a shining example of someone who has devoted his life to \nthe betterment of others. Throughout his 20 years with Opportunity \nVillage, Guthrie has grown the organization to be recognized \ninternationally, receiving numerous awards. It was named one of the \ncountry's top five rehabilitation service providers in the United \nStates by the Social Security Administration and was distinguished as \nLas Vegas' Best Community Organization.\n  Mr. Guthrie has had great influence in expanding the facilities over \nthe years, pushing to open the Walters Family Campus of Opportunity \nVillage and the North Campus of Opportunity Village. I have personally \ntaken a tour of the Ralph and Betty Engelstad Campus and witnessed the \nimportance of space specifically laid out for the needs of the \norganization. Opportunity Village now has three employment training \ncenter campuses and a thrift store, and it services 1,990 people every \nday. Mr. Guthrie's dedication to these students and families is without \nlimit and stands as a pristine example of selflessness.\n  Opportunity Village offers vocational training, community employment, \nday services, advocacy, arts, and social recreation, creating a \nproductive environment for those who participate. This gives students \nthe opportunity to create friendships and pursue independence to become \npart of the local community. I have seen firsthand, after attending \nOpportunity Village events such as the 10th annual Job Discovery \nProgram graduation ceremony and hosting meetings with Mr. Guthrie, the \npositive atmosphere that the organization offers to the community.\n  I extend my deepest gratitude to Mr. Guthrie for his noble \ncontributions to the Las Vegas community and to the individuals that \nhave benefited from Opportunity Village. His service to Nevada places \nhim among the outstanding men and women of the State.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in recognizing \nMr. Guthrie and his work for Opportunity Village, a program with a \nmission that is both honorable and necessary. I wish the program the \nbest of luck in all of its future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/02/26/senate-section/article/S1156-2", "month": "02", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID MORTON\n\n Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, today I congratulate David Morton \non his retirement after 26 years of service with the Housing Authority \nof the City of Reno. It gives me great pleasure to recognize the years \nof hard work and dedication he has committed to the City of Reno and \nthe Silver State.\n  Mr. Morton earned his bachelor of arts from Auburn University in \nAlabama and then went on to complete his graduate studies in history \nand political science at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. Upon \ncompletion of his studies, Mr. Morton began his career as a community \norganization officer at the Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency \nin Nashville. After 20 years of working for two successful housing \nagencies in Nashville and Dallas, TX, Mr. Morton moved to the city of \nReno to utilize his experience in a new location, benefitting the great \nState of Nevada. His work within the community shines as an outstanding \nexample of true commitment to bettering the State.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Morton also served as president of the Public \nHousing Authorities Directors Association, secretary and treasurer of \nthe board of directors of the Housing Authorities Risk Retention Pool, \ntrustee of the Legislative Committee for the Public Housing Authorities \nDirectors Association, and member of the Housing Committee for the \nNational Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials. His work \nthroughout these many organizations demonstrates his dedication to \nhonorably representing Nevada on a larger scale. He currently serves as \npresident of the Washoe Affordable Housing Corporation, which \nadministers project-based contracts with the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development for the State of Nevada. Although he is retiring, his \nlegacy within these organizations will continue for years to come.\n  The Reno community has greatly benefitted from the hard work of Mr. \nMorton. He exemplifies the highest standards of leadership and \ncommunity service and should be proud of his long and meaningful \ncareer. Today, I ask that all of my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating David Morton on his retirement, and I offer my deepest \nappreciation for all that he has done to make Nevada an even better \nplace.

Mr. President, in many cases small businesses are \nthe best representatives of their communities. If you were to ask folks \nfrom Lake Charles, LA for the best po-boy in town, locals would agree \nthat Darrell's is the spot to be. All about great food and good times, \nDarrell's has provided its patrons with genuine Louisiana fare for over \n30 years, which is why Darrell's is this week's Small Business of the \nWeek.\n  Open Monday through Saturday, Darrell's has become a staple in the \nLake Charles community and the surrounding southwest Louisiana area. A \ngo-to for locals of all ages and walks of life, Darrell's menu includes \nmouth-watering po-boys piled high with a variety of fresh, delicious \nLouisiana ingredients. Most popular on the menu is the Darrell's \nSpecial po-boy, which comes piled high with fresh-sliced ham, turkey, \nand roast beef cooked in and covered with homemade roast beef gravy. \nLocals would recommend adding a schmear of Darrell's own jalapeno mayo, \na side of chips, and an ice-cold glass of sweet tea. Darrell's has also \nupped the ante with baking their crusty French bread in-house and \nserving a specialty barbeque sauce. Darrell's also takes advantage of \nLouisiana's successful seafood industry by serving up a spicy Cajun \nshrimp po-boy option. It is always great to see local establishments \ntap into the rich resources our State has to offer because that is when \nwe begin to see economic growth across the board.\n  Beyond mouth-watering po-boys, Darrell's also serves as a local \nwatering-hole where customers can enjoy a cold beverage while cheering \non their\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\nfavorite sports team. After the dinner rush, Darrell's turns into a \nfull-service bar. It even stays open until 2 a.m. on Tuesdays to \naccommodate their loyal patrons. The Southwest Louisiana community was \nsaddened by the passing of the original beloved owner Darrell Derouen \nin 2013. However, his wife Susie Derouen proudly continues the family \ntradition of quality food, service, and authenticity at the famous Lake \nCharles location.\n  Establishments like Darrell's are vital members of their communities \nand are well-deserving of our continued support and encouragement as \nthey grow and thrive. Congratulations again to Darrell's, Small \nBusiness of the Week, for 30 years of service to the Lake Charles \ncommunity.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 578. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure more timely access to home health services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries under the Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Schumer to introduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and \ndisabled citizens have timely access to home health services under the \nMedicare program.\n  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives \nand clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important \nroles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural \nand medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be \nin scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in \n1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services \nprovided by these health professionals as long as those services are \nwithin their scope of practice under State law.\n  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered \nnurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home \nhealth services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only \nphysicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for \nMedicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the \npatient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, \nthe certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the \npatient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, \nphysician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse \nmidwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, \nthis requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps \nto the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it \ncan lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home \nhealth care they need simply because a physician is not readily \navailable to sign the form.\n  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician \nassistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for \nMedicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these \nproviders may be the only health care professionals available. For \nexample, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a \nMedicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only \nhealth care professional serving the patient's small town, and the \nsupervising physician was located 60 miles away.\n  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her \ncollaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. \nAs a consequence, the patient experienced a 2 day delay in getting \nneeded care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another \nphysician.\n  Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous that she \ncan order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute facility but \ncannot order home health care. One of her patients had to wait eleven \ndays after being discharged before his physical and occupational \ntherapy could continue simply because the home health agency had \ndifficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation of the same \ntherapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to authorize when the \npatient was in the facility.\n  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act will help to ensure \nthat our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care that they need \nwhen they need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse \npractitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives \nto order home health services. Our legislation is supported by a broad \ncoalition of organizations, including the AARP, the National Council on \nAging, the American Geriatrics Society, the National Association for \nHome Care and Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American \nAssociation of Nurse Practitioners, the American Academy of Physician \nAssistants, the American College of Nurse Midwives, and the Visiting \nNurse Associations of America. I urge my colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 25, 2015.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Schumer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Schumer: Thank you for \n     introducing the bipartisan Home Health Care Planning \n     Improvement Act of 2015. We, the undersigned groups, pledge \n     our continued support of your efforts to obtain passage of \n     this important legislation in the 114th Congress. As you \n     know, the bill authorizes nurse practitioners, clinical nurse \n     specialists, certified nurse-midwives and physician \n     assistants as eligible health care professionals who can \n     certify patient eligibility for home health care services \n     under Medicare. This critical\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\n     change would improve access to important home health care \n     services, and potentially prevent additional hospital, sub-\n     acute care facility and nursing home admissions--all of which \n     are costly to the consumer, the taxpayer and Medicare.\n       The undersigned organizations are committed to ensuring \n     that consumers have access to health care providers who are \n     qualified, educated, and certified to provide high quality \n     primary care, chronic care management, and other services \n     that keep them living a high quality life, with dignity, in \n     locations of their choice.\n       Although current law has long recognized advanced practice \n     registered nurses and physician assistants as authorized \n     Medicare providers, and allows these clinicians to certify \n     eligibility for nursing home care for their patients, it \n     precludes these same practitioners from certifying patient \n     eligibility for home health care services. This is an \n     unnecessary barrier to care and adds at least one more step \n     in the process of accessing home health care services by \n     requiring the provider to find a physician to certify \n     eligibility. In addition, time delays to locate a physician \n     to certify eligibility, particularly in rural and underserved \n     areas, can result in an extended hospital stay or nursing \n     home admission because the beneficiary could not be moved \n     back to or remain at home without home health care services.\n       There are decades of data supporting the ability of these \n     providers to deliver high quality care to people of all ages, \n     including Medicare recipients with multiple chronic \n     conditions. Advanced practice registered nurses are often the \n     only care providers available in health professional shortage \n     areas such as urban, rural, and frontier regions. Given the \n     existing and future projected primary care physician \n     shortages, and the coming of increased numbers of Medicare \n     eligible patients, the need will be even greater for all \n     qualified providers to be allowed to certify home health care \n     eligibility.\n       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act would help to \n     ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in need of home health \n     care services whose providers are nurse practitioners, \n     clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse midwives, and \n     physician assistants would be able to directly access home \n     health care by referral from their providers. This bill would \n     provide beneficiaries continued access to care and increase \n     the likelihood that they would experience better health and a \n     higher quality of life. Additionally, outside experts \n     assessed the impact of the bill earlier last year and \n     projected a Medicare savings of $7.1 million in 2015 and up \n     to a ten-year savings of $252.6 million. This analysis also \n     notes the potential to reduce beneficiary admissions to and \n     lengths of stay in institutional settings under the policy \n     change.\n       We appreciate your continued leadership and are committed \n     to working with you to ensure that this bipartisan \n     legislation is passed and placed on the President's desk for \n     signature at the first opportunity. The time is now to ensure \n     that patients have timely access to the quality, cost \n     effective care they need.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a grant program to support the restoration of San Francisco \nBay; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce legislation to further the restoration of the San \nFrancisco Bay.\n  San Francisco Bay is truly a national treasure. Encompassing \napproximately 550 square miles, it is the largest estuary on the west \ncoast, and is vital to the Nation for both ecological and economic \nreasons. It is home to more than 1,000 plant and wildlife species, \nroughly 77 percent of California's remaining perennial estuarine \nwetlands, and an important stopover for birds along the Pacific Flyway. \nMarshes around the bay help prevent flooding, protecting more than 40 \ncities in nine counties, one of the Nation's busiest seaports, and two \ninternational airports. The bay is critical to the region's economy, \nwhich if it were its own nation, would be the world's 19th largest \neconomy.\n  Over the last 150 years, the water quality and health of the San \nFrancisco Bay Estuary have been diminished by pollution, invasive \nspecies, loss of wetland habitat and other factors. The degradation has \nnot only impacted fish and wildlife, but has also reduced the estuary's \nability to support important economic activities such as commercial and \nsport fishing, shipping, agriculture, recreation, and tourism.\n  Federal funding in recent years has started the Bay's recovery \nprocess by investing in projects that improve water quality and restore \ncritical habitat. These investments, $43 million between 2008 and 2015, \nwere critical to leveraging $145 million from other partners. But much \nwork remains.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce the San Francisco Bay \nRestoration Act with Senator Boxer, Ranking Member of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. Companion legislation has also \nbeen introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congresswoman \nJackie Speier.\n  This bill was first introduced in the 112th Congress. The Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works reported favorably on the \nbill in both the 112th and 113th Congresses and recommended its \npassage.\n  This bill recognizes the important restoration work that must be done \nto restore and protect the iconic San Francisco Bay. It authorizes $5 \nmillion a year for restoration work between 2015 and 2019, prioritizing \nfunding for projects that will protect and restore vital estuarine \nhabitat for migratory waterfowl, shorebirds, and wildlife; improve and \nrestore water quality and rearing habitat for fish; and in turn \nreinvigorate recreation, tourism, and agricultural activities in and \naround the bay.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in their support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 to provide that such section does not authorize the Federal \nCommunications Commission to preempt the laws of certain States \nrelating to the regulation of municipal broadband, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise today to announce that along with \nmy colleague in the House of Representatives, Representative Marsha \nBlackburn, have introduced legislation that prohibits the Federal \nCommunications Commission from pre-empting States with municipal \nbroadband laws already on the books, or any other States that \nsubsequently adopt such municipal broadband laws. The bill also \nincludes a Sense of Congress stating that the FCC should not impose \nmunicipal broadband regulations on any state.\n  Earlier today, the FCC took an unprecedented and legally questionable \nstep to allow Wilson, North Carolina, to ignore North Carolina law when \nexpanding its municipal broadband network.\n  The North Carolina law the FCC preempted is intended to protect \ntaxpayers and consumers from the financial risks we have seen many \nmunicipalities, including Wilson, face when venturing into broadband \nventures that are best left to the private market to provide.\n  After witnessing how some local governments wasted taxpayer dollars \nand accumulated millions in debt through poor decision making, the \nlegislatures of states like North Carolina and Tennessee passed \ncommonsense, bipartisan laws that protect hardworking taxpayers and \nmaintain the fairness of free-market competition. Representative \nBlackburn and I recognize the need for Congress to step in and take \naction to keep unelected bureaucrats from acting contrary to the \nexpressed will of the American people through their State legislatures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Nelson):\n  S. 598. A bill to improve the understanding of, and promote access to \ntreatment for, chronic kidney disease, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan \nChronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act of \n2015, which I am introducing with Senators Crapo and Nelson today. This \nlegislation seeks to make a real difference in the lives of Americans \nsuffering from kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.\n  Kidney disease is the 9th leading cause of death in the United \nStates, and unfortunately, more than one in ten Americans today suffer \nfrom some form of kidney disease. More than 615,000 Americans are \nliving with kidney failure or end-stage renal disease, which is an \nirreversible condition that can be fatal without a kidney transplant or \nlife-sustaining dialysis. 430,000 patients in our country rely on life-\nsustaining dialysis care to survive.\n  This legislation seeks to promote research, expand patient choice, \nand improve care coordination for these hundreds of thousands of \npatients. Specifically, it would identify the gaps in research and \nimprove the coordination of Federal research efforts. The bill would \nrequire the Government Accountability Office to submit a comprehensive \nreport analyzing current federally funded research projects regarding \nchronic kidney disease and identifying knowledge gaps that are not \nbeing addressed through those research efforts. It would also direct \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate and report on \nthe biological, social, and behavioral factors related to kidney \ndisease and efforts to slow the progression of disease in minority \npopulations disproportionately affected by this disease.\n  This legislation would improve access to pre-dialysis kidney \neducation programs to better manage patients' kidney disease and even \nprevent kidney failure in some cases. Nephrologists and other health \nprofessionals would be incentivized to work in underserved rural and \nurban areas, and current payment policies would be modified to \nencourage home dialysis, which is not incentivized under the current \nMedicare payment structure. Patients with acute kidney injury would \nalso be allowed to receive treatments through dialysis providers, \ntherefore reducing costs associated with care provided in the more \nexpensive hospital outpatient setting. Perhaps most importantly, our \nlegislation would establish a voluntary coordinated care program that \nwould incentivize doctors and dialysis facilities to work together to \nimprove the coordination of care and reduce costly hospitalization.\n  Lastly, the bill would expand the options for patients by allowing \nindividuals diagnosed with kidney failure to enroll in the Medicare \nAdvantage program and reauthorizing on a permanent basis the Medicare \nAdvantage Special Needs Plan for patients with kidney failure.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Crapo and Senator Nelson in \nsupporting the Chronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and \nTreatment Act of 2015, which will improve the care of patients who \nsuffer from kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the importance of the \nChronic Kidney Disease Improvement in Research and Treatment Act being \nintroduced today. This legislation will not only pave the way for \nenhanced research opportunities and allow physicians greater \nflexibility in how and where they treat patients, but, importantly, \nwill provide increased access to care for those with chronic and end-\nstage kidney disease, particularly in rural and underserved areas. As \nour Nation continues to face dangerously high levels of debt, it is \nimperative we prioritize initiatives such as this while simultaneously \nensuring we do not worsen our already fragile fiscal picture. Prior to \npassage, as with any piece of legislation, a responsible offset that is \nbudget neutral must be included.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Mr. Toomey, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 599. A bill to extend and expand the Medicaid emergency \npsychiatric demonstration project; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today Senators Toomey and Collins and I \nare introducing the Improving Access to Emergency Psychiatric Care Act \nof 2015, which will build on the current 3-year Medicaid Emergency \nPsychiatric Demonstration Project to provide timely and cost-effective \ntreatment to people who are experiencing an emergency psychiatric \ncrisis.\n  We know that emergency psychiatric care delivered in general \nhospitals and freestanding psychiatric hospitals is a life-saving \nservice for individuals with severe mental illnesses. In addition, a \nGovernment Accountability Office report, GAO-09-347, on hospital \nemergency departments concluded the difficulties in transferring, \nadmitting, or\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\ndischarging psychiatric patients from the emergency department \ncontribute to overcrowding in our Nation's emergency rooms.\n  Community-based psychiatric hospitals, like Sheppard Pratt Health \nSystem in my home State of Maryland, could help relieve these back-ups \nin emergency departments; however, due to a longstanding Medicaid \nstatutory provision called the Institution for Mental Disease, IMD, \nexclusion, patients receiving care in these freestanding psychiatric \nhospitals are not covered if the patients are between the ages of 21 \nand 64, and the hospitals cannot get Medicaid Federal matching payments \nfor these services.\n  In response to this problem, bipartisan legislation was first \nintroduced in the Senate in 2003 by Senators Olympia Snowe and Kent \nConrad, who were joined by Senators Susan Collins and Ron Wyden, to \naddress this problem by allowing Federal Medicaid matching payments to \nfreestanding psychiatric hospitals for emergency psychiatric cases. In \n2010, based on this legislation, Congress authorized a three-year \ndemonstration that was intended to expand the number of emergency \ninpatient psychiatric beds available in communities. Currently, 11 \nStates, including my State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia \nare participating in this demonstration.\n  The purpose of the demonstration is to determine whether allowing \nFederal Medicaid matching payments to freestanding psychiatric \nhospitals for emergency psychiatric cases improves access to and \nquality of medically necessary care, improves discharge planning for \ndemonstration beneficiaries, and has a positive impact on Medicaid cost \nand utilization. The preliminary data shows that, of the total number \nof Medicaid beneficiaries admitted to these freestanding psychiatric \nhospitals, 84 percent had just one admission during the entire first \nyear of the demonstration. The average length of stay was a short 8.2 \ndays and, in 88 percent of the admissions, the patients were discharged \nhome.\n  The current demonstration project would end no later than December \n31, 2015; however, the final evaluation of this project by CMS is not \nexpected to be completed until 1 year later, in the fall of 2016.\n  The purpose of the bipartisan legislation we are introducing today is \nto allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to continue the \ncurrent demonstration project until the Secretary submits a report to \nCongress with her recommendations, based on the final evaluation, \nregarding whether the current demonstration should be extended for an \nadditional 3 years and whether additional States should be allowed to \nparticipate in the demonstration, or September 30, 2016, whichever \noccurs first.\n  Importantly, in order to extend the current demonstration project \nuntil the report is submitted, the Secretary must determine that \noverall Medicaid spending in the participating state is not expected to \nincrease during the extension of the demonstration project for a \nmaximum of nine months, and the Chief Actuary of CMS must also certify \nthat the extension is not projected to result in an increase in net \nMedicaid program spending. If, in her report, the Secretary recommends \nextending the demonstration project for an additional three years and/\nor expanding it to include other States, the same requirements \nregarding Medicaid spending would need to be met, ensuring budget \nneutrality. At the completion of those additional 3 years, the \ndemonstration project would come to a close unless Congress passes \nauthorizing legislation to continue and/or expand the demonstration \nproject.\n  We have a real crisis in this country for millions of Americans who \ncannot get timely access to life-saving emergency inpatient psychiatric \ntreatment. The Medicaid program is a vital source of support for people \nwith mental disorders, funding more than 50 percent of state and local \nspending on mental health services. This outdated IMD policy is \npenalizing the disabled and poor. It is also contributing to \ninefficiencies in our health care system and likely adding to the cost \nof care. The legislation introducing today would help ensure that the \nneediest have access to hospital care when they need it and strengthen \nour Nation's health care system. It is an incremental, targeted \napproach with built-in cost safeguards, so I hope my colleagues will \njoin with me to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 88\n\n       Whereas in 1776, people imagined the United States as a new \n     country dedicated to the proposition stated in the \n     Declaration of Independence that ``all men are created equal, \n     that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and \n     the pursuit of Happiness . . .'';\n       Whereas the first Africans were brought involuntarily to \n     the shores of America as early as the 17th century;\n       Whereas African Americans suffered enslavement and \n     subsequently faced the injustices of lynch mobs, segregation, \n     and denial of the basic and fundamental rights of \n     citizenship;\n       Whereas in 2015, the vestiges of these injustices and \n     inequalities remain evident in the society of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas in the face of injustices, people of the United \n     States of good will and of all races have distinguished \n     themselves with a commitment to the noble ideals on which the \n     United States was founded and have courageously fought for \n     the rights and freedom of African Americans;\n       Whereas African Americans, such as Lieutenant Colonel Allen \n     Allensworth, Constance Baker Motley, James Baldwin, James \n     Beckwourth, Clara Brown, Ralph Bunche, Shirley Chisholm, \n     Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ralph Ellison, Medgar \n     Evers, Alex Haley, Dorothy Height, Lena Horne, Charles \n     Hamilton Houston, Mahalia Jackson, Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     the Tuskegee Airmen, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, Bill \n     Pickett, Jackie Robinson, Aaron Shirley, Sojourner Truth, \n     Harriet Tubman, Homer Plessy, the Greensboro Four, Maya \n     Angelou, Arthur Ashe Jr., Booker T. Washington, Stephanie \n     Tubbs Jones, Hiram Revels, and Blanche Bruce, along with many \n     others, worked against racism to achieve success and to make \n     significant contributions to the economic, educational, \n     political, artistic, athletic, literary, scientific, and \n     technological advancements of the United States, including \n     the westward expansion;\n       Whereas the contributions of African Americans from all \n     walks of life throughout the history of the United States \n     reflect the greatness of the United States;\n       Whereas many African Americans lived, toiled, and died in \n     obscurity, never achieving the recognition they deserved, and \n     yet paved the way for future generations to succeed;\n       Whereas African Americans continue to serve the United \n     States at the highest levels of government and military;\n       Whereas the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick \n     Douglass inspired the creation of Negro History Week, the \n     precursor to Black History Month;\n       Whereas Negro History Week represented the culmination of \n     the efforts of Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the ``Father of Black \n     History'', to enhance knowledge of Black history through the \n     Journal of Negro History, published by the Association for \n     the Study of African American Life and History, which was \n     founded by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland;\n       Whereas Black History Month, celebrated during the month of \n     February, dates back to 1926 when Dr. Carter G. Woodson set \n     aside a special period in February to recognize the heritage \n     and achievement of Black people of the United States;\n       Whereas Dr. Carter G. Woodson stated: ``We have a wonderful \n     history behind us. . . .

Res. 90\n\n       Whereas heart disease affects men, women, and children of \n     every age and race in the United States;\n       Whereas heart disease continues to be the leading cause of \n     death in the United States, taking the lives of approximately \n     600,000 individuals in the United States each year and \n     accounting for 1 in 4 deaths in the United States;\n       Whereas congenital heart defects are the most common birth \n     defect in the United States, as well as the leading killer of \n     infants with birth defects;\n       Whereas more than 1 in 3 adult men and women have some form \n     of cardiovascular disease;\n       Whereas every year an estimated 735,000 individuals in the \n     United States have a heart attack;\n       Whereas heart disease and stroke account for \n     $320,000,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost \n     productivity annually;\n       Whereas heart disease and stroke will account for \n     $918,000,000,000 in health care expenditures and lost \n     productivity annually by 2030;\n       Whereas individuals in the United States have made great \n     progress in reducing the death rate for coronary heart \n     disease, but this progress has been more modest with respect \n     to such death rate of women and minorities;\n       Whereas many people do not recognize that heart disease is \n     the number 1 killer of women in the United States, taking the \n     lives of more than 290,000 such women in 2010, and nearly 2/3 \n     of women who unexpectedly die of heart disease have no \n     previous symptoms of disease;\n       Whereas nearly half of all African-American adults have \n     some form of cardiovascular disease, including 48 percent of \n     African-American women and 46 percent of African-American \n     men;\n       Whereas many minority women, including African-American, \n     Hispanic, Asian-American, and Native-American women and women \n     from indigenous populations, have a greater prevalence of \n     risk factors or are at a higher risk of death from heart \n     disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases, but such \n     women are less likely to know of this risk;\n       Whereas between 1965 and 2015, treatment of cardiovascular \n     disease for women has largely been based on medical research \n     on men;\n       Whereas due to the differences in heart disease between \n     males and females, more research and data on the effects of \n     heart disease treatments for women is vital;\n       Whereas extensive clinical and statistical studies have \n     identified major and contributing factors that increase the \n     risk of heart disease;\n       Whereas the major risk factors, identified by such studies, \n     include high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, smoking \n     tobacco products, exposure to tobacco smoke, physical \n     inactivity, obesity, and diabetes mellitus;\n       Whereas an individual can greatly reduce the risk of \n     cardiovascular disease through lifestyle modification coupled \n     with medical treatment when necessary;\n       Whereas greater awareness and early detection of risk \n     factors of heart disease can improve and save the lives of \n     thousands of individuals in the United States each year;\n       Whereas under the Joint Resolution entitled ``Joint \n     Resolution to provide for the designation of the month of \n     February in each year as `American Heart Month' '', approved \n     December 30, 1963 (36 U.S.C. 101), Congress requested that \n     the President issue an annual proclamation designating \n     February as ``American Heart Month'';\n       Whereas the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of \n     the National Institutes of Health, the American Heart \n     Association, and many other organizations celebrate \n     ``National Wear Red Day'' during February by ``going red'' to \n     increase awareness about heart disease as the leading killer \n     of women;
